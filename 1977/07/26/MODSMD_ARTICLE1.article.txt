Unusual objects
pill recalls a set of oil
igs as the most unusual
1 he ever handled. Do-

nated by a Californian alumnus,
the set consisted of seven nudes
on black velvet, done by the
famous Trhitian artist Leeteg.
Four of the works currently re
side in San Francisco at
Trader Vic's restaurant.
Claspill said his one-man
"scrapology unit," now in its
seventeenth year, brings in more
than $600,000 during good
years. When Stanford Press
equipment was auctioned off
last year, it alone netted
$250,000, he said.
Claspill, however, does not
work on a commission basis, but
rather receives a salary. For de
partmental equipment, he said,
85 to 90 per cent of the resale
revenue goes back to the indi
vidual departments. The addi
tional 10 to 15 per cent covers

A truck awaits "recycling" at the Investment Recovery lot after being burned at a local dump. Jim
Claspill, University manager of surplus and salvage, says he will try to salvage the truck's bed and
front scoop.
Claspill's costs, such as news
paper advertisements.
Recycling
Asked whether some things
do not return enough profit to
justify the time spent on them,
Claspill replied, "1 don't think of
it in terms of profit, I think of it as
recyclng."
Not all gifts are recyclable,
though. One couple from Pacific
Grove donated their $500,000 es
tate on the condition that the
funds be put in a savings account
and the interest be used as a full
scholarship for a physically

handicapped student.
Items currently available at
the investment recovery site, lo
cated on Bonair Siding between
the fire station and Maples Pavil
ion, include an automobile used
(for 179,000 miles) by President
Richard Lyman and a
truck which recently burned at a
local dump.
If something hasn't been sold
within six months to a year,
Claspill said, it goes in the
dumpster. However, the kind of
job Claspill does is shown by the
fact that the dumpster annually
claims less than one per cent of
the goods.

85 to 90 per cent of the resale
revenue goes back to the indi

A truck awaits "recycling" at the Investment Recovery lot after being burned at a local dump. Jim
Claspill, University manager of surplus and salvage, says he will try to salvage the truck's bed and
front scoop.

paper advertisements.
Recycling
Asked whether some things
do not return enough profit to
justify the time spent on them,
Claspill replied, "1 don't think of
it in terms of profit, I think of it as
recyclng."
Not all gifts are recyclable,
though. One couple from Pacific
Grove donated their $500,000 es
tate on the condition that the
funds be put in a savings account
and the interest be used as a full
scholarship for a physically

handicapped student.
Items currently available at
the investment recovery site, lo
cated on Bonair Siding between
the fire station and Maples Pavil
ion, include an automobile used
(for 179,000 miles) by President
Richard Lyman and a
truck which recently burned at a
local dump.
If something hasn't been sold
within six months to a year,
Claspill said, it goes in the
dumpster. However, the kind of
job Claspill does is shown by the
fact that the dumpster annually
claims less than one per cent of
the goods.
