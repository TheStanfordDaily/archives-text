# Shine It On'/Paul Miller
## All Minnelli 
### Paul Miller 
Liza Minnelli is an astonish
ing talent and she shows it off to
its highest extreme in Shine it
On.
Shine it On is really a Minnelli
concert with a small story on the
side. She sings 15 songs during
the course of the evening and in
between each she is involved
with the life of Michelle Craig, a
singer-dancer trying to make it
in Las Vegas and Hollywood.
Liza Minnelli is terrific. Se
eing and hearing her sing the
dazzling and delightful songs by
John kander and Fred Ebb is un
forgettable.

Minnelli is backed by a chorus
of four men and three women
who perform some stunning
singing and dancing acts.
Choreographer Ron Lewis has
done a brilliant job in creating
these numbers.
The book by George Furth is
hard to believe in.
Martin Scorsese's direction is
uninspired due to the virtually
uninteresting plot. This makes
for dull and clumsy looking
supporting roles played by Barry
Nelson, as the producer and
Minnelli's husband whom she
leaves, and Mark Goddard as a
young record producer with

whom she falls in love.
The full orchestra is on stage
taking up most of the room. At
times the performers seem
cramped but the concept works.
The stage is set by beautiful
background collages designed
by Tony Walton. There is also a
movable platform which adds an
interesting effect.
Thea Van Runkle's costumes
are colorful and sufficient. Tha
ron Musser's creation of various
spotlights is excellent. Musser.
who has won Tony Awards as
"Best Lighting Designer" for A
Chorus Line and Follies was rep
resented on Broadway last year
with six different shows at once.
Some great numbers in the
show include "Shine it On,"
"Little Do They Know,"
"Bobo's," "Turning," "Arthur in
the Afternoon" and"The Only
Game in Town," which
Minnelli soloed at the end of the
performance.
The show definitely would
have worked better as just a Liza
Minnelli Show.
Liza Minnelli demands to be
seen. Once you can forget the
dreary story, sit back and enjoy
fine musical entertainment.
