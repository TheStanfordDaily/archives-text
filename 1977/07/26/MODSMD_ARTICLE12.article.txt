Sadat orders cease-fire
Matruh, Egypt — Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat ordered an immediate halt
to further hostilities with Libya Sunday
night in an attempt to end six days of
fighting.
Libya, however, has said nothing about
a cease-fire and there was no confirma
tion that the fighting had ended.
The order came soon after Sadat began
mediation talks with Algerian President
Hourai Boumedienne, who arrived in
Cairo from Tripoli. He had met with Li
byan leader Moammar Khadafv there.
Palestine Liberation Organization
Chairman Yasser Arafat had been work
ing on behalf of the 20-member Arab
League in order to arrange a cease-fire.
Progress had been reported Sunday,
when, in a surprise move, Boumedienne
flew to Tripoli to join in the effort.
The fact that Sadat acted so quickly
after meeting with Boumedienne indi
cated that the Algerian leader brought
some sign of reconciliation from Khadafy,
perhaps as a result of the talks with
.Arafat.
Yet, as Egypt's truce was announced
over Cairo radio, Libya's Arab Revolution
News Agency reported, "The enemy is
now trying to occupy the village of
Jaghbub by dropping paratroopers from
helicopters."

Doctors find laetrile harmful
Washington — Researchers at
Georgetown University have reported
that two cancer patients developed ad
verse reactions from using laetrile. On
that basis, they believe the substance may
be dangerous.
Dr. Philip Schein, chief of the
Georgetown's medical oncology division,
said Sunday that he and three colleagues
seem to have found the first reported in
cidents of harmful effects to cancer pa
tients who used laetrile.
The physicians have submitted a report
on their findings to the lournal of the
American Medical Association.
"The main purpose of the report is to
alert the medical profession and the pub
lic that this material may not be safe,"
Schein said in a telephone interview with
the Associated Press Sunday.
"It has been assumed by the lay public
and the medical profession that this mate
rial is at worst a harmless placebo. It may
not even fit that criteria."

Indictments sought
Washington — The Justice Department
told the House Ethics Committee that five
former congressmen may face indict
ments soon in the investigation of South
Korean influence-buying on Capitol Hill,
the Los Angeles Times reported yester
day.
It was learned Sunday that the indict
ments are expected to be sought in Au
gust and September, culminating a two
year investigation.
Justice Department spokesman Robert
Havel had no comment, but a source close
to House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-
Mass.) confirmed that the Ethics Commit
tee had been told of the indictments.
No names were passed along to the
committee, which is headed by Rep. John
Flynt (D-Ga.).

Sadat orders cease-fire
Matruh, Egypt — Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat ordered an immediate halt
to further hostilities with Libya Sunday
night in an attempt to end six days of
fighting.
Libya, however, has said nothing about
a cease-fire and there was no confirma
tion that the fighting had ended.
The order came soon after Sadat began
mediation talks with Algerian President
Hourai Boumedienne, who arrived in
Cairo from Tripoli. He had met with Li
byan leader Moammar Khadafv there.
Palestine Liberation Organization
Chairman Yasser Arafat had been work
ing on behalf of the 20-member Arab
League in order to arrange a cease-fire.
Progress had been reported Sunday,
when, in a surprise move, Boumedienne
flew to Tripoli to join in the effort.
The fact that Sadat acted so quickly
after meeting with Boumedienne indi
cated that the Algerian leader brought
some sign of reconciliation from Khadafy,
perhaps as a result of the talks with
.Arafat.
Yet, as Egypt's truce was announced
over Cairo radio, Libya's Arab Revolution
News Agency reported, "The enemy is
now trying to occupy the village of
Jaghbub by dropping paratroopers from
helicopters."

Doctors find laetrile harmful
Washington — Researchers at
Georgetown University have reported
that two cancer patients developed ad
verse reactions from using laetrile. On
that basis, they believe the substance may
be dangerous.
Dr. Philip Schein, chief of the
Georgetown's medical oncology division,
said Sunday that he and three colleagues
seem to have found the first reported in
cidents of harmful effects to cancer pa
tients who used laetrile.
The physicians have submitted a report
on their findings to the lournal of the
American Medical Association.
"The main purpose of the report is to
alert the medical profession and the pub
lic that this material may not be safe,"
Schein said in a telephone interview with
the Associated Press Sunday.
"It has been assumed by the lay public
and the medical profession that this mate
rial is at worst a harmless placebo. It may
not even fit that criteria."

Indictments sought
Washington — The Justice Department
told the House Ethics Committee that five
former congressmen may face indict
ments soon in the investigation of South
Korean influence-buying on Capitol Hill,
the Los Angeles Times reported yester
day.
It was learned Sunday that the indict
ments are expected to be sought in Au
gust and September, culminating a two
year investigation.
Justice Department spokesman Robert
Havel had no comment, but a source close
to House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-
Mass.) confirmed that the Ethics Commit
tee had been told of the indictments.
No names were passed along to the
committee, which is headed by Rep. John
