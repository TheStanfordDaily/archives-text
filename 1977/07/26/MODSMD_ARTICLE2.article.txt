director of the TM program for
the southern peninsula area.
Black was instrumental in br
inging the courses here. They are
being run by several executive
governors of the TM program
who declined to be interviewed
and asked that the residence not
be named.
The courses began last week
and will run until the end of Sep
tember. Up to 50 persons from
throughout Northern California

will participate in the individual
courses, Black said.
Later courses
After completing the initial
studies, students will take later
courses to learn to perform vari
ous unusual mental and physi
cal acts.
The ultimate purpose of the
program of study here is to bring
about the "state of enlighten
ment" in the individual, Black
