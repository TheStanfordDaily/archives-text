# USE protests status changes
## 
### 
One United Stanford
Employees (USE) worker has
been suspended, and others are
wearing red protest armbands
following a University decision
to change the classifications of
various computer operators.
The change in classifications
took effect yesterday for 24 oper
tors at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator (SI.AC) and at theStan
ford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP), according to
Robert Britton, a computer
operator at SCIP.
The lead operators at each site
were demoted to senior
operators, and new lead
operators are being selected on a
rotating basis from among seni or
operators, Britton said.
Ken Martell, selected to be the
first new lead operator at SLAC,
said he was suspended yester
day when he chose not to indi
cate whether he would accept
the post.
Martell said his action was
based on the fact that no union
steward was present at the time,
but told the Daily he will refuse
the position if he is offered it
today with a union steward pre
sent.
About a dozen other lead
operator candidates at SLAC

would also refuse the position,
Martell predicted.
At SCIP, workers "de
monstrated bad morale" yester
day, Berk said, and selected their
own lead operator, although
they indicated they would
acknowledge the University
picked lead operator if asked to
do so.
USE has also filed a charge
with the National Labor Rela
tions Board, asserting that the
position changes violate the Oc
tober 1976 USE/University con
tract, according to Britton.
However, Assoc. Staff Counsel
Gerald Halligan said "there are
no grounds for filing a labor
grievance. Management's right
to do the things it did are clearly
set forth in the labor contract."
He said the changes were
made because "there were a
number of people being paid as
leaders who were not perform
ing as leaders."
Under the new system, some
persons will be made lead
operators who had not previ
ously held the title. "1 don't feel
they can tell us we have to be
promoted into an area of greater
responsibility than we want to
accept," Britton said.
