# Postal rate hikes

In recent years, Americans
have become conditioned to ex
pect postal rate hikes with al
most annual frequency. Indi
viduals in their twenties re
member the alarmingly rapid ef
fects of inflation on the mail. For
some time, it has been more
economical to telephone than to
send a letter to someone across
town. However, it now appears
that the citizen postal user fi
nally has a friend in the White
House.
Following a suggestion by
President Carter, Postmaster
General Benjamin Bailar recent
ly proposed a new plan with
provisions for a split rate, dif
ferentiating between businesses
and individuals. First class rates
for business mail would rise to
16 cents per ounce, postcards
would increase to 10 cents, and
parcel post fees would climb 26
per cent. Second class rates,
which include newspapers and
magazines, would rise an aver
age of 29 per cent. Most impor
tantly and surprisingly, first
class personal letters and bill
payments would remain at 13
cents.
In order to qualify for the
"citizen rate." a letter must bear
a lhandwritten address, either de
livery or return. It would thus
apply to personal correspon
dence within the country and to
households paying their bills,
but would prevent businesses
from trying to evade the 16 cent
rate.
The merits of the new system
are obvious. For the first time,
the brunt ot mail service rate in
creases will be borne by its
greatest users, rather than by
those who can least afford them.
Under the Carter plan, the U.S.

mail stands a chance of main
taining its historical role as a
major national unifying entity,
rather than a financially
prohibitive luxury.
Before taking effect, the Postal
Service board of governors must
adopt the proposals and submit
them to the Postal Rate Commis
sion, which has 10 months to
act on the new rates. Although
the plan carries no guarantee
that the "citizen rate" will not
rise in the future, it sets a prece
dent in rendering personal
first-class mail immune to postal
budget deficits. The importance
of approval of the new measure
warrants letters to the commis
sion expressing individual feel
ings and support from con
cerned citizens. Thirteen cents
now may save n-times-three
cents in the future.
