ERA
Shannon Blando — whomain
tains that the Equal Rights
Amendment would not interfere
with the choice of women to re
main in the traditional female
role — apparently has not fol
lowed California legislative aijd
judicial action in family law
since the emphasis on "equal
ity" began here.
We were earmarked years ago
as the pilot state for implement
ing the principles of the ERA,
even though it has not been pas
sed. Anyone keeping tabs on
California family law knows that
in this great new climate of -

"equality," the legal structure
making the role of homemaker a
realistic choice has been de
molished. What remains for the
family is at best anarchy.
The whole issue of "equal
rights" revolves around the
question, Who will take care of
the children? ERA promoters in
tend that virtually everyone be
come a "human resource" in the
one-world economic order to
ward which we are headed —
with various pressures applied
to those who fail to conform —
and that the state fill the breach
in the home.
Anyone who denies these in
tentions — which pose a grave
threat to values important to
mankind — either fails to under
stand the feminist movement or
is trying to deceive his audience.

It is unfortunate that feminists
are so often moved to attack their
fellow women over their choice
of profession. The homemaker's
most virulent opposition comes
from women themselves. The
acidity of their attacks often pro
vides yet another expression of
"the stereotype of the hysterical
woman."
Some human beings still hope
to have children, and fortunately
not everyone is totally repelled
by the thought of a baby's diaper.
And there are even men and
women who both care for the
needs of their young children
and live creative lives. This year
it is my husband's turn to take
care of our young daughter, but
I m sure that his "identity" is
dependent neither on me nor on
that "smelly diaper bucket."
I would very much like to hear
Shannon Blando's opinions on
the ERA without the invective,
which only reflects the prejudice

and emotional irrationality of
which she speaks.

'Average females'
I am greatly dismayed by the
In the World news brief (Daily,
July 22), "judge warns females."
The implication that a female
who hitchhikes gaves male driv
ers "permission" to force sexual
intercourse is a dangerous one to
our society. Would this society
equally acquit the driver who
robs a (shall we say) male hitch
hiker of his money because the
hitchhiker "has less concern for
the consequences than the aver
age male"? If so, then riding
with a stranger becomes a realm
outside of the law where "any
thing goes." Might not the same
thing be applied to riding with
strangers in elevators and to all
other areas of life where contact
with strangers is possible? But
one suspects that steal ing money
is not so easily placed outside
the law.
The most disturbing aspect of
the judge's attitude is his arbit
rary definition of how the "aver
age female" behaves. I say to
him: Does the "average female"
sleep with her windows open,
does she ride a bicycle along
semi-secluded paths, does she
jog in the hills (Cf. the July 22
letter to the Daily re: attempted
rape), does she ever go out alone
after dark, does she walk down
Palm Drive at 2:30 p.m.? And if
not, are those females who do
these things "asking for it"? The
"average female" would con
sequently barricade herself in
side her home, never go out
alone, and limit herself to physi
cal exercise in crowded public
facilities.
If the law will not uphold the
rights of women to behave out
side of such confines by promis-

ing the legal prosecutionuj
assailants, then whv not a
