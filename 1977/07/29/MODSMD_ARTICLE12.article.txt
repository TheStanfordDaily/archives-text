is a Book of the Month Club sort
of device to keep people who are
away from the campus in touch
with Stanford faculty. That's a
fairly broad range of publica
tions.
Daily: And this week is the
Alumni College. .. .
Stone: That's an example of
the continuing education prog
ram. We also offer one-day
brush-up courses on particular
topics of interest to people,
workshops and seminars that we
hold here and at other cities
where there are alumni clubs.
We run a management college
up at the camp for a week in the
fall. This is one of the interesting
efforts every summer to bring fa
culty from different kinds of dis
ciplines to bear on a topic.
We enjoy a regular return fol
lowing — people who come here
for something of a vacation but
also enjoy going back to school
and meeting Stanford faculty
again.
Daily: What does the associa
tion offer those who have not yet
graduated?
Stone: The association's
theory is that future members,
while they are here, ought to
have the chance to see the kind
of programs that are available
and, also, to help define the
kinds of programs that will be
available once they've left this
place.
In a very pragmatic sense,
we're not going to have a captive
audience after they leave to the
degree that we do while they're
here.
One thing is to try to be helpful
to current students in vocational
assistance — we've got experts
in almost any kind of work any
one would want to find out about
— and another is to look for the

kind of programs that will draw
people of various classes to
gether because of a common in
terest.
Daily: Do you think your re
sources are sufficient for your
tasks?
Stone: In some ways this place
seems fairly opulent. In other
ways I think we run it pretty
leanly. The amount of mileage
we get out of a small group of
employes is striking.
We run a fine line between
breakeven and uneven every
year, and I think we get a good
deal of mileage out of what we
ask people for in membership
dues.
If you divide the dues we
charge by the number of ac
tivities we offer, you find that
five cents a day buys a fairly
enormous range of activities. We
don't want the prices to become
a problem for the alumni; we
prefer to keep them at least as
low as they are now.
Association President Steve
Home, in his closing remarks to
the Class of 1977, pointed out the
vast difference in dollars for tui
tion per class hour and the cost
of being a member of the associa
tion. I think that's an important
distance to try to keep.
Daily: How many alums are in
the association?
Stone: I think in the range of
40.000 out of a possible 110.000
people who have actually
graduated from some program,
either graduate or under
graduate. On the one hand that
seems like a low number, but on
the other this is one of the high
est participation rates of any or
ganization of its kind in this
country.
Obviously, we wish it were
100 per cent instead of 40 be
cause we would then be able to
do quite a few more things than

are now possible, but I don't
think we're in bad shape in that
regard.
Daily: Do you contemplate
any major recruitment drives in
the near future?
Stone: Oh. I think so. We're
going to try to make sure that
everybody has the opportunity
to get to know what we're up to
and to know we're not a fund
raising organization per se.
Joining an alumni association
may not be the first thing on the
mind of someone who has just
gone through four years at the
University studying, but I like to
think that there are some con
tinuing opportunities for every
body— Stanford, the association
and the graduates. We have quite
a bit incommonand a lot that we
can accomplish.
Daily: In fact, one of the poi nts
made at the time of your ap
pointment was that your youth

was part of a symbolic effort to
encourage the recent graduate to
become involved, . . .
Stone: Somebody in math
suggested that 35,000 people
have graduated from Stanford
since I did — that made me feel
anything but youthful.
1 think the stereotypes that the
Class of XX may hold about the
present class and the stereotypes
the present class may hold about
Class XX are probably equally
suspect.
The current student may say,
"What is a Stanford alum" and
maybe their image is a tailgate
party with the funny hats on
football days, and that isn't the
kind of thing that leads you to
say, "Boy, I'd love to be a Stan
ford alum!"
I think if that's true it shows a
misreading of the facts in a sub
stantial sense.

100 per cent instead of 40 be
cause we would then be able to
do quite a few more things than

are now possible, but I don't
think we're in bad shape in that
regard.
Daily: Do you contemplate
any major recruitment drives in
the near future?
Stone: Oh. I think so. We're
going to try to make sure that
everybody has the opportunity
to get to know what we're up to
and to know we're not a fund
raising organization per se.
Joining an alumni association
may not be the first thing on the
mind of someone who has just
gone through four years at the
University studying, but I like to
think that there are some con
tinuing opportunities for every
body— Stanford, the association
and the graduates. We have quite
a bit incommonand a lot that we
can accomplish.
Daily: In fact, one of the poi nts
made at the time of your ap
pointment was that your youth

was part of a symbolic effort to
encourage the recent graduate to
become involved, . . .
Stone: Somebody in math
suggested that 35,000 people
have graduated from Stanford
since I did — that made me feel
anything but youthful.
1 think the stereotypes that the
Class of XX may hold about the
present class and the stereotypes
the present class may hold about
Class XX are probably equally
suspect.
The current student may say,
"What is a Stanford alum" and
maybe their image is a tailgate
party with the funny hats on
football days, and that isn't the
kind of thing that leads you to
say, "Boy, I'd love to be a Stan
ford alum!"
I think if that's true it shows a
misreading of the facts in a sub
stantial sense.

away from the campus in touch
with Stanford faculty. That's a
fairly broad range of publica
tions.
Daily: And this week is the
Alumni College. .. .
Stone: That's an example of
the continuing education prog
ram. We also offer one-day
brush-up courses on particular
topics of interest to people,
workshops and seminars that we
hold here and at other cities
where there are alumni clubs.
We run a management college
up at the camp for a week in the
fall. This is one of the interesting
efforts every summer to bring fa
culty from different kinds of dis
ciplines to bear on a topic.
We enjoy a regular return fol
lowing — people who come here
for something of a vacation but
also enjoy going back to school
and meeting Stanford faculty
again.
Daily: What does the associa
tion offer those who have not yet
graduated?
Stone: The association's
theory is that future members,
while they are here, ought to
have the chance to see the kind
of programs that are available
and, also, to help define the
kinds of programs that will be
available once they've left this
place.
In a very pragmatic sense,
we're not going to have a captive
audience after they leave to the
degree that we do while they're
here.
One thing is to try to be helpful
to current students in vocational
assistance — we've got experts
in almost any kind of work any
one would want to find out about
— and another is to look for the

kind of programs that will draw
people of various classes to
gether because of a common in
terest.
Daily: Do you think your re
sources are sufficient for your
tasks?
Stone: In some ways this place
seems fairly opulent. In other
ways I think we run it pretty
leanly. The amount of mileage
we get out of a small group of
employes is striking.
We run a fine line between
breakeven and uneven every
year, and I think we get a good
deal of mileage out of what we
ask people for in membership
dues.
If you divide the dues we
charge by the number of ac
tivities we offer, you find that
five cents a day buys a fairly
enormous range of activities. We
don't want the prices to become
a problem for the alumni; we
prefer to keep them at least as
low as they are now.
Association President Steve
Home, in his closing remarks to
the Class of 1977, pointed out the
vast difference in dollars for tui
tion per class hour and the cost
of being a member of the associa
tion. I think that's an important
distance to try to keep.
Daily: How many alums are in
the association?
Stone: I think in the range of
40.000 out of a possible 110.000
people who have actually
graduated from some program,
either graduate or under
graduate. On the one hand that
seems like a low number, but on
the other this is one of the high
est participation rates of any or
ganization of its kind in this
country.
Obviously, we wish it were
100 per cent instead of 40 be
cause we would then be able to
do quite a few more things than

are now possible, but I don't
think we're in bad shape in that

assistance — we've got experts
in almost any kind of work any
one would want to find out about
— and another is to look for the

kind of programs that will draw
people of various classes to
gether because of a common in
terest.
Daily: Do you think your re
sources are sufficient for your
tasks?
Stone: In some ways this place
seems fairly opulent. In other
ways I think we run it pretty
leanly. The amount of mileage
we get out of a small group of
employes is striking.
We run a fine line between
breakeven and uneven every
year, and I think we get a good
deal of mileage out of what we
ask people for in membership
dues.
If you divide the dues we
charge by the number of ac
tivities we offer, you find that
five cents a day buys a fairly
enormous range of activities. We
don't want the prices to become
a problem for the alumni; we
prefer to keep them at least as
low as they are now.
Association President Steve
Home, in his closing remarks to
the Class of 1977, pointed out the
vast difference in dollars for tui
tion per class hour and the cost
of being a member of the associa
tion. I think that's an important
distance to try to keep.
Daily: How many alums are in
the association?
Stone: I think in the range of
40.000 out of a possible 110.000
people who have actually
graduated from some program,
either graduate or under
graduate. On the one hand that
seems like a low number, but on
the other this is one of the high
est participation rates of any or
ganization of its kind in this
country.
Obviously, we wish it were
100 per cent instead of 40 be
cause we would then be able to
do quite a few more things than

are now possible, but I don't
think we're in bad shape in that
regard.
Daily: Do you contemplate
any major recruitment drives in
the near future?
Stone: Oh. I think so. We're
going to try to make sure that
everybody has the opportunity
to get to know what we're up to
and to know we're not a fund
raising organization per se.
Joining an alumni association
may not be the first thing on the
mind of someone who has just
gone through four years at the
University studying, but I like to
think that there are some con
tinuing opportunities for every
body— Stanford, the association
and the graduates. We have quite
a bit incommonand a lot that we
can accomplish.
Daily: In fact, one of the poi nts
made at the time of your ap
pointment was that your youth

was part of a symbolic effort to
encourage the recent graduate to
become involved, . . .
Stone: Somebody in math
suggested that 35,000 people
have graduated from Stanford
since I did — that made me feel
anything but youthful.
1 think the stereotypes that the
Class of XX may hold about the
present class and the stereotypes
the present class may hold about
Class XX are probably equally
suspect.
The current student may say,
"What is a Stanford alum" and
maybe their image is a tailgate
party with the funny hats on
football days, and that isn't the
kind of thing that leads you to
say, "Boy, I'd love to be a Stan
ford alum!"
I think if that's true it shows a
misreading of the facts in a sub
stantial sense.

Stone: That's an example of
the continuing education prog

brush-up courses on particular
topics of interest to people,
workshops and seminars that we
hold here and at other cities
where there are alumni clubs.
We run a management college
up at the camp for a week in the
fall. This is one of the interesting
efforts every summer to bring fa

ciplines to bear on a topic.
We enjoy a regular return fol

for something of a vacation but
also enjoy going back to school
and meeting Stanford faculty
again.
Daily: What does the associa
tion offer those who have not yet
graduated?
Stone: The association's
theory is that future members,
while they are here, ought to
have the chance to see the kind
of programs that are available
and, also, to help define the
kinds of programs that will be
available once they've left this
place.
In a very pragmatic sense,
we're not going to have a captive
audience after they leave to the
degree that we do while they're
here.
