# Summer at the ballet Julianne Koehne
## 
### 
I apologize to Michael Smuin for I saw
his Scherzo on the short-circuit television
in the foyer of the Geary Theatre. It is a
compelling work; one couple watched
the screen for 15 minutes, then reluc
tantly announced that they were in the
wrong theater.
By last Sunday, the San Francisco Bal
let's summer season was already 1/3
finished; until July 31 they will be per
forming works by indigenous choreog
raphers with the exception of Jerome
Robbins' Moves.
Only once in a great while does a
dancer synthesize an intangible image of

filled caress. His noble air belies his
stocky build and during his suspended
jumps and broad leaps in a circle he is so
modest that 1 could not help but fall in
love.
Victoria Gyorfi and Elizabeth Tienken
also danced with McNaughton in Diver
tissement and though I have not seen
Gyorfi in many classical roles, her small
head and long limbs suit her well for
them. She subdued her perky, elfin charm
to be a bit more delicate and when, before
her last variation, she coyly bent her long
toes back and then repointed her foot in
front of her, she seemed almost fey. But

above John Butler's Three (1977). Their
inherent symbolism is fascinating, but
they are so distracting I cannot imagine a
better way to detract from the turbulent
encounters going on below between
Lynda Meyer, Vane Vest and Dennis Mar
shall.
Although Butler says that he attempts
to show the essence of a gesture, rather
than "real movement," most of his dance
images are so literal that I grew impatient.
The actions used to signify the coupling
of male and female human beings are
standard and boring by now and Butler
uses them all. The man supports himself

tension in Bejart'sL'Oiseau deFeu(l
was for the birds, and though mypui
just as pretentious. I realize nowthi
not the preaching I find ludicrous
rather the assumption that Stravin
revolutionary qualitieis lay in thei
not musical material.
Bejart attempts to "free the emc
that fill the succession of scenes" i
original, but his freedom is super!
Just as Stravinsky composed motifi
melodies exactly corresponding ti
dramatic developments in the on
Tibretto, so has Bejart choreograpl
ballet which corresponds dramatica
