# Thrilling 'Divertissement,' mechanical 'Three,' roses for Wahl

classical grace with his own motives.
David McNaughton transported me to the
heights last Saturday in Divertissement
d'Auber (Christensen, 1959). In this vir
tuoso performance he links technique
and emotion. "My training (from the
Christensen brothers) taught me the no
bility of the male dancer and his gentility
and respect for the ballerina," he said. "I
love the romantic fantasies in which bal
let is set."
Only his innocence succeeds in making
the trite gesture of stroking the first bal
lerina's shin and instep, after she extends
her bent leg to the side, a loving, wonder

her glazed passivity, when being
partnered, is distracting and seems so
cruelly casual when McNaughton is so
ardent.
After the pas de deux for Gyorfi and
McNaughton, Elizabeth Tienken admira
bly executes a series of arabesques and
turns on the diagonal, which are in
terspersed with frothy, saucy kicks to the
audience whenever she runs upstage.
Tienken's smile is joyous, but her shoul
ders and arms are coat-hanger tense.
Several large, shiny gray intestinal ob
jects (or perhaps they resemble rotting
sausages with the wrappers still on), float

on two hands and one leg, extending his
other leg in back while the woman
writhes below. The woman straddles the
man's waist face to face or she is held with
her back to him while extending her leg
front, side and back. Though his
choreography is literal and at times trite,
the intensity of Butler's movements is
hotly effective but it could be appreciated
more if the intestinal sausages were put
into cold storage.
Last January, 1 wrote that the social pre
every fluctuation in harmony. He uses
contemporary ideas which, unlike classi
cal myth, outdate within a short time.

Gary Wahl's portrayal of the andrd
ous firebird is so translucent and I
that he received roses and a dozencui
calls. To simulate flight and landing

ages; Wahl must turn with his leg be
back of him and then cleanly flit
pointed foot to the side, whilekeepia
arms in back of his shoulders witl

who can dance with such endurance
power, but Wahl combines strength
such ease and elasticity in his upper
that in a companv with no stars.heat
deserves an asterisk.
