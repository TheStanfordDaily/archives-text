# Strong, solid 'Red Ryder'
## 
### Bob Henry 
The Jewish Community
Center has a strong, taut produc
tion that offers an excellent
chance to see how good a local
amatuer production of When
You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?
can be.
Stanford-related people have a
big part in the production, from
Obie-winning playwright Mark
Medoff (MA Stanford) to direc
tor Judith Burgess, a Stanford
drama instructor, to four Stan
ford student actors.
The story revolves around
Teddy, an unbalanced Vietnam
veteran who comes into a sleepy

cafe in New Mexico early one
Sunday. Things proceed nicely
until Teddy tries to get money
from the customers. Soon, he
fires his pistol at one of the cus
tomers and we have a besieged
cafe controlled by this crazed
vet.
Teddy's control, however, is
not utter physical domination.
He attracts and fascinates the
customers. He steps in like a de
monic surgeon and operates on
their weaknesses and vul
nerabilities. The two characters
most likely to stop him —
Stephen, the 19 year old town
toughie and Richard, a man
travelling to New Orleans with
his wife — envy his power and
force and at times watch him in
awe as he manipulates them
selves and the other customers.
Medoff explores many ideas,
including the loss of honorable,
untainted heroes. Teddy longs
for the days of the virtuous cow
boy Red Ryder and baseball star
Duke Snyder. Medoff examines
what happens when the good
guys aren't entirely good and
when the people looking up to

the good guys realize that and
suddenly question the general
way in which matters operate.
Director Burgess has managed
to elicit strong performances
from the cast. Teddy is the skele
ton of this show — he holds it all
together — and Christoper Hills,
a UCLA drama student, gives us
a multidimensional Teddy. It
would be too easy and in the end
quite shallow, to make Teddy an
infallible god who totally con
trols the action; Mills makes
Teddy human and vulnerable.
His complex Teddy has mo
ments of weakness, moments of
strength, moments of pain, mo
ments of fun. Teddy's masterful
insights into the other characters
makes him able to skillfully cut
to the marrow and probe their
thoughts and feelings.
Mills gives a very strong per
formance. His desperado is al
ways concerned with the logis
tics of his robbery and escape, a
realistic element which makes
the whole situation more believ
able.
A skeleton with no flesh
would not stand up, however;

Mills needs strong perform
around him. The rest of tb
supplies enough muscle,
and vital organs to create
million person. Al Mel'j
portrays Stephen and skil
masters the walk and tal J

can be.
Stanford-related people have a
big part in the production, from
Obie-winning playwright Mark
Medoff (MA Stanford) to direc
tor Judith Burgess, a Stanford
drama instructor, to four Stan
ford student actors.
The story revolves around
Teddy, an unbalanced Vietnam
veteran who comes into a sleepy

cafe in New Mexico early one
Sunday. Things proceed nicely
until Teddy tries to get money
from the customers. Soon, he
fires his pistol at one of the cus
tomers and we have a besieged
cafe controlled by this crazed
vet.
Teddy's control, however, is
not utter physical domination.
He attracts and fascinates the
customers. He steps in like a de
monic surgeon and operates on
their weaknesses and vul
nerabilities. The two characters
most likely to stop him —
Stephen, the 19 year old town
toughie and Richard, a man
travelling to New Orleans with
his wife — envy his power and
force and at times watch him in
awe as he manipulates them
selves and the other customers.
Medoff explores many ideas,
including the loss of honorable,
untainted heroes. Teddy longs
for the days of the virtuous cow
boy Red Ryder and baseball star
Duke Snyder. Medoff examines
what happens when the good
guys aren't entirely good and
when the people looking up to

the good guys realize that and
suddenly question the general
way in which matters operate.
Director Burgess has managed
to elicit strong performances
from the cast. Teddy is the skele
ton of this show — he holds it all
together — and Christoper Hills,
a UCLA drama student, gives us
a multidimensional Teddy. It
would be too easy and in the end
quite shallow, to make Teddy an
infallible god who totally con
trols the action; Mills makes
Teddy human and vulnerable.
His complex Teddy has mo
ments of weakness, moments of
strength, moments of pain, mo
ments of fun. Teddy's masterful
insights into the other characters
makes him able to skillfully cut
to the marrow and probe their
thoughts and feelings.
Mills gives a very strong per
formance. His desperado is al
ways concerned with the logis
tics of his robbery and escape, a
realistic element which makes
the whole situation more believ
able.

would not stand up, however;

Mills needs strong perform
