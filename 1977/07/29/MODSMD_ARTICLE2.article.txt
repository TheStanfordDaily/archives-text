five years the plant has been open 5000 to 10,000
tons of ash have accumulated.
Gullrandsen, the geologist, called this stockpile
"a nice little mine." ,
Harris said the city of Palo Alto has issued a
reouest for proposals to about a dozen mining and
extraction companies. The best bid will secure the
stockpile as well as the dailyPP od .
The proposals will be of two kinds, Harris said,
the straight sale, and/or the on-site plant. Harris
said he favors the construction of an extraction
plant at the ash dump site.
The on-site plant would be more practical. Har
ris said, because of the high cost of hauling the ash
to an existing plant.
He said the only company expected to present an
on-site proposal is World Resources of McLean,
Va . — a new firm which specializes in the extrac
tion of metals from municipal sludges and sludge
ashes.
Paul Barric, a World Resources official, said the
company is in the process of designing an on-site
"portable plant." Its design could be used any
where. he said, but the firm hopes to build it right
behind the sewage plant.
Barric says World Resources is interested in ex
tracting all metals in the ash. not just gold and
silver. The sewage also contains zinc, chromium.
tin and copper in substantial quantities.
He said one reason the company is interested in
all metals, not just the profitable ones, is that some
metals are toxic, and are considered possible en
vironmental dangers. ♦ u oae u
These metals can leach into the soil from the ash.
After the metals are extracted, the remaining ash
will be "clean" and will be safe for the environ
ment, Barric said. 112
Barric said World Resources is sure extraction ot
the metals is feasible. The firm has successfully

removed gold from four tons ot Palo Alto ash.
Barric says. "We have little bars of it sitting in our
He said this is the first successful extraction of
gold from sewage ash, as far as he knows. We
ought to strike a special medal for Palo Alto," with
the gold from this first extraction, Barric said.
Barric said the company has investigated the
sludge and sludge ash of more than 260 cities in
the I Inited States and in foreign countries.
The U.S. Bureau of Mines has also done research
on the sewage of several large municipal areas,
including Detroit. Like Palo Alto. Detroit is highly
industrial. No results from this research are availa
ble yet.
The second possibility for recovering metals
from the Palo Alto ash is a straight sale. 1 larris said.
A company would buy the ash by the ton and
haul it away.
Price offers have ranged from $5 to $20 per ton.
Harris says this possibility would be the easiest,
characterizing it as "no muss, no fuss."
Several traditional mining companies are in
terested in this option. John Shearn, an official of
the CC&S Mining Co. of Reno, Nev., said the Palo
Alto sewage "intrigued us."
He said the tests his firm have conducted indi
cate they could extract at least the silver, copper
and gold, but "not at any fantastic profit."

Gullrandsen, the geologist, called this stockpile
"a nice little mine." ,
Harris said the city of Palo Alto has issued a
reouest for proposals to about a dozen mining and
extraction companies. The best bid will secure the
stockpile as well as the dailyPP od .
The proposals will be of two kinds, Harris said,
the straight sale, and/or the on-site plant. Harris
said he favors the construction of an extraction
plant at the ash dump site.
The on-site plant would be more practical. Har
ris said, because of the high cost of hauling the ash
to an existing plant.
He said the only company expected to present an
on-site proposal is World Resources of McLean,
Va . — a new firm which specializes in the extrac
tion of metals from municipal sludges and sludge
ashes.
Paul Barric, a World Resources official, said the
company is in the process of designing an on-site
"portable plant." Its design could be used any
where. he said, but the firm hopes to build it right
behind the sewage plant.
Barric says World Resources is interested in ex
tracting all metals in the ash. not just gold and
silver. The sewage also contains zinc, chromium.
tin and copper in substantial quantities.
He said one reason the company is interested in
all metals, not just the profitable ones, is that some
metals are toxic, and are considered possible en
vironmental dangers. ♦ u oae u
These metals can leach into the soil from the ash.
After the metals are extracted, the remaining ash
will be "clean" and will be safe for the environ

Barric said World Resources is sure extraction ot
the metals is feasible. The firm has successfully

removed gold from four tons ot Palo Alto ash.
Barric says. "We have little bars of it sitting in our
He said this is the first successful extraction of
gold from sewage ash, as far as he knows. We
ought to strike a special medal for Palo Alto," with
the gold from this first extraction, Barric said.
Barric said the company has investigated the
sludge and sludge ash of more than 260 cities in
the I Inited States and in foreign countries.
The U.S. Bureau of Mines has also done research
on the sewage of several large municipal areas,
including Detroit. Like Palo Alto. Detroit is highly
industrial. No results from this research are availa
ble yet.
The second possibility for recovering metals
from the Palo Alto ash is a straight sale. 1 larris said.
A company would buy the ash by the ton and
haul it away.
Price offers have ranged from $5 to $20 per ton.
Harris says this possibility would be the easiest,
characterizing it as "no muss, no fuss."
Several traditional mining companies are in
terested in this option. John Shearn, an official of
the CC&S Mining Co. of Reno, Nev., said the Palo
Alto sewage "intrigued us."
He said the tests his firm have conducted indi
cate they could extract at least the silver, copper
and gold, but "not at any fantastic profit."

two ofthe largest companies in the Palo Alto area,
said their firms are saving as much of the metals as
is economically feasible.
Harris said the amount of waste from each firm is
small, but that the amounts add up.
He said another reason the concentration ot met
als is so high is that the Palo Alto plant, which
serves Palo Alto, Los Altos and Stanford, burns its

five years the plant has been open 5000 to 10,000
tons of ash have accumulated.
Gullrandsen, the geologist, called this stockpile
"a nice little mine." ,
Harris said the city of Palo Alto has issued a
reouest for proposals to about a dozen mining and
extraction companies. The best bid will secure the
stockpile as well as the dailyPP od .
The proposals will be of two kinds, Harris said,
the straight sale, and/or the on-site plant. Harris
said he favors the construction of an extraction
plant at the ash dump site.
The on-site plant would be more practical. Har
ris said, because of the high cost of hauling the ash
to an existing plant.
He said the only company expected to present an
on-site proposal is World Resources of McLean,
Va . — a new firm which specializes in the extrac
tion of metals from municipal sludges and sludge
ashes.
Paul Barric, a World Resources official, said the
company is in the process of designing an on-site
"portable plant." Its design could be used any
where. he said, but the firm hopes to build it right
behind the sewage plant.
Barric says World Resources is interested in ex
tracting all metals in the ash. not just gold and
silver. The sewage also contains zinc, chromium.
tin and copper in substantial quantities.
He said one reason the company is interested in
all metals, not just the profitable ones, is that some
metals are toxic, and are considered possible en
vironmental dangers. ♦ u oae u
These metals can leach into the soil from the ash.
After the metals are extracted, the remaining ash
will be "clean" and will be safe for the environ
ment, Barric said. 112
Barric said World Resources is sure extraction ot
the metals is feasible. The firm has successfully

removed gold from four tons ot Palo Alto ash.
Barric says. "We have little bars of it sitting in our
He said this is the first successful extraction of
gold from sewage ash, as far as he knows. We
ought to strike a special medal for Palo Alto," with
the gold from this first extraction, Barric said.
Barric said the company has investigated the
sludge and sludge ash of more than 260 cities in
the I Inited States and in foreign countries.
The U.S. Bureau of Mines has also done research
on the sewage of several large municipal areas,
including Detroit. Like Palo Alto. Detroit is highly
industrial. No results from this research are availa
ble yet.
The second possibility for recovering metals
from the Palo Alto ash is a straight sale. 1 larris said.
A company would buy the ash by the ton and
haul it away.
Price offers have ranged from $5 to $20 per ton.
Harris says this possibility would be the easiest,
characterizing it as "no muss, no fuss."
Several traditional mining companies are in
terested in this option. John Shearn, an official of
the CC&S Mining Co. of Reno, Nev., said the Palo
Alto sewage "intrigued us."
He said the tests his firm have conducted indi
cate they could extract at least the silver, copper
and gold, but "not at any fantastic profit."
