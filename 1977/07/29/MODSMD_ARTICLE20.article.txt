However, A Great American
Backstage Musical cannot be
simply categorized as camp.
Sylvia's "Crumbs in My Bed" is
openly humorous, while her "I'll
Wait for Joe" is perfectly
straight. The costumes, by Stan
ford's Julie Strauss Weiss, reflect
the personalities of their wearers
and they are chronologically ac
curate.
Allen Klein used simple roll
on props for accomplishing the
frequent scene changes. The
plain stage adapted easily to the
variety of locations. The small
props allowed room enough for
active dance numbers. Robert
Talmage, director and choreog
rapher, blocks the dances well
for the most part. Occasionally,
however, the audience at the
right and left sides of the stage
can not see all the action.
The music, directed and ar
ranged by Glen Kelly, and light
ing by William Strom, comple
ment, but do not overpower, the
production. All in all, Bill Solly
and Donald Ward's The Great
American Backstage Musical
satisfies and pleases. The good
comic-timing of the actors in
cludes Don Stitt's as Banjo,
Johnny's sidekick and Joe Bar

rett's as Harry, the boy who in
herits $5 million upon his mar
riage.
The musical asks nothing of
its audience except momentary
attention and, in return, supplies
good singing, nice dancing and
laughter. While it will not
change your philosophy of life,
A Great American Backstage
Musical is worthwhile enter
tainment.
(The Great American Backstage
Musical is at the Montgomery
Playhouse, 622 Broadway, San
Francisco.)
