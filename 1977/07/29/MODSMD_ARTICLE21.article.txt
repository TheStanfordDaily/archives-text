# HMS Pinafore/Martha Manqueros
## Not so smooth sailing 
### 
My basic complaint with
H.M.S. Pinafore is not the
operetta itself, for the story and
music are enjoyable, but with the
production's lack of energy. Or
maybe the audience took the sa
tire too seriously. Several funny
lines elicited no reaction from
the opening-night crowd.
The Stanford Savoyard's
"Nautical Opera in Two Brine
filled Acts" (as the program
says), consists of nicely cos
tumed people singing, running,
and dancing about the stage.
Gilbert and Sullivan satirize
the British social class system
where true love conquers all —
almost. As Sir Joseph Porter, first
Lord of the Admiralty (John
Breakwell) claims "A British
sailor is any man's equal — ex
cept nine."
Ralph Backstraw (Steve Gill)
"loves a lass above his station,"
the captain's daughter. He proc
laims his love for the haughty
Josephine (Laurel Smith) in
silver-tongued oration complete

with a parody of Shylock's
"Doth not a jew. . speech. She
shuns the lowly sailor's ad
vances till he threatens suicide.
Their plans for elopement are
thwarted by Captain Corcoran
(Gerald Moshell) who wants
Josephine to marry Sir Joseph.
The "plump and pleasing"
Buttercup saves the young lov
ers by announcing that in her
"young and charming days" she
practiced "baby-farming" and ac
cidently mixed the well-born
Ralph with Captain Corcoran.

Since Corcoran is now a com
mon sailor he can marry Butter
cup (even though the relation
ship seems rather Oedipal).
The breakneck pace of the
H.M.S. Pinao/re makes the songs
technically difficult. The cast
and orchestra, especially Laurel
Smith, manage well but, on oc
casion, the lyrics are unintelligi
ble. The orchestra, directed by
Henry Rosack, seemed unused to
an audience. Rather than wait for
the subsidence of laughter or
applause, the music proceeds

and, again, the audience loses
lyrics. Despite a few technical
errors — the curtains rising too
early, the house lights left un
dimmed for several seconds, the
operetta moved smoothly.
If you decide to see the per
formance go early since all seats
are general admission. A top row
set in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
offers excellent viewing and lis
tening but the lack of ventilation
will make you wish the produc
tin moved even faster than its 2 V*
hours.
