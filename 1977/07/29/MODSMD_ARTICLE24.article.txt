Errant kite sparks fire
Santa Barbara — Fire authorities said
yesterday that the hugh fire which rav
aged this coastal city was started by an
errant kite that sparked a power line.
Dist. Atty. Stanley Roden reported that
a young man in his 20s, was flying a hite
in Sycamore Canyon, when his kite string
became entangled with 16,000 volt power
lines.
The string, Roden said, caused an elec
trical arc which "either set the brush im
mediately below on fire or sent a shower
of flammable material to the ground,
which set the brush on fire."
The kite flier was not identified by offi
cials "for fear of reprisals," but he did
issue a statement through his attorney.
"I am deeply shocked and saddened by
the great loss and suffering which has
resulted from the fire," he said.
"I shall always regret the part, however
innocent, I have had in this tragic mat
ter."
The fire, which began Tuesday, was
contained Wednesday after having
burned 740 acres and damaged 385
homes.
An estimated 3000 persons were sent
fleeing from the flames, but there were no
reports of death and relatively few in
juries.

The damage toll is expected to rise as
high as $20 million, and by midday Wed
nesday, the city was named an official
disaster area.

Carter aids investigation
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
has become involved in efforts to bring
Korean businessman Tongsun Park back
to the United States to face questioning
about his alleged influence buying opera

tions in Congress.
As the Justice Department intensified
its investigations last year, Park left
Washington suddenly. He is now living
in London.
In an unusual, special briefing on the
investigation for lawmakers Wednesday,
Asst. Atty. Gen. Benjamin Civiletti said
the Justice Department badly needed Park
for questioning and that vigorous steps
were being taken at the highest levels in
government to bring him back.
Civiletti, whose investigations have
been seeking ways to extradite Park or to
otherwise obtain his cooperation, de
clined to give more details.
But White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell confirmed, that the President, at
the specific request of Atty. Gen. Griffin
Bell, is involved in the attempts to bring
Park back.
The President's involvement in the Ko
rean investigation underscores the high
priority the Justice Department is giving
it.
