# Heart surgery billing resumes
## 
### Randy Keith 
Billing for heart surgery per
formed by faculty at the Medical
School here has resumed after
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
school and University vice
president for medical affairs, ag
reed to review the method by
which professional fees charged
by the doctors are used.
A group of cardiovascular
surgeons headed by Dr. Norman
Shumway had stopped billing
patients June 23 after a dis
pute over whether the Medical
Center violates state law by
employing salaried doctors and
then charging patients for the
physician's services.
The University temporarily
lost between $26,000 and
$600,000 in revenue while the
doctors were not billing, accord
ing to Spyros Andreopoulos,
Medical Center news service di
rector. The bills will be sent out
"retroactively," he added.
Shumway was not available
for comment.
Violation
The surgeons contend that the
Medical Center violates section
2008 of the California Business
and Professions Code which
prohibits employment of
salaried doctors if patients are
charged for doctors' services.
Carl Hitchner, associate coun
sel for medical affairs, said that
because the Medical Center does
not set fees, it is not in violation
of the law.
He said the physician sets the
fee charged the patient and that
as a condition of employment
here the doctors on the Medical
School faculty must turn over all
of their earnings from the fees to
the University.
The group of four heart sur
geons performs between 100 and
150 operations a month charging
$2000 to $4000 per operation,
Andreopoulos said.
Second largest
According to documents ob
tained by the Daily, this makes
the cardiovascular surgery de
partment the second largest,
next to anesthesia, in profes
sional fee revenues. During the
1975-76 academic year the net
revenue for the department was
$2,005,000 with expenses, in
cluding the physician's salaries,
$664,000.
The excess revenue generated
by any department is distributed
in the Medical School using a
medical service plan formula

adopted in 1974.
The formula provides for a de
partmental executive fund ad
ministered by the department
chairman and a school fund for
each department administered
by the dean of the Medical
School. The money in the funds
is to be used at the adminis
trator's discretion "within the
limits of applicable University
policies," according to the
documents.
The cardiovascular surgery
department received the highest
total amount as a result of the
plan getting $351,000 in de
partmental executive funds and
$970,000 in school funds, ac
cording to the documents.
It is the medical service plan
which Rich and the 11 depart
ment chairmen will review, ac
cording to Andreopoulos. The
plan was scheduled for review
this year, he said, adding that the
study should take three months.

geons performs between 100 and
150 operations a month charging
$2000 to $4000 per operation,
Andreopoulos said.
Second largest
According to documents ob
tained by the Daily, this makes
the cardiovascular surgery de
partment the second largest,
next to anesthesia, in profes
sional fee revenues. During the
1975-76 academic year the net
revenue for the department was
$2,005,000 with expenses, in
cluding the physician's salaries,
$664,000.
The excess revenue generated
by any department is distributed
in the Medical School using a
medical service plan formula

adopted in 1974.
The formula provides for a de
partmental executive fund ad
ministered by the department
chairman and a school fund for
each department administered
by the dean of the Medical
School. The money in the funds
is to be used at the adminis
trator's discretion "within the
limits of applicable University
policies," according to the
documents.
The cardiovascular surgery
department received the highest
total amount as a result of the
plan getting $351,000 in de
partmental executive funds and
$970,000 in school funds, ac
cording to the documents.
It is the medical service plan
which Rich and the 11 depart
ment chairmen will review, ac
cording to Andreopoulos. The
plan was scheduled for review
this year, he said, adding that the
study should take three months.
Billing for heart surgery per
formed by faculty at the Medical
School here has resumed after
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
school and University vice
president for medical affairs, ag
reed to review the method by
which professional fees charged
by the doctors are used.
A group of cardiovascular
surgeons headed by Dr. Norman
Shumway had stopped billing
patients June 23 after a dis
pute over whether the Medical
Center violates state law by
employing salaried doctors and
then charging patients for the
physician's services.
The University temporarily
lost between $26,000 and
$600,000 in revenue while the
doctors were not billing, accord
ing to Spyros Andreopoulos,
Medical Center news service di
rector. The bills will be sent out
"retroactively," he added.
Shumway was not available
for comment.
Violation
The surgeons contend that the
Medical Center violates section
2008 of the California Business
and Professions Code which
prohibits employment of
salaried doctors if patients are
charged for doctors' services.
Carl Hitchner, associate coun
sel for medical affairs, said that
because the Medical Center does
not set fees, it is not in violation
of the law.
He said the physician sets the
fee charged the patient and that
as a condition of employment
here the doctors on the Medical
School faculty must turn over all
of their earnings from the fees to
the University.
The group of four heart sur
geons performs between 100 and
150 operations a month charging
$2000 to $4000 per operation,
Andreopoulos said.
