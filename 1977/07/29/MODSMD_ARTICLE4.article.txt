Four South Africa protesters
who testified they heard the
order to disperse at Old Union
May 9 were found guilty yester
day on two counts, but the jury
was hung 10-2 on the same two
counts for four defendants who
did not take the stand.
All eight students were found
innocent on a third count of
trespassing with intent to dis
rupt business.
Two jurors felt the four defen
dants who did not testify must be
found innocent because it was
unclear whether they heard the
order to disperse before they

put on six months probation.
