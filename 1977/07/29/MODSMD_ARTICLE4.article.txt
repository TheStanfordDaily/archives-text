# Hung jury in second protest trial
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
Four South Africa protesters
who testified they heard the
order to disperse at Old Union
May 9 were found guilty yester
day on two counts, but the jury
was hung 10-2 on the same two
counts for four defendants who
did not take the stand.
All eight students were found
innocent on a third count of
trespassing with intent to dis
rupt business.
Two jurors felt the four defen
dants who did not testify must be
found innocent because it was
unclear whether they heard the
order to disperse before they
were arrested, a juror said.
The jury, which deliberated
for 5V2 hours, found Ellen Bryne,
Roger Cole, Bruce Parker and Joe
Wender guilty of a trespassing
charge and a failure to disperse
charge. They were fined $65 and
put on six months probation.
Mistrial
Municipal Court Judge Ed
ward Scoyen declared a mistrial
for Julie Hatta, Peter Salovey,
Steve Sicotte and Thomas
Thompson. He set Aug. 10 as the
X,

Byrne said all eight defen

were present when the order was
given but the attorneys did not
want to bore the jury with re

the decision to have only four of
the eight take the stand troubled
the jury.
The jurors returned to the
courtroom twice before they
reached a verdict. They asked
Judge Scoyen to reread the defin
itions of the charges.
Reasonable doubt
The jury foreman told the
judge there was "reasonable
doubt among some of the jurors
regarding the assumption that
all in the area had heard the ad
monition."
After the 10 men and two
women had returned to the jury

room to continue deliberating,
defendant Parker remarked,
"They obviously missed our
point. Even though we did hear
it we had a right to be there."
The defendants claimed they
should have been allowed to re
main in Old Union because they
were Stanford students, not
members of the general public.
They were arrested for al
legedly refusing to leave a Uni
versity building "not open to the
general public, upon being re
quested to leave by a peace of
ficer and the owner." according
to the charge.

Parker said he took the stand
because "it was an integral part
of the defense."
Byrne said all eight defen
dants would have testified they
were present when the order was
given but the attorneys did not
want to bore the jury with re

the decision to have only four of
the eight take the stand troubled
the jury.
The jurors returned to the
courtroom twice before they
reached a verdict. They asked
Judge Scoyen to reread the defin

Reasonable doubt
The jury foreman told the
judge there was "reasonable
doubt among some of the jurors
regarding the assumption that
all in the area had heard the ad
monition."
After the 10 men and two
women had returned to the jury

room to continue deliberating,
defendant Parker remarked,
"They obviously missed our
point. Even though we did hear
it we had a right to be there."
The defendants claimed they
should have been allowed to re
main in Old Union because they
were Stanford students, not
members of the general public.
They were arrested for al

general public, upon being re
quested to leave by a peace of
ficer and the owner." according
to the charge.

who testified they heard the
order to disperse at Old Union

day on two counts, but the jury
was hung 10-2 on the same two
counts for four defendants who
did not take the stand.
All eight students were found
innocent on a third count of
trespassing with intent to dis
rupt business.
Two jurors felt the four defen
dants who did not testify must be
found innocent because it was
unclear whether they heard the
order to disperse before they
were arrested, a juror said.
The jury, which deliberated
for 5V2 hours, found Ellen Bryne,
Roger Cole, Bruce Parker and Joe
Wender guilty of a trespassing
