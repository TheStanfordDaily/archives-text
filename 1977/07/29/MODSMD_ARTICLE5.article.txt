Recycling center
I am appalled at the Universi
ty's decision to evict the recvcl-,
ing center from its location on
Pampas Lane. This center has
been the only depository on the
campus for recyclable materials,
and has, 1 am sure reduced
greatly the amount of reusable
paper, cans and glass that has
been needlessly discarded.
Plant Services Director Jason
Mavis's comments that the
center created traffic problems
and had garbage in public view
are very surprising. On the sev
eral occasions on which I have
taken recyclable materials to the
center, I have never witnessed
any traffic problems. In fact, in
most cases, either my car has
been the only one at the center,
or there has been one other car
there.
Although the materials to be
recycled occupy a fairly large
amount of space, they are kept in
containers specifically marked
for each type of recyclable mate
rial, and I have never seen any
"garbage" at the recycling
center. Actually, about 200 feet
SE of the center, behind the
commissary warehouse, is
where an eyesore exists. What
appear to be milk and fruit juiLe
crates are piled haphazardly on
the ground, and old car tires are
strewn about randomly between
the trees.
In addition, there is a high
fence partly encircling the area;
perhaps if the University were
willing to extend this fencing
around the rest of the perimeter
of the area, any complaints from
neighboring facilities would be
eliminated. The cost would be
minimal in comparison with the
costs of wasting huge quantities
of resources that could be recy
cled. I hope that Stanford Uni
versity wishes to be a leader in
the field of resource recovery;
evicting the only recycling
center on the campus is not an
answer to waste disposal prob
lems.

Cheers for Karen Harns (Daily.
July 26) who is doing her part to
dispel a denigrating attitude to

ward homemaking and child
rearing!
It might seem fortunate
that fathers are free now to share
in the kind of perspective possi
ble only through greater partici
pation in the care, training, de
velopment and education of
their children.
Unfortunately, most men are
unwilling to make the sacrifice
in their own career advancement
necessary to assume their equal
share of these jointly-incurred
responsibilities. Their attitude is
compatible with the unmistaka
ble objective of California family
laws enacted to conform to
"equal rights" — which is to get
virtually everyone into the mar
ketplace.
A woman whose husband is
more interested in "getting
ahead" than in equally sharing a
vocation in the home has one of
two choices. She may relinquish
the care of their children and re
lated responsibilities to others in
order to pursue her own paying
career; or she may remain in the
home and — inasmuch as the
marriage has at least a 50-
percent chance of ending in di
vorce — place considerable risk
on her economic future.
For her husband, under "equal
rights," and irrespective of his
own earning capacity, will not
be expected to split equally the
expense of her earning-potential
depreciation when the divorce
court requires her to get a paying
job — at a level necessarily
commensurate with her inex
perience.
Those able to work things out
amicably are indeed blessed.
Human nature being what it is,
though, some persons take
undue advantage of others —
which fact is the reason we must
have law.
But the fuzzy, ambiguous fam
ily law that California has
enacted since ratifying the Equal
Rights Amendment is, to all in
tents and purposes, no law at all
— except, however, that the state
has provided itself with the legal
structure for taking over the
functions of the family wherever
conflict arises.

Mavis's comments that the
center created traffic problems
and had garbage in public view
are very surprising. On the sev
eral occasions on which I have
taken recyclable materials to the
center, I have never witnessed
any traffic problems. In fact, in
most cases, either my car has
been the only one at the center,
or there has been one other car
there.
Although the materials to be
recycled occupy a fairly large
amount of space, they are kept in
containers specifically marked
for each type of recyclable mate
rial, and I have never seen any
"garbage" at the recycling
center. Actually, about 200 feet
SE of the center, behind the
commissary warehouse, is
where an eyesore exists. What
appear to be milk and fruit juiLe
crates are piled haphazardly on
the ground, and old car tires are
strewn about randomly between
the trees.
In addition, there is a high
fence partly encircling the area;
perhaps if the University were
willing to extend this fencing
around the rest of the perimeter
of the area, any complaints from
neighboring facilities would be
eliminated. The cost would be
minimal in comparison with the
costs of wasting huge quantities
of resources that could be recy
cled. I hope that Stanford Uni
versity wishes to be a leader in
the field of resource recovery;
evicting the only recycling
center on the campus is not an
answer to waste disposal prob
lems.

Cheers for Karen Harns (Daily.

dispel a denigrating attitude to

It might seem fortunate
that fathers are free now to share
in the kind of perspective possi
ble only through greater partici
pation in the care, training, de
velopment and education of
their children.
Unfortunately, most men are
unwilling to make the sacrifice
in their own career advancement
necessary to assume their equal
share of these jointly-incurred
responsibilities. Their attitude is
compatible with the unmistaka
ble objective of California family
laws enacted to conform to
"equal rights" — which is to get
virtually everyone into the mar
ketplace.
A woman whose husband is
more interested in "getting
ahead" than in equally sharing a
vocation in the home has one of
two choices. She may relinquish
the care of their children and re
lated responsibilities to others in
order to pursue her own paying
career; or she may remain in the
home and — inasmuch as the
marriage has at least a 50-
percent chance of ending in di
vorce — place considerable risk
on her economic future.
For her husband, under "equal
rights," and irrespective of his
own earning capacity, will not
be expected to split equally the
expense of her earning-potential
depreciation when the divorce
court requires her to get a paying
job — at a level necessarily
commensurate with her inex
perience.
Those able to work things out
amicably are indeed blessed.
Human nature being what it is,
though, some persons take
undue advantage of others —
which fact is the reason we must
have law.
But the fuzzy, ambiguous fam
ily law that California has
enacted since ratifying the Equal
Rights Amendment is, to all in
tents and purposes, no law at all
— except, however, that the state
has provided itself with the legal
structure for taking over the
functions of the family wherever
conflict arises.

I am appalled at the Universi

Pampas Lane. This center has
been the only depository on the

greatly the amount of reusable
paper, cans and glass that has
been needlessly discarded.
