Los Angeles, January 20,1978 — The deliberate
possession of a vagina implies a woman's consent
to sexual relations, a Los Angeles Superior Court
judged ruled yesterday.
In dismissing rape charges against a Los Angeles
insurance broker, Judge Leadus Knot said, "Since
surgery is now available to correct the condition of
having a vagina, any woman who chooses to keep
hers is asking to be raped."
He added such a woman "advertises that she has
little regard for the consequences attached to pos
session of this sex organ."
feminists in the court room audience broke into
loud denunciations of the ruling and the judge.
Shouting, Knot is a rapist' and "Get rid of your
own organ, Leadus," the feminists rushed toward
the bench.
They dispersed, however, when Knot instructed
the bailiffs to remind the women that they posses
sed vaginas themselves, and weretherefore subject
to sexual assault.
Later in his chambers. Knot told reporters how
he came to yesterday's landmark decision.
He noted that legal precedents for the ruling
came last year in two rape cases, one in Wisconsin
and the second in Los Angeles.
In the first case, Judge Archie Simonson of
Madison, Wisconsin, sentenced a 15 year-old
rapist to a year at home. Simonson ruled that rape
was normal in a sexually permissive society. He
mentioned nude dancers in local bars as one in
citement to the rape of the 16 year-old victim, who
was fully clothed when she was attacked.
The second legal decision came in July of last
year, when Justice Lynn Compton, speaking for the
three-judge Court of Appeals, overturned the rape
conviction of a Los Angeles man.
Justice Compton said that a lone female hitch
hiker implies consent to sexual relations by her
willingness to enter a stranger's car.
Women shouldn't allow themselves to appear
in public without clothing, nor should they enter
vehicles with unknown men," said Judge Knot

yesterday. "And it's clear to me that a in wo
who wants to avoid being raped knows
the answer for her." , , if

judged ruled yesterday.
In dismissing rape charges against a Los Angeles
insurance broker, Judge Leadus Knot said, "Since
surgery is now available to correct the condition of
having a vagina, any woman who chooses to keep
hers is asking to be raped."
He added such a woman "advertises that she has
little regard for the consequences attached to pos
session of this sex organ."
feminists in the court room audience broke into
loud denunciations of the ruling and the judge.
Shouting, Knot is a rapist' and "Get rid of your
own organ, Leadus," the feminists rushed toward
the bench.
They dispersed, however, when Knot instructed
the bailiffs to remind the women that they posses
sed vaginas themselves, and weretherefore subject
to sexual assault.
Later in his chambers. Knot told reporters how
he came to yesterday's landmark decision.
He noted that legal precedents for the ruling
came last year in two rape cases, one in Wisconsin
and the second in Los Angeles.
In the first case, Judge Archie Simonson of
Madison, Wisconsin, sentenced a 15 year-old
rapist to a year at home. Simonson ruled that rape
was normal in a sexually permissive society. He
mentioned nude dancers in local bars as one in
citement to the rape of the 16 year-old victim, who
was fully clothed when she was attacked.
The second legal decision came in July of last
year, when Justice Lynn Compton, speaking for the
three-judge Court of Appeals, overturned the rape
conviction of a Los Angeles man.
Justice Compton said that a lone female hitch
hiker implies consent to sexual relations by her
willingness to enter a stranger's car.
Women shouldn't allow themselves to appear
in public without clothing, nor should they enter
vehicles with unknown men," said Judge Knot
