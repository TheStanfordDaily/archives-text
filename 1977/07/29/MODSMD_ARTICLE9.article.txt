Geothermal energy has to be
used on the spot, he pointed out.
Currently it is being used in
places like California's Imperial
Valley, where hot water is erupt
ing and in Wairekai, New Zea
land, where steam erupts.
Iceland also uses geothermal
energy, Kruger said, and thus
saves about one million barrels
of oil annually by using hot
springs for heating.
Research is underway on how

to design better turbines and
how to improve drilling
technology, he said.
Kruger said the profit level
from geothermal energy invest
ment is very difficult to estimate.
He also said geothermal energy
production may release pollut
ants into the atmosphere.
Conflicting government regu
lations may cause delays and
frustrations in geothermal
energy production, he added.
