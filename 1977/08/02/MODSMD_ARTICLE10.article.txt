After several months of doubt
about the future of the Chicano
Affairs Office, the University has
decided to retain the office in its
current form, according to office
head Cecilia Burciaga.
Burciaga said she will be step
ping down from her position
within a month, as soon as a suc
cessor is found.
Some 130 persons had applied
for the position, she said, and six
have now emerged as top candi
dates for the post. The final deci
sion will be made by President
Richard Lyman, she said.
One candidate is a member of
the University community, she
said, and the other five are out
siders.
Convincing administrators of

the need for continuation of the
Chicano Affairs Office required
"a lot of negotiating," Burciaga
said.
In April, Lyman told the Fa
culty Senate "the University
should not close down the office
unless the functions of the office
are being performed elsewhere,
and it is not clear that such is the
case."
For the fall, the Chicano Af
fairs Office will be striving to
improve chicano student ac
tivities on campus, and to im
prove faculty affirmative action
efforts, Burciaga said.
Burciagoalsosaid theChicano
Affairs Office will look into the
possibility of establishing a cul
tural center for the 13 or 14

chicano organizations onj

In April she had said "t|

the needs of the chicano
munits and the external
cumstani ■ ■■- such as the I
case makes it .< difficult til
