Henry VI, 111 is a blood-and
guts history play based on Eng
land's War of Roses. Besides il
lustrating the chaotic in
evitabilities of crown
mongering, it introduces
Richard Crookback,Shakes
peare's most hypnotically vil
lainous character.
Henry VI, is also complex. It
follows Henry's 1 and II and the
speaking parts are for 36, as well
as soldiers and attendants.
Further, Richard's delayed
emergence (not until act III)
leaves a play that can be stilted,
as the oratory tends toward

bombast and the incidents to
ward contrivance.
It is what the experts describe
as difficult while the perceptive
say mediocre, never cited as the
best Shakespeare ever wrote.
Or so I thought until I saw Pat
Patton's polished, organized and
altogether brilliant Henry VI,
one that denies the limitations so
often cited as part and parcel of
the play.
Because it is outdoors at night
in the finest S hakespearean thea
ter in North America, the actors
do justice to their parts without
anesthesizing the audience.
Larry Ballard's lienry, Joseph De
Salvio's Duke of York and Mi mi
Carr's Queen Margaret are par
ticularly impressive. All three
give forceful characterizations
and all three resist the pull to
ward caricature.
Jerry Jones ("a son that has kil
led his father") and Dan kremer
("A father that has killed his
son") transform what easily
could be very maudlin into
something telling and admira
ble.
Michael Santo's performance
as "the indigest, deformed
lump" . . . "valiant crookbacked
prodigy; Dicky" has everyone
who saw it anxious for Ash

land's 1978 Richard 111 in which
Richard's powers are fully ex
posed — it is nothing less than
the finest moment in the festival.
I hope Santo gets a chance to
show his stuff as Richard next
year.
Jeanne Davidson's costume
design and Richard Hay's stage
work make allegiances easy to
follow. With the exception of
some angelic-looking French
people and a few distractingly
plasticky heads (I told you it was
blood and guts) their efforts can
hardly be faulted.
For a long, hard history, Henry
is better than I had thought pos
sible. If everything else had been
butchered it would have still be
worth the trip. Needless to say,
this is not the case.
Ashland's second triumph is
its Merchant of Venice. Mer
chant isanoldfavoriteoffestival
founder Agnus Bowmer who has
played Shylock eight times here
(beginning in 1935 when plays
alternated with boxing
matches). James Edmunson
takes the role this year and he
does it well. Appearing both vil
lainous and stricken, Edmunson
gives the audience no easy outs.
At the same time, heallowsthem
to enjoy (at least at first) the

"other story" in the play — in
volving Portia (Christine Healy),
Bassanio (Barry Mullholland)
and a few unbearably funny
suitors.
I don't mean to say those in
command ran away from the ra
cism in this play. Director
Michael Addisson has faced it
squarely and the fifth act (after
Shylock is "saved" and forced to
become Christian) is as clouded
as ever. He has given a jollier
than normal Belmont and in
such a way keeps the play sur
prisingly balanced.
No simple "Tragedy of the
Jew," this. Instead, we have a
full-throated, puzzling show,
which is just what the audience
needed.
Ashland's summer season
continues until September 18. In
addition to the Shakespeare
mentioned, "Anthony and
Cleopatra" is performed. Non-
Shakespearean works include
Sheridan's "The Rivals," Wil
liam's "A Streetcar Named De
sire" and O'Neil's "A Moon for
the Misbegotten."
Weekend tickets are very
scarce hut there are waiting lists.
The box office phone number is
(503) 482-4331.

For a long, hard history, Henry
is better than I had thought pos

worth the trip. Needless to say,
this is not the case.

founder Agnus Bowmer who has
played Shylock eight times here
(beginning in 1935 when plays
alternated with boxing
matches). James Edmunson
takes the role this year and he
does it well. Appearing both vil

gives the audience no easy outs.
At the same time, heallowsthem

"other story" in the play — in
volving Portia (Christine Healy),
Bassanio (Barry Mullholland)
and a few unbearably funny
suitors.
I don't mean to say those in
command ran away from the ra
cism in this play. Director
Michael Addisson has faced it
squarely and the fifth act (after
Shylock is "saved" and forced to
become Christian) is as clouded
as ever. He has given a jollier
than normal Belmont and in
such a way keeps the play sur
prisingly balanced.
No simple "Tragedy of the
Jew," this. Instead, we have a
full-throated, puzzling show,
which is just what the audience
needed.
Ashland's summer season
continues until September 18. In
addition to the Shakespeare
mentioned, "Anthony and
Cleopatra" is performed. Non-
Shakespearean works include
Sheridan's "The Rivals," Wil
liam's "A Streetcar Named De
sire" and O'Neil's "A Moon for
the Misbegotten."
Weekend tickets are very
scarce hut there are waiting lists.

Henry VI, 111 is a blood-and
guts history play based on Eng
land's War of Roses. Besides il
lustrating the chaotic in
evitabilities of crown
mongering, it introduces
Richard Crookback,Shakes
peare's most hypnotically vil
lainous character.
Henry VI, is also complex. It
follows Henry's 1 and II and the
speaking parts are for 36, as well
as soldiers and attendants.
Further, Richard's delayed
emergence (not until act III)
leaves a play that can be stilted,
as the oratory tends toward

bombast and the incidents to
ward contrivance.
It is what the experts describe
as difficult while the perceptive
say mediocre, never cited as the
best Shakespeare ever wrote.
Or so I thought until I saw Pat
Patton's polished, organized and
altogether brilliant Henry VI,
one that denies the limitations so
often cited as part and parcel of
the play.
Because it is outdoors at night
in the finest S hakespearean thea
ter in North America, the actors
do justice to their parts without
anesthesizing the audience.
Larry Ballard's lienry, Joseph De
Salvio's Duke of York and Mi mi
Carr's Queen Margaret are par
ticularly impressive. All three
give forceful characterizations
and all three resist the pull to
ward caricature.
Jerry Jones ("a son that has kil
led his father") and Dan kremer
("A father that has killed his
son") transform what easily
could be very maudlin into
something telling and admira
ble.
Michael Santo's performance
as "the indigest, deformed
lump" . . . "valiant crookbacked
prodigy; Dicky" has everyone
who saw it anxious for Ash

land's 1978 Richard 111 in which
Richard's powers are fully ex
posed — it is nothing less than
the finest moment in the festival.
I hope Santo gets a chance to
show his stuff as Richard next
year.
Jeanne Davidson's costume
design and Richard Hay's stage
work make allegiances easy to
follow. With the exception of
some angelic-looking French
people and a few distractingly
plasticky heads (I told you it was
blood and guts) their efforts can
hardly be faulted.
