Turner's version of
Bare's Measure tor Men
tis not the kind of play

ier has put much.stress
ark spots in this "dark
eception has not been
cause the action is set in
Shakespearean" police
ipled by "unShakespea
aks. the critical reaction
I loud and long
' all," they say, "who
o see an Angelo that
lather boots, crops his
nr like a Gestapo, wears
fire glasses, carries a
d tenders his affections
nner that would have
fry Flint proud? Who
see a Duke that drinks,
Isvmemory and fiddles

sadistically with the wellbeing
of his subjects? Does he think
this is a drive-in?"
Yet even those complaints are
trifling compared to the reaction
to the ending (Turner has taken
it upon himself to adjust the
finish to fit above-mentioned
"nuns-in-bondage" interpreta
tion). Every critic worth his
plumes will tell you that
ending-changing is an unfor
giveable defilement of every
thing truly Shakespearean.
"'Tis Heresy,' is the cry" and an
affront to the Bard himself."
What's worse, its mostly true
— this is a heavy-handed ver
sion. Still, I am less than con
vinced when people like Ber
txand Evans (in last week's San
Francisco Chronicle pink sec
tion) suggest that festivalgoers
skip the play and spend the time

in Lithia Park "watching the
pony-tailed boys and girls with
bushy armpits!"
Perhaps 1 am a degenerate, and
perhaps I should turn in the
plumes — I must confess herein
to having greatly enjoyed the
play. It is warped, to be sure, but
that need not deter us from go
ing. In the park, one sees very
little of the insidiously superior
acting with which this play is
packed — from lames Edmon
son's Angelo to John Tyson's
Pompey, the personas are stark
and impressive. Or maybe the
staging was most impressive —
as always by Richard Hay, and as
always ingenious and simple.
Whatever it is, the effect is a dis
tinctly non-puritan attitude to
wards artistic experimentation
— more pleasant 11hi nk, than the
bushiest armpit in the country.
