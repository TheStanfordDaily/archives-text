'°se book is about a
robber named Jamie
u ho is in search of
d a nice wife.
oduction fails twice
part, portrayed fairly
lv er: first he is not de
"° the leading charac
|°r intended. Second,
n '< made into the
for by the
r role in the
11 of Clement Mus-
Wns rich plantation
B f ove is feebly per-

awkwardly, his make up job
looks phony, and is just too
young-looking for the part,
which is an old man.
On the whole, the rest of the
company is quite impressive.
There are two tremendous
standouts.
Terri Berringer, as Musgrove's
wicked second wife, Salome, is
extremely hilarious and shows
great promise for the future.
Every time she hits the stage
there is true excitement and en
joyment.
The other brilliant perfor
mance is by Ken Goth, who plays
a character called Goat, a far
mhand who works for the evil

Salome. Like Berringer, he is a
terrific actor and is truly hilari
ous in this zany role.
Al Kramer's sets, Elisabeth
Roberts' costumes, and John
Fisher's lighting are all suffi
cient.
I saw the Broadway produc
tion last season. This season s
production lacks the fine direc
tion and choreography last sea
son's had.
All in all. if you can ignore the
bad timing et al. The Robber
Bridegroom is good family fun.
This critic is disappointed with
the overall production though.
