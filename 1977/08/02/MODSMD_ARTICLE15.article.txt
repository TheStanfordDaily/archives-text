Nixon said to receive cash
New York — Time magazine, quoting
unidentified government sources, said
former President Richard Nixon had re
ceived $1 million in cash from Teamsters
Union President Frank Fitzsimmons in
exchange for barring James Hoffa from
seeking elective office in the union.
The magazine reported Sunday that the
sources had said government informers
contended that New Jersey Teamster boss
Anthony Provenzano had ordered in
early January, 1973, that $500,000 in cash
be delivered to a White House courier in
Las Vegas.
Provenzano allegedly told an associate
that he had collected the money at
Fitzsimmons' request and that another
$500,000 in cash had been provided for
Nixon, also on Fitzsimmons' orders, by
Allen Dorfman, a convicted Chicago labor
racketeer. Dorfman had been an adviser to
the Teamsters Union pension fund.
According to the magazine, the al
legedly arranged $500,000 payment by
Provenzano was made in Las Vegas on
Jan. 6, 1973, and was arranged for by
Nixon White House aide Charles Colson.
Hoffa vanished from a restaurant park
ing lot outside Detroit on July 30, 1975.
The FBI interviewed Colson about the
alleged payoff last February, the
magazine said, but Colson denied any
knowledge of it.
The magazine said the $1 million might
have been what Nixon had referred to in
the March 21,1973 White House meeting
with White House counsel John Dean 111
about the Watergate burglars' demands
for huge sums of hush money.
Nixon had commuted Hoffa's 13-year
prison sentence for jury tampering and

mail fraud in December, 1971, with the
proviso that he have nothing to do with
running the union.
Steelworkers strike
Duluth, Minn. — Picketers represent
ing more than 1400 seel workers in at least
five states shut down two-thirds of the
nation's iron ore production yesterday in
the basic steel industry's first strike in 18
years.
Industry officials said the walk-outs
violated a no-strike clause in the national
contract, but the United Steelworkers
union officials said the issues were local
ones and therefore the strike was legal.
The walkout was concentrated in
northern Minnesota and Upper Michi
gan, where USW officials said members
of 21 locals voted overwhelmingly to
strike 12 iron ore mines and plants after
negotiations broke down Sunday night.
In addition, the USW reported that
about 700 workers in Worchester, Mass.,
struck the U.S. Steel Corp.'s electrical
cable divsion and two smaller steel firms.
The last industry wide steel strike in
1959 lasted 116 days.
'Son of Sam' strikes
New York — The killer who calls him
self "Son of Sam" struck again early Sun

day, shooting a young couple, killing one
and wounding another, as they sat in a car
parked on the Brooklyn waterfront.
By Sunday afternoon, more than 12
hours after the shootings, Police Depart
ment ballistics experts confirmed that the
attack had been carried out with the same
.44-caliber revolver that had been used to
kill five young people and wound six
others in seven incidents during the last
year.
The attack came two days after the an
niversary of the killer's first murder, and
occured more thanlO miles from his pre
vious attacks, which were clustered in
northern Queens and the east Bronx.
The victims, Robert Violante, 20, and
Stacy Moskowitz, also 20, were both shot
in the head, Violante once and Moskowitz
twice. Both victims were taken to Coney
Island Hospital and then transferred to
Kings County Hospital Center, where
both underwent extensive operations.
Doctors had later listed Moskowitz's
chances of survival at 50 per cent. She
died early last night. Violante's chances
for survival were said to be better, but he
might possibly lose his sight.
One bullet fired in the attack had
lodged in the car's steering column, but
the fragment was too badly mangled for
ballistics experts to say definitely that it
had come from the .44-caliber killer's
gun. So it was not until surgeons removed
a nearly whole bullet from Moskowitz's

neck that the police could concln
state that the "Son of Sam"hadi
again.
