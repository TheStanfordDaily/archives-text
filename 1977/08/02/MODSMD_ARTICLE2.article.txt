said, although it was about 60
per cent male for 1976-77.
Jean Kitaji, supervisor of
single student housing, said
more spaces have been reserved
for freshmen in four-class dorms
this fall, to accommodate the
unusually large Class of 1980.
She said "at last count," 1577
spaces were reserved for the
Class of 1981, while previous en
tering classes have been about
1500.
Some triples in Roble Hall
may be converted into quads,
Kitaji said.
Roommates are usually the
same height, Trusty said. "Al
though there's no real
psychological reason for doing
this," she said, "it's some sort of
initial criterion."
The AIC also tries to room
Californians with non-
Californians, Trusty said.
Beyond those considerations,
she said, the AIC tries to room
persons with different intellec
tual and activities backgrounds,
but with little cultural conflict.

"We're not going to put some
one whose parents are both col
lege educated and went to Har
vard with someone whose pa
rents never went to college and
are say — laborers in a car
shop," she said.
Within dorms, Trusty added,
she and the other assigners will
try to put quiet persons in the
center of a corridor so they will
meet more people, and seem
ingly more outgoing persons in
the ends of halls because they
will meet people regardless.
All information about mem
bers of theClass of 1981 is culled
from a card entering students
fill out and send in to the AIC,,
she said.
"We try not to put two pre
meds or two engineers to
gether," Trusty said. "The com
petition is too intense to have to
live with."
Students with special prefer
ences are usually accommo
dated, Trusty said. Swimmers
are usually placed in Branner or
Toyon Hall, the two closest
dorms to the swimming com

plex, she said.
One freshman-to-be indicated
that she would bring her horse
and keep it at the campus stable,
so she was placed in Lagunita,
the closest dorm to the stable.
Trusty said.
However, she added, twice as
many freshman males as could
be accommodated requested that
they be placed in dorms which
were coed within corridors. The
choice coed spots are being
doled out "as randomly as we
can make it," Trusty said.
Twins and siblings are usually
not placed in the same dorm, she
said, but are usually placed on
the same side of campus.
Generally, Trusty said, "we try
to make each dorm a microcosm
of each class."
Because of the larger-than
expected size of this fall s enter
ing freshman class, Trusty said
far fewer spaces than usual will
be available to returning stu
dents on the single student wait
ing list following this spring's
draw.

Twins and siblings are usually

said, but are usually placed on

Generally, Trusty said, "we try

Jean Kitaji, supervisor of

more spaces have been reserved
for freshmen in four-class dorms
this fall, to accommodate the
unusually large Class of 1980.
She said "at last count," 1577
spaces were reserved for the
Class of 1981, while previous en
tering classes have been about
1500.
Some triples in Roble Hall
may be converted into quads,
Kitaji said.
Roommates are usually the

though there's no real
psychological reason for doing
this," she said, "it's some sort of
initial criterion."
The AIC also tries to room
Californians with non-
Californians, Trusty said.
Beyond those considerations,
she said, the AIC tries to room
persons with different intellec
tual and activities backgrounds,
but with little cultural conflict.

"We're not going to put some
one whose parents are both col
lege educated and went to Har
vard with someone whose pa
rents never went to college and
are say — laborers in a car
shop," she said.
Within dorms, Trusty added,
she and the other assigners will
try to put quiet persons in the
center of a corridor so they will
meet more people, and seem
ingly more outgoing persons in
the ends of halls because they
will meet people regardless.

"We try not to put two pre

Students with special prefer

are usually placed in Branner or
