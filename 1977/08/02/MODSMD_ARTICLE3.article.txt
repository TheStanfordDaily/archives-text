# 6 change pleas to 'no contest'
## 
### Randy Keith Bonny Rodden 
Six South Africa protesters
yesterday changed their plea to
no contest on one of three mis
demeanor charges against them
rather than proceed with their
scheduled trial for sitting-in
May 9 in Old Union.
Five of the six accepted
Municipal Court Judge Edward
Scoyen's offer of 50 hours of vol
unteer work in lieu of a $65 fine
and the sixth agreed to pay the
fine. Each of the defendents also
received six months' probation.
Robert Degrasse, David Bur
nett, Elizabeth Dwyer, Kathy
McTigue, Thatcher Freund and
Jack Finkler all changed their
plea to no contest on the charge
of trespassing.
The demonstrators originally
pleaded innocent to charges of
trespassing, trespassing with in
tent to obstruct business and fai
lure to disperse, but changed
their pleas after seeing the re
sults of the first two trials.
Eleven other demonstrators
have been found guilty on
charges of trespassing and fai
lure to disperse. The trial of four

others resulted in a hung jury.
All 15 were found innocent of
trespassing with intent to
obstruct business.
"We were discouraged about
whether or not we could do bet
ter than a hung jury," said kathy
McTigue, one of the defendents.
McTigue also asked if she
could be sentenced to jail in
stead of receiving a penalty of
volunteer work and probation.
Scoyen denied the request.
"I asked to go to jail because I
felt really strongly about what
we did . . . since the county has
decided that we should be
punished for it, I would rather
have the kind of punishment
they deal out to someone who
didn't have enough money to
pay them (the county)," she said.
McTigue accepted the volunteer
work as part of her sentence.
Robert Degrasse, a defendent
who graduated from here in
1976, said "I've felt from early on
in the process that I wasn't too
sure going to trial was the best
way to expend our energy."
"What we did basically was a
protest against Stanford's
policies. In the broader sense I
don't think that all of us, or a
great number of us, had all that
much interest in trying to clog
up the legal system in Santa
Clara County," he said.
Attorneys for the 214 protes
ters who have yet to go to trial
said they do not know whether
all their clients will change their
pleas rather than go to court.
"We don't encourage them
one way or another," said Rick
Dubois, one of the attorneys rep
resenting some of the protesters
who have yet to go to trial.
Ron Romines, another attor
ney for the protesters, said that
he expected to know by the end
of next week whether most of the
protesters would change their
pleas.
However, time is an element
in the case because Scoyen is
scheduled to go on a four-week
vacation starting Friday. He will
be replaced by another Munici
pal Court judge or by a Superior
Court judge, either of whom
could issue sentences different
from what has become Scoyen's
standard penalty of a $65 fine
and six months' probation.
"Judge Scoyen has a reputa
tion for being a lenient judge-. . .
I don't see that (Scoyen's vaca
tion) as a major factor in chang
ing the pleas," Romines added.
