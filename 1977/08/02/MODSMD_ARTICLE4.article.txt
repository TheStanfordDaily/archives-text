New track
I am writing this letter in the
hope of provoking action in an
area of athletics at Stanford that I
feel needs immediate attention.
That area is the track and field
facility. To put it bluntly, Stan
ford needs a new track.
There is no reason why a track
team at any level should not be
able to workout on its track. The
Stanford team cannot. We are
forced to practice on the grass
inside the track or on the fields
surrounding. During the season
we run on it for a workout once a
week. Hurdlers and relay men
must practice on it on a more
frequent basis.
The reason why we don't prac
tice on our track is to prevent
injury. The track was laid with
the intention of resurfacing it
after five years. The date is sev
eral years past. The surface is
rutty and hard. There is no
reason why an institution such
as Stanford or its athletes should
be ashamed of a facility. That
point is rapidly approaching.
One might argue that the track
team has done little itself to war
rant a new track. That may have
been true of the last few years,
but certainly not this year. If all
indications prove correct it will
never be true. We had two world
leaders going into the late season
in Terry Albritton and James Lof
ton. We will return 34 of our 45
Pac-8 Meet points, the highest
total scored in seven years. We
also return school recordholders
in the long jump, 400, and the
mile relay team.
The list of recruits is the envy
of many:thetop middle distance

runner in North America (a
Canadian), the undefeated Cal
state high school mile champ
ion. the undefeated Cal state dis
cus champion, the Kansas state
indoor hurdle champ, the sec
ond place Cal state high hurdler,
as well as many others. The fu
ture is bright; a new track would
spark it further.
There seems to be some argu
ment concerning why Stanford
should lay a new track when, be
cause of the shortage of lanes, we
could never get big meets to
come. This is no excuse. The
new track would be 400 meters,
rather than the current 440
yards. It would be entirely pos
sible to (football fanaticsâ€”count
to ten) remove small portions of
the inside ends of the stadium.
The effect on football seating
would be no more than several
hundred at most. This would
allow for eight or nine lanes on
the turn. With Stanford's other
assets the prospects of holding
top-flight competition are tre
merftious.
I myself am a member of the
team. I transferred here this year
as a junior. I spent a year at
UCLA and one at Foothill Col
lege. I was third in the Pac-8 400
hurdles and a member of that
school record relay team. I urge
you to consider what I have writ
ten. For obvious reasons I would
like to see a new track this com
ing year. It is possible, too. They
don't take a long time to install
once minds are made up. It
would also make sense to get the
best. I can't see money as a
roadblock, especially with
people donating $250,000 foun
tains on campus. Of course,
there must be action.
