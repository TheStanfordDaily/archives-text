In recent weeks, it has become increasingly ap
parent that domestic policy makers in Washington
have become preoccupied with defense considera
tions. This disturbing trend follows what has been
a relative calm in arms escalation since the end of
American involvement in the Vietnam conflict.
The B-l bomber, the cruise missile and the neutron
bomb have been items of major Congressional con
cern since the Carter administration took office.
The zeal with which this nation is gearing up its
nuclear armaments is an ominous sign that at
titudes toward the possibility of nuclear war are
changing. Long thought of as a holocaust which
mankind had sense enough to avoid, treatment of
the prospect has recently come to resemble that of
a future devastating California earth inevit
able, yet too far removed from the last similar event
to incite realistic fear. Indeed, it would appear that
memories of the flattened buildings, ghastly radia
tion burns, death, and suffering wrought at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have faded sufficiently to

While the United States has managed to avoid
direct involvement in international conflict for
several years, our most recent folly in Southeast
Asia taught several important lessons.
Hrst of all, if war does again break out between
our country and a foreign nation, it will undoub
tedly differ greatly from confrontations of the past.
nousands of young Americans were killed or
maimed for life in the Vietnam conflict, and bill
ions of dollars were spent - all for the same end

pffnrTm^ 011 ' mß mory of such wasted
effort.makes it highly unlikely that a successful
selective service program could be instituted in
the near future. Few citizens would presently be
willing to risk their lives for Uncle Sam, unless a
,hreat t0 American soil were posed by the
enemy. r y
