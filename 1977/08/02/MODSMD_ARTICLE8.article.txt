# Filling Kennedy's shoes 'tough' job for Bernfield
## 
### George Anders 
Ask Merton Bernfield, new
chairman of the Human Biology
Program, what it's like to have
the post Don Kennedy used to
have, and he'll tell you it's a
tough job.
"Don left a very large gap
that's almost impossible to fill
with one person," Bernfield said
yesterday. "It's not only my hope
but it's almost mandatory that
we get further help in teaching
from the faculty of other depart
ments."
Bernfield was appointed prog
ram chairman on June 10 after
Kennedy had resigned to be
come commissioner of the Food
and Drug Administration in
March.
Bernfield said he plans few
changes in the structure of the
interdisciplinary program.
However, he said he will divide
planning responsibilities among
more persons, and will seek to
have more instructors from other
departments.
Two new courses on health
care policy and environmental
policy will be offered in the com
ing academic year, Bernfield ad
ded. These courses will resem
ble the fourth quarter core course

offered in spring 1976, he
explained.
For 1977-78, the fourthquarter
core will emphasize different
subjects, he added.
Bernfield said he will con
tinue to teach during his three
year appointment as chairman.
"I'm only doing this so I can
teach," he said. "My kicks are
not from administrating."
Bernfield said he will concen
trate on overseeing the natural
science parts of the Human Biol
ogy core, while Assoc. An
thropology Prof. Arthur Wolf
will be in charge of the social

science parts.
Faculty in other departments
will be willing to teach Human
Biology courses, Bernfield pre
dicted. "It's morethan justa mat
ter of coercing and cajoling them
to teach," he said.
Bernfield said he felt students
expressed "justifiable conster
nation" immediately after Ken
nedy's departure.
Viewing the months ahead, he
said "Things are going to be
done somewhat differently, but
we've put together our own
ideas and I think we're going to
do OK."
