If you want to go on paying cruel and unusual prices for new
books, there's not much we can do about it. But what if you
suddenly realized you could get the same books for half of
what you're spending now? Or better yet, what if you could get
any book or record without spending money at all? Wouldn't it
be a good idea to have a place where you could trade in the
records and books you don't want for the ones you do? We're
at 405 Kipling, corner of Lytton, 329-9217, and we've been
doing this seven days a week for seven years. See you
soon. .. .

If you want to go on paying cruel and unusual prices for new
books, there's not much we can do about it. But what if you
suddenly realized you could get the same books for half of
what you're spending now? Or better yet, what if you could get
any book or record without spending money at all? Wouldn't it
be a good idea to have a place where you could trade in the
records and books you don't want for the ones you do? We're
at 405 Kipling, corner of Lytton, 329-9217, and we've been
doing this seven days a week for seven years. See you
soon. .. .
