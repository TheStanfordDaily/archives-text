They could have done it better.
Douglas Mac Arthur's life was one of which
epics should be made. West Point's top graduate in
1903, he was President Theodore Roosevelt's
aide-de-camp, led World War I's famed "Rainbow
Division," administered West Point and, at age 50,
became U.S. Army chief of staff.
In the latter post Mac Arthur first achieved con
troversial national recognition when at President
Herbert Hoover's request he routed the Depression
Bonus Marchers in Washington.
He was widely accused of fascism after that ac
tion and FDR's view that he used a cannon to kill a
fly caused the general to be shunted off to the
Philippines in 1935, presumably to live out his
career in the backwash of the Far East.
Few suspected his position would, within six
years, catapult him to the command of an entire
theater of operations after Pearl Harbor.
By the time the Japanese attacked the Philip
pines in 1941, Mac Arthur, 61, had already lived
what for most men would have been a full life. A
film portrait of the man would have taken full
measure of the early years and tried to capture the
man inside the uniform molded before he became
commander of U.S. forces in the Far East.
Instead, Richard Zanuck and David Brown have
managed to take the most brilliant, meteoric and
controversial American military career of the 20th
century and made it into a lifeless rendition of the
post-1941 scenes of Mac Arthur's life already cap
tured faithfully on newsreels.
Gregory Peck's considerable acting talents
aside, Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins could
easily have saved their effort writing a two hour
and 15 minute script by patching together film of
Mac Arthur himself and writing a short documen
tary narrative.
There is the "1 Shall Return" scene, the strategy
meeting with Roosevelt and Admiral Nimitz, the
landing back on the Philippines, the surrender
ceremony aboard the U.S.S. Missouri, the meeting
with Hirohito as head of the occupation of Japan,
the first report by Truman on the Korean invasion,
