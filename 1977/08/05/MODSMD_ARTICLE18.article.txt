-K.Y.W.
The Harvey J. Earl Memorial Park is one of The
F'arm's smallest parks. Its location is right where
you found the plaque: the median divider along
Panama St. near Duena St. is the park.
From Roxanne Nilan at University Archives, I
found out that Earl was a Stanford undergrad here
in 1918. He was, what was called at that time, a
pre-legal student. He was listed as still alive in the
1955 Alumni directory.
So, I then contacted the Alumni Association.
From them, 1 discovered that Earl died in 1969.
However, his name shall live on at the Harley J.
Earl Memorial Park.
