# Grover's Corners: Old favorite too old?
## 
### 
'Our Town'/AI Peterson

It's been almost 40 years since
the old stage manager or epic
storyteller, whichever you pre
fer. began winding his tales ot
life love and death in the quaint
and ordinary town of Grover's
Corners. N.H. Let's face it, by
now the old guy belongs with
the other talking tombstones on
one of the hills just outside of
town.
Berkeley Repertory Theatre's
production of Thornton Wilder's
Our Town attempts to rejuvenate
a play that has become a war
horse in American drama. It's
been over worked (or perhaps,
worked over) by damn near
every theater group one can
think of. Our Town is a play
which is all too often used as a
staple in a company's season,
some thing that will draw and
give balance thus allowing some
security for the production of
plays which are either experi
mental or at least a less popular
draw.
Fortunately, Berkeley Rep
isn't a petty bunch. They stack
their deck with a play like Our
Town. Instead, they can attack
the stigma that has been attached
to the play in the past 25 years.
Despite a wealth of talent and
strong directing, the play just
doesn't make it. The strong per
formance proves one thing; the
stigma was earned. It's a nice
sentimental journey to a bygone
era and little more. The crusty
old stage manager who pontifi
cates on living life for the mo
ment is heard but who can or
wants to believe that — coming
from his perspective?

Robert Hirschfield. in the role
originally played by Wilder, is
kindly and bittersweet as the
stage manager. He's omnipotent
but somehow, despite the con
stant irony in Grover's Corners,
never shows a trace of cynicism.
That's remarkable considering
the love found — love taken
away near melodramtic plot.
He directs the action with a
fatherly hand. He is casually
acknowledged and walked
around by the other characters.
His advice is paternal and be
cause of his position, non
effectual.
Before the kindly old stage
manager lets us get to know the
folks, however, he shows us
around Grover's Corners. It's "86
per cent Republican, 10 per cent
Democrat. 4 per cent Socialist
and the rest indifferent... 85 per
cent Protestant, 12 per cent
Catholic and the rest indiffe
rent."
Director Douglas Johnson has
the birds singing and morning
light crossing the stage, shades
of everybody's old relatives back
in the midwest. Bean vines, fresh
air and unlocked doors, they're
all right there in Grover's Cor
ners.
After this introduction, the
pastoral paradise becomes inha
bited by witty adults and inno
cent children. This is clearly an
escapist tract.
Rumblings of war in Europe
and the depression, which en
thralled the country when the
play was written in 1938, are

pushed out of sight and, hope
fully, out of mind.
The families, the Webbs and
the Gibbs, are symmetric. The
fathers, are as intelligent and
thoughtful as the community al
lows; they can't avoid talking
about the weather on Main
Street.
They're adept at keeping their
gossipy wives in place by using
the dry witty putdown. The
play's most colorful character,
Dr. Gibbs, elicits laughs by sub

tly cutting down the triviality of
his wife and the early 20th cen
tury woman. Sheldon Feldner
takes the role and walks the thin
line between good humor and
cruel sarcasm.
After the stage manager gives
us a peek at life in Grover's Cor
ners, he gives us permission to
take a break before we get to the
meat of the play, love, but not
just regular love, young love.

Now its time for Wilder
(through the kindly stage man
ager) to let us have it. We are all
lackeys, who failed to realize
that we live in the New Hamp
shire Garden of Eden known as
Grover's Corners. We've failed to
live for the moment, so we're
cast out never to return.
Today, well the folks in
Grover's Corners just aren't the
same, they lock their doors, the
drugstore is "citified and the

good old friends have moved
away.
Our Town is a play locked to
its time period. That's the
stigma. Back in 1938 it was the
proper pablum. It told the audi
ence, whether they were starv
ing, jobless or observers of the
depression, that the good life
was at hand, Grover's Corners
was just around the corner.
Berkeley Rep's production is
about as good as this play can be
done. With the exception of

some scattered overacting by the
mothers (J.C. Sealy and Alice
Rorvik) the entire cast displays a
high degree of professionalism.
The anti-illusionist staging,
avant-garde back in 1938, allows
wide action within the small
confines of Berkeley Rep's stage.
It is elegantly cluttered by set de
signer Ron Pratt.
Our Town has a definite place
in American drama. It is by no
means a classic, but historically
it cannot be overlooked.

'Our Town'/AI Peterson

It's been almost 40 years since
the old stage manager or epic
storyteller, whichever you pre
fer. began winding his tales ot
life love and death in the quaint
and ordinary town of Grover's
Corners. N.H. Let's face it, by
now the old guy belongs with
the other talking tombstones on
one of the hills just outside of
town.
Berkeley Repertory Theatre's
production of Thornton Wilder's
Our Town attempts to rejuvenate
a play that has become a war
horse in American drama. It's
been over worked (or perhaps,
worked over) by damn near
every theater group one can
think of. Our Town is a play
which is all too often used as a
staple in a company's season,
some thing that will draw and
give balance thus allowing some
security for the production of
plays which are either experi
mental or at least a less popular
draw.
Fortunately, Berkeley Rep
isn't a petty bunch. They stack
their deck with a play like Our
Town. Instead, they can attack
the stigma that has been attached
to the play in the past 25 years.
Despite a wealth of talent and
strong directing, the play just
doesn't make it. The strong per
formance proves one thing; the
stigma was earned. It's a nice
sentimental journey to a bygone
era and little more. The crusty
old stage manager who pontifi
cates on living life for the mo
ment is heard but who can or
wants to believe that — coming
from his perspective?

Robert Hirschfield. in the role
originally played by Wilder, is
kindly and bittersweet as the
stage manager. He's omnipotent
but somehow, despite the con
stant irony in Grover's Corners,
never shows a trace of cynicism.
That's remarkable considering
the love found — love taken
away near melodramtic plot.
He directs the action with a
fatherly hand. He is casually
acknowledged and walked
around by the other characters.
His advice is paternal and be
cause of his position, non
effectual.

Now its time for Wilder
(through the kindly stage man
ager) to let us have it. We are all
lackeys, who failed to realize
that we live in the New Hamp
shire Garden of Eden known as
Grover's Corners. We've failed to
live for the moment, so we're
cast out never to return.
Today, well the folks in
Grover's Corners just aren't the
same, they lock their doors, the
drugstore is "citified and the

good old friends have moved
away.
Our Town is a play locked to
its time period. That's the
stigma. Back in 1938 it was the
proper pablum. It told the audi
ence, whether they were starv
ing, jobless or observers of the
depression, that the good life
was at hand, Grover's Corners
was just around the corner.
Berkeley Rep's production is
about as good as this play can be
done. With the exception of

some scattered overacting by the
mothers (J.C. Sealy and Alice
Rorvik) the entire cast displays a
high degree of professionalism.
The anti-illusionist staging,
avant-garde back in 1938, allows
wide action within the small
confines of Berkeley Rep's stage.
It is elegantly cluttered by set de
signer Ron Pratt.
Our Town has a definite place
in American drama. It is by no
means a classic, but historically
it cannot be overlooked.
'Our Town'/AI Peterson

It's been almost 40 years since
the old stage manager or epic
storyteller, whichever you pre
fer. began winding his tales ot
life love and death in the quaint
and ordinary town of Grover's
Corners. N.H. Let's face it, by
now the old guy belongs with
the other talking tombstones on
one of the hills just outside of
town.
Berkeley Repertory Theatre's
production of Thornton Wilder's
Our Town attempts to rejuvenate
a play that has become a war
horse in American drama. It's
been over worked (or perhaps,
worked over) by damn near
every theater group one can
think of. Our Town is a play
which is all too often used as a
staple in a company's season,
some thing that will draw and
give balance thus allowing some
security for the production of
plays which are either experi
mental or at least a less popular
draw.
Fortunately, Berkeley Rep
isn't a petty bunch. They stack
their deck with a play like Our
Town. Instead, they can attack
the stigma that has been attached
to the play in the past 25 years.
Despite a wealth of talent and
strong directing, the play just
doesn't make it. The strong per
formance proves one thing; the
stigma was earned. It's a nice
sentimental journey to a bygone
era and little more. The crusty
old stage manager who pontifi
cates on living life for the mo
ment is heard but who can or
wants to believe that — coming
from his perspective?

Robert Hirschfield. in the role
originally played by Wilder, is
kindly and bittersweet as the
stage manager. He's omnipotent
but somehow, despite the con
stant irony in Grover's Corners,
never shows a trace of cynicism.
That's remarkable considering
the love found — love taken
away near melodramtic plot.
He directs the action with a
fatherly hand. He is casually
acknowledged and walked
around by the other characters.
His advice is paternal and be
cause of his position, non
effectual.
Before the kindly old stage
manager lets us get to know the
folks, however, he shows us
around Grover's Corners. It's "86
per cent Republican, 10 per cent
Democrat. 4 per cent Socialist
and the rest indifferent... 85 per
cent Protestant, 12 per cent
Catholic and the rest indiffe
rent."
Director Douglas Johnson has
the birds singing and morning
light crossing the stage, shades
of everybody's old relatives back
in the midwest. Bean vines, fresh
air and unlocked doors, they're
all right there in Grover's Cor
ners.
After this introduction, the
pastoral paradise becomes inha
bited by witty adults and inno
cent children. This is clearly an
escapist tract.
Rumblings of war in Europe
and the depression, which en
thralled the country when the
play was written in 1938, are

pushed out of sight and, hope
fully, out of mind.
The families, the Webbs and
the Gibbs, are symmetric. The
fathers, are as intelligent and
thoughtful as the community al
lows; they can't avoid talking
about the weather on Main
Street.
They're adept at keeping their
gossipy wives in place by using
the dry witty putdown. The
play's most colorful character,
Dr. Gibbs, elicits laughs by sub

tly cutting down the triviality of
his wife and the early 20th cen
tury woman. Sheldon Feldner
takes the role and walks the thin
line between good humor and
cruel sarcasm.
After the stage manager gives
us a peek at life in Grover's Cor
ners, he gives us permission to
take a break before we get to the
meat of the play, love, but not
just regular love, young love.
George Gibbs (Steve Knox)
