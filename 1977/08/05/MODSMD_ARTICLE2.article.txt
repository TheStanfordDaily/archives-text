Tom Sawyer, manager of the
PRO, said "it looks hopeful" his
operation will be sponsored by a
University group. He said he has
received virtual assurances of
sponsorship offers from
SWOPSI and the Environmental
Law Society, but said the ASSU
is most likely to be the actual
sponsor.
ASSU co-president Anne
Henkels has expressed an in
terest in sponsoring t he center. If
the University approves a spon
sored center, it will receive a
permanent area, funds for up
keep and reliable labor, said Dan
DeYoung, director of service op
erations.
DeYoung said he and Plan
ning Office members will
evaluate proposals.
Administrators "have
changed their tune considera
bly" since issuing the eviction

order, Sawyer said. He said they
are now addressing the ques
tion of finding a proper place"
for the center.
"There's been a tremendous
amount of pressure," Sawyer
said. Mavis acknowledged that
his office has received a number
of telephone calls from "people
who are concerned."
But he said these calls
shouldn't be regarded as "pres
sure" and added that commun
ity interest "does not alter the
fact that the current location is
wrong."
A new recycling operation
would be in a different location,
Mavis said. Administrators have
not looked at other possible loca
tions, he said. ..
Although Sawyer is consider
ing having ASSU sponsor a re
cycling operation, he said such
an effort "cannot be run by a stu
dent group." Students have too
many other involvements, he
explained.
In fuly 1976, because of popu
lar demand, the Peninsula Con
servation Center, which runs the
PRO, expanded recycling opera
tions from the center's office in
Palo Alto to the Stanford cam
pus.
"We kept receiving calls from
people on campus asking us to
pickup their cans and paper. We
did and as the volume in
creased, more storage space was
needed. Since our Palo Alto of
fice couldn't handle the supply,
the most obvious solution was to
get a station on campus," said
Sawyer,
Mavis gave permission and al
located the land for setting up
operations. He said he was led to
believe the recycling center was
a pilot project on an interim
basis involving student facilities
only.
Mavis said he had allowed the
recycling center to use the land
without full authority to make
decisions for the university.
Since the center did not receive
proper authorization from him
in the first place, any appeal to
remain on the site probably
would be refused, he said.
The center was more success
ful than he had expected, he
said.
He said complaints about traf
fic problems and unsightliness
came from the neighboring food
service operations, credit union
and daycare center.
"I am for recycling," Mavis
said, "but it's not fair to those
who must pass by everyday.

Tom Sawyer, manager of the
PRO, said "it looks hopeful" his
operation will be sponsored by a
University group. He said he has
received virtual assurances of
sponsorship offers from
SWOPSI and the Environmental
Law Society, but said the ASSU
is most likely to be the actual
sponsor.
ASSU co-president Anne
Henkels has expressed an in
terest in sponsoring t he center. If
the University approves a spon
sored center, it will receive a
permanent area, funds for up
keep and reliable labor, said Dan
DeYoung, director of service op
erations.
DeYoung said he and Plan
ning Office members will
evaluate proposals.
Administrators "have
changed their tune considera
bly" since issuing the eviction

order, Sawyer said. He said they
are now addressing the ques
tion of finding a proper place"
for the center.
"There's been a tremendous
amount of pressure," Sawyer
said. Mavis acknowledged that
his office has received a number
of telephone calls from "people
who are concerned."
But he said these calls
shouldn't be regarded as "pres
sure" and added that commun
ity interest "does not alter the
fact that the current location is
wrong."
A new recycling operation
would be in a different location,
Mavis said. Administrators have
not looked at other possible loca
tions, he said. ..
Although Sawyer is consider
ing having ASSU sponsor a re
cycling operation, he said such
an effort "cannot be run by a stu
dent group." Students have too
many other involvements, he
explained.
In fuly 1976, because of popu
lar demand, the Peninsula Con
servation Center, which runs the
PRO, expanded recycling opera
tions from the center's office in
Palo Alto to the Stanford cam
pus.
"We kept receiving calls from
people on campus asking us to
pickup their cans and paper. We
did and as the volume in
creased, more storage space was
needed. Since our Palo Alto of
fice couldn't handle the supply,
the most obvious solution was to
get a station on campus," said
Sawyer,
Mavis gave permission and al
located the land for setting up
operations. He said he was led to
believe the recycling center was
a pilot project on an interim
basis involving student facilities
only.
Mavis said he had allowed the
recycling center to use the land
without full authority to make
decisions for the university.
Since the center did not receive
proper authorization from him
in the first place, any appeal to
remain on the site probably
would be refused, he said.
The center was more success
ful than he had expected, he
said.
He said complaints about traf
fic problems and unsightliness
came from the neighboring food
service operations, credit union
and daycare center.
"I am for recycling," Mavis
said, "but it's not fair to those
who must pass by everyday.

Tom Sawyer, manager of the
PRO, said "it looks hopeful" his
operation will be sponsored by a
University group. He said he has
received virtual assurances of
sponsorship offers from
SWOPSI and the Environmental
Law Society, but said the ASSU
is most likely to be the actual
sponsor.
ASSU co-president Anne
Henkels has expressed an in
terest in sponsoring t he center. If
the University approves a spon
sored center, it will receive a
permanent area, funds for up
keep and reliable labor, said Dan
DeYoung, director of service op
erations.
DeYoung said he and Plan
ning Office members will
evaluate proposals.
Administrators "have
changed their tune considera
bly" since issuing the eviction

order, Sawyer said. He said they
are now addressing the ques
tion of finding a proper place"
for the center.
"There's been a tremendous
amount of pressure," Sawyer
said. Mavis acknowledged that
his office has received a number
of telephone calls from "people
who are concerned."
But he said these calls
shouldn't be regarded as "pres
sure" and added that commun
ity interest "does not alter the
fact that the current location is
wrong."
A new recycling operation
would be in a different location,
Mavis said. Administrators have
not looked at other possible loca
tions, he said. ..
Although Sawyer is consider
ing having ASSU sponsor a re
cycling operation, he said such
an effort "cannot be run by a stu
dent group." Students have too
many other involvements, he
explained.
In fuly 1976, because of popu
lar demand, the Peninsula Con
servation Center, which runs the
PRO, expanded recycling opera
tions from the center's office in
Palo Alto to the Stanford cam
pus.
"We kept receiving calls from
people on campus asking us to
pickup their cans and paper. We
did and as the volume in
creased, more storage space was
needed. Since our Palo Alto of
fice couldn't handle the supply,
the most obvious solution was to
get a station on campus," said
Sawyer,
Mavis gave permission and al
located the land for setting up
operations. He said he was led to
believe the recycling center was
a pilot project on an interim
basis involving student facilities
only.
Mavis said he had allowed the
recycling center to use the land
without full authority to make
decisions for the university.
Since the center did not receive
proper authorization from him
in the first place, any appeal to
remain on the site probably
would be refused, he said.
The center was more success
ful than he had expected, he
said.
He said complaints about traf
