# 'A Thousand Clowns'/Jan Miller
## Almost 1000 laughs 
### 
Foothill College's Summerepertory company
may not have evoked a thousand laughs, but there
were plenty of chuckles in the audience for its
recent performance of A Thousand Clowns.
The combination of a great play, talented cast
and skilled director were the predictable ingre
dients of Summerepertory's fine production.
Jeff Kinghorn sparkles as the happy-go-lucky
bachelor Murray Burns, whose carefree, day-to
day existence is what all men crave but few realize.
With his terrific sense of humor and bright
philosophical commentary, the unemployed
script writer is downright funny. Unfortunately,
Murray's unconventional methods of rearing his
precocious 12-year-old nephew Nick, lead him to
face disapproval from the Child Welfare Bureau.
Scott Williams is superb as the brusque, callous
and stuffy welfare worker Albert Amundson. His
strictly-by-the-books attitude not only impinges
on Murray's lifestyle, but costs him his female
flame and cohort, Sandra Markowitz played by
Carolyn Keith.
Keith, a Palo Alto resident, does a good job in her
shift from the up-tight, prudish welfare lady with
tightly drawn hair and spectacles, to the liberated
and supportive woman who later cajoles and aids
Murray.
Chris Mraz, new to Summerepertory this season,
is candid and believable in his portrayal of Nick.
