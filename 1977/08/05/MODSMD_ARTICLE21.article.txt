The Esmeralda Pas de Deux
which followed was choreog
raphed to Ceasare Pugni's music
by the director of the program,
Norbert Vesak. Vesak is on leave
from his position as director of
ballet to the Metropolitan Opera
Company and brings the experi
ence of over 200 professional
productions to Forest Meadows.
He and his creative associate
Robert-Glay Laßose are respon
sible for the excellent lighting,
programming and theatre itself.
His choreography is interna
tionally known through crea
tions for such companies as the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet of
Canada and the Scottish Ballet.
This particular piece was in
teresting and difficult. Unfortu
nately its performance by Kim
berley Graves and Antonio
Mendes was not up to the
exalted standards of classical
ballet.
Graves, who has danced as a
soloist on tour abroad with the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet, was
technically very good. Her solo
was by far the high point of the
piece. She has a fine sense of line
and performs quick, clean turns.
Yet, somehow she lacks the flow
and breath that make a truly ex
cellent dancer.
Mendes, who has danced with
such notable California ballet
companies as the Pacific Ballet,
danced well, but his perfor
mance was marred by a lack of
bravura and absolute precision.
In addition, a genuine rapport
between the dancers was never
established during the piece. In
stead, they relied a bit too heav
ily upon stylized characteriza
tion. Though both dancers show

considerable talent, they lack the
finish which holds a classical
piece together.
Following a 10-minute inter
mission, Tchaikovsky's Trio in
A Minor for Violin, Cello and
Piano, Opus 50 was performed
by Olefsky, Stuart Canin and
William Doppman.
Violinist Canin is a teacher
and performer at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music.
Pianist Doppman has performed
with more than 50 orchestras
and has toured Europe four
times.
The trio, composed in 1882, is
inscribed to Nicholas Rubinstein
"in memory of a great artist." In
tribute to the great pianist, the
piano part of the piece is espe
cially demanding. The piece
consists of two movements; the
first in sonata form and the sec
ond a theme and variations.
As the moon rose behind the
stage, the three musicians held
their audience enthralled. The
interplay between the instru
ments was rich and sensitive.
They moved smoothly and

gracefully through shifts of
mood, performing both sus
tained and staccato movements
with equal dexterity. Doppman,
Olefsky and Canin wove their
superb talents into an auditory
tapestry.
Each musical thread main
tained its individuality, yet be
came inseperable intertwined
with the others. The audience
enjoyed their memorable per
formance so much that it was
only reluctantly that they eased
their applause after the fourth
bow had been taken.
The final piece was choreog
raphed to music written by Ned
Rorem. Rorem, currently com
poser in residence, was the 1976
recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for
composition. Eleven Studies for
Eleven Players was written bet
ween 1959 and 1960. It is scored
for many percussion instru
ments along with winds, brass,
harp, piano and strings. Each of
the 11 players is used as a vir
tuoso soloist and each of the 11
movements uses a different
number and combination of

players thus creating a rich vari
ety of moods. Competitions is
a modern ballet inspired by
Rorem's Eleven Studies for Ele
ven Players to which it is
choreographed.
The dancers, unified by a fine
rapport, were equally expressive
as individuals and as members
of groups and subgroups. As
they moved through the piece
emphasis shifted to different
characters from section to sec
tion. They each struggled with
their own type of competition.
Sometimes it was directed out
ward as in the tussle between the
two male dancers, called Con
test.
The most exciting thing for me
was to see Sebastian's idea come
to life. The student-stars of the
piece blended fine characteriza
tion and fluid technique into
wonderfully evocative dancing.
As the evening came to a close
and the audience wandered
slowly back to their cars,
snatches of conversation expres
sed the pleasure felt from a
memorable performance.

Royal Winnipeg Ballet of
Canada and the Scottish Ballet.
This particular piece was in
teresting and difficult. Unfortu
nately its performance by Kim
berley Graves and Antonio
Mendes was not up to the
exalted standards of classical
ballet.
Graves, who has danced as a
soloist on tour abroad with the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet, was
technically very good. Her solo
was by far the high point of the
piece. She has a fine sense of line
and performs quick, clean turns.
Yet, somehow she lacks the flow
and breath that make a truly ex
cellent dancer.
Mendes, who has danced with
such notable California ballet
companies as the Pacific Ballet,
danced well, but his perfor
mance was marred by a lack of
bravura and absolute precision.
In addition, a genuine rapport
between the dancers was never
established during the piece. In
stead, they relied a bit too heav
ily upon stylized characteriza
tion. Though both dancers show

considerable talent, they lack the
finish which holds a classical
piece together.
Following a 10-minute inter
mission, Tchaikovsky's Trio in
A Minor for Violin, Cello and
Piano, Opus 50 was performed
by Olefsky, Stuart Canin and
William Doppman.
Violinist Canin is a teacher
and performer at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music.
Pianist Doppman has performed
with more than 50 orchestras
and has toured Europe four
times.
The trio, composed in 1882, is
inscribed to Nicholas Rubinstein
"in memory of a great artist." In
tribute to the great pianist, the
piano part of the piece is espe
cially demanding. The piece
consists of two movements; the
first in sonata form and the sec
ond a theme and variations.
As the moon rose behind the
stage, the three musicians held
their audience enthralled. The
interplay between the instru
ments was rich and sensitive.
They moved smoothly and

gracefully through shifts of
mood, performing both sus
tained and staccato movements
with equal dexterity. Doppman,
Olefsky and Canin wove their
superb talents into an auditory
tapestry.
Each musical thread main
tained its individuality, yet be
came inseperable intertwined
with the others. The audience
enjoyed their memorable per
formance so much that it was
only reluctantly that they eased
their applause after the fourth
bow had been taken.
The final piece was choreog
raphed to music written by Ned
Rorem. Rorem, currently com
poser in residence, was the 1976
recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for
composition. Eleven Studies for
Eleven Players was written bet
ween 1959 and 1960. It is scored
for many percussion instru
ments along with winds, brass,
harp, piano and strings. Each of
the 11 players is used as a vir
tuoso soloist and each of the 11
movements uses a different
number and combination of

players thus creating a rich vari
ety of moods. Competitions is
a modern ballet inspired by
Rorem's Eleven Studies for Ele
ven Players to which it is
choreographed.
The dancers, unified by a fine
rapport, were equally expressive
as individuals and as members
of groups and subgroups. As
they moved through the piece
emphasis shifted to different
characters from section to sec
tion. They each struggled with
their own type of competition.
Sometimes it was directed out
ward as in the tussle between the
two male dancers, called Con
test.
The most exciting thing for me
was to see Sebastian's idea come
to life. The student-stars of the
piece blended fine characteriza
tion and fluid technique into
wonderfully evocative dancing.
As the evening came to a close
and the audience wandered
slowly back to their cars,
snatches of conversation expres
sed the pleasure felt from a
memorable performance.

Olefsky and Canin wove their
superb talents into an auditory
tapestry.
Each musical thread main
tained its individuality, yet be
came inseperable intertwined
with the others. The audience
enjoyed their memorable per
formance so much that it was
only reluctantly that they eased
their applause after the fourth
bow had been taken.
The final piece was choreog
raphed to music written by Ned
Rorem. Rorem, currently com
poser in residence, was the 1976
recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for
composition. Eleven Studies for
Eleven Players was written bet
ween 1959 and 1960. It is scored
for many percussion instru
ments along with winds, brass,
harp, piano and strings. Each of
the 11 players is used as a vir
tuoso soloist and each of the 11
movements uses a different
number and combination of

players thus creating a rich vari
ety of moods. Competitions is
a modern ballet inspired by
Rorem's Eleven Studies for Ele
ven Players to which it is
choreographed.
The dancers, unified by a fine
rapport, were equally expressive
as individuals and as members
of groups and subgroups. As
they moved through the piece
emphasis shifted to different
characters from section to sec
tion. They each struggled with
their own type of competition.
Sometimes it was directed out
ward as in the tussle between the
two male dancers, called Con
test.
The most exciting thing for me
was to see Sebastian's idea come
to life. The student-stars of the
piece blended fine characteriza
tion and fluid technique into
wonderfully evocative dancing.
As the evening came to a close
and the audience wandered
slowly back to their cars,
snatches of conversation expres
sed the pleasure felt from a
memorable performance.

The Esmeralda Pas de Deux
which followed was choreog
raphed to Ceasare Pugni's music
by the director of the program,
Norbert Vesak. Vesak is on leave
from his position as director of
ballet to the Metropolitan Opera
Company and brings the experi
ence of over 200 professional
productions to Forest Meadows.
He and his creative associate
Robert-Glay Laßose are respon
sible for the excellent lighting,
programming and theatre itself.
His choreography is interna
tionally known through crea
tions for such companies as the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet of
Canada and the Scottish Ballet.
This particular piece was in
teresting and difficult. Unfortu
nately its performance by Kim
berley Graves and Antonio
Mendes was not up to the
exalted standards of classical
ballet.
Graves, who has danced as a
soloist on tour abroad with the
Royal Winnipeg Ballet, was
technically very good. Her solo
was by far the high point of the
piece. She has a fine sense of line
and performs quick, clean turns.
Yet, somehow she lacks the flow
and breath that make a truly ex
cellent dancer.
Mendes, who has danced with
such notable California ballet
companies as the Pacific Ballet,
danced well, but his perfor
mance was marred by a lack of
bravura and absolute precision.
In addition, a genuine rapport
between the dancers was never
established during the piece. In
stead, they relied a bit too heav
ily upon stylized characteriza
tion. Though both dancers show

considerable talent, they lack the
finish which holds a classical
piece together.
Following a 10-minute inter
mission, Tchaikovsky's Trio in
A Minor for Violin, Cello and
Piano, Opus 50 was performed
by Olefsky, Stuart Canin and
William Doppman.
Violinist Canin is a teacher
and performer at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music.
Pianist Doppman has performed
with more than 50 orchestras
and has toured Europe four
times.
The trio, composed in 1882, is
inscribed to Nicholas Rubinstein
"in memory of a great artist." In
tribute to the great pianist, the
piano part of the piece is espe
cially demanding. The piece
consists of two movements; the
first in sonata form and the sec
ond a theme and variations.
As the moon rose behind the
stage, the three musicians held
their audience enthralled. The
interplay between the instru
ments was rich and sensitive.
They moved smoothly and

gracefully through shifts of
mood, performing both sus
tained and staccato movements
with equal dexterity. Doppman,
Olefsky and Canin wove their
superb talents into an auditory
tapestry.
Each musical thread main
tained its individuality, yet be
came inseperable intertwined
with the others. The audience
enjoyed their memorable per
formance so much that it was
