Elective abortion funds cut
Washington — HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano ordered an end to federal fund
ing for elective abortions yesterday after a
federal court cleared the way for him to
act.
"The department will provide federal
financial participation in the cost of abor
tions only where the attending physician
. . . has certified that the abortion is
necessary because the life of the mother
would be endangered if the fetus were
carried to term," he said in a prepared
statement.
HEW officials immediately began ar
rangements to inform state Medicaid
agencies, U.S. public health service hos
pitals and state medical societies of the
action.
The various states may decide on their
own whether to pay for abortions when
the life of the mother is not endangered.
Califano acted after U.S. District Judge
John Dooling lifted his prohibition
against enforcement of the so-called Hyde
amendment.
The law, which Congress voted last Oc
tober, forbids HEW from using federal
Medicaid money to pay for abortions that
are not necessary except to save another's
life.
I-Hotel tenants evicted
San Francisco — Sheriff's Deputies
forced their way through more than 1000
protestors yesterday in order to remove
the evicted tenants of the International
Hotel.
The evictions came after a nine-year
legal battle that has produced numerous
demonstrations.

The confrontation began shortly after
midnight when about 2000 de
monstrators — answering a "red alert"
put out by the tenants' organization —
congregated near the hotel.
At 3:07 a.m., police cordoned off sur
rounding streets.
"No evictions, we won't move"
changed the demonstrators as mounted
police tried to batter through the lines of
persons standing five deep, their arms
locked.
At 4:30 a.m., the deputies began carry
ing out the tenants, who went limp in the
classic pose of passive resistance
Undersheriff James Denman said eight
demonstrators were injured, none be
lieved seriously. Police said 19 arrests
were made, and one demonstrator was
booked for resisting arrest.
The tenants were taken away from the
building and left on a nearby street corner
while the owners of the hotel moved in
and began to board up doors and win
dows.
After the last tenants were out, the re
maining demonstrators, numbering sev
eral hundred, marched several blocks to
St. Mary's Park for a rally.
Telephone strike possible
Washington — A nationwide strike by
700,000 telephone workers Saturday is

almost inevitable, the chief union
negotiator said yesterday.
President Glenn Watts of the Com
munications Workers of America said
that bargaining has come to a standstill.
He said that time for the negotiations, re
cessed since Tuesday, is running out.
"I can see no way to avoid a strike un
less there is a dramatic break-through in
the next few hours, which I candidly do
not forsee," Watts told a news conference.
Current contracts with the Bell System
expire at midnight Saturday and the un
ions involved in the negotiations have
threatened a strike at 12:01 a.m. EDT
Sunday.
In addition to the CWA with its 500,000
members, the unions involved are the In
ternational Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, representing 120,000 workers,
and the Telecommunications Interna
tional Union with about 70,000 members.
Because the telephone system is highly
automated, a strike would not be ex
pected to have an immediate impact on
routine phone service. However, Watts
said it would cause serious problems with
callers needing operator assistance and in
the installation of new equipment plus
repairs.
A company spokesman said he is hope
ful a strike can be averted. The spokes
man, Charles Dynes, indicated Bell was
about to make a new offer to the union,
