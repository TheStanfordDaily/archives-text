Flames spurted from the
second-story window of an Es
condido Village apartment yes
terday afternoon in a fire which
did an estimated $10,000 worth
of damage, a fire official said.
The fire "totally gutted" one
bedroom and heat from the blaze
"severely damaged" another
bedroom in apartment 123 A, a
two-story dwelling on
Blackwelder Court, Palo Alto
Fire Department Battalion Chief
Ted Pearson said.
Flames also licked the ridge of
the wood-shingled roof, causing
slight damage, Pearson said.
The fire's cause is not known.
"We can't find a direct source,"
Pearson added.
Matilda Scaramucci, who
lives in the apartment, told fire
officials her 3-year-old daughter
informed her of the fire.
Scaramucci's husband Jose b a

graduate student in
engineering-economic sys
tems.
She said she climbed the stairs
and saw her daughter's book
shelves ablaze and smoke and
flames in the rest of the room.
She ran to her neighbors who
called the fire department.
Scaramucci said she had no
idea what started the fire.
"We don't smoke," she said.
Pearson said electrical prob
lems, light magnified through a
window or a child playing with
matches could have caused the
fire.
Pearson said the fire started in
the child's room either on the
bed or in the bookshelf area.
The fire department received
the call at 3:06 p.m. The fire was
under control in four minutes
and out in 15, Pearson said.
