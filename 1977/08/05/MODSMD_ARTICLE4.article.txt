# Graphology: 'you are your writing'
## 
### Cami Edlund 
On a whim, she sent a page of
her script to a handwriting
analysis firm that advertised in
the paper. The sample came back
with this report: "You'd be very
good at this.''
"This" is graphology, the
study of handwriting, and she is
Helen Dinklage — 30 years ago a
librarian, now a
graphotherapist.
One young Vietnam war vete
ran came to her for help; he
lacked stability and serenity. His
writing was hurried, uneven and
the spacing was irregular.
Dinklage's analysis: "The
tent-like t's showed client stub
bomess, the tiny writing of diffe
rent heights, feeling of inferiority
and inconsistencies in senti
ments."
After three diligent months of
writing pages of designs, the
word "monument" and quota
tions from Fromm's The Art of
Loving, he said, "1 have much
more confidence now."
Dinklage described him as
someone "who is busy being
born."
Another client is a junior high
school teacher who now begins
every class with form designs
Dinklage has given her. She has

been congratulated by the prin
cipal for having so few discip
line problems.
Graphotheraphy, or script
therapy, involves changing
handwriting to bring about
changes in your character.
Clients come to Dinklage with
samples of spontaneous writing.
From her analysis with the
psyuchogram, a circular graph
on which she scores various
components of the writing, she
can spot emotional problems
and insecurities.
She then develops unique
exercises, in the form of designs
and quotations from authors like
Fromm and Camus, for each
client to remedy the problems in
thefr characters that are reflected
in their writing.
She emphasizes that graphol
ogy is not a game. The warm
smile that plays across her face
fades as she criticizes the sen
sationalist books and articles on
graphology published recently.
Dinklage says the primary
traits analyzed in handwriting
are base line, pressure spacing,
slant and creativity.
These add up to create a
rhythm. She says, "You have to
I - retrace the writing
elf."

Illy, writing should flow

{apologizes for her writing,
g that it isn't very pretty.

But the precise, smooth, almost
Gothic script isn't unattractive.
She says she has changed her
own writing unconsciously
since becoming a graphologist.
"But," she says, "I've changed
too. I was bookish, not people
oriented at all."
After 15 years as a librarian,
she says,"I suddenly had a great
need to do something creative,
here I could work, more closely
with people where they live."
She laughs as she admits that
she is a typical Sagittarian, dri
ven by wanderlust. She has lived
"all across the United States —
from Florida to Maine, from
Kansas to California."
Loves it here
But, she says that has died
down with retirement, and the
four-year resident of Menlo Park
says she loves it here.
Her ideal is a university town
— Princeton is another favorite.
But, she says she likes Stanford
because she's a sun worshipper;
she couldn't stand British Col
umbia.

in handwriting analysis tomor

As her promotional brochure
says, "Your writing is you — you

On a whim, she sent a page of

analysis firm that advertised in

Helen Dinklage — 30 years ago a
librarian, now a
graphotherapist.
One young Vietnam war vete
ran came to her for help; he
lacked stability and serenity. His
writing was hurried, uneven and
the spacing was irregular.
Dinklage's analysis: "The
tent-like t's showed client stub
bomess, the tiny writing of diffe
rent heights, feeling of inferiority
and inconsistencies in senti
ments."
After three diligent months of
writing pages of designs, the
word "monument" and quota

more confidence now."
Dinklage described him as
someone "who is busy being
born."
Another client is a junior high
school teacher who now begins
every class with form designs
Dinklage has given her. She has

been congratulated by the prin

line problems.
Graphotheraphy, or script
therapy, involves changing
handwriting to bring about
changes in your character.
Clients come to Dinklage with
samples of spontaneous writing.
From her analysis with the
psyuchogram, a circular graph
on which she scores various
components of the writing, she
can spot emotional problems
and insecurities.
She then develops unique
exercises, in the form of designs
and quotations from authors like
Fromm and Camus, for each
client to remedy the problems in
thefr characters that are reflected
in their writing.
She emphasizes that graphol
ogy is not a game. The warm
smile that plays across her face
fades as she criticizes the sen
sationalist books and articles on
graphology published recently.
Dinklage says the primary
traits analyzed in handwriting
are base line, pressure spacing,
slant and creativity.
These add up to create a
rhythm. She says, "You have to
I - retrace the writing
elf."

g that it isn't very pretty.

But the precise, smooth, almost
Gothic script isn't unattractive.
She says she has changed her
own writing unconsciously
since becoming a graphologist.
"But," she says, "I've changed
too. I was bookish, not people
oriented at all."
After 15 years as a librarian,
she says,"I suddenly had a great
