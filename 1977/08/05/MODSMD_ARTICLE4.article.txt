# Graphology: 'you are your writing'
## 
### Cami Edlund 
On a whim, she sent a page of
her script to a handwriting
analysis firm that advertised in
the paper. The sample came back
with this report: "You'd be very
good at this.''
"This" is graphology, the
study of handwriting, and she is
Helen Dinklage â€” 30 years ago a
librarian, now a
graphotherapist.
One young Vietnam war vete

lacked stability and serenity. His
writing was hurried, uneven and
the spacing was irregular.

graphology published recently.
Dinklage says the primary

These add up to create a
rhythm. She says, "You have to
