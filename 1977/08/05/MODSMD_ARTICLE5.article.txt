Nolo contendere
The following statement was
read into the court records on
August 3, 1977:
I sat in at the Old Union to
protest U.S. complicity in a slave
system, to protest the Stanford
administration's abstention
from its responsibility to stand
— over one hundred years after
the Civil War — for the abolition
of slavery, and to publicize the
realities of the U.S.-supported
apartheid system.
I would like to exercise my
constitutional right to a fair jury
trial, but I do not expect justice
from this court.
Civil disobedience has been a
traditional extra-institutional
means of redressing wrongs and
awakening the public to injus
tice for over 300 years. We are no
more guilty than demonstrators
who fought for the abolition of
slavery, for women's rights and
women's suffrage, and for civil
rights in the 19605. What we did
was necessary and right, and
should incur no legal penalties.
Stanford's continuance of
legal prosecution of the 294 —
despite the trustees' belated at
tention to the issues we raised
and alleged appreciation of our
principled action, can only be
considered as a suppression of
free speech and free assembly
rights. Stanford's abstention on
South Africa has been seconded
by this courtroom's abstention
from considering the political
and moral issues in this case.
The court's insistance on ig
noring the relevance of our
motivations and the horrors of

apartheid — and focusing in
stead on the legal technicalities
of the charges against us — offers
us no justice. It is far easier to
arrest and try us as criminals,
than to try Stanford, U.S. corpo
rate capitalists and the racist
South African regime for the
continuance of apartheid.
What we did was right, and
should incur no legal penalties.
The fines and probation sen
tenced by this court are inap
propriate and unwarranted by
our action. I have been advised
that further trials in this case will
be punished by even more severe
penalties, if we are convicted, to
defray the costs of the trials. I
suggest that lesser fines and no
probation would defray the costs
to the taxpayers far more effec
tively and with far more justice.
I am convinced that a jury of
my peers would find us not
guilty — but I have less faith in
the judgment of a predomin
antly white, male, over 55-year
old jury instructed to ignore the
political issues of this case.
Because I signed a citation
when I was arrested. I expect to
incur no fine if I plead nolo con
tendere. Because I do not expect
to be tried with justice by a jury
of my peers — because I do not
anticipate beneficial effects on
Stanford, U.S. corporations or
South Africa from the results of a
trial — and because I cannot af
ford to pay a punitive fine for
exercising my right to a trial, I
submit to the coercion of this
court and enter a plea of no con
test.

legal prosecution of the 294 —
despite the trustees' belated at
tention to the issues we raised
and alleged appreciation of our
principled action, can only be
considered as a suppression of
free speech and free assembly
rights. Stanford's abstention on
South Africa has been seconded
by this courtroom's abstention
from considering the political
and moral issues in this case.
The court's insistance on ig
noring the relevance of our
motivations and the horrors of

apartheid — and focusing in
stead on the legal technicalities
of the charges against us — offers
us no justice. It is far easier to
arrest and try us as criminals,
than to try Stanford, U.S. corpo
rate capitalists and the racist
South African regime for the
continuance of apartheid.
What we did was right, and
should incur no legal penalties.
The fines and probation sen
tenced by this court are inap
propriate and unwarranted by
our action. I have been advised
that further trials in this case will
be punished by even more severe
penalties, if we are convicted, to
defray the costs of the trials. I
suggest that lesser fines and no
probation would defray the costs
to the taxpayers far more effec
tively and with far more justice.
I am convinced that a jury of
my peers would find us not
guilty — but I have less faith in
the judgment of a predomin
antly white, male, over 55-year
old jury instructed to ignore the
political issues of this case.
Because I signed a citation
when I was arrested. I expect to
incur no fine if I plead nolo con
tendere. Because I do not expect
to be tried with justice by a jury
of my peers — because I do not
anticipate beneficial effects on
Stanford, U.S. corporations or
South Africa from the results of a
trial — and because I cannot af
ford to pay a punitive fine for
exercising my right to a trial, I
submit to the coercion of this
court and enter a plea of no con
test.

Nolo contendere
The following statement was
read into the court records on
August 3, 1977:
I sat in at the Old Union to
protest U.S. complicity in a slave
system, to protest the Stanford
administration's abstention
from its responsibility to stand
— over one hundred years after
the Civil War — for the abolition
of slavery, and to publicize the
realities of the U.S.-supported
apartheid system.
I would like to exercise my
constitutional right to a fair jury
trial, but I do not expect justice
from this court.
Civil disobedience has been a
traditional extra-institutional
means of redressing wrongs and
awakening the public to injus
tice for over 300 years. We are no
more guilty than demonstrators
who fought for the abolition of
slavery, for women's rights and
women's suffrage, and for civil
rights in the 19605. What we did
was necessary and right, and
should incur no legal penalties.
