# Might makes right?

Until very recently in human history, the justice
of a cause or the correctness of a position was
determined by physical combat. "Might makes
right" was the prevailing philosophy, and the de
termining factor was a good sword arm.
Today this concept of "might makes right" lives
on, but the sword in the hand has been replaced by
the dollar in the pocket. Those with most dollars
have most power. Affluence is today's "might,"
and the affluent can bend "right" to accommodate
their desires and whims.
Nowhere is this more in evidence than in Con
gress' recent decision to withdraw tax support
from Medicaid abortions for poor women.
The champions of this decision exhibit a curious
blend of hypocrisy, illogic and affluent bias. Their
arguments are not only unconvincing, but are con
spicuously contrived to justify discrimination
against the poor.
They insist that they are not actually denying
abortions to the poor, since the right to an abortion
is constitutionally protected. But one supporter
spoke for many when he said, "We aren't saying
poor women can t have abortions. All we're saying
is that we (the affluent) don't have to pay for
them."
Now it has always been my understanding that
not being able to afford something is equivalent to
not having it. If you can't pay for an abortion, you
are still as pregnant as if no abortions were availa
ble.
The second argument used to justify the deci
sion deals with an acceptance of economic in
equality. This is one of President Jimmy Carter's
positions. He recently said that of course the weal
thy and middle class can afford many things the
poor cannot, but government doesn't have to
equalize this inequality.
Is the I resident ignorant of affirmative action
and integration programs? Aren't these examples
ot the states attempts to equalize economic in
equality between the poor and the affluent?
Other proponents of the abortion funding with
drawal make analogies between consumer goods
and abortions. "A rich woman can buy a new car.
Does that mean the government has to buy one for a
poor woman?"
Somehow, this example fails to convince me of
anything except the fact that American values
have been so warped by capitalism that life-and
death questions are reduced to the level of material

acquisition problems.
And so we come to "morality, inw
concept of "might makes right shows
clearly.
