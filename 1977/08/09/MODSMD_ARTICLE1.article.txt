Lutz, a member of Palo Alto
No-nukes which belongs to the
alliance said the protest was
against all nuclear power, but
said the Diablo Canyon plant
was especially dangerous be
cause it lies close to several ac
tive earthquake faults.
PG&E spokesman Fritz Drag
ger said the 2000-megawatt
plant will exceed all state and
federal safety standards. The
plant is 99.9 per cent ready for
operation and only awaits
licensing, he said. Because the
drought has decreased the out
put of PG&E's hydroelectric
plants, PG&E is planning to re
quest permission to begin opera
tion before the licensing process
is completed, he said.
Lutz, who was also arrested in
the May 9 sit-in at the Old Union,
said he is uncertain of the sen
tences he will receive if he is
convicted in both cases.
Drysdale said Municipal
Court judge Conklin requested a
500-word statement from him
suggesting the appropriate sanc
tion. Drysdale said he plans to
suggest a supervised work pro
ject with a community service
organization as his punishment.
Two Stanford professors,
Thomas Connolly, associate
chairman of the mechanical en
gineering department, and John
McCarthy, professor of compu
ter science, led a group of about
10 pro-nuclear power de

monstrators who carried signs
which said "Nuclear is natural"
and"The sun is a nuclear plant."
An anti-nuclear power
speaker received an ovation
from the crowd when he ret erred
to the signs. "Yes, the sun is a
nuclear plant, but it is what we
consider a sate distance away.
Lutz, said the Abalone Al
liance, which is patterned after
the Clamshell Alliance on the
East Coast, stresses mass nonvio
lent resistance to nuclear power.
The Clamshell Alliance oc
cupied the Seabrook, N.H. nuc
lear plant last May 1. I he occu
pation resulted in 1414 arrests
and the longest judicial tie-up in

the state's history.
Sunday's demonstration is a
prelude to future protests, Lutz
said. An extensive presentation
is planned for a "Disorientation
Week," sometime in the coming
academic year, he said. The oc
cupation Sunday consisted of
mainly area residents, Lutz said.
A much larger occupation is
planned for late 1977 or early
1978, he said.
Lutz said stopping the plant
and nuclear power would not be
easy. Only one nuclear plant has
been stopped after construction
had begun; it was in West Ger
many and involved a month
occupation by 25,000 persons.
