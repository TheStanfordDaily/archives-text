Works Volume One, especially
Emerson's "Piano Concerto
Number One." Emerson, how
ever. carried off the piece ably,
often picking up sections on the
keyboard which were meant for
horns or strings.
Lake was less hindered by the
lack of the orchestra, choosing
"C'est La Vie," "Lucky Man"
and "Still You Turn Me On" for
his solo session. He Accom-

Early in the show, his hand-held synthesizer turned
into a piece ofartillary sending forth its fireworks into
the audience

panied himself on acoustic
guitar, as he did through the
majority ot the concert.
Palmer's shining moment
came during the group's perfor
mance ot "Tank.' As Lake and
Emerson left the stage, Palmer's
eleven-drum, five-cymbal set,
complete with high hat, tympani
and gongs, came to life. The set
was mounted atop a circular
chrome platform and was ac
cented by colored lights and
whirling strobes in the base.
The absence of the orchestra

resulted in a more explosive per
formance by the group, typified
by the antics of Emerson. Early
in the show, his hand-held
synthesizer turned into a piece
of artillary, sending forth its
fireworks into the audience.
Later, during the group's per
formance of "Pictures at an
Exhibition," Emerson's compu
ter console/synthesizer was de
tonated and went up in a smoke

filled explosion.
As ELP played their encore,
Aaron Copeland's "Fanfare for
the Common Man," Emerson
proceeded to jump over and atop
one keyboard and then pulled it
down on top of himself.
He continued to play in this
position and finished it off by
whirling the keyboard about like
a top and kicking it over.
Needless to say, the crowd
greatly appreciated Emerson's
athletic endeavors.

Palmer's shining moment
came during the group's perfor
mance ot "Tank.' As Lake and
Emerson left the stage, Palmer's
eleven-drum, five-cymbal set,
complete with high hat, tympani
and gongs, came to life. The set
was mounted atop a circular
chrome platform and was ac
cented by colored lights and
whirling strobes in the base.
The absence of the orchestra

resulted in a more explosive per

by the antics of Emerson. Early

synthesizer turned into a piece

fireworks into the audience.
Later, during the group's per
formance of "Pictures at an
Exhibition," Emerson's compu

tonated and went up in a smoke

filled explosion.
As ELP played their encore,
Aaron Copeland's "Fanfare for
the Common Man," Emerson
proceeded to jump over and atop
one keyboard and then pulled it
down on top of himself.
He continued to play in this
position and finished it off by
whirling the keyboard about like
a top and kicking it over.
Needless to say, the crowd
greatly appreciated Emerson's
athletic endeavors.
