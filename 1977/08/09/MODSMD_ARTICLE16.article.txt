Notes on Broadway/Paul Miller

A while back, when I saw the
members of the original Chorus
Line in New York, I wasn't sure if
the show's success rode on the
terrific cast or the tremendous
parts themselves.
At a second viewing of the
show in San Francisco, I found
out: it is the roles and what parts
they are.
The San Francisco (national
touring) company has the same
inspired approach. I could find
little to fault by this tremendous
show. A Chorus Line still is
Broadway.
The dancing is superb, the

singing is marvelous, the acting
is sufficient and the lighting —
oh, that lighting! Tharon Mus
ser's Tony Award winning col
lection of various colors lighting
upthe stage and dancing mirrors
is stunning.
One fault I might point out,
not in the show, but in the acous
tics of the Curran Theatre: the
sound doesn't flow very well.
I can't tell you what parts
and/or actors stand out: because
all the parts and performers
stand out. Each actor is given
such a tremendous and equally
interesting and entertaining role
it is just a joy trip.
The show is still packing the
Shubert Theatres in both New
York and Los Angeles, and the
Drury Lane in London. It shows
no signs of letting up. Will it
ever? I doubt it.
Broadway's continuing box
office champ, A Chorus Line
since its Broadway opening two
years ago, has raised its evening
orchestra price from $15 to
$17.50 along with the other
prices.
The 1976-77 legitimate theatre
had a record-breaking season tor
the second year in a row, shatter
ing the previous mark set last
year.
The total box office gross re
ceipt for Broadway and the road
companies combined came to

$176,033,391, which was a 62
per cent increase over last year's
record — $123,429,723. The
gross receipt on Broadway alone
was $93,406,082, a 33 per cent
increase over the 75-76 season's
$70,841,738.
Another main reason for the
great year was the quality of the
shows. Joining such previous
season holdovers as A Chorus
Line, The Wiz, Grease, Equus,
Same Time, Next Year, and
Shenandoah, all with current
touring companies, were this
season's hits — Annie, For Col
ored Girls Who 1 lave Considered
Suicide/When The Rainbow Is
Enuf, Side by Side by Sondheini,
Sly Fox, The Shadow Box.
Otherwise Engaged and the revi
vals of The King and I and Oh!
Calcutta!
Annie, A Chorus Line, The
King and 1 and Grease are con
stant sellouts.
