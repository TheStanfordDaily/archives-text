The octopus gets pissed off at
the high-speed offshore drilling,
and decides to show its ecologi
cal concern by eating small help
less children. Also beautiful
women. Also an old wino, but
that may have been a mis
take. . . .
So anyway, the octopus goes
around eating peopleout of cribs
and out of small, helpless boats,
but then it decides that that's not
enough, so it eats the wife ot the
killer-whale trainer at a certain
prominent sea-show operation
in San Diego. Not a good idea.
The killer whale trainer gets
even by having his killer whales,
who are more human than most
people he knows, ripthe octopus
into little pieces. . . .
But wait. The investigative re
porter in the small town north of
San Diego where this picture
takes place is sick and tired,
goddammit, and he's not going
to trike it any more. So he tells off
the two-bit mayor and threatens
to take the film to all-new post-
Watergate era heights. But they
drop him about half way through
the movie (or maybe he gets et —
I can't remember) and nothing
happens. So never mind. . . .

That was tentacles — starring
John Huston as the investigative
reporter ("My nose is read, the
screen is green and that corpse is
a vivid blue"), Shelly Winters as
the grief-stricken mother ("O my
God, Billy. Billy? Oh MY
GOD!"). Henry Fonda as who
knows what, and somebody else
a.s the killer whale trainer (don't
remember, but it's just as well —
he sucked). I saw it at the drive
in last week with Food ol the
Gods, which is undoubtedly the
second-worst movie in the his
tory ot cinema — just behind
Tentacles.
Tentat les has first place
sewed up, though. In addition to
having the worst dialogue
("Only one thing could do this
kind of damage, Bud. Do you
mean . . . killer shark'. 1 ' No, Bud, I
mean . . . GIANT OG
TOPUS. . ."). the worst acting
("Oh my God. Billy Billy? Oh
MY GOD!"), and the worst plot
line on record, it has some un
derwater camerawork that
makes Lloyd Bridges look like
Jaqueline Bisset. . . .
Still, I could be wrong. We
were parked next to the Manson
family (surely the bodies and
munitions were in the back of
their van) and they thought it
was great — particularly the part
in Food where the giant rats
nourished by an ethereal pus
seeping out of the ground near
an isolated country larm ate the

isolated country farmer out of
his isolated country Volkswa
gen. Also the part where the old
lady is attacked by foot-long
poisonous biting worms. The
Manson family liked that part.
Dwarf
1 he people on the other side of
us liked it too. and that was re
(illy strange. They looked like a
normal, clean-cut, all American
fascist, NO-on-14 family to me —
but that was clearly impossible.
What kind of parent would take
his scar-for-lifeable young tots to
see this kind of thing? 1 mean,
shit, they could have gone to see
Black Sunday, orSinbad and the
Eye of the Dwarf, or something
edifying like that. These people
obviously had hidden vices
probably took the kids here be
cause it was too expensive to
leave them in the dryer. . . .
Unsuspecting
But that's not what I want to
talk about. I want to talk about
the Drive-in-Ethos, as it were,
w hic.h is to say the larger, more
unifying wholeness of entity
that distinguishes the institution
from swap meets and Billy
(»raham spectaculars. I want to
discuss the ways in which one
can enjoy a night at the Drive-In
Movies even if the movies bite,

and even if no one around you
feels like being raped and plun
dered. . . .
I bet you didn't think I was
going to bring that up. You were
wrong. I am aware ot the vis< eral
realities that come as part and
parcel of such excursions, and it
I hadn't been when we started
out my photographer and his
girlfriend were more 1 than wil
ling to remind me.
The thing is. I discovered long
ago (right atter getting gum in
Debbie Si rewbee's hair when
going for second base back in the
eighth grade, to be exact) th.it
there are other things to do .it the
Drive-In. (Jo for a walk, for in
stance — if there are other sc
reens (most Drive-Ins these days
have at least three) you can
watch film clips from the Bruce
Lee movie behind you, or ride on
the swing sets with unsuspect
ing young children ("Here Kid.
