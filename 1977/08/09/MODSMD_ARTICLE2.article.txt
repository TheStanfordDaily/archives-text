# Arson claimed in USE dispute

### George Anders 
Computer Operator William
karns, whose parked motorcycle
was set ablaze Sunday night,
said the burning was an attempt
to intimidate him.
karns has been accepting lead
operator assignments this
month under a job classification
scheme instituted bv the Univer
sity July 25. United Stanford
Employees (USE) opposes the
plan.
USE reporter Bob Britton said
"there wasn't any union in
volvement. The union doesn't
encourage anyone to violate the
law." Britton said the burning
may have been performed by a
union member acting on his
own, or by a member of Univer
sity management.
When asked if he thought the

burning represented an effort to
intimidate him, karns said
"Yes." Stanford Public Safety of
ficers are looking for a suspect,
karns said yesterday afternoon.
The vehicle was parked be
hind facilities of the Stanford
Center for Information Proces
sing, in Encina Hall.
karns said he put out the fire
within 30 seconds after it
started, and incurred $25 to $50
in damages. A security guard
brought the matter to his atten
tion, and he left his work station
to examine his motorcycle and
then put out the fire, he said.
Yesterday, the University filed
an unfair labor practice charge
with the National Labor Rela
tions Board (NLRB) asserting
that USE is violating the no
strike provision of the October
197fi contract between the Uni
versity and USE.
According to the charge, the
violation arises because USE has
threatened to fine or expel from
the union those members who
accept lead operator assign
ments under the new system.
USE has developed a series of
"shop rules," Britton said,
which, among other things, urge
computer operators not to coop
erate with management beyond
the minimum requirements of
their jobs "during this period of
crisis."
The rules state that blatant dis
regard of them "could be consi
dered gross disloyalty," Britton
said.
Fines and expulsion are pos
sible punishments for gross dis
loyalty, he said.
Jim Berk, chief steward for
USE, called the NI.RB charge
"harassment" and "fluff in the
wind."
