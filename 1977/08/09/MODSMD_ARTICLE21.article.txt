# Chez Yvonne/George Anders
## Service mars fine food 
### 
Given the immense difficul
ties of trying to operate a quality
French restaurant on El Camino
Real, Chez Yvonne does an ad
mirable job.
In fact, if it weren't for the
questionable service, one could
hardly fault the Mountain View
restaurant.
The food is uniformly excel
lent and skillfully prepared.
Candlelight, red tablecloths and
numerous paintings make for an
elegant, yet subdued decor.

The menu features a respecta
ble assortment of French dishes,
with only a few American ones
to round out the selection.
(However, one does wonder
about the wisdom of listing "Le
Beef Bourgoignon," when "Beef
Burgundy" or "Boeuf Bourgoig
non" would seem more consis
tent.)
Regardless of the name, the
beef merited its $H. 75 purchase
price. The tender meat was
pampered with a well-balanced
sauce. The entree was served
separately from rice and vegeta
bles, in proper French style.
Some of the other service
might have been more approp
riate for a Howard Johnson's.
Silverware was placed
haphazardly, defying common
sense as well as etiquette. An ex
quisitely seasoned Terrine de
Pate Maison was clumsily
served, with part of the terrine
ending up on the tablecloth.
The menu did not include an
inserted sheet listing the spe

cials of the day; rather, the wait
ress thrust a chalkboard listing
the specials in front of us before
we had time to peruse the menu.
Nonetheless, the service was
generally prompt and friendly,
even if it lacked the flair one ex
pects from a French restaurant.
Our other entree, a Crepe
Normande, was equally good. It
contained a generous amount of
shrimp and crab and was co
vered with a cream sauce that
enhanced the seafood, rather
than overwhelming it.
Meals included either a small
seafood plate or spaghetti as ap
petizers. Both were quite re
spectable. Desserts all cost at
least an additional dollar. A
strawberry tart war somewhat
sweet, but well-prepared, with
an excellent custard layer.
Except for the service then,
Chez Yvonne lives up to the high
standards one associates with
French restaurants. Only in that
one area does a trace of El
Camino show through.
