Fire rages in Big Sur
Carmel — The Big Sur fire, which had
burned over 77.000 acres by dawn, was
termed "extremely critical" yesterday as
a crucial strategy shift was made in an
effort to keep the inferno from advancing
into the valuable Carmel River watershed.
The U.S. Forest Service announced the
strategy shift of men and equipment from
the southern perimeter of the blaze to the
northeastern portion and warned that the
fire, the biggest in California, could dou
ble in size as a result.
"1 have had to make some decisions
today that were not easy but essential to
protect the high priority watershed."
Myron Lee. the fire boss, said at headquar
ters in King City.
Officials said the watershed affected
the entire Salinas-Carmel Valley area.
That means that tens of thousands of
people are threatened with a drying up of
their water source.
Brian Barrette. a forestry department
spokesman, said $154 million in
watershed had been damaged in the Big
Sur fire in and around the hugh federal
preserve called the Ventana YVilderness
Area.
The cost of suppressing the fire to date
is around $2.24 million, with 3100
firefighters pressed into action.
PLO might concede
Taif, Saudi Arabia — U.S. officials
traveling with Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance said they had received word that
the Palestine Liberation Organization
might be willing to recognize Israel.
Vance was meeting with King Khaled
yesterday and officials in his delegation

said they had received indirect word the
PLO might accept a modified form of U.N.
Resolution 242. which tacitly recognizes
Israel's right to exist.
The informants said however, there is
"nothing firm" yet. "We are seeking
clarification." said one official.
The officials gave no further detail on
how these contacts were established, but
PLO chief Yasir Arafat has shadowed
Vance on almost every stop of his Mideast
trip, showing up in Arab capitals a day
before or after the American.
It was reported Sunday that the PLO
wants to have the resolution reworded to
recognize Palestinian rights to a home
land. As now worded, the resolution, pas
sed in 1967 with U.S. backing, simply
calls for a "just settlement of the refugee
problem."
Second passage of a reworded resolu
tion would firmly commit the United Na
tions and the United States to a Palesti
nian homeland.
In Beirut, a PLO representative said the
organization has not informed the Carter
administration of any change in its op
position to Resolution 242.
Mt. Usu erupts
Tokyo — A volcano erupted Sunday in
northern Japan, sending a column of
smoke nearly 40,000 feet in the air, pelt
ing a jetliner with rocks that cracked
cockpit windows and spraying ash and

debris over a 24-mile area.
Police on Japan's northernmost main
island of Hokkaido ordered 20,000
tourists and 5000 area residents to take
shelter at schools and other public
facilities. No casualties were reported.
The Japanese Meterological Agency
said the 237H-foot twin-peaked Mt. Usu
erupted twice within three hours Sunday,
sending a column of gray smoke 39,360
feet into the air.
Hokkaido officials estimated damage to
nearby cornfields, nearly ready for har
vest, at about $11.3 million.
The meteorological agency said it was
the first majoreruption of Mt. Usu in more
than three decades. It said the 1332-foot
Mt. Showa Shinia Shinzan was created
near Mt. Usu in major eruptions in 1943-
45.
AMA warns about laetrile
Chicago — The American Medical As
sociation says laetrile, heralded by advo
cates as an effective anti-cancer treatment
and damned by opponents as worthless,
should be kept out of the reach of children
because it is poisonous.
In the current issue of the AMA's jour
nal. three physicians cited an 11-year-old
child who died of cyanide poisoning after
swallowing between one and five laetrile
tablets.
