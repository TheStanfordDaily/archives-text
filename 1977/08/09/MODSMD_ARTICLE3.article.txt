Two more South Africa pro

terday to no contest, bring i ng t he
total number of demonstrators
who have settled their cases to
7H.
Donald McClintock and Ste
ven Mentor both pleaded no con
test to the charge of failure to
disperse on the order of a police
officer. McClintock was fined
$65 and Mentor was assigned 50
hours ot volunteer labor in lieu
of the fine. Moth also received six

months probation.
The failure to disperse charge
was one of three misdemeanor
charges filed against each of the
294 protesters who were arrested
for sitting-in at Old Union May
9.
Three other defendants asked
for continuances and had their
trial date rescheduled for Oc
tober 3. The three were Mark
Mueller, Donald Lyons and
Stuart O/.er.
Some of the 216 de
monstrators who have yet to go
to trial are expected to ask for

continuances so that a third trial
can take place in the fall
According to kim McCall, one
of the 294 protesters arrested,
whether or not a trial takes place
in the fall is still undecided, fol
lowing a meeting of the protes
ters last Wednesday night,
McCall said that there were
"strong opinions on both sides
and a lot of people (were) fairly
evenly divided between recom
mending we have another trial
and recommending that we
don't."
