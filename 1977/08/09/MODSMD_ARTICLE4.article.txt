# Nickel Brigade
## 
### 
Area consumer advocates,
supported by President Carter,
Ralph Nader and a coalition of
business and labor leaders, are
massing in California's 12th
Congressional District to fight
for the creation of a federal
Agency for Consumer Protec
tion.
The Consumer Nickel Brigade
marks the first time a coalition of
farmer, business, labor and con
sumer leaders have travelled to
local communities to organize
voters into a lobbying force. The
coalition has targetted the 12th
District because its Con
gressman. Rep. Paul McCloskey,
is opposing the creation of a
strong consumer-oriented
branch of the federal govern
ment.
The local consumer coalition
hopes to mount a successful
publicity campaign here in one
of the most politically charged
Congressional districts, to urge
constituents to shower McClos
key with mail urging him to re
turn to his once pro-consumer
posture.
At tables throughout the dis
trict in Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
Sunnyvale, Mountain View and
other cities, the Nickel Brigade
will ask residents to send a nic
kel to McCloskey — indicating
that consumers, too, can lobby
Washington legislators.
"It will cost the average
American only about five cents
each to create a consumer voice
within federal agencies," Nader
said. "The nickel and letter
campaign is our way to get the

attention — and the vote — ot
those wavering representatives
who will decide the fate of the
bill (to create the Agency for
Consumer Protection). Let big
business spend mil lions on mas
sive lobbying and full-page ads.
Consumers will spend nickels to
make their power felt."
The Nickel Brigade hopes to
spark hundreds of letters to each
Congressman in four other
California districts where sup
port is crucial.
But the biggest thrust will be
in the 12th District where
McCloskey first supported, then
voted against the creation of the
Agency for Consumer Protec
tion. It is here that the coalition
hopes to ignite a flood of
thousands of letters and nickels.
The Consumer Nickel Brigade
is working with other supporters
of the bill, including President
Carter, Vice-President Mondale,
Speaker O'Neil, Majority Leader
Wright and California Sen. Alan
Cranston, in pressing for a suc
cessful floor vote in the near fu
ture.
In addition to consumers, the
bill is supported by many major
corporations, who contend the
agency will improve the quality
of goods and services to the con
sumer rather than be an enemy of
big business.
