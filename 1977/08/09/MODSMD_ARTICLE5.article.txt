Recycling center
I have been disappointed to read about the eviction of the recycl
ing operation on campus, and I hope another suitable location is
found promptly. While I have no basis on which to judge the com
plaints concerning traffic and unsightliness, 1 would want to take
exception to the argument that this is "an inappropriate use of land."
The recycling operation is not only a convenience to the campus
community and a sensible project in and of itself. It also reveals —
and encourages — attitudes which reflect a sense of social responsi
bility and an effort to translate them into constructive action. It is, in
other words, precisely the sort of thing that a university community
would want to encourage and support. Let us not let it get bogged
down in bureaucratic chicanery!
