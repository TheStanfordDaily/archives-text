# The
						role of dissent

Dissent in the last decade began as a small flame,
rapidly grew into a wildfire, and threatened to
bum away the false sense of security and ease that
goes under the name of "The American Dream."
There were martyrs, bloodied heads and corp
ses. There were riots, marches, clarion calls for
equal rights and liberty for all U.S. citizens. There
were vigils, protests, crowded jails overflowing
with those who dared to shout "NO!" to U.S.
policies, both foreign and domestic.
Where are the voices of dissent now? The echoes
from the last decade have been muffled by the
intervening years. Those few who now agitate for
social justice are forced to stand in horror as their
rights are eroded by the courts, legislatures and
electorates of the land.
Concessions made by government, like affirma
tive action, are being rescinded. Future protec
tions, like the ERA, are being systematically re
jected.
This decade of the '70s is seeing "a return to
normalcy." The government and the public at
large are weary of the voices of dissent, tired of
criticism which strikes too close to the truth to be
comfortably dismissed.
Much more desirable than remaining attentive
after the rude a wakening of the '60s, this country is
again going to sleep — to dream — to regain its
dream of contentment, which ignores the fact that
the urban poverty pockets are again festering; that
human rights are being voted away; that the needs
of the minority are being suppressed so the major
ity may indulge in self-satisfied repose.
1 he great fire of dissent has gone out. Only a few
embers remain. What are left are crushed under the
governmental heel when sighted.
Yes the burning roar of protest has subsided.
I tie Vietnam issue was resolved by ending the
war. Deprived of this obvious focal point, the op
ponents of militarism became confused, lost their
voices.
Racial inequality was resolved by affirmative
action, just long enough to lull protestors into
thinking equality was finally becoming in
stitutionalized through "proper" Establishment
channels. Civil rights activists began to relax, their
tatal error — for now that affirmative action is
emg successfully undermined, the protestors are

no longer unified or sufficiently organize
launch a successful counteraction.
