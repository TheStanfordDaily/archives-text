Climbing stairs
s Terman showed me with
earound his beautiful home,
s amazed to discover that a
'ear-old man would take
Bot the stairs two at a time.

He stood over six feet

countenance.
\ 'lis own count, he is the

r .man graduated from Stan
ln vvith degrees in
lls 'ry and electrical en-

gineering. He earned his docto
rate in electrical engineering at
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1924, and re
turned here as an instructor in
1925.
The Klystron tube
Erom that point he rose, in 12
years, to head the Electrical En
gineering Department. Under
his administrative guidance the
department became one of the
two or three finest in the nation.
During that period, the Klystron
tube was developed by the Yar
ian brothers, and it became the
basis for radar in World War I.
I was led into a study lined
vvith books. Five shelves were
required to hold the books he,
his wife and his father have writ
ten.
Some of the books Terman
wrote have been translated into
Russian, Japanese. Korean.
Polish and Spanish.
Terman's deceased wife Sibyl
was interested in reading dis
abilities in children. She co
authored books on the subject
with her younger brother
Charles Walcutt.
IQ test
Terman's father Lewis was in
volved in both the schools of
education and psychology here.
Lewis Terman developed the
famed Stanford-Binet Intelli
gence Test, and the Stanford
Achievement Test.
"My father understood the
University and what counted. I
learned a lot. I knew when I was
an undergraduate what counted
in a university and in a profes
sor." Terman said.
1 was shown Terman's main
study, and the man who was
once dean of the School of En
gineering, and provost and
vice-president of the University

motioned me to sit down.
Terman does know what
counts in creating a superlative
engineer: intelligence and im
agination.
'Rise to the top'
"There are some people that
rise to the top, wherever you put
them. People like that come
along. (William) Hewlett and
(David) Packard were unusual. It
is remarkable the way they grew
as they gained experience,"
Terman said.
Hewlett and Packard, the two
principle donors of the new
Terman Building on campus,
were students of Terman in the
19305. Hewlett used to "play
around and build things" in
Terman's makeshift attic
laboratory.
"Hewlett could get more tools
dull in a single afternoon than
the rest of the students would
together in an entire week,"
Terman said. "He had great
energy and not much finesse."
Packard was the best student
in the School of Engineering,
Terman said, and a talented
athlete as well. He was hired by
General Electric after graduat
ing, but Terman lured him back
here "for further study" and ar
ranged fora half-time job at $55 a
month for nine months.
After returning
Within two weeks after return
ing. Packard agreed to go into
business with Hewlett. With
Terman urging them on. they set
up a partnership in an old gar
age.
They had only one product, an
oscillator Hewlett had designed.
If business was good, Terman re
calls, the car would be parked in
front. If business was slow, Pac
kard's car was in the garage.
The first year's net profit was

$1653, Terman said as he pulled
the records out of his file cabinet.
Terman interrupted the inter
view several times to display the
various works that his students
have produced, and that he has
edited.
Today, Hewlett-Packard is the
world's largest manufacturer of
electronic measuring instru
ments, with annual sales of $100
million."And Fred Terman,"
Packard once said, "is the daddy
of the whole works."
'More credit'
Although Terman admits that
he helped such companies as

Watkins-Johnson and Hewlett-
Packard get started, he modestly
says that there is a "tendency to
give me much more credit for
building up industry in the area
than 1 deserve."
Terman said he helped instill
a "help each other attitude" in
the fledgling companies. He en
couraged them to build up the
area, and to cooperate with one
another in doing so.
It was important to recruit en
gineers from other areas, and not
to steal nearby companies' men.
Terman said.
