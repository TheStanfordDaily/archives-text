# Over intelligence interpretation
## Turner: I won't be czar 
### Bruce Charonnat 
CIA Director S tans field
Turner vowed not to become a
"czar J ' over intelligence in
terpretation in a speech last Fri
day. President Jimmy Carter last
week gave Turner full responsi
bility over all of the nation's in
telligence activities.
Turner, however, made no re
ference to information collec
tion. the other aspect of intelli
gence. The powers given to
Turner as director of central in
telligence includeauthority over

both facets.
Claiming that the CIA is
"opening up," Turner described
the agency's efforts to expand
media coverage, citing a visit by
cameras of the television show
60 Minutes. He also said the
agency will downgradeand pub
lish more documents than in the
past.
To support his claims, Turner
pointed out that recent dis
coveries in CIA archives con
cerning the agency's 'use of
drugs on unknowing subjects

had been made public last week.
The documents had not been
found during a congressional
investigation two years ago. but
were now being used, according
to Turner, to "track down and
notify the human guinea pigs."
Turner also detailed measures
taken by Carter to insure strin
gent overseeing of the nation's
intelligence community. The
president has set up a three
member committee to monitor
intelligence activities, to which
appeals may be sent. The com
mittee's mail will not be cen
sored, Turner said, and the
group will report directly to the
president.
Turner said, though, that the
agency was also tightening up
secrecy on classified informa
tion. The agency "cannot, and
will not, open up everything,"
and "must ask. and obtain, that
level of secrecy which is neces
sary."
Turner announced that a re
port will be made public this
week that details problems the
Soviet economy will be ex
periencing in the next decade.
He said the CIA estimates "that
Soviet production of oil will fall
markedlyinabout 1980. . . .This
will have a major impact on the
world's economy."
He pointed out that the
Soviets' problems are based in
part on the country's oil prob
lems and also because of "de
mographic factors which are
going to slow the rate of growth
of their labor force."
Turner spoke before 450 per
sons at the Commonwealth Club
in San Francisco.
