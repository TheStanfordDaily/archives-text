Wilkinson, a 34-year-old
electrical contractor, has been
Imperial Wizard of the Invisi
ble Empire of the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan (one of sev

years.
He said he joined the Klan
because of the "moral de

According to Wilkinson, the
reason for the decline is "the
increasing arrogance ot the
Negro as he gains in wealth
and importance."
Wilkinson said the Klan
aims to exclude blacks, Jews
and the foreign-born from the

"repatriating" blacks to Af

explained. "Klan members are

Wilkinson would not disclose

He also would not speak at

He admitted there is a possi

The Klan climaxed their
weekend activities with a tradi

Saturday night in a nearby park.
While Wilkinson said he ex

"People are still prejudiced
against the Klan," Wilkinson
explained. "Klan members are
afraid that they might lose their
jobs if their identity were
known, so they put on the
robes."
Wilkinson would not disclose
precisely how many members
the Klan now claims in Califor
nia. He says it would be a "tacti
cal error" to publicize the
strength of his "invisible army."
He also would not speak at
length about the possibility of a
Klan "offensive" in the near fu
ture, except to say he wants his
"recruits" to be "level-headed
men who are not afraid of vio
lence."
He admitted there is a possi
bility of "aggressive action" by
the Klan if the Carter administra
tion continues to oppose it.
The Klan climaxed their
weekend activities with a tradi
tional cross-burning ceremony
Saturday night in a nearby park.
While Wilkinson said he ex
pected "hundreds" to attend,
only about 80 Klansmen and
supporters showed up.
