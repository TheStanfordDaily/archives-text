not his Beloved but instead the

Monty Python assaults Jah
berwocky with the same pun

propelled The Holy Grail and
with equal success. As usual
they have spared none of their
black humor.
The best thing you can say
about a farce is that it is funny,
right? Well, this one is funny.
I've sworn not to give away the
jokes, so don't believe me. . .you
will have to see it for yourself.

Don't run into The Last He
make of Beau Geste expecting to
fall from your seat in bellylaugh
delirium. That was my mistake
and the movie was the worse for
disappointed expectation. But if
you see it with an open mind,
you might find it diverting or
even funny.
Marty Feldman, Mel Brooks's
walleyed sidekick, directed,
produced, wrote and stars in

Last Remake, adding another
name to the list of do-it-a 11 -
yourself comedians. Too bad he
does not measure up to the com
pany.
The film's fatal flaw is too
damned much self
consciousness. Proclaiming it
self a "remake", it proceeds to
run off a long series of movie
cliches that turn on themselves,
go flat, and extend ad nauseum
into banality. They are supposed
to make us laugh. Sorry to say
they don't.
The vehicle for all this is an
elaborate attempt by brothers
Digbv and Beau Geste to protect
the priceless family jewel from
the greedy clutches of step
mother, Anne Margaret. Identi
cal twins Digby and Beau, inci
dentally, are played by Feldman
and Michael York, which is one
of the funnier gags.
Feldman seems afflicted with
that awful comic disease
wherein the comedian thinks a
joke amusing once is hysterical
twice. Further, certain vaudevil
lean white elephants stultify the
film. First, Feldman falls into the
mud; then Henrv Gibson bares

his bum; and F'eter Ustinov
looses his peg leg, all of which
elicit from the audience, except
the kiddies up front, sardonic
snorts.
There are bright spots how
ever. Spike Milligan, playing an
aged butler, gets some of the best
bits, effective because they are
offhand enough to surprise us,
and Ted "Lurch" Cassidy de
serves honorable mention as a
blind French legionnaire who is
also the troop's cook. Finally,
there is a crazed dance of the
legionnaires complete with
overhead shots a hi June Taylor
Dancers.
Somehow, Feldnian hooked a
stand of otherwise respectable
actors, to whom the film does lit
tle justice or they it tor that mat
ter. If anything, Last Remake de
stroys the myth that any Briton
with buggy eyes and crooked
gaze has to be funnier than a
room full of nitrous oxide. We'll
just lay that one to rest.
