Assembly overrides Brown
Sacramento — The state Assembly yes
terday narrowly overruled Gov. Jerry
Brown's veto of a new California death
penalty bill.
The bill initially passed the Assembly
by a vote of 54 to 23 in May. Gov. Jerry
Brown then vetoed the death penalty as
"a matter of conscience."
The state Senate voted in June to enact
the death penalty over Brown's veto, and
a two-thirds vote in the Assembly was
necessary to override it.
The veto was overruled by the bare
minimum of a two-thirds majority vote in
the Assembly.
California's previous death penalty
statue was ruled unconstitutional last
year by the state Supreme Court. The
measure now under consideration at
tempts to correct the procedural flaws
cited by the court.
'Son of Sam' caught
New York Police have captured the
man they believe to be the .44-caliber kil
ler known as "Son of Sam."
The arrest came as David Berkowitz, 24,
a postal worker, left his apartment house
Wednesday night in suburban Yonkers
and encountered police, who had staked
out the building.
Police said that as Berkowitz stepped
into his car, they asked him who he was,

and Berkowitz replied, "I'm Son of Sam.
Okay, you've got me." He offered no resis
tance.
"We have him," a police aide to Ist
Deputy Police Commissioner James
Taylor told reporters later.
At an afternoon news conference,
Police Commissioner Michael Codd said
that Berkowitz had been an auxiliary New
York policeman between 1970 and 1973
and been trained by the police in "law
and unarmed defense," but had not been
given firearms training. Berkowitz served
three years in the Army.
Police said they seized two shotguns in
his seventh-floor apartment and a .44-
caliber Charter Arms Bulldog revolver
Berkowitz carried with him as he entered
his car outside his apartment. They said
he also carried a brown bag with two
dozen bullets and a poem.
Ballistic tests early yesterday con
firmed the revolver was the same one
used in many of the "Son of Sam" attacks.
The poem found in the bag described
the death of a young woman — ". . .And
huge drops of lead poured down upon her

head until she was dead. . .
Police were led to Berkowitz by a ticket
written for parking too near a fire hydrant.
The ticket was issued the night Stacy
Moskowitz and Robert Violante were
shot, in the neighborhood of the shooting.
