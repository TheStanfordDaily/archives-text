# Rep. McCloskey terms consumer bill 'absurd'
## 
### 
Creating a Consumer Protec
tion Agency that could sue other
agencies would be "absurd on its
face," Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park| declared Wednes
day evening in Palo Alto.
An administration-backed bill
already passed by the House
would create a Consumer Protec
tion Agency (CPA) which could
sue other agencies. McCloskey
said he will be introducing a
substitute bill which eliminates
the suing privilege.
Such suing would "add to the
cost of administering the gov
ernment of the United States an
untold sum," McCloskey said.
"No agency, present or ever, has
had the power to sue other agen
cies."
McCloskey discussed the na
ture of a possible consumer
agency (CPA) with constituents
and Roy Riesling, president of
the Consumer Federation of
California, during a forum out
side the California Ave. Co-op
market.
Riesling, arguing for the ad
ministration bill, said suing was
"a sticky point," but said it
would be necessary for the
agency to be effective.
McCloskey's bill "is a lauda
ble attempt at conciliation." he
said, "but it is lacking any of the
viable and durable constituency
that the agency would need to be
a success."
McCloskey said his bill will
differ from the administration
bill in three other ways. He said
his will abolish all existing fed
eral consumer agencies, but
noted that President Jimmy Car

ter has already agreed to such a
provision.
McCloskey said his bill will
also eliminate exemptions for
labor and agricultural practices.
The labor exemption in particu
lar "is a prostitution, a political
compromise to get labor support
for the bill," he said.
The nature of a CPA would be
"almost entirely a function of
who the first head was," Riesl
ing said.
He noted that a consumer
agency bill has been considered
by Congress since 1<17(). "It one
had been passed five years ago,"
he said, "its impact would have

been disastrous."
If the Carter bill becomes law,
Riesling said, it would create an
agency with about 200 employes
and a budget of about $15 mill
ion a year. "That's not an organi
zation that would take over the
country," he said.
"Some of the fears voiced
about the consumer protection
agency have to be looked at with
a grain of salt," kiesling said.
In addition to the suing op
tion, Kiesling said the CI'A
would hire consultants, issue an
annual report, receive and act
upon complaints, and have the
power to evaluate products.

Creating a Consumer Protec
tion Agency that could sue other
agencies would be "absurd on its
face," Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park| declared Wednes
day evening in Palo Alto.
An administration-backed bill
already passed by the House
would create a Consumer Protec
tion Agency (CPA) which could
sue other agencies. McCloskey
said he will be introducing a
substitute bill which eliminates
the suing privilege.
Such suing would "add to the
cost of administering the gov
ernment of the United States an
untold sum," McCloskey said.
"No agency, present or ever, has
had the power to sue other agen
cies."
McCloskey discussed the na
ture of a possible consumer
agency (CPA) with constituents
and Roy Riesling, president of
the Consumer Federation of
California, during a forum out
side the California Ave. Co-op
market.
Riesling, arguing for the ad
ministration bill, said suing was
"a sticky point," but said it
would be necessary for the
agency to be effective.
McCloskey's bill "is a lauda
ble attempt at conciliation." he
said, "but it is lacking any of the
viable and durable constituency
that the agency would need to be
a success."
McCloskey said his bill will
differ from the administration
bill in three other ways. He said
his will abolish all existing fed
eral consumer agencies, but
noted that President Jimmy Car

ter has already agreed to such a
provision.
McCloskey said his bill will
also eliminate exemptions for
labor and agricultural practices.
The labor exemption in particu
lar "is a prostitution, a political
compromise to get labor support
for the bill," he said.
The nature of a CPA would be
"almost entirely a function of
who the first head was," Riesl
ing said.
He noted that a consumer
agency bill has been considered
by Congress since 1<17(). "It one
had been passed five years ago,"
he said, "its impact would have

been disastrous."
If the Carter bill becomes law,
Riesling said, it would create an
agency with about 200 employes
and a budget of about $15 mill
ion a year. "That's not an organi
zation that would take over the
country," he said.
"Some of the fears voiced
about the consumer protection
agency have to be looked at with
a grain of salt," kiesling said.
In addition to the suing op
tion, Kiesling said the CI'A
would hire consultants, issue an
annual report, receive and act
upon complaints, and have the
power to evaluate products.
