Nuke protest
I found the front-page article
by A 1 Petersen on the Diablo Ca
nyon power plant protest | Daily,
Aug. 9) the worst kind of yellow
journalism I've seen in your pub
lication for some time. Mr. Peter
sen did a quick and dirty job of
dismissing the pro-Diablo Ca
nyon demonstration of which I
was a part by referring to just two
of the dozen signs we carried,
and printing the cutting remarks
to these signs (whether solicited
or not was not known) by the
anti-nukes.

I thank you for including the
things we had to say about the
anti-nukes and their illegal and
unethical actions at Diablo Ca
nyon. 1 remind you, sir, that de
spite our own small numbers, we
were representing the over four
million California voters who by
a 2 to 1 margin last year over
whelmingly said yes to nuclear
power and Diablo Canyon.
That much, 1 think, deserves
more than the disdain of one of
your reporters.
