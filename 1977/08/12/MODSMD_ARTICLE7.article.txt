Shannon Blando

He is the film maker who
wants to treat women's prob
lems, but can't get funding be
cause he is a male.
He is the author whose written
attempts to persuade men to give
up their "macho" outlooks go
unread.
He is the man who is heckled
by other men for refusing to take
part in "locker room" discus
sions of women's bodies.
He's the man struggling to
forge a new identity and a new
attitude toward other people—Qf
both sexes.
In short, he is a concerned,
sensitive human being, making a
gargantuan effort to escape his
upbringing and
conditioning— not an easy task.
Hut he gets support from no
one. Feminists distrust him.
Non-feminists don't understand

him. Most men ridicule him.
Women seeking equality
today have a number of role
models. History is being rewrit
ten to include their contribu
tions. Modern media report their
stereotype-shattering activities,
and their social and political
gains.
But the non-sexist man
doesn't have this kind of moral
support. The past discloses only
a very few men who could accu
rately be called "liberated."
Television and newspapers of
today show little interest in re
porting organizations like Men
Against Rape or male birth con
trol clinics.
One man said recently, "It
doesn't seem fair to be distrusted
or misunderstood by women and
abused by other men. How in the
hell can I work on my head to
change it when I get reproach
from all sides?"
The man who favors sexual
equality is a neglected entity
who needs supportive recogni
tion trom feminists. After all. he
won't get it from other quarters.
And his participation in the lib
eration movement is crucial —
not because he is a man, but be
cause he is a caring human be
ing. And we need all of those we
can get.
Making a place for such men
in the movement can only add to
its strength. Each new voice of
support adds to the total impact
made by the outcry for equality.
Experienced feminists will
remember examples of men who
have been willing to do lip ser
vice to the women's movement

Feminism's goals are to br

roles—to make it possible
