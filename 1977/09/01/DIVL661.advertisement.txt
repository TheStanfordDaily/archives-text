WHO MAKES THE BEST
ICE CREAM IN TOWN?
Before we could answer that question, we would first point out
that there are two distinct types of Ice Creams available today:
Commercial Ice Cream, like those sold in your neighborhood ice
cream stores, and Old-fashioned Ice Cream, like you might make
at home.
To further distinguish them, Commercial Ice Creams are made
from a pre-packaged mix that contains smoothers and other add- I I
itives to give them a "creamy" texture; Old-fashioned Ice K I
Creams, on the other hand, are made from Fresh Cream, Grade A
Milk, Fresh Eggs. 100% Cane Sugar or Honey, Salt, Fruits and
Extracts and have a rich, well-bodied texture.
Who makes the best ice cream in town?
We really can't say. But we know who makes the ONLY Old- I I
fashioned-lce Cream in town! I H
