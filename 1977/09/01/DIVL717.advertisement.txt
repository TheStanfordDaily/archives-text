[retread]
■ the tire of the future ■
fr| Economy: Today's retread conforms to federal safety standards, yet is sold, generally, at
less than 112 the price of a new tire. Why a savings of over half? The reason is obvious -
■ because 70% of the cost of the new tire is in the casing, which is recycled through
•±| retreading. This gives retreads a true cost/performance edge.
O Ener gy ; The energy shortage has driven up the cost of fuel and oil-based products, such 5
pi as tires. Not only does a retread cost you less, but it helps conserve the nation's oil supply. It
n takes seven gallons of crude oil to produce the average new automobile tire, but only two 5
■ and ahalf gallons to retread one. At that rate, the more than 30 million retreads sold in 1973
| saved hundreds of millions of gallons of crude oil.
LJ Ecology: More than 200 million tire casings are discarded annually in the United States.
LJ This is enough to encircle the earth four times at the Equator. Since retreading is recycling, ■
it makes an obvious - and inexpensive - contribution toward solving this particular solid ■
U waste disposal problem.
