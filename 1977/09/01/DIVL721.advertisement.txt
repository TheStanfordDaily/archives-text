} AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH I
2 TO STEREO 5
Weingarten Stereo isn't a supermarket. We're people — professional consumers,' selling
£ the equipment we'd buy ourselves. We think it's an attitude that really makes sense. After «
n all, when you go to any professional, such as a mechanic or a doctor, you are paying him to
perform a service the way you'd do it yourself, if you had the time and training. £
£ We've been into music for a long time —we know what live music sounds like — and we've t)
p tried to select components that give you the most accurate reproduction of music for your p
S> dollar. We've chosen our products after listening to nearly everything that's available in this ft
? country, and we keep up with new products as they come out. That's why we think that if
(s you're really into music, you'll appreciate Weingarten Stereo. ?
We are currently recommending: Dayton Wright, Audire, Dun/ap-Clcirke, Denon, k
5 Cizek, Onkyo and many others. 1
