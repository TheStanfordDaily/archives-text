Freshman Orientation
Week presents the entering
student with an array of ac
tivities which is both fas
cinating and confusing.
Every year, there is too
much to see and absorb and
too little time to do it all.
We've put together a brief
guide of major events to
help make things a bit more
clear.
Thursday, Sept. 22 — His
tory of Stanford presenta
tion by University Archivist
Ralph Hansen (7 p.m.).
The capsulized story of
how the University began —
it's really much more in
teresting than it sounds.
Ralph Hansen mixes fact
with anecdotes and slides of
the original campus. Well
worth your time, since you
probably won't have the
chance to see it again.
Friday, Sept. 23 — From 8
a.m. until 10 a.m., foreign
language placement tests
and freshman english
exemption tests will be gi
ven.
At 10:30 a.m., President
Lyman will deliver his an
nual "Welcome to Stan
ford."
Tours of campus facilities
take place from 3 p.m. until
6 p.m.
Co to those places that
you'll probably never get to
see once classes begin, like
the Hoover Institution or
the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.

Dinner with academic ad
visors will take place at 6
p.m.
Know that face, and get to
know that person. Your
academic advisor can be a
truly helpful source of in
formation and advice, but
you must make the effort to
seek out him/her during the
year, besides those times
you need your class study
list approved.
At 9 p.m., two films will be
shown on campus: Chap
lin's The Great Dictator, at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
and The Heart is a Lonely

Hunter, at Kresge Au
ditorium.
Saturday, Sept. 24 — At 11
