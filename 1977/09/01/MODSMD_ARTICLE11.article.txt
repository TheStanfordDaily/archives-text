# Cream of the Course Crop
## 
### 
A great number of freshmen
arrive here with their schedules
already figured out. With the
no-nonsense attitude of the ear
nest greenhorn, they tend to
place themselves in such
courses as Chemistry 31, Math
41, Introduction to Econ and be
ginning French.
In the opinion of many up
perclassmen, these students are
misguided, although there may
be nothing wrong with any of
these courses in and of them
selves.
The problem lies in the fact
that a schedule full of "hard
core" classes is a schedule be
reft of the classes which really
make life worth while: the little
known course in the obscure
department which is brilliantly
instructed, or the large lecture
course whose subject matter, at
first of no apparent interest,
gradually becomes obsessively
fascinating.
We do not pretend to have
sorted out all of the diamonds
from the rough, but the follow
ing list contains the names of
courses which we feel are espe
cially good ways to start an edu
cation at Stanford.
Large well-known courses
Art 1. The subject matter
of this course is its strong
point.

Anthropology 1. "Social and
Cultural Anthropology." A gen
eral survey course.
History 1. "Modern Europe."
A difficult but very rewarding
course. The reading load is sig
nificant.
Humanities 61. "Western
Thought and Literature: The
World of Classic Antiquity."
Taught by Professor
Raubitschek, whom many stu
dents find charming.
Philosophy 1. "God, Self and
World." Another general survey
and often a pleasant surprise for
students with no previous ex
perience with philosophy.
Political Science 35. "How Na
tions Deal with Each Other." A
good general course for
everyone and highly recom
mended for students who may
wish to continue in history,
political science or international
relations.
Smaller humanities
courses.
English 10. "English and
American Literature: Modern
and Medieval." The curriculum
is very interesting but this
course deserves a special re
commendation on account of
Professors Brown and Friedlan
der. The latter's status with the
University is currently unclear so

there may not be many more
chances to take a course from
him.
Comparative Literature 40.
"Drama." Professor L'Heureux
and his subject matter contri
bute equally to this course.
English 90. "Narration." Un
fortunately available only to
first quarter freshmen who have
been exempted from the writing
requirement.
English 92. "Reading and Writ
ing Poetry." A jurse wth the
same availability for freshmen as
English 90.
English 138. "Autobiographi
cal Narrative." Entry to this
course may be difficult to obtain
but it is highly recommended.
Engineering and Science
courses.
Mechanical Engineering 101.
"Visual Thinking." One of the
most creative course concepts in
the University's offerings.
Mechanical Engineering 103.
"Manufacturing Technology."
The curriculum of the course has
been in flux during the last sev
eral quarters, but the labs consti
tute one of the few oppor
tunities in the University for ex
posure to a "vocation."
Applied Physics 15. "The Na
ture of the Universe." An excel
lent but little-known survey.

World." Another general survey
and often a pleasant surprise for
students with no previous ex
perience with philosophy.
Political Science 35. "How Na
tions Deal with Each Other." A
good general course for
everyone and highly recom
mended for students who may
wish to continue in history,
political science or international
relations.
Smaller humanities
courses.
English 10. "English and
American Literature: Modern
and Medieval." The curriculum
is very interesting but this
course deserves a special re
commendation on account of
Professors Brown and Friedlan
der. The latter's status with the
University is currently unclear so

there may not be many more
chances to take a course from
him.
Comparative Literature 40.
"Drama." Professor L'Heureux
and his subject matter contri
bute equally to this course.
English 90. "Narration." Un
fortunately available only to
first quarter freshmen who have
been exempted from the writing
requirement.
English 92. "Reading and Writ
ing Poetry." A jurse wth the
same availability for freshmen as
English 90.
English 138. "Autobiographi
cal Narrative." Entry to this
course may be difficult to obtain
but it is highly recommended.
Engineering and Science
courses.
Mechanical Engineering 101.
"Visual Thinking." One of the
most creative course concepts in
the University's offerings.
Mechanical Engineering 103.
"Manufacturing Technology."
The curriculum of the course has
been in flux during the last sev
eral quarters, but the labs consti
tute one of the few oppor
tunities in the University for ex
posure to a "vocation."
Applied Physics 15. "The Na
ture of the Universe." An excel
lent but little-known survey.
A great number of freshmen
arrive here with their schedules
already figured out. With the
no-nonsense attitude of the ear
nest greenhorn, they tend to
place themselves in such
courses as Chemistry 31, Math
41, Introduction to Econ and be
ginning French.
In the opinion of many up
perclassmen, these students are
misguided, although there may
be nothing wrong with any of
these courses in and of them
selves.
The problem lies in the fact
that a schedule full of "hard
core" classes is a schedule be
reft of the classes which really
make life worth while: the little
known course in the obscure
department which is brilliantly
instructed, or the large lecture
course whose subject matter, at
first of no apparent interest,
gradually becomes obsessively
fascinating.
We do not pretend to have
sorted out all of the diamonds
from the rough, but the follow
ing list contains the names of
courses which we feel are espe
cially good ways to start an edu
cation at Stanford.
Large well-known courses
Art 1. The subject matter
of this course is its strong
point.

Anthropology 1. "Social and
Cultural Anthropology." A gen
eral survey course.
History 1. "Modern Europe."
A difficult but very rewarding
course. The reading load is sig
nificant.
Humanities 61. "Western
Thought and Literature: The
World of Classic Antiquity."
Taught by Professor
Raubitschek, whom many stu
dents find charming.
Philosophy 1. "God, Self and
World." Another general survey
and often a pleasant surprise for
students with no previous ex
perience with philosophy.
