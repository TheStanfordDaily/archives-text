# The 						musical question: to zoo or not to zoo
## 
### 
(Editors' Note• We are indebted
to Mr. Lopez. Program Directoi
at KZSU, for the following de
scription of the station, to which
we could not have done justice
ourselves.)
When is a zoo not a zoo?
When it is a K-ZOO, or actually
KZSU.
Seriously, KZSU has been the
springboard, or half-way house,
for budding Walter Cronkites as
well as assorted music junkies.
The common misperception is

that KZSU has a static clique of
personnel with hopeless futures
for outsiders. Well, pilgrim, you
don't have to go to Foothill Col
lege for a career in broadcasting.
The truth of the matter is that
KZSU needs fresh talent every
year. Just like the "real" world
(that's life off-campus after
graduation), KZSU will allow a
skillful and clever person to
achieve self-actualization or at
least a proficient level in a mar
ketable skill.

You think I'm some Edsel
salesman? Well, those of you
from Washington D.C. or
Chicago may have reguarly seen
Marylee Beck on the ABC station
(Stanford and KZSU, 1969).
Engineers are not exempt
either. There is James Gabbert
(FM pioneer and owner of KlOl,
San Francisco) and Ray Dolby
(he lives in your TEAC cassette
deck). And there are many
others who have gone on to
great accomplishments in

broadcast as well as becoming
responsible citizens.
You're probably asking "OK,
I'm interested if there aren't too
many parties this quarter.
What's down at the Zoo?"
First, there's actual on-the-air
work. Disc-jockeys must have a
third-class FCC license. KZSU
has a short and relatively easy
program to help you get it.
Given a more-than-passing in
terest in music, one can easily
develop a skill in programming

music (no forrrat or restrictions
imposed)-.
This last year, KZSU has had
Salsa, R&B, Soul, Rock, Jazz and
Classical programs. For those
who are afraid of anything big
ger than AM and two knobs, we
have painless training sessions
that will ease you into broadcast
professionalism.
News and Public Affairs is
where liberal arts and other
non-engineering majors have
actually learned something be
sides applying to grad schools.
When that vocational show
down occurs in your senior year,
believe me, you're going to want
as many options as possible.
If you have an inclination to
ward electronics or anything
mechanical, KZSU NEEDS YOU.
Many an engineer has found ful
fillment beyond academics at
KZSU.
So, if you like to travel (yes
there's travel), the opposite sex,
beer, music, or learning, you'll
like KZSU. You'll be surprised
how easy "real" life can be.

This last year, KZSU has had
Salsa, R&B, Soul, Rock, Jazz and
Classical programs. For those
who are afraid of anything big
ger than AM and two knobs, we
have painless training sessions
that will ease you into broadcast
professionalism.
News and Public Affairs is
where liberal arts and other
non-engineering majors have
actually learned something be
sides applying to grad schools.
When that vocational show
down occurs in your senior year,
believe me, you're going to want
as many options as possible.
If you have an inclination to
ward electronics or anything
mechanical, KZSU NEEDS YOU.
Many an engineer has found ful
fillment beyond academics at
KZSU.
So, if you like to travel (yes
there's travel), the opposite sex,
beer, music, or learning, you'll
like KZSU. You'll be surprised
how easy "real" life can be.

When is a zoo not a zoo?
When it is a K-ZOO, or actually
KZSU.
Seriously, KZSU has been the
springboard, or half-way house,
for budding Walter Cronkites as
well as assorted music junkies.
The common misperception is

that KZSU has a static clique of
personnel with hopeless futures
for outsiders. Well, pilgrim, you
don't have to go to Foothill Col
lege for a career in broadcasting.
The truth of the matter is that
KZSU needs fresh talent every
year. Just like the "real" world
(that's life off-campus after
graduation), KZSU will allow a
skillful and clever person to
achieve self-actualization or at
least a proficient level in a mar
ketable skill.

You think I'm some Edsel
salesman? Well, those of you
from Washington D.C. or
Chicago may have reguarly seen
Marylee Beck on the ABC station
(Stanford and KZSU, 1969).
Engineers are not exempt
either. There is James Gabbert
(FM pioneer and owner of KlOl,
San Francisco) and Ray Dolby
(he lives in your TEAC cassette
deck). And there are many
others who have gone on to
great accomplishments in

broadcast as well as becoming
responsible citizens.
You're probably asking "OK,
I'm interested if there aren't too
many parties this quarter.
What's down at the Zoo?"
First, there's actual on-the-air
work. Disc-jockeys must have a
third-class FCC license. KZSU
has a short and relatively easy
program to help you get it.
Given a more-than-passing in
terest in music, one can easily
develop a skill in programming

music (no forrrat or restrictions
imposed)-.
