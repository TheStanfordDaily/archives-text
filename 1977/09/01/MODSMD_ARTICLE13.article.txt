# T-shirts to travel: the ASS services U
## 
### 
The ASSU offers a myriad of
special services for members of
the University community.
Among the most popular ser
vices is the ASSU Lecture Notes
Service. Notes from selected
courses are taken by ASSU ap
pointees, and are duplicated
and distributed to student sub
scribers.
Most students view the notes
as a valuable study aid. Many
subscribers do not take any
notes of their own, and are
therefore able to listen more
closely to the lectures as they are
being presented.
The ASSU also offers a T-shirt
service. Individual T-shirts may
be bought, or campus groups
may design and wear their own
T-shirt with a personalized logo
or slogan.
For those with the travel bug,
the ASSU Travel Service offers
charter flights and information
about European travel. Charters

are planned for this Christmas to
New York, Washington,
Chicago and Boston. This
spring, planes will be going to
New York, Chicago, Mexico and
Hawaii.
The charter prices cannot be
beat, and it is wise to sign up
immediately for charter flights,
as the spaces fill up quickly.
The Travel Service, the T-Shirt
Service and the Lecture Notes
Service are all located in the
ASSU office on the second floor
of Tresidder Union.
The ASSU also sponsors the
Sunday Flicks, shown every
Sunday evening in Memorial
Auditorium. The schedule for
this fall includes such films as
Small Change, Rocky and The
Story of O.
The ASSU Legal Counseling
Service offers aid and counsel
ing to students with legal prob
lems.
The ASSU Special Events

bureau schedules campus enter
tainment, mostly of the rock var
iety. There was a marked decline
in both quantity and quality of
entertainers last year when
compared with previous years,
but the bureau has plans for a
vastly improved schedule this
year, starting off on Oct. 22 with
Ronnie Laws.
This year, for the first time, the
ASSU will be in charge of the
linen service of campus, hand
led in past years by an outside
company. They hope to expand
the service with longer hours,
and also hope to lower the price
for the upcoming year.
The ASSU Course Guide is a
publication that attempts to rate
classes and professors in terms
of teaching quality and value to
the student. The Course Guide
compiles the results of student
course evaluations that are con
ducted at the end of each quar
ter. Copies of the Course Guide

are delivered to dorms.
Plans for the upcoming year
include a new recycling center;
the existing one on Pampas Lane
is being shut down. Also plan
ned are an auto tune-up service
for students and staff, and a
series of courses to be dubbed
"ASSU Special Classes," which
are to cover such subjects as car
repair, consumer fraud, frisbee
and CPR.
