# Leland Stanford — munificent mogul with a Midas touch
## 
### 
Leland Stanford was born in 1824 in Water
liet, New York. He never received the univer
sity education that was to mean so much to him
for others in the founding of his university.
Instead, he was educated at country schools
and later apprenticed himself to a law firm in
Albany. He was admitted to the New York and
Wisconsin bars.
His future wife, Jane Lathrop, was born in
Albany, New York, in 1828. She was the daugh
ter of moderately well-to-do parents, and re
ceived the normal private school education
that was fitting for girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married in 1850. In 1852,
Leland went alone to San Francisco to begin his
business ventures. Jane stayed behind in New
York until 1855 to care for her ailing father to
whom she was very close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then moved to Wisconsin,
where they lived until a tragic fire destroyed

Leland's law library. To start a new life they
moved to Sacramento via Nicaragua in 1856;
Leland's father had told them that California
was the place to be.
In Sacramento, Leland purchased his
brothers' store, and then began his political
life. In 1856, he helped to organize Sacramen
to's Republican party. Four years later, he was
'chosen as a delegate to the Chicago conven
tion, where he supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became more of a politi
cal infuence with his election in 1861 as gover
nor of California. As former Stanford student,
and later president, Ray Lyman Wilbur writes
in his Memoirs, "as governor of California he
had led in the battle to keep California in the
Union against those who wanted it to follow
the South or to set it up as a separate republic."
In 1885, he was to be elected to the United
States Senate.
Stanford museum docent and chairman of
the Stanford Family Portfolio Peg Haneberg
says that Leland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the standing armies of
Europe were a waste of time and manpower,"
she says."He believed that disputes should be
settled by arbitration."
The same year, 1861, Stanford and three
other men formed the Central Pacific Railroad,
of which he later was elected president. Later,

a series of complicated mergers consolidated
several railroads into the Central Pacific Sys
tem.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian at the Univer
sity libraries, says that Leland and his three
associates were known as the "big four."
"He has been characterized by some histo
rians as a robber baron," he adds. "If he was
really so despicable he wouldn't have been
liked so much by his employees."
At first the railroad was considered to be a
risky financial venture, but it later proved to be
a most lucrative investment, as it was later to
help support the University. To celebrate the
first transcontinental line, Leland drove a gol
den spike in a ceremony at Promontory, Utah,
in 1869.
Stanford's business adventures allowed him
some measure of play. In 1870 he bought his
first race horse, named Occident. He later
bred, trained, and raced horses very success

fully; one year his horse won a world's record.
When the horse died, Kentucky racers were
relieved.
An investment in the California Street Cable
Railroad Franchise made Stanford an even
wealthier man. He tried to talk his influential
friends into investing in the company, but only
a few were willing to take the chance; he
bought most of the shares himself.
The cable was completed in 1877. Because
Stanford never did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world by a new
method of molding concrete. In spite of the
low five-cent fare for riding the cable cars, the
stock eventually made him an even wealthier
mah.
Stanford wasn't successful at everything. In
1881, he bought a vineyard in Vina, Ca., and
tried to make table wine. According to
Haneberg, he invested a lot of money in wine
and made good brandy, but never got good
table wine.
'Farmer at heart'
Hansen says that Stanford was a "farmer at
heart," and made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
"He was a pioneer of viticulture," he con
tinues. "The reasons for his failure at Vina
were soil problems." Stanford planted 3000
acres of grapes from France for champagne,
but they failed and became brandy. His Weidel

Winery at Mission San Jose still produces suc
cessfully.
Jane had meanwhile made her husband her
career, and the two were very close. Because
of her husband's many personal and business
interests, she knew many famous people,
traveled widely, and lived well.
Hansen says that "Jane's outstanding
characteristic was that she was deeply religi
ous. Her life centered in her belief in immortal
ity and Jesus Christ." Jane supported Catholic
charities, but neither she nor Leland belonged
to any particular church.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she didn't toot her
horn about it," Hansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergartens in Menlo Park and San
Francisco."
In his Memoirs, Wilbur describes Jane as
"never a beautiful woman — some thought
she resembled Queen Victoria in general ap
pearance, which rather pleased her. She had a
commanding presence and friendly dignity
which only a great heart, courage and strong
convictions and character can give."
Up until their 18th year of marriage, the Stan
fords remained childless. Finally, in 1868 in
Sacramento, Leland Jr. was born. Jane was 40 at
the time of his birth; according to Stanford Art
Museum docent Glenda Northway, he was her
"precious jewel."
Leland Jr. had everything a child could want.
He was taken on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he attended Heald
Business College in San Francisco.
Yet Haneberg says that he wasn't spoiled;
.research has it that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been longing for. He
loved the boots, and slept in them the first
night. The next day, he saw a poor boy who
had no shoes, so Leland Jr. gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland I r., was very intelli
gent, had a good sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he was brought up
to be aware of the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
The joys of parenthood were not to last long
for Leland and Jane. While the family was vaca
tioning in Istanbul, Leland Jr. contracted
typhoid fever. He got worse in Naples and
Rome, and in 1884 died in Florence. He was 16.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very close; the loss
of the only child was a tremendous blow.When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank into a coma
from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is said that Leland Jr.
appeared and said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke, Leland said, "California's children
shall be my children." Thus Leland founded
Leland Stanford Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her son, established
theLeland Stanford Junior Museum. Museums
were her son's passion and lifelong dream; the
fall he was 16, he had planned to enter Harvard
and study courses pertaining to the running of
a museum.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new University was
laid on May 14 in 1887 — it would have been
Leland Jr.'s 19th birthday. In a copper box in
the cornerstone, the Stanfords placed, among
other documents relating to the organiza
tion of the University, a photograph of their
son. The University was to open four years
later.
According to Wilbur, Sen. Stanford had no
trouble choosing the site for his University.
Although the Stanfords had various houses,
Palo Alto was home, so he chose his Palo Alto
farm.
"The Senator's opinion," writes Wilbur,
"was that any place thai was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for students."
Wilbur continues, "I particularly liked Mr.
Stanford's idea of what education should be,
that it should be for 'direct usefulness in life.'
He wanted it to break away from the
tradition-bound classical and philosophical
programs of some of the older eastern institu
tions, and to develop along the more practical
and scientific lines in which Cornell Univer
sity, the Johns Hopkins University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology were
pioneering.
Jordan first president
"He wanted for president of the new west
ern institution a man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could "see and try
new ways of doing things. Such a man he
found in David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford in 1892, writes
of his early impressions of the physical expan
siveness and vastness of the University. "We
came along El Camino Real, then a narrow dirt

road. . . We swung up to the University build
ings, which were then only what we call now
the Inner Quadrangle (Memorial Church had
not yet been built).
"With the buff sandstone wall, red-tiled
roofs, and long sandstone arcades they were
delightfully different from any educational
buildings we had ever seen."
Unlike many universities, from the begin
ning Stanford was coed. Girls were housed in
Roble Hall; the men in Encina Hall. Hansen
says that Encina has been "slowly remodeled"
and now houses offices, the Economics De
partment and the Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly pleased that
women were accepted at Stanford; Haneberg
says that Leland "favored" women. But Jane
went along with her husband's wishes, and in
spite of her misgivings, women were re
spected and given equal rights.
To welcome the women, Jane gave tea par
ties at their Palo Alto home, the site of the
present Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the founding grant
doesn't prohibit women; in 1899, women
began to increase. Jane became concerned
that more women than men would attend the
University that had been dedicated to her
son."
He adds that a clause to the founding grant
prohibited more than 500 women. "Up until
the early '30s, they were known as the 'Stan
ford 500.' It was later rescinded by the trus
tees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no tuition; Leland
believed that all his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students were responsi
ble for paying their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University charged $4.50
weekly for room and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first year at Stan
ford, one of those miscellaneous expenses
was laundry. A "quiet, friendly chap" came to
Wilbur's room at Encina and asked if Wilb,ur
wanted to send his laundry to a "San Jose
company of which he was the Stanford agent.
He promptly got my limited business." The
quiet, friendly chap was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual growing pains
that any new educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur writes that
"not only was the University undergoing or
ganization, with educational processes in de
bate at practically every meeting of the faculty,
but the students themselves were likewise de
veloping their own organizations, their athle
tic teams, their debating, literary and musical
societies and fraternities. . .
"A good many . . . new traditions evapo
rated with one trial, some lasted a little longer,
a few became a lasting part of Stanford life.
With the trial and error method there de
veloped good leadership and some rather un
ique and appropriate customs. . . We were

starting from the very beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains, the University
continued smoothly enough for two years. But
the young University was devastated by the
death of its founder in 1893.
There was some question if the University
could survive financially after Leland's death.
The estate was tied up in court for some time.
)ane, who had a massive jewelry collection
second only to the queen of England, estab
lished the Jewel Fund, the money of which was
used to pay for salaries and books.
Hansen says that because of Jane's firm,
single-minded determination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed ahead" to
save the University.
"When Leland died, the lawyers advised her
to close the University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school closed down I
would have nothing to live for.' The University
became her son; every energy and dollar mus
tered went to the University. It was part of her
Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as to the cause of
her death. Wilbur and Haneberg concur that
death was caused by a heart attack. Rumors at
the time had it that she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid . . . "as was headlined in
some of the more sensational newspapers,"
writes Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along with her hus
band and son, in the mausoleum, set apart
from the main grounds in a grove of oak trees.
Another shock was to come to the Univer
sity, this time in the form of the massive 1906
earthquake. The new Outer Quad, much of
the museum, the library, the gym, arches and
Jane's beloved, recently-built Memorial
Church was badly damaged. The statue of
biologist Agassiz, located in front of Jordan
Hall, fell headfirst into the pavement. A stu
dent and fireman were killed.
Wilbur writes that the University was re
lieved that Jane wasn't alive to see the damage,
as that in itself would have killed her. "It was
just a case of starting all over again."
"Starting all over again" meant immediately
beginning restoration of the damaged build
ings. Wilbur writes that President Jordan is
sued a statement saying that "the actual needs
of the growing University" would be first con
sidered. "No backward" steps were taken in
repairs, nor were faculty numbers reduced.
For a while, the University could not accept
any more students; the year after the quake,
students returned "in greater numbers than
ever before."
President Jordan, Wilbur writes, "drew
some philosophical lessons from the ear
thquake, commenting that 'forever man must
rise above his own creations.' " The young
university soon fully recovered.
