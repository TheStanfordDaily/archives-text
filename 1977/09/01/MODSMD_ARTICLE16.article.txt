# Frosh English: bigger and better for more than ever
## 
### 
More entering students are
being forced to take freshman
writing courses this year than
before, but those who have res
igned themselves to two quar
ters of "bonehead English" have
a pleasant surprise in store.
There is a wide variety of
themes and learning styles from
which to choose and some of the
University's most innovative
courses fulfill the writing re
quirement.
Only students earning a four
or a five on the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) Ad
vanced Placement Test will be
exempted from the writing re
quirement this year. Until last
year, entering students receiv
ing a score of 700 or better on the
CEEB's English Composition
Achievement Test could take a
Stanford-prepared exemption
test.
Last year, the University began
moving away from the achieve
ment test because, as former
Academic Information Center
Director Robert Hamrdla said,
"that test does not in fact mea
sure one's ability to write."
According to Joe O'Mealy,
former Teaching Coordinator in
the Freshman English program,

only about 20 per cent of those
taking the exemption test pas
sed. As a result, the University
has abandoned the test al
together this year.
"The whole idea of placing out
of composition makes it seem a
punishment of some sort, which
it shouldn't be," O'Mealy said.
"It's part of the whole freshman
syndrome that says freshmen
English is something to be av
oided."
Stiffer requirements
Other campuses have been
beefing up their writing prog
rams as well, both by requiring
more students to take college
level English and by stiffening
entrance requirements. The
University of California, for
example, is currently consider
ing a proposal to make four
years of high school English a
systemwide admission require
ment.
Much of this action has stem
med from widespread alarm
among faculty and adminis
trators about an alleged decline
in student writing ability. But
those involved in the process
here offer a less gloomy assess
ment.
"I'm not sure that there's been
a decline," said Ellen Nold, who

was instrumental in developing
the Undergraduate Writing
Program, which was phased out
in 1975 with many of its innova
tive classes and methods
adopted by the English Depart
ment.
While some studies have
shown a decline, "largely
they're impressionistic results,"
Nold said. She pointed to the
great difficulty involved in
evaluating the ability to write on
a large scale.
"Perhaps there is some slight
decline," O'Mealy said, cau
tioning that "the way we test
may have something to do with
what results we're getting."
Variety
Whatever the students'
abilities, there is no question
that a variety of methods are av
ailable for improving writing
here. Students may choose
theme-oriented workshops,
non-theme workshops, thema
tic seminars or tutorial classes.
As the writing program ma
tures, tutorials are beginning to
emerge as the most popular
method of fulfilling the re
quirement, according to Nold.
Perhaps even more than with the
other methods, teaching ability
is the central factor in the suc
cess or failure of a tutorial work

shop.
So, training writing instructors
has become the prime goal of
those heading the programs.
Nold, in addition to creating a
writing instruction program for
the School of Engineering, con
tinued after the 1975 end of the
Undergraduate Writing Program
to evaluate seminar and work
shop instructors, and to hold
seminars for would-be instruc
tors on teaching English.
Lamenting the decline in stu
dent writing ability "is a
smokescreen for not teaching
composition because people
don't know how to teach com
position," Nold said. She said
that while faculty members can
be taught the art of teaching
composition, "it takes a great
deal of time and effort," which
most professors outside the
writing program can't afford to
spend.
So Nold embarked on an ex
periment in the School of En
gineering which, if successful,
may change the nature of
freshman English here. "I be
lieve we must utilize the
cheapest and best resource av
ailable: undergraduates," she
said. Undergraduate writing
tutors would be assigned to

non-English courses to hold
seminars on writing, tutor stu
dents, etc.
"It couldn't hurt and it might
work,", she said. "If it doesn't
work, I'm out of a job."
Familiar patterns
But for the present, training of
writing instructors will continue
in familiar patterns. Instructors
in both freshman seminars and
freshman English, who may or
may not be faculty members, are
evaluated along with their teach
ing proposals. In addition, they
are given orientation seminars,
according to Nold.
o'Mealy 4 who was in charge
last year of training the graduate
students who lead workshops in
the freshman English program,
said "We try to train them in the
resources that are available.
We give them advice and prac
tice in grading student papers,
structuring assignments, etc."
In addition, he said, the
would-be workshop leaders'
own writing ability is examined.
"We try to shake them up a bit,"
he said. "In some cases, they
hafe bad habits and don't realize
what is wrong" with their writ
ing.
"We want to change their in
tuitive knowledge to explicit
knowledge" of the methods of
composition, O'Mealy said. In
this way, he said, entering stu
dents have the best chance for
getting the kind of criticism
necessary for writing quality im

theme-oriented workshops,
non-theme workshops, thema

As the writing program ma

emerge as the most popular
method of fulfilling the re
quirement, according to Nold.
Perhaps even more than with the
other methods, teaching ability
is the central factor in the suc

shop.
So, training writing instructors
has become the prime goal of
those heading the programs.
Nold, in addition to creating a
writing instruction program for
the School of Engineering, con
tinued after the 1975 end of the
Undergraduate Writing Program
to evaluate seminar and work

Lamenting the decline in stu

smokescreen for not teaching
composition because people
don't know how to teach com
position," Nold said. She said
that while faculty members can
be taught the art of teaching
composition, "it takes a great
deal of time and effort," which
most professors outside the
writing program can't afford to
spend.
So Nold embarked on an ex
periment in the School of En
gineering which, if successful,
may change the nature of
freshman English here. "I be
lieve we must utilize the
cheapest and best resource av

said. Undergraduate writing
tutors would be assigned to

non-English courses to hold
seminars on writing, tutor stu
dents, etc.
"It couldn't hurt and it might
work,", she said. "If it doesn't
work, I'm out of a job."
Familiar patterns
But for the present, training of
writing instructors will continue
in familiar patterns. Instructors
in both freshman seminars and
freshman English, who may or
may not be faculty members, are
evaluated along with their teach
ing proposals. In addition, they
are given orientation seminars,
according to Nold.
o'Mealy 4 who was in charge
last year of training the graduate
students who lead workshops in
the freshman English program,
said "We try to train them in the
resources that are available.
We give them advice and prac

structuring assignments, etc."
In addition, he said, the
would-be workshop leaders'
own writing ability is examined.
"We try to shake them up a bit,"
he said. "In some cases, they
hafe bad habits and don't realize
what is wrong" with their writ

"We want to change their in

composition, O'Mealy said. In

More entering students are
being forced to take freshman
writing courses this year than
before, but those who have res
igned themselves to two quar
ters of "bonehead English" have
a pleasant surprise in store.
There is a wide variety of
themes and learning styles from
which to choose and some of the
University's most innovative
courses fulfill the writing re
quirement.
Only students earning a four
or a five on the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) Ad
vanced Placement Test will be
exempted from the writing re
quirement this year. Until last
year, entering students receiv
ing a score of 700 or better on the
CEEB's English Composition
Achievement Test could take a
Stanford-prepared exemption
test.
Last year, the University began
moving away from the achieve
ment test because, as former
Academic Information Center
Director Robert Hamrdla said,
"that test does not in fact mea
sure one's ability to write."
According to Joe O'Mealy,
former Teaching Coordinator in
the Freshman English program,

only about 20 per cent of those
taking the exemption test pas
sed. As a result, the University
has abandoned the test al
together this year.
"The whole idea of placing out
of composition makes it seem a
punishment of some sort, which
it shouldn't be," O'Mealy said.
"It's part of the whole freshman
syndrome that says freshmen
English is something to be av

Stiffer requirements
Other campuses have been
beefing up their writing prog
rams as well, both by requiring
more students to take college
level English and by stiffening
entrance requirements. The
University of California, for
example, is currently consider
ing a proposal to make four
years of high school English a
systemwide admission require
ment.
Much of this action has stem
med from widespread alarm
among faculty and adminis
trators about an alleged decline
in student writing ability. But
those involved in the process
here offer a less gloomy assess
ment.
"I'm not sure that there's been
a decline," said Ellen Nold, who

was instrumental in developing
the Undergraduate Writing
Program, which was phased out
in 1975 with many of its innova
tive classes and methods
adopted by the English Depart

While some studies have
shown a decline, "largely
they're impressionistic results,"
Nold said. She pointed to the
great difficulty involved in

a large scale.

writing courses this year than
before, but those who have res
igned themselves to two quar
ters of "bonehead English" have
a pleasant surprise in store.
There is a wide variety of
themes and learning styles from
which to choose and some of the
University's most innovative
courses fulfill the writing re
quirement.
Only students earning a four
or a five on the College Entrance
Examination Board's (CEEB) Ad
vanced Placement Test will be
exempted from the writing re
quirement this year. Until last
year, entering students receiv
ing a score of 700 or better on the
CEEB's English Composition
Achievement Test could take a
Stanford-prepared exemption
test.
Last year, the University began
moving away from the achieve
ment test because, as former
Academic Information Center
Director Robert Hamrdla said,
"that test does not in fact mea
sure one's ability to write."
According to Joe O'Mealy,
former Teaching Coordinator in
the Freshman English program,

only about 20 per cent of those
taking the exemption test pas
sed. As a result, the University
has abandoned the test al
together this year.
"The whole idea of placing out
of composition makes it seem a
punishment of some sort, which
it shouldn't be," O'Mealy said.
"It's part of the whole freshman
syndrome that says freshmen
English is something to be av
oided."
Stiffer requirements
Other campuses have been
beefing up their writing prog
rams as well, both by requiring
more students to take college
level English and by stiffening
entrance requirements. The
University of California, for
example, is currently consider
ing a proposal to make four
years of high school English a
systemwide admission require
ment.
Much of this action has stem
med from widespread alarm
among faculty and adminis
trators about an alleged decline
in student writing ability. But
those involved in the process
here offer a less gloomy assess
ment.
"I'm not sure that there's been
a decline," said Ellen Nold, who

was instrumental in developing
the Undergraduate Writing
Program, which was phased out
in 1975 with many of its innova
tive classes and methods
adopted by the English Depart
ment.
While some studies have
shown a decline, "largely
they're impressionistic results,"
Nold said. She pointed to the
great difficulty involved in
evaluating the ability to write on
a large scale.
"Perhaps there is some slight
decline," O'Mealy said, cau
tioning that "the way we test
may have something to do with
what results we're getting."
Variety
Whatever the students'
abilities, there is no question
that a variety of methods are av
ailable for improving writing
here. Students may choose
theme-oriented workshops,
non-theme workshops, thema
tic seminars or tutorial classes.
As the writing program ma
tures, tutorials are beginning to
emerge as the most popular
method of fulfilling the re
quirement, according to Nold.
Perhaps even more than with the
other methods, teaching ability
is the central factor in the suc
cess or failure of a tutorial work

shop.
So, training writing instructors
has become the prime goal of
those heading the programs.
Nold, in addition to creating a
writing instruction program for
the School of Engineering, con
tinued after the 1975 end of the
Undergraduate Writing Program
to evaluate seminar and work
shop instructors, and to hold
seminars for would-be instruc
tors on teaching English.
Lamenting the decline in stu
dent writing ability "is a
smokescreen for not teaching
composition because people
don't know how to teach com
position," Nold said. She said
that while faculty members can
be taught the art of teaching
composition, "it takes a great
deal of time and effort," which
most professors outside the
writing program can't afford to
spend.
So Nold embarked on an ex
periment in the School of En
gineering which, if successful,
may change the nature of
freshman English here. "I be
lieve we must utilize the
cheapest and best resource av
ailable: undergraduates," she
said. Undergraduate writing
tutors would be assigned to

non-English courses to hold
seminars on writing, tutor stu
dents, etc.
"It couldn't hurt and it might
work,", she said. "If it doesn't
work, I'm out of a job."
Familiar patterns
But for the present, training of
writing instructors will continue
in familiar patterns. Instructors
in both freshman seminars and
freshman English, who may or
may not be faculty members, are
evaluated along with their teach
ing proposals. In addition, they
are given orientation seminars,
according to Nold.
o'Mealy 4 who was in charge
last year of training the graduate
students who lead workshops in
the freshman English program,
said "We try to train them in the
resources that are available.
We give them advice and prac
tice in grading student papers,
structuring assignments, etc."
In addition, he said, the
would-be workshop leaders'
own writing ability is examined.
"We try to shake them up a bit,"
he said. "In some cases, they
hafe bad habits and don't realize
what is wrong" with their writ
ing.
"We want to change their in
tuitive knowledge to explicit
knowledge" of the methods of
composition, O'Mealy said. In
this way, he said, entering stu
dents have the best chance for
getting the kind of criticism
necessary for writing quality im
provement.
