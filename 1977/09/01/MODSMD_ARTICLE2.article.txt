# For the first time ever — Fred Hargadon admits all
## 
### 
Whether it's his unusual, chatty approach
to form letters, or his license plate that reads
ADMITS, there's something that sets Fred
Hargadon apart from your average dean of
admissions. Last month, Daily Managing
Editor George Anders talked with Hargadon
about the undergraduate admissions process
here.
In past years, after you've made all the admis
sions decisions by April, you've said it's time to
get started again. What's your year-round
schedule like 112
It's more hectic, year-round, than most
people think. For instance, when we do mail
the letters out on April 1, then we spend six

weeks corresponding with two sets of stu
dents — the students which have been
turned down, and that's well over 7000. And a
number of those students and/or their pa
rents write us. And I try and respond person
ally.
Increasingly, overthe past few years, those
students whom we admit write us and have
all kinds of questions. "Can I bring my cat?"
"Can I get a room with a sunny view on the
north side of Flo Mo?" We spend an awful lot
of time corresponding with those we have
offered admission to, who at that point are
trying to make up their mind between one or
another school and Stanford.
So it's not as if you just mail the letter out
and all of a sudden people say "Okay, I'm
coming" or "I'm not coming" and those that
you've turned down say "Gee, that's great"
and "you made a great decision."
Then we're into May by that time, and from
the previous January we've probably
backlogged an awful lot of requests from
juniors in high school for interviews, all of
which start again in May. And although we
don't require the interview, we will grant
one. And we — as you can see by walking
through that waiting room — on any given
day have tons of people who come in for
interviews.
But, also beginning in May, after having
just read through 10,000 freshman applica
tions, we have to start reading 2000 transfer
applications for fall quarter: this year with the
idea of selecting around 150 students. And so
we're juggling that at the same time.
At the same time, we try and get our heads
together to see if there isn't some way to
improve our bulletin "Why Stanford?" and
we then review our application papers. Based
on the way we read them last year, are some
of the questions still valid?
And at the same time, we send surveys out
to everyone we've admitted who isn't com
ing, and everyone we've admitted who is
coming to ask them how they went about
making up their mind. We look at those to
see if there are things we should be doing
differently, based on the responses of those
we just dealt with.
So right now, we have just received the
press copy of "Why Stanford?"—a major re
write of that bulletin, including a description
of every department.
It doesn't seem to us that anything has
wound down at all, other than the fact that we
don't spend as many evenings or weekends
here.
Then we will visit between 600 and 800 high
schools between the end of September and
the end of December. And then carry out all
the correspondence with first quarter
seniors. Hopefully, all that will result in ap
plications being in by early January. At which
point, we stop traveling, we stop interview-

ing, and we spend most of our waking hours
from January to the end of March reading and
evaluating the 10,000 freshman applications.
This includes long eveningsf
That includes many long evenings, and too
many weekends. But then we get it done, and
we feel a sigh of relief as we mail the letters
out. But it's not as if it's done. It keeps going
around.
How much do the applications change every
yearf
Actually, they don't change all that much.
We made some major revisions a few years
ago. It's little things, like trying to be sensitive
to the amount of time that teachers spend
writing recommendations. There's a point at
which, if every college asks too much, then
we're not going to get anything back at all.
But they haven't changed all that much.
And we haven't thought of a new essay ques
tion. We like an essay, because any applica
tion is like a set of nine or ten hooks, and
10,000 unknown applicants out there are
going to put their hat on several of those
hooks. But we don't know which ones ahead
of time. For some, it may be the essay.
We don't like questions that project right
or wrong answers. We really don't want the
applicants sitting there trying to figure out
what it is that the admissions people would
like to hear.
If you think of most essay questions that
you run across in applications to college, a lot
of them it seems to me would put applicants
into that position. "Who are your seven
heroes" or "Who would you have liked to
have been in the 19th century?" I guess I
worry a little bit that they would try to figure
out who Dean Hargadon would like to have
been in the 19th century, or who my seven
heroes would have been.
Or if you ask what books they've read, you
don't know what to do with the answer. If
they read them, you don't know what they
got out of them. It's very difficult to evaluate
that kind of question.
So ours is a rather open-ended essay, giv
ing them a hook which they may utilize and
which will help fill in the human part of the
applications.
A couple of years ago, President Richard
Lyman was somewhat concerned about
what you call the human aspect. He said grades
were getting so inflated, and recommendations
were getting so bland with the Buckley
Amendment that College Board scores were
about all that was left. Do you think that's much
of a problem, or do you think there's still room
for essays and meaningful recommendations.'
There is some evidence that grades are in
flated, but you can say that in general. It's a
little hard to say that in a specific case for a
specific student in a specific high school, ftut
you do get some concern because you see so
many straight-A students, and the range of
test scores for those students is so broad, that
you begin to wonder if the grades themselves
are inflated.
I've often said that if we had 10,000 applic
ants and none of them had As, we'd still be
admitting a freshman class.
The problem is that it's a little hard to jump

on the high schools because there was a feel
ing that even the most selective colleges
went through a period of grade inflation.
That's why we don't use any one measure.
We try and check grades against test scores
and against the quality of the academic prog
ram. That is, the number of academic solids a
student has taken in high school can vary a

great deal.
Vou don't even have to worry about grade
inflation to pick up the fact that two students
can have 4.0 averages, but one 4.0 would be
with 12 academic solids and one would be
with 20 over the same period of time.
And those discrepancies probably cause
most of the problems for us when we're ad
mitting and turning down students.
Some of them will write and say "How
could you turn down my son or daughter
witha3.9or4.o?" And we know, bylookingat
that academic program, that it was not all that
difficult to turn them down. They were in a
quite weak program, compared to the prog
ram that most of the applicants presented.
But the letters of recommendation — cer
tainly some of them have become more
bland. But many have not, and I think there is
a point at which both students and the
people they ask to write on their behalf sim
ply realize that it doesn't make much sense to
write a recommendation that is not going to
make any difference.
Most of our recommendations are not re
ally helpful, but you don't know ahead of
time which ones are going to be helpful. I've
often said that we feel like we've cornered
the market on saints when we read those
recommendations, because we just don't
remember any letters that say "Gee, don't
touch this guy with a 10-foot pole," or "Yeah,
this is a very mediocre student."
People will go out of their way — we've got
some favorite quotes we've pulled out —
teachers go out of their way to be positive.
And you get quotes like: "Mary is in the top
90 per cent of the students I've ever taught."
Or you get "John is in the top third quarter of
his class." They really go out of their way.
One real favorite of mine is that "Ralph's only
weakness is the lack of his own potential."
Which is a very roundabout way, but they try
and be positive, and I guess that's human
nature. In some ways, I guess it's kind of nice
it is that way."
Still, on occasion, the one letter you
wanted, or the one that kind of pulls things
together in a folder, will be the kind that
describes the student quite perceptively in a
way that you feel "Gee, that's a very interest
ing young man," or "a vecy interesting young
woman."
How many really unusual applications are
there that stick out, after all the years?
You get a little spoiled. Because an awful
lot stand out. You look at them and as an
admissions person, you become very hum
ble about what they've accomplished by 17 or
18.
You become quite impressed by the variety
of abilities in one person, particularly if the
variety of abilities is set within someone who
is quite modest or humble about it. It really
seems as if here's a person who can do an
awful lot of things well, and doesn't seem to
be cocky about it or even to know that that's
the case.
The really unusual applications — probably
less than a half dozen that I remember —
would be unusual in the sense that you really
wonder why they ever applied to Stanford, or
how they ever came to learn about us. And
it's usually someone out of a very remote set
of circumstances in the country.
Perhaps a really small town at a great dis
tance, where you wonder if anyone has ever
heard of Stanford. And you look at the intel
lectual abilities of the student and you realize
"My gosh, how did they ever get developed

this well, given the sets of circumstances?"
You're more likely to remember that, or a
really great essay. There was a really first rate
essay that came in this year, I thought, from a
young woman who had lived in a mountain
ous part of the South, and wrote in the dialect
of the area.
One, it was terribly well written, two, the
dialect, it seemed to me, was terribly well
done. But more than that, one gained an un
derstanding of what this young woman had
gotten out of her experience there. And
that'll stick in your mind as you go through.
What do you think the Bakke decision's going
to do, assuming we get one from the Supreme
Courtf
Well, I don't know. It will really depend on
how the court treats the question, whether
they treat it narrowly or broadly.
One of the problems I see in it is that there
are a lot of people who want the court to rule
against Bakke, so that all minority admissions
programs will be retained. It seems to me that
not enough thought has been given to the
fact that the court might well rule in favor of
Bakke, in which case the real question then
is: "How do we go about maintaining our
commitment to enroll more minority stu
dents?" That's something I worry about.
What sort of follow-up studies does your of
fice do, to see how the people you admit per
form?
Every once in a while, we'll look at the
people graduating and see if they graduate
with distinction, or honors, or Phi Beta Kappa
or whatever, and then relate that back to the
academic ratings we gave them when they
entered.
We do that more because we want to see if
we've got the ratings upside down: those
with our lowest ratings all Phi Beta
Kappa and those with our highest ratings —
well, obviously it doesn't turn out that way.
We've been sitting around with the dean of
undergraduate studies to see if there wasn't
some way we could get more feedback on the
kinds of considerations that we make, in
terms of how well they do here.
There are a lot of problems with that. The
easiest way is to look at freshman grades.
That's been the traditional validity study. You
get into real problems if you don't control for
the subject matter. That is, it seems pretty
clear to me that some subjects are more dif
ficult than others in which to get an A.
Also, it's not clear that first year is the only
year which you ought to look at. In fact, if
students, to get a lot out of their education,
believe everything we tell them in the catalog

arid believe everything we tell them on
Orientation Day, they probably wouldn't be
getting as good grades as they're getting
now.
They'd probably be experimenting, taking
subjects which they have no familiarity with.
They might really be getting quite a mixed set
of grades.
What would be of interest, of course,
would be to know how well they did over the
long haul, over the four years.
We're not sure of the role played by acci
dent in all of these things. If someone didn't
have a good freshman year, it may have no
thing to do with their academic credentials. It
may have more to do with a busted romance.
It takes a lot of time to study those things.
And you have to ask yourself: "Will you learn
enough through the study to justify all the
time and money spent on it?"
What sort of pressures does your office get
from coaches, trustees and other influential
people, and just where do these pressures leadf
Surprisingly few pressures, in the sense of
that term. We get an awful lot of inquiries,
and a lot of people, as you can imagine, write,
putting forth candidates. Most of the time,
they're simply well meaning. They really do
like the student, and would like to see them
at Stanford.
All we do is acknowledge the letter, and
thank them for it. We do, when asked, tell
them that we don't get any letters that aren't
positive, so it's a little hard to use that.
We've never been told to admit anybody.
That is, the administration, or the trustees or
the president has never said "We just have to
have this person." That's fortunate.
With the coaches, I would pressure me if I
were them. Because in some sense, they
"have got to be very interested in the skills and
talents of the athletes that are going to play
for them.
But we have a pretty clear understanding
that when it comes down to the decision
whether to admit or not, that's really our de
cision. We would like it to be an informed
one, in the sense of the abilities of the stu
dent, that they're really of the caliber that, all

things being equal, we can take that talent
into consideration.
And we ask the Athletic Department, and
the Music Department and the Art Depart
ment to let us know about exceptionally
talented students. Now, we don't take every
exceptionally talented student, obviously.
They obviously get disappointed by a lot of
our decisions, and they're probably happy
about some of them. Here, they operate
under far more restriction than most of the
schools we compete against in, say, athletics.
That is, this is actually one of the few places
where student/athletes actually have to fill

out applications and be admitted along with
everybody else.
Whereas at most schools they're in a special
group?
There's some question as to how it oper
ates at many schools.
What got you interested in going into admis
sions at Swarthmore in the first place? (Harga
don was a lecturer in political science at
Pennsylvania's Swarthmore College in the
early '60s, became dean of admissions there
in 7964, and then came here as admissions
dean in 1969.)
Well, I was teaching political science there,
and it happened that their dean left, and I
guess my name was proposed. At first, I said
"No, I'd like tocontinuetoteach." Andthen I
remembered that someone had let me into
college when I was 22, when I had come out
of the service.
I don't think I would be considered one of
Stanford's top candidates. I always say that
I'm perfectly comfortable with the notion
that I would not have admitted myself to
either Swarthmore or Stanford.
But I thought about it, one evening, and I
went back in and thought: "I really do owe
it." Because going to college made really a
big difference in my life.
So I went in and said "I'll do it, as long as I
can continue to teach." So I did both teach
ing and admissions at Swarthmore for four
years, and then I came out here. The job was
so enormous here that I just haven't had the
time to teach.
Partly, I liked it because it does give you the
opportunity to see many more kinds of in
teresting students than it would ever be
reasonable to admit to a school, or than I
would ever see in a classroom.
It's an interesting job. It allows you to be
fairly eclectic. You can justify reading almost
any kind of book or being interested in al
most any kind of subject in an almost
dilettante-ish way, on the grounds that you
are going to meet candidates. In that sense,
it's great for me, anyway.
How much longer do you think you'll keep
goingf
I don't think about it that way. I did not
grow up wanting to be a dean of admissions.
But I didn't grow up wanting to go to college
either.
I've let accident play a role in my life. That
is, I don't plan it out. It could be next year, or
it could be a couple of years.
