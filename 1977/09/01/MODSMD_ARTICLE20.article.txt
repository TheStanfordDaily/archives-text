# Freshman into senior: metamorphosis
## 
### 
Freshman year at Stanford.
That first day you wonder why
you were stupid enough to show
up. You feel outclassed and
ridiculous, standing alone in a
mob of everyone else's friends.
You're the only one without
perfect teeth, five tennis rackets
and 800s on the SAT.
Only you miss your first lec
ture because you can't find the
classroom.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) the folks next door
played Led Zeppelin until 4
a.m.; b) food service spaghetti
gave you indigestion; c) you
didn't study enough (at all) so
you hide in UGLY all day to avoid
embarrassing disaster.
Your room looks like Camp
Pendleton, your roommate like
Albert Einstein and the night
after orientation you start count
ing the days until Christmas.
Senior year at Stanford.
That first day you check out
the freshmen and wonder who
was crazy enough to let them in.
You are "at home" because
you recognize half the faces
around you. You can rattle off

Mem Chu, Hoo Tow, SLAC and
Dink as you plan the year's
"mick" classes and practical
jokes.
You miss your first class be
cause you're too hung over to
get out of bed.
You also miss test no. I be
cause a) you realize the course is
a lot harder than it's supposed to
be; b) your friends hit the beach
that day; c) you know the
teacher's aide and he'll let you
take the test later if you give him
a stab at a good excuse.
Your room looks like hell,
your roommates are licking the
lint off of the carpet and every
morning after you start counting
the hours until the next party.
Somewhere between
"freshmen" and "senior" lies
most of a sampling of up
perclassmen's opinions of Stan
ford learning and lifestyle.
They say they found their first
year on the Farm "full of knocks
and highs," and every year after
"great for doing what you
want."
"You come here expecting to

study and work like hell for
grades," said a pre-med senior.
"They tell you the pressure is
terrific, that only rich, smart kids
go there so watch out.
"The classes are tough but
there are easy ones too. And
some people are dumber than
you.
"That feeling of awe and wari
ness lasts two months."
By November of freshman
year, most students questioned
said they hit the pits of studying
like slaves and were ready to
realize that only the hard-core
grad-school-bound really have
to worry about grades.
"You decide you can get away
with living a little," said a junior
communication major. "Stan
ford becomes a great place to
taste the great college life.
"The important thing is to stay
in perspective. You've got to see
that games are great but play
them only when you can. If you
flunk out, you aren't helping
anybody."
Balancing work and play is the
hardest job for freshmen, up
perclassmen said. They called

"figuring what to do with your
self the toughest question of
first quarter."
"You reach a point where you
can become jock, nerd, partyer
or whatever," said a senior biol
ogy major. "You pick a rut then
dig deep."
"The roles help especially
when you've got to handle emo
tional problems like homesick
ness or pressure to achieve."
Though less than 20 per cent
of upperclassmen questioned
found freshman year "very un
settling emotionally," most said
"you get the jumps now and
then."
"You can't reconcile being
where you are with anything,"
explained a junior economics
major. "You want familiarity,
safety, home."
But "in that span from Sep
tember to March you change.
You grow a shell that protects
you from emotional problems. If
you don't, you've got trouble.
"You grow so much that if you
don't grow up, you'll go crazy."

Freshman year at Stanford.
That first day you wonder why
you were stupid enough to show
up. You feel outclassed and
ridiculous, standing alone in a
mob of everyone else's friends.
You're the only one without
perfect teeth, five tennis rackets
and 800s on the SAT.
Only you miss your first lec
ture because you can't find the
classroom.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) the folks next door
played Led Zeppelin until 4
a.m.; b) food service spaghetti
gave you indigestion; c) you
didn't study enough (at all) so
you hide in UGLY all day to avoid
embarrassing disaster.
Your room looks like Camp
Pendleton, your roommate like
Albert Einstein and the night
after orientation you start count
ing the days until Christmas.
Senior year at Stanford.
That first day you check out
the freshmen and wonder who
was crazy enough to let them in.
You are "at home" because
you recognize half the faces
around you. You can rattle off

Mem Chu, Hoo Tow, SLAC and
Dink as you plan the year's
"mick" classes and practical
jokes.
You miss your first class be
cause you're too hung over to
get out of bed.
You also miss test no. I be
cause a) you realize the course is
a lot harder than it's supposed to
be; b) your friends hit the beach
that day; c) you know the
teacher's aide and he'll let you
take the test later if you give him
a stab at a good excuse.
Your room looks like hell,
your roommates are licking the
lint off of the carpet and every
morning after you start counting
the hours until the next party.
