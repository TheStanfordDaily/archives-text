# Coach Walsh: 'We won't be an aerial circus'
## 
### 
"We will not be an aerial cir
cus. We're not depending on
the passing game to win," first
year Stanford football coach Bill
Walsh told writers in August.
Poker face and tongue in
cheek, the silver-haired Walsh
said, "We are going to throw less
this year than before."
Downplaying the role of the
air attack in Stanford's football
fortunes is an act of heresy at a
school which has produced such
top passing-oriented quarter
backs as Frankie Albert, )ohn
Brodie, Jim Plunkett and Don
Bunce.
Walsh's remarks seemed par
ticularly difficult to swallow con
sidering the circumstances
under which the Cardinals begin
the season:
—Walsh, for 10 years one of
the top offensive minds in the
National Football League and
the man responsible for the suc
cess of the passing games at Cin
cinnati and San Diego, has instal
led his sophisticated offensive
system with the Cardinals.
—Guy Benjamin, the top per
centage passer in Stanford his
tory, returns as the Cards' No. 1
signal caller.
—On a team plagued by lack
of depth, Stanford has a large
reservoir of talent at wide re
ceiver and tight end.
Paul Brown
While working under Paul
Brown at Cincinnati, Walsh de
veloped Greg Cook into the top
thrower in the NFL (1969) and tu
tored Ken Anderson to similar
distinction in 1974 and 1975.
In four of his eight years at
Cincinnati, the Bengals led the
American Football Conference
in passing.

This season Walsh will build
his offense around the 6-foot-4
Benjamin.
"I've worked with a lot of
good quarterbacks in the pros,
and I thought I might have to
readjust my expectations when i
came here," Walsh said. "But
Benjamin has taught me other
wise. He's a super quarterback
both mentally and physically."
Benjamin, who completed 170
of 295 passes last season, split
his time between the bench and
the field during the quarterback
gaffe of the last three seasons.
Backfield coach Denny Green
said, "The entire staff has been
impressed with Guy. He throws
with speed on the ball but it is
easy to catch and handle."
Learning ability
"I've been most impressed
with his ability to learn our of
fensive system. It is important
that Guy develops confidence in
the system and get that confid
ence across to the rest of the of
fense," Green said.
Last year's coaching staff often
questioned Benjamin's leader
ship qualities. Green said, how
ever, that Benjamin never mis
sed a winter workout and as
sumed a leadership role at
spring practice.
Benjamin will have a large
number of targets available to
throw the ball to during the au
tumn campaign.
Walsh hopes that foremost
among them will be lames Lof
ton, a talented athlete who will
give Stanford's its deep threat.
Lofton caught 12 passes for
four touchdowns last season.
Walsh said he hopes that
6-foot-3 speedster can do the
same thing for the Cards that

Isaac Curtis did for the Cincin
nati Bengals: provide them with
a scoring threat from anywhere
on the field.
Bill Kellar, Stanford's No. 2
pass receiver last season with 34
receptions, will hold down the
other starting spot. Vince Mul
roy, who had 18 receptions last
season, junior college transfer
Kerry Schimpf and freshmen
Ken Magerum and Larry Harris
will also see action at wide re
ceiver.
Tight end
At tight end four players will
battle throughout the season for
the starting position. Mitch
Pleis, a junior college transfer,
emerged after spring practice
with the edge on the starting
nod. By Saturday's Illinois con
test the position could be any
one's.
Mark "Tree" Hoaglin, a
6-foot-8 senior, started at tight
end last season. He is coming off
a knee operation and will not re
linquish the starting job without
a fight. Also contending for the
spot are junior Marty Smith and
sophomore Pat Bowe.
The offensive line must pro
tect Benjamin and allow the
gifted quarterback time to
throw. But the line is short of
depth and it is crucial for Stan
ford that the line remains heal
thy.
"There are those who say you
can't be mean and play the of
fensive line," Coach Green said.
"Well, they haven't seen Gordy
King."
The 6-foot-6, 265-pound
tackle, a starter in every game
the last two years, anchors Stan
ford's line.
Adding beef to the line, 260-
pound sophomore Brent Saylor
will start next to King at left
guard. The early season will be a
critical proving ground for
Saylor who has only 48 minutes
of varsity playing time.
Center
Senior Dan McCann will start
at center this season as last
year's center, Mark Hill, has
moved to right guard. Hill, who
suffered an illness that left him
temporarily paralyzed last
spring, reportedly has reco
vered completely.
junior college transfer Gene
Engle will start at the right tackle
slot.
Freshman Brian Holloway (6-7,

250 pounds) and junior George
Kerekes (6-3, 250 pounds) will
back up Kingand Engleattackle.
For Stanford to contend, the
passing attack will have to be
complemented by an adequate
running game. And rarely has
Stanford has a ground attack to
write home about.
This year the fortunes of the
running game center on fullback
Phil Francis who had an out
standing spring before suffering
a shoulder injury. The No. 2
ground gainer for the Cards last
season, Francis will play
alongside one of four halfbacks
— Gary Lynn, Billie Anderson,
Gordon Banks or Darrin Nelson.
Starter
Lynn will start at halfback but
will have to share time with An
derson and the lightning quick
Banks and Nelson.
John Finley, who had an out
standing session his sophomore
year before slumping to a poor
performance last fall, will spell
Francis at fullback.

While offensive fortunes will
rise and fall with Benjamin, the
defense will be spearheaded by
Cordy Ceresino from his mid
dle linebacker spot.
Defensive line coach Fred
VonAppen termed Ceresino
"the bell cow" of the defense.
Ceresino made 159 tackles last
season, including 24 against San
lose State. Ceresino also had
three interceptions last season.
Third-season starter Ray Car
dinal and sophomore Terry Re
nnaker will flank Ceresino as the
weak and strong side backers at
the beginning of the season.
Andy Sickmeier and Tony Mitre,
both junior college transfers,
and four top freshman recruits
will contest for the linebacking
spots.
The Cardinals lost three start
ing defensive linemen from last
year's squad, including All -
American Duncan McColl, but
have three experienced players
returning to fortify the line.
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
will hold down the end positions

while senior Geoff Kieburtz and
inexperienced sophomore Dan
Floyd will start at tackles.
Secondary
"The pass defense here has
needed improvement the last
couple years," Walsh said in Au
gust.
Stanford fans often voiced
that same sentiment during jack
Christiansen's last two seasons.
Three starters return to a sec
ondary which last year ranked
seventh in the Pacific-8 in pas
sing defense. Walsh apparently
believes that new defensive
backfield coach George Seifert,
head coach for the last two sea
son at Cornell, will redirect the
fortunes of the Stanford secon
dary.
Returning to the defensive
backfield are junior cornerbacks
Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson and senior safety
Ralph Phillips. Walk-on |oe St.
Geme has the inside track on the
other safety spot despite no var
sity experience.

Of the remaining defensive
backs, only John Pigott has any
varsity experience. Injuries in
this area will prove costly.
Ken Naber, who averaged 42
yards a punt in high school last
year and hit 85 of 89 point after
attempts his last two prep sea
sons, is the main player in Stan
ford's kicking picture. Roger
May, a red-shirt last season, will
vie for the place-kicking job.
Vital returns
Walsh said, "The return game
will be vital for us. We need the
big play."
The Cards will look to Banks
and Nelson to provide that big
play.
"We'll approach the season
with no stars in our eyes," Walsh
said. "Each game will be a sea
son for us. We can't have crucial
games — we have to play each
game in a similar manner."
Walsh concluded his August
press luncheon by saying, "We
can go on and on but we haven't
played yet."

can't be mean and play the of
fensive line," Coach Green said.
"Well, they haven't seen Gordy
King."
The 6-foot-6, 265-pound
tackle, a starter in every game
the last two years, anchors Stan
ford's line.
Adding beef to the line, 260-
pound sophomore Brent Saylor
will start next to King at left
guard. The early season will be a
critical proving ground for
Saylor who has only 48 minutes
of varsity playing time.
Center
Senior Dan McCann will start
at center this season as last
year's center, Mark Hill, has
moved to right guard. Hill, who
suffered an illness that left him
temporarily paralyzed last
spring, reportedly has reco
vered completely.
junior college transfer Gene
Engle will start at the right tackle
slot.
Freshman Brian Holloway (6-7,

250 pounds) and junior George
Kerekes (6-3, 250 pounds) will
back up Kingand Engleattackle.
For Stanford to contend, the
passing attack will have to be
complemented by an adequate
running game. And rarely has
Stanford has a ground attack to
write home about.
This year the fortunes of the
running game center on fullback
Phil Francis who had an out
standing spring before suffering
a shoulder injury. The No. 2
ground gainer for the Cards last
season, Francis will play
alongside one of four halfbacks
— Gary Lynn, Billie Anderson,
Gordon Banks or Darrin Nelson.
Starter
Lynn will start at halfback but
will have to share time with An
derson and the lightning quick
Banks and Nelson.
John Finley, who had an out
standing session his sophomore
year before slumping to a poor
performance last fall, will spell
Francis at fullback.

While offensive fortunes will
rise and fall with Benjamin, the
defense will be spearheaded by
Cordy Ceresino from his mid
dle linebacker spot.
Defensive line coach Fred
VonAppen termed Ceresino
"the bell cow" of the defense.
Ceresino made 159 tackles last
season, including 24 against San
lose State. Ceresino also had
three interceptions last season.
Third-season starter Ray Car
dinal and sophomore Terry Re
nnaker will flank Ceresino as the
weak and strong side backers at
the beginning of the season.
Andy Sickmeier and Tony Mitre,
both junior college transfers,
and four top freshman recruits
will contest for the linebacking
spots.
The Cardinals lost three start
ing defensive linemen from last
year's squad, including All -
American Duncan McColl, but
have three experienced players
returning to fortify the line.
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
will hold down the end positions

while senior Geoff Kieburtz and
inexperienced sophomore Dan
Floyd will start at tackles.
Secondary
"The pass defense here has
needed improvement the last
couple years," Walsh said in Au
gust.
Stanford fans often voiced
that same sentiment during jack
Christiansen's last two seasons.
Three starters return to a sec
ondary which last year ranked
seventh in the Pacific-8 in pas
sing defense. Walsh apparently
believes that new defensive
backfield coach George Seifert,
head coach for the last two sea
son at Cornell, will redirect the
fortunes of the Stanford secon
dary.
Returning to the defensive
backfield are junior cornerbacks
Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson and senior safety
Ralph Phillips. Walk-on |oe St.
Geme has the inside track on the
other safety spot despite no var
sity experience.

Of the remaining defensive
backs, only John Pigott has any
varsity experience. Injuries in
this area will prove costly.
Ken Naber, who averaged 42
yards a punt in high school last
year and hit 85 of 89 point after
attempts his last two prep sea
sons, is the main player in Stan
ford's kicking picture. Roger
May, a red-shirt last season, will
vie for the place-kicking job.
Vital returns
Walsh said, "The return game
will be vital for us. We need the
big play."
The Cards will look to Banks
and Nelson to provide that big
play.
"We'll approach the season
with no stars in our eyes," Walsh
said. "Each game will be a sea
son for us. We can't have crucial
games — we have to play each
game in a similar manner."
Walsh concluded his August
press luncheon by saying, "We
can go on and on but we haven't
played yet."

Gordy Ceresino
"We will not be an aerial cir
cus. We're not depending on
the passing game to win," first
year Stanford football coach Bill
Walsh told writers in August.
Poker face and tongue in
cheek, the silver-haired Walsh
said, "We are going to throw less
this year than before."
Downplaying the role of the
air attack in Stanford's football
fortunes is an act of heresy at a
school which has produced such
top passing-oriented quarter
backs as Frankie Albert, )ohn
Brodie, Jim Plunkett and Don
Bunce.
Walsh's remarks seemed par
ticularly difficult to swallow con
sidering the circumstances
under which the Cardinals begin
the season:
—Walsh, for 10 years one of
the top offensive minds in the
National Football League and
the man responsible for the suc
cess of the passing games at Cin
cinnati and San Diego, has instal
led his sophisticated offensive
system with the Cardinals.
—Guy Benjamin, the top per
centage passer in Stanford his
tory, returns as the Cards' No. 1
signal caller.
—On a team plagued by lack
of depth, Stanford has a large
reservoir of talent at wide re
ceiver and tight end.
Paul Brown
While working under Paul
Brown at Cincinnati, Walsh de
veloped Greg Cook into the top
thrower in the NFL (1969) and tu
tored Ken Anderson to similar
distinction in 1974 and 1975.
In four of his eight years at
Cincinnati, the Bengals led the
American Football Conference
in passing.

This season Walsh will build
his offense around the 6-foot-4
Benjamin.
"I've worked with a lot of
good quarterbacks in the pros,
and I thought I might have to
readjust my expectations when i
came here," Walsh said. "But
Benjamin has taught me other
wise. He's a super quarterback
both mentally and physically."
Benjamin, who completed 170
of 295 passes last season, split
his time between the bench and
the field during the quarterback
gaffe of the last three seasons.
Backfield coach Denny Green
said, "The entire staff has been
impressed with Guy. He throws
with speed on the ball but it is
easy to catch and handle."
Learning ability
"I've been most impressed
with his ability to learn our of
fensive system. It is important
that Guy develops confidence in
the system and get that confid
ence across to the rest of the of
fense," Green said.
Last year's coaching staff often
questioned Benjamin's leader
ship qualities. Green said, how
ever, that Benjamin never mis
sed a winter workout and as
sumed a leadership role at
spring practice.
Benjamin will have a large
number of targets available to
throw the ball to during the au
tumn campaign.
Walsh hopes that foremost
among them will be lames Lof
ton, a talented athlete who will
give Stanford's its deep threat.
Lofton caught 12 passes for
four touchdowns last season.
Walsh said he hopes that
6-foot-3 speedster can do the
same thing for the Cards that

Isaac Curtis did for the Cincin
nati Bengals: provide them with
a scoring threat from anywhere
on the field.
Bill Kellar, Stanford's No. 2
pass receiver last season with 34
receptions, will hold down the
other starting spot. Vince Mul
roy, who had 18 receptions last
season, junior college transfer
Kerry Schimpf and freshmen
Ken Magerum and Larry Harris
will also see action at wide re
ceiver.
Tight end
At tight end four players will
battle throughout the season for
the starting position. Mitch
Pleis, a junior college transfer,
emerged after spring practice
with the edge on the starting
nod. By Saturday's Illinois con
test the position could be any
one's.
Mark "Tree" Hoaglin, a
6-foot-8 senior, started at tight
end last season. He is coming off
a knee operation and will not re
linquish the starting job without
a fight. Also contending for the
spot are junior Marty Smith and
sophomore Pat Bowe.
The offensive line must pro
tect Benjamin and allow the
gifted quarterback time to
throw. But the line is short of
depth and it is crucial for Stan
ford that the line remains heal
thy.
"There are those who say you
can't be mean and play the of
fensive line," Coach Green said.
"Well, they haven't seen Gordy

press luncheon by saying, "We
can go on and on but we haven't

"We will not be an aerial cir
cus. We're not depending on
the passing game to win," first
year Stanford football coach Bill
Walsh told writers in August.
Poker face and tongue in
cheek, the silver-haired Walsh
said, "We are going to throw less
this year than before."
Downplaying the role of the
air attack in Stanford's football
fortunes is an act of heresy at a
school which has produced such
top passing-oriented quarter
backs as Frankie Albert, )ohn
Brodie, Jim Plunkett and Don
Bunce.
Walsh's remarks seemed par
ticularly difficult to swallow con
sidering the circumstances
under which the Cardinals begin
the season:
—Walsh, for 10 years one of
the top offensive minds in the
National Football League and
the man responsible for the suc
cess of the passing games at Cin
cinnati and San Diego, has instal
led his sophisticated offensive
system with the Cardinals.
—Guy Benjamin, the top per
centage passer in Stanford his
tory, returns as the Cards' No. 1
signal caller.
—On a team plagued by lack
of depth, Stanford has a large
reservoir of talent at wide re
ceiver and tight end.
Paul Brown
While working under Paul
Brown at Cincinnati, Walsh de
veloped Greg Cook into the top
thrower in the NFL (1969) and tu
tored Ken Anderson to similar
distinction in 1974 and 1975.
In four of his eight years at
Cincinnati, the Bengals led the
American Football Conference
in passing.

This season Walsh will build
his offense around the 6-foot-4
Benjamin.
"I've worked with a lot of
good quarterbacks in the pros,
and I thought I might have to
readjust my expectations when i
came here," Walsh said. "But
Benjamin has taught me other
wise. He's a super quarterback
both mentally and physically."
Benjamin, who completed 170
of 295 passes last season, split
his time between the bench and
the field during the quarterback
gaffe of the last three seasons.
Backfield coach Denny Green
said, "The entire staff has been
impressed with Guy. He throws
with speed on the ball but it is
easy to catch and handle."
Learning ability
"I've been most impressed
with his ability to learn our of
fensive system. It is important
that Guy develops confidence in
the system and get that confid
ence across to the rest of the of
fense," Green said.
Last year's coaching staff often
questioned Benjamin's leader
ship qualities. Green said, how
ever, that Benjamin never mis
sed a winter workout and as
sumed a leadership role at
spring practice.
Benjamin will have a large
number of targets available to
throw the ball to during the au
tumn campaign.
Walsh hopes that foremost
among them will be lames Lof
ton, a talented athlete who will
give Stanford's its deep threat.
Lofton caught 12 passes for
four touchdowns last season.
Walsh said he hopes that
6-foot-3 speedster can do the
same thing for the Cards that

Isaac Curtis did for the Cincin
nati Bengals: provide them with
a scoring threat from anywhere
on the field.
Bill Kellar, Stanford's No. 2
pass receiver last season with 34
receptions, will hold down the
other starting spot. Vince Mul
roy, who had 18 receptions last
season, junior college transfer
Kerry Schimpf and freshmen
Ken Magerum and Larry Harris
will also see action at wide re
ceiver.
Tight end
At tight end four players will
battle throughout the season for
the starting position. Mitch
Pleis, a junior college transfer,
emerged after spring practice
with the edge on the starting
nod. By Saturday's Illinois con
test the position could be any
one's.
Mark "Tree" Hoaglin, a
6-foot-8 senior, started at tight
end last season. He is coming off
a knee operation and will not re
linquish the starting job without
a fight. Also contending for the
spot are junior Marty Smith and
sophomore Pat Bowe.
The offensive line must pro
tect Benjamin and allow the
gifted quarterback time to
throw. But the line is short of
depth and it is crucial for Stan
ford that the line remains heal
thy.
"There are those who say you
can't be mean and play the of
fensive line," Coach Green said.
"Well, they haven't seen Gordy
King."
The 6-foot-6, 265-pound
tackle, a starter in every game
the last two years, anchors Stan
ford's line.
Adding beef to the line, 260-
pound sophomore Brent Saylor
will start next to King at left
guard. The early season will be a
critical proving ground for
Saylor who has only 48 minutes
of varsity playing time.
Center
Senior Dan McCann will start
at center this season as last
year's center, Mark Hill, has
moved to right guard. Hill, who
suffered an illness that left him
temporarily paralyzed last
spring, reportedly has reco
vered completely.
junior college transfer Gene
Engle will start at the right tackle
slot.
Freshman Brian Holloway (6-7,

250 pounds) and junior George
Kerekes (6-3, 250 pounds) will
back up Kingand Engleattackle.
For Stanford to contend, the
passing attack will have to be
complemented by an adequate
running game. And rarely has
Stanford has a ground attack to
write home about.
This year the fortunes of the
running game center on fullback
Phil Francis who had an out
standing spring before suffering
a shoulder injury. The No. 2
ground gainer for the Cards last
season, Francis will play
alongside one of four halfbacks
— Gary Lynn, Billie Anderson,
Gordon Banks or Darrin Nelson.
Starter
Lynn will start at halfback but
will have to share time with An
derson and the lightning quick
Banks and Nelson.
John Finley, who had an out
standing session his sophomore
year before slumping to a poor
performance last fall, will spell
Francis at fullback.

While offensive fortunes will
rise and fall with Benjamin, the
defense will be spearheaded by
Cordy Ceresino from his mid
dle linebacker spot.
Defensive line coach Fred
VonAppen termed Ceresino
"the bell cow" of the defense.
Ceresino made 159 tackles last
season, including 24 against San
lose State. Ceresino also had
three interceptions last season.
Third-season starter Ray Car
dinal and sophomore Terry Re
nnaker will flank Ceresino as the
weak and strong side backers at
the beginning of the season.
Andy Sickmeier and Tony Mitre,
both junior college transfers,
and four top freshman recruits
will contest for the linebacking
spots.
The Cardinals lost three start
ing defensive linemen from last
year's squad, including All -
American Duncan McColl, but
have three experienced players
returning to fortify the line.
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
will hold down the end positions

while senior Geoff Kieburtz and
inexperienced sophomore Dan
Floyd will start at tackles.
Secondary
"The pass defense here has
needed improvement the last
couple years," Walsh said in Au
gust.
Stanford fans often voiced
that same sentiment during jack
Christiansen's last two seasons.
Three starters return to a sec
ondary which last year ranked
seventh in the Pacific-8 in pas
sing defense. Walsh apparently
believes that new defensive
backfield coach George Seifert,
head coach for the last two sea
son at Cornell, will redirect the
fortunes of the Stanford secon
dary.
Returning to the defensive
backfield are junior cornerbacks
Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson and senior safety
Ralph Phillips. Walk-on |oe St.
Geme has the inside track on the
other safety spot despite no var
sity experience.

Of the remaining defensive
backs, only John Pigott has any
varsity experience. Injuries in
this area will prove costly.
Ken Naber, who averaged 42
yards a punt in high school last
year and hit 85 of 89 point after
attempts his last two prep sea
sons, is the main player in Stan
ford's kicking picture. Roger
May, a red-shirt last season, will
vie for the place-kicking job.
Vital returns
Walsh said, "The return game
will be vital for us. We need the
big play."
The Cards will look to Banks
and Nelson to provide that big
play.
"We'll approach the season
with no stars in our eyes," Walsh
said. "Each game will be a sea
son for us. We can't have crucial
games — we have to play each
game in a similar manner."
Walsh concluded his August
press luncheon by saying, "We
can go on and on but we haven't
played yet."

depth and it is crucial for Stan
ford that the line remains heal
thy.
"There are those who say you
can't be mean and play the of
fensive line," Coach Green said.
"Well, they haven't seen Gordy
King."
The 6-foot-6, 265-pound
tackle, a starter in every game
the last two years, anchors Stan
ford's line.
Adding beef to the line, 260-
pound sophomore Brent Saylor
will start next to King at left
guard. The early season will be a
critical proving ground for
Saylor who has only 48 minutes
of varsity playing time.
Center
Senior Dan McCann will start
at center this season as last
year's center, Mark Hill, has
moved to right guard. Hill, who
suffered an illness that left him
temporarily paralyzed last
spring, reportedly has reco
vered completely.
junior college transfer Gene
Engle will start at the right tackle
slot.
Freshman Brian Holloway (6-7,

250 pounds) and junior George
Kerekes (6-3, 250 pounds) will
back up Kingand Engleattackle.
For Stanford to contend, the
passing attack will have to be
complemented by an adequate
running game. And rarely has
Stanford has a ground attack to
write home about.
This year the fortunes of the
running game center on fullback
Phil Francis who had an out
standing spring before suffering
a shoulder injury. The No. 2
ground gainer for the Cards last
season, Francis will play
alongside one of four halfbacks
— Gary Lynn, Billie Anderson,
Gordon Banks or Darrin Nelson.
Starter
Lynn will start at halfback but
will have to share time with An
derson and the lightning quick
Banks and Nelson.
John Finley, who had an out
standing session his sophomore
year before slumping to a poor
performance last fall, will spell
Francis at fullback.

While offensive fortunes will
rise and fall with Benjamin, the
defense will be spearheaded by
Cordy Ceresino from his mid
dle linebacker spot.
Defensive line coach Fred
VonAppen termed Ceresino
"the bell cow" of the defense.
Ceresino made 159 tackles last
season, including 24 against San
lose State. Ceresino also had
three interceptions last season.
Third-season starter Ray Car
dinal and sophomore Terry Re
nnaker will flank Ceresino as the
weak and strong side backers at
the beginning of the season.
Andy Sickmeier and Tony Mitre,
both junior college transfers,
and four top freshman recruits
will contest for the linebacking
spots.
The Cardinals lost three start
ing defensive linemen from last
year's squad, including All -
American Duncan McColl, but
have three experienced players
returning to fortify the line.
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
will hold down the end positions

while senior Geoff Kieburtz and
inexperienced sophomore Dan
Floyd will start at tackles.
Secondary
"The pass defense here has
needed improvement the last
couple years," Walsh said in Au
gust.
Stanford fans often voiced
that same sentiment during jack
Christiansen's last two seasons.
Three starters return to a sec
ondary which last year ranked
seventh in the Pacific-8 in pas
sing defense. Walsh apparently
believes that new defensive
backfield coach George Seifert,
head coach for the last two sea
son at Cornell, will redirect the
fortunes of the Stanford secon
dary.
Returning to the defensive
backfield are junior cornerbacks
Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson and senior safety
Ralph Phillips. Walk-on |oe St.
Geme has the inside track on the
other safety spot despite no var
sity experience.

Of the remaining defensive
backs, only John Pigott has any
varsity experience. Injuries in
this area will prove costly.
Ken Naber, who averaged 42
yards a punt in high school last
year and hit 85 of 89 point after
attempts his last two prep sea
sons, is the main player in Stan
ford's kicking picture. Roger
May, a red-shirt last season, will
vie for the place-kicking job.
Vital returns
Walsh said, "The return game
will be vital for us. We need the
big play."
The Cards will look to Banks
and Nelson to provide that big
play.
"We'll approach the season
with no stars in our eyes," Walsh
said. "Each game will be a sea
son for us. We can't have crucial
games — we have to play each
game in a similar manner."
Walsh concluded his August
press luncheon by saying, "We
can go on and on but we haven't
played yet."

Gordy Ceresino
"We will not be an aerial cir
cus. We're not depending on
the passing game to win," first
year Stanford football coach Bill
Walsh told writers in August.
Poker face and tongue in
cheek, the silver-haired Walsh
said, "We are going to throw less
this year than before."
Downplaying the role of the
air attack in Stanford's football
fortunes is an act of heresy at a
school which has produced such
top passing-oriented quarter
backs as Frankie Albert, )ohn
Brodie, Jim Plunkett and Don
Bunce.
Walsh's remarks seemed par
ticularly difficult to swallow con
sidering the circumstances
under which the Cardinals begin
the season:
—Walsh, for 10 years one of
the top offensive minds in the
National Football League and
the man responsible for the suc
cess of the passing games at Cin
cinnati and San Diego, has instal
led his sophisticated offensive
system with the Cardinals.
—Guy Benjamin, the top per
centage passer in Stanford his
tory, returns as the Cards' No. 1
signal caller.
—On a team plagued by lack
of depth, Stanford has a large
reservoir of talent at wide re
ceiver and tight end.
Paul Brown
While working under Paul
Brown at Cincinnati, Walsh de
veloped Greg Cook into the top
thrower in the NFL (1969) and tu
tored Ken Anderson to similar
distinction in 1974 and 1975.
In four of his eight years at
Cincinnati, the Bengals led the
American Football Conference
in passing.

This season Walsh will build
his offense around the 6-foot-4
Benjamin.
"I've worked with a lot of
good quarterbacks in the pros,
and I thought I might have to
readjust my expectations when i
came here," Walsh said. "But
Benjamin has taught me other
wise. He's a super quarterback
both mentally and physically."
Benjamin, who completed 170
of 295 passes last season, split
his time between the bench and
the field during the quarterback
gaffe of the last three seasons.
Backfield coach Denny Green
said, "The entire staff has been
impressed with Guy. He throws
with speed on the ball but it is
easy to catch and handle."
Learning ability
"I've been most impressed
with his ability to learn our of
fensive system. It is important
that Guy develops confidence in
the system and get that confid
ence across to the rest of the of
fense," Green said.
Last year's coaching staff often
questioned Benjamin's leader
ship qualities. Green said, how
ever, that Benjamin never mis
sed a winter workout and as
sumed a leadership role at
spring practice.
Benjamin will have a large
number of targets available to
throw the ball to during the au
tumn campaign.
Walsh hopes that foremost
among them will be lames Lof
ton, a talented athlete who will
give Stanford's its deep threat.
Lofton caught 12 passes for
four touchdowns last season.
Walsh said he hopes that
6-foot-3 speedster can do the
same thing for the Cards that

Isaac Curtis did for the Cincin
nati Bengals: provide them with
a scoring threat from anywhere
on the field.
Bill Kellar, Stanford's No. 2
pass receiver last season with 34
receptions, will hold down the
other starting spot. Vince Mul
roy, who had 18 receptions last
season, junior college transfer
Kerry Schimpf and freshmen
Ken Magerum and Larry Harris
will also see action at wide re
ceiver.
Tight end
At tight end four players will
battle throughout the season for
the starting position. Mitch
Pleis, a junior college transfer,
emerged after spring practice
with the edge on the starting
nod. By Saturday's Illinois con
test the position could be any
one's.
Mark "Tree" Hoaglin, a
6-foot-8 senior, started at tight
end last season. He is coming off
a knee operation and will not re
linquish the starting job without
a fight. Also contending for the
spot are junior Marty Smith and
sophomore Pat Bowe.
The offensive line must pro
tect Benjamin and allow the
gifted quarterback time to
throw. But the line is short of
depth and it is crucial for Stan
ford that the line remains heal
thy.
"There are those who say you
can't be mean and play the of
