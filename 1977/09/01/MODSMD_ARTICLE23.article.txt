# Recruiting a success on three new fronts
## 
### 
"This year compares favorably
with the best recruiting years
Stanford has had," first-year
Stanford grid mentor Bill Walsh
said in August.
Walsh, appointed Cardinal
football coach just two months
before the national letter of in
tent signing date, landed 26
freshmen and eight junior col
lege players during the winter
recruiting wars.
Offensive line coach Doug
Single, last season's recruiting
coordinator, this summer said

that the difference between a
"very good" and a "very
mediocre" season will be how
much freshmen are able to con
tribute this fall.
And how much they are able
to help will "depend on their
quickness picking up the sys
tem," Single said.
Immediate contribution
The fledgling Stanford players
are being looked at for im
mediate contributions to the
kicking game, the linebacking
corps and possibly at running
back and wide receiver.
Among the freshmen ex
pected to help the varsity in their
first year on the Farm are Ken
Naber, punter-place kicker;
Brian Holloway, offensive
tackle; Larry Harris, wide re
ceiver; Darrin Nelson, halfback;
Ken Magerum, wide receiver;
and Bob Boxold, linebacker.
The new recruiting strategy
which reaped this bumper crop
of freshmen featured:
—a concentrated effort to re
cruit well in southern California;
— a move to a nationwide re
cruiting campaign;
— an emphasis on improving
overall team speed;
— a belief that Stanford can
successfully recruit talented
black athletes from the inner

city.
"We had to hit southern
California hard," Walsh said.
"We have to challenge (JSC and
UCLA for top southern Califor
nian players."
Success
Stanford successfully com
peted with its two Los Angeles
rivals for talent in their backyard
—15 of the 26 freshmen recruits
come from southern California.
In addition, several of the new
Cards are players who headed
Southern Cal's list of most
wanted recruits.
Stanford was also successful
in its effort to recruit on a na
tional basis. The 11 freshmen
who did not come out of south
ern California are from out of
state, representing eight diffe
rent states.
Partially underlying the na
tional recruiting strategy is the
realization by Stanford coaches
that out-of-state players are
going to have a better chance to
get through the school's admis
sions department.
A recruit from California may
be one of a dozen students from
his school applying for admis
sion to Stanford. If he ranks
seventh or eighth among those
12 the admissions staff may
bypass him.

On the other hand, if a recruit
is from Nebraska, he may be the
only one in his high school class
applying at Stanford. He will
therefore rank first among the
people from his school applying
to Stanford.
Northern California
As successful as the recruiting
went nationally and in southern
California, it made no inroads
in northern California.
Most importantly, the Cards
lost Pat Graham, a mammoth
lineman, and Rich Campbell, a
talented 6-foot-5 quarterback, to
California.
"We restructured our recruit
ing list to improve team speed,"
Single said. "Size was not impor
tant."
"We need speed not size,"
Walsh reiterated. "We want men
that can move."
Apparently they found them.
It almost appeared that the
football staff was trying to fill
track coach Payton Jordan's
Christmas list.
Wide receiver Larry Harris
runs a 4.5-second 40 and won the
Kansas prep title for the 180-yard
low hurdles. He also finished
second in the state meet in the
220 where he has a best of 21.8.
Arizona sprinter
Running back Darrin Nelson

has a 100-yard dash best of 9.6
seconds and frosh teammate
Mark Taylor was one of the top
prep sprinters in Arizona last
year.
Rick Gervais, an Oregonian
speedster, finished fifth in the
state meet in the 100 and third in
the 220.
Ken Magerum, who has a 100
best of 9.8, finished second in
the California prep meet's 120-
yard high hurdles final with a
13.7 clocking.
In addition to speed, Stanford
went after another commodity
of which they had a short supply
— talented black gridders from
the cities.
"We placed an emphasis on
recruiting black athletes,"
Single said. "We've been negli
gent in this area in the past."
Single added that Denny
Green and Russ Charles, both
black coaches on the new coach
ing staff, were playing the major
roles in recruiting inner-city
athletes.
The effort yielded Robbie
Chapman, Andre Tyler, Harris
and Nelson.
"We have missed the inner
city kids," Single said. "It's been
easy to ignore them in the past."
The times they are a changin'.

peted with its two Los Angeles
rivals for talent in their backyard
—15 of the 26 freshmen recruits
come from southern California.
In addition, several of the new
Cards are players who headed
Southern Cal's list of most
wanted recruits.
Stanford was also successful
in its effort to recruit on a na
tional basis. The 11 freshmen
who did not come out of south
ern California are from out of
state, representing eight diffe
rent states.
Partially underlying the na
tional recruiting strategy is the
realization by Stanford coaches
that out-of-state players are
going to have a better chance to
get through the school's admis
sions department.
A recruit from California may
be one of a dozen students from
his school applying for admis
sion to Stanford. If he ranks
seventh or eighth among those
12 the admissions staff may
bypass him.

On the other hand, if a recruit
is from Nebraska, he may be the
only one in his high school class
applying at Stanford. He will
therefore rank first among the
people from his school applying
to Stanford.
Northern California
As successful as the recruiting
went nationally and in southern
California, it made no inroads
in northern California.
Most importantly, the Cards
lost Pat Graham, a mammoth
lineman, and Rich Campbell, a
talented 6-foot-5 quarterback, to
California.
"We restructured our recruit
ing list to improve team speed,"
Single said. "Size was not impor
tant."
"We need speed not size,"
Walsh reiterated. "We want men
that can move."
Apparently they found them.
It almost appeared that the
football staff was trying to fill
track coach Payton Jordan's
Christmas list.
Wide receiver Larry Harris
runs a 4.5-second 40 and won the
Kansas prep title for the 180-yard
low hurdles. He also finished
second in the state meet in the
220 where he has a best of 21.8.
Arizona sprinter
Running back Darrin Nelson

has a 100-yard dash best of 9.6
seconds and frosh teammate
Mark Taylor was one of the top
prep sprinters in Arizona last
year.
Rick Gervais, an Oregonian
speedster, finished fifth in the
state meet in the 100 and third in
the 220.
Ken Magerum, who has a 100
best of 9.8, finished second in
the California prep meet's 120-
yard high hurdles final with a
13.7 clocking.
In addition to speed, Stanford
went after another commodity
of which they had a short supply
— talented black gridders from
the cities.
"We placed an emphasis on
recruiting black athletes,"
Single said. "We've been negli
gent in this area in the past."
Single added that Denny
Green and Russ Charles, both
black coaches on the new coach
ing staff, were playing the major
roles in recruiting inner-city
athletes.
The effort yielded Robbie
Chapman, Andre Tyler, Harris
and Nelson.
"We have missed the inner
city kids," Single said. "It's been
easy to ignore them in the past."
The times they are a changin'.
"This year compares favorably
with the best recruiting years
Stanford has had," first-year
Stanford grid mentor Bill Walsh
said in August.
Walsh, appointed Cardinal
football coach just two months
before the national letter of in
tent signing date, landed 26
freshmen and eight junior col
lege players during the winter
recruiting wars.
Offensive line coach Doug
Single, last season's recruiting
coordinator, this summer said

that the difference between a
"very good" and a "very
mediocre" season will be how
much freshmen are able to con
tribute this fall.
And how much they are able
to help will "depend on their
quickness picking up the sys
tem," Single said.
Immediate contribution
The fledgling Stanford players
are being looked at for im
mediate contributions to the
kicking game, the linebacking
corps and possibly at running
back and wide receiver.
Among the freshmen ex
pected to help the varsity in their
first year on the Farm are Ken
Naber, punter-place kicker;
Brian Holloway, offensive
tackle; Larry Harris, wide re
ceiver; Darrin Nelson, halfback;
Ken Magerum, wide receiver;
and Bob Boxold, linebacker.
The new recruiting strategy
which reaped this bumper crop
of freshmen featured:
—a concentrated effort to re
cruit well in southern California;
— a move to a nationwide re
cruiting campaign;
— an emphasis on improving
overall team speed;
— a belief that Stanford can
successfully recruit talented
black athletes from the inner

city.
"We had to hit southern
California hard," Walsh said.
"We have to challenge (JSC and
UCLA for top southern Califor
nian players."

"We placed an emphasis on
recruiting black athletes,"
Single said. "We've been negli

roles in recruiting inner-city
athletes.
The effort yielded Robbie

easy to ignore them in the past."
