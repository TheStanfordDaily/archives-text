# Taking a look at the faces of Stanford athletics
## 
### 
One of Stanford's pet conceits
has been that the pursuit of
academic and athletic excel
lence needn't be mutually exc
lusive.
To some extent, the University
has succeeded.
While the question of
academic excellence will remain
moot here, Cardinal teams have
in some areas met the challenge
of excellence.
During the 1976-77 school
year, for the first time in the
school's history, two Cardinal
teams brought home NCAA ti
tles — the water polo and tennis
teams capturing the coveted na
tional crowns.
The women's swim teams
finished second at the nationals
and the women's tennis teams
placed third at the AIAW champ
ionships. The men's swimming

team finished seventh last spring
at the national meet, while the
track team, only seventh at the
Pacific-8 meet, finished 10th at
the NCAA championships.
Ensconced within Stanford's
sandstone walls are some of the
world's outstanding athletes.
Gold medalists
Olympic gold medalists Mike
Bruner and Kim Peyton churn
the water for )im Gaughran's
swim teams.
Last May Matt Mitchell be
came the fifth Stanford netter to
win the NCAA singles crown. In
coming freshman netter John
McEnroe was the youngest
player ever to advance to the
semifinals at Wimbledon when
he met jimmy Connors during
the summer.
Senior James Lofton, currently
playing wide receiver for the

Card football team, had the
world's top long jump mark
(26-9) through the first five
months of 1977.
Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey have combined to win the
women's collegiate doubles title
the last two years.
Freshman Doug Clarke, win
ner of the Trans-Mississippi
amateur golf tourney, is reputed
to be one of the nation's top
amateur golfers.
Stanford has also contributed
numerous standout athletes to
the current professional ranks —
names such as Tom Watson, )im
Plunkett and Roscoe Tanner.
Stanford's athletic facilities
have even hid their glory days.
Stanford Stadium was the site
of the 1960 U.S. Olumpic Trials
and the two-day U.S.-U.S.S.R.
track meet in 1962 which drew

more than 150,000 spectators.
Hoover
Herbert Hoover also delivered
his acceptance speech in 1928 at
the stadium, following his
nomination to run for President
on the C.O.P. ticket.
Maples Pavilion hosted one of
the early ventures in ping-pong
diplomacy between the United
States and Red China.
But for all the estimable per
formances and performers on
the Farm, the athletic program is
not without its weak points.
For three years, Stanford's
football aspirations floundered
from a lack of leadership — the
team going from game to game
never certain which quarterback
would be at the helm.
Only time will tell if the pro
fessional approach to football
which Bill Walsh has brought

with him from San Diego will lift
the Cardinals from the mire of
mediocrity in which they have
been grounded since coach
)ohn Ralston's departure to the
National Football League after
back-to-back Rose Bowl appear
ances.
The track team has not beaten
USC since 1933, having lost the
last 41 meetings with the Tro
jans.
Embarrassment
The track itself is an embar
rassment to the Stanford athletic
program. When Olympian
James Robinson of California
edged (JSC's Rayfield Beaton
here two years ago in an 800-
meter race, Beaton reportedly
said that he lost the race when
he stumbled on one of the lines
dividing the lanes.
Such is the shape of the Stan

ford Stadium track.
The Stanford fans can be
equally embarrassing at times.
Last basketball season, Oregon
and its "Kamikaze Kids" cage
squad came to Maples Pavilion
for a Saturday night basketball
contest. Had an uninformed ob
server been in attendance, he
would have believed that the
Ducks had moved their home
contests to quarters more spaci
ous than Mac Arthur Courts.
Apathy
The apathetic showing of the
fans is more than made up by the
inspired performances of the
Band and the Dollies. (Although
the Band's detractors would say
they just add to the embarrass
ment of the Cardinal rooting
section.)
To form your own opinion

about the Band, the football
teams and the rest of the athletic
program, attend one, or several,
of the various varsity contests
going on around campus this
weekend.
Friday at 3:30 p.m. the wo
men's volleyball team plays at
Maples Pavilion.
Saturday the women's cross
country team runs at 9 a.m., the
men's team at 10 a.m., on the
Stanford Golf Course. The water
polo team plays at 11 a.m. at De-
Cuerre and the soccer team
plays at 2 p.m. on Harry Maloney
Field. -
Oh . . . and yes, the Band be
gins play at Stanford Stadium
sometime after 1 p.m. The foot
ball team will also appear at the
stadium to entertain Illinois.
Good luck, sports fans.

One of Stanford's pet conceits
has been that the pursuit of
academic and athletic excel
lence needn't be mutually exc
lusive.
To some extent, the University
has succeeded.
While the question of
academic excellence will remain
moot here, Cardinal teams have
in some areas met the challenge
of excellence.
During the 1976-77 school
year, for the first time in the
school's history, two Cardinal
teams brought home NCAA ti
tles — the water polo and tennis
teams capturing the coveted na
tional crowns.
The women's swim teams
finished second at the nationals
and the women's tennis teams
placed third at the AIAW champ
ionships. The men's swimming

team finished seventh last spring
at the national meet, while the
track team, only seventh at the
Pacific-8 meet, finished 10th at
the NCAA championships.
Ensconced within Stanford's
sandstone walls are some of the
world's outstanding athletes.
Gold medalists
Olympic gold medalists Mike
Bruner and Kim Peyton churn
the water for )im Gaughran's
swim teams.
Last May Matt Mitchell be
came the fifth Stanford netter to
win the NCAA singles crown. In
coming freshman netter John
McEnroe was the youngest
player ever to advance to the
semifinals at Wimbledon when
he met jimmy Connors during
the summer.
Senior James Lofton, currently
playing wide receiver for the

Card football team, had the
world's top long jump mark
(26-9) through the first five
months of 1977.
Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey have combined to win the
women's collegiate doubles title
the last two years.
Freshman Doug Clarke, win
ner of the Trans-Mississippi
amateur golf tourney, is reputed
to be one of the nation's top
amateur golfers.
Stanford has also contributed
numerous standout athletes to
the current professional ranks —
names such as Tom Watson, )im
Plunkett and Roscoe Tanner.
Stanford's athletic facilities
have even hid their glory days.
Stanford Stadium was the site
of the 1960 U.S. Olumpic Trials
and the two-day U.S.-U.S.S.R.
track meet in 1962 which drew

more than 150,000 spectators.
Hoover
Herbert Hoover also delivered
his acceptance speech in 1928 at
the stadium, following his
nomination to run for President
on the C.O.P. ticket.
Maples Pavilion hosted one of
the early ventures in ping-pong
diplomacy between the United
States and Red China.
But for all the estimable per
formances and performers on
the Farm, the athletic program is
not without its weak points.
For three years, Stanford's
football aspirations floundered
from a lack of leadership — the
team going from game to game
never certain which quarterback
would be at the helm.
Only time will tell if the pro
fessional approach to football
which Bill Walsh has brought

with him from San Diego will lift
the Cardinals from the mire of
mediocrity in which they have
been grounded since coach
)ohn Ralston's departure to the
National Football League after
back-to-back Rose Bowl appear
ances.
The track team has not beaten
USC since 1933, having lost the
last 41 meetings with the Tro
jans.
Embarrassment
The track itself is an embar
rassment to the Stanford athletic
program. When Olympian
James Robinson of California
edged (JSC's Rayfield Beaton
here two years ago in an 800-
meter race, Beaton reportedly
said that he lost the race when
he stumbled on one of the lines
dividing the lanes.
Such is the shape of the Stan

ford Stadium track.
The Stanford fans can be
equally embarrassing at times.
Last basketball season, Oregon
and its "Kamikaze Kids" cage
squad came to Maples Pavilion
for a Saturday night basketball
contest. Had an uninformed ob
server been in attendance, he
would have believed that the
Ducks had moved their home
contests to quarters more spaci
ous than Mac Arthur Courts.
Apathy
The apathetic showing of the
fans is more than made up by the
inspired performances of the
Band and the Dollies. (Although
the Band's detractors would say
they just add to the embarrass
ment of the Cardinal rooting
section.)
To form your own opinion

about the Band, the football
teams and the rest of the athletic
program, attend one, or several,
of the various varsity contests
going on around campus this
weekend.
Friday at 3:30 p.m. the wo
men's volleyball team plays at
Maples Pavilion.
Saturday the women's cross
country team runs at 9 a.m., the

One of Stanford's pet conceits
has been that the pursuit of
academic and athletic excel
lence needn't be mutually exc
lusive.
To some extent, the University
has succeeded.
While the question of
academic excellence will remain
moot here, Cardinal teams have
in some areas met the challenge
of excellence.
During the 1976-77 school
year, for the first time in the
school's history, two Cardinal
teams brought home NCAA ti
tles — the water polo and tennis
teams capturing the coveted na
tional crowns.
The women's swim teams
finished second at the nationals
and the women's tennis teams
placed third at the AIAW champ
ionships. The men's swimming

team finished seventh last spring
at the national meet, while the
track team, only seventh at the
Pacific-8 meet, finished 10th at
the NCAA championships.
Ensconced within Stanford's
sandstone walls are some of the
world's outstanding athletes.
Gold medalists
Olympic gold medalists Mike
Bruner and Kim Peyton churn
the water for )im Gaughran's
swim teams.
Last May Matt Mitchell be
came the fifth Stanford netter to
win the NCAA singles crown. In
coming freshman netter John
McEnroe was the youngest
player ever to advance to the
semifinals at Wimbledon when
he met jimmy Connors during
the summer.
Senior James Lofton, currently
playing wide receiver for the

Card football team, had the
world's top long jump mark
(26-9) through the first five
months of 1977.
Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey have combined to win the
women's collegiate doubles title
the last two years.
Freshman Doug Clarke, win
ner of the Trans-Mississippi
amateur golf tourney, is reputed
to be one of the nation's top
amateur golfers.
Stanford has also contributed
numerous standout athletes to
the current professional ranks —
names such as Tom Watson, )im
Plunkett and Roscoe Tanner.
Stanford's athletic facilities
have even hid their glory days.
Stanford Stadium was the site
of the 1960 U.S. Olumpic Trials
and the two-day U.S.-U.S.S.R.
track meet in 1962 which drew

more than 150,000 spectators.
Hoover
Herbert Hoover also delivered
his acceptance speech in 1928 at
the stadium, following his
nomination to run for President
on the C.O.P. ticket.
Maples Pavilion hosted one of
the early ventures in ping-pong
diplomacy between the United
States and Red China.
But for all the estimable per
formances and performers on
the Farm, the athletic program is
not without its weak points.
For three years, Stanford's
football aspirations floundered
from a lack of leadership — the
team going from game to game
never certain which quarterback
would be at the helm.
Only time will tell if the pro
fessional approach to football
which Bill Walsh has brought

with him from San Diego will lift
the Cardinals from the mire of
mediocrity in which they have
been grounded since coach
)ohn Ralston's departure to the
National Football League after
back-to-back Rose Bowl appear
ances.
The track team has not beaten
USC since 1933, having lost the
last 41 meetings with the Tro
jans.
Embarrassment
The track itself is an embar
rassment to the Stanford athletic
program. When Olympian
James Robinson of California
edged (JSC's Rayfield Beaton
here two years ago in an 800-
meter race, Beaton reportedly
said that he lost the race when
he stumbled on one of the lines
dividing the lanes.
Such is the shape of the Stan

ford Stadium track.
The Stanford fans can be
equally embarrassing at times.
Last basketball season, Oregon
and its "Kamikaze Kids" cage
squad came to Maples Pavilion
for a Saturday night basketball
contest. Had an uninformed ob
server been in attendance, he
would have believed that the
Ducks had moved their home
contests to quarters more spaci
ous than Mac Arthur Courts.
Apathy
The apathetic showing of the
fans is more than made up by the
inspired performances of the
Band and the Dollies. (Although
the Band's detractors would say
they just add to the embarrass
ment of the Cardinal rooting
section.)
