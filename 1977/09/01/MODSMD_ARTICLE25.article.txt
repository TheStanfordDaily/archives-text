# Meet the mentors — who's who in coaching
## 
### 
Some are Sons of the Stanford Red.
Others hail from the vaunted crimson and gold of down-south
rival USC.
Five are in their first year at Stanford.
Another is starting his 22nd year on the Farm.
Three have coached teams to NCAA titles.
Two have headed squads in the Olympic Games.
Stanford's varsity coaches are as diverse and talented as the stu
dent body from which they draw their athletes. They can be as
low-key as cross country coach Marshall Clark or gymnastics
mentor Sadao Hamada, or as hard-sell as tennis promoter extraor
dinaire Dick Could.
Some work with as many as 10 assistants. Others work by them
selves.
MARSHALL CLARK — A 1957 graduate of Southern Cal, Clark
begins his 10th season as head of Stanford's cross country program.
In addition to the men's team, Clark coaches the women's squad
which starts its first season with varsity status.
Clark, who is also an assistant track coach, took his first Stan
ford team to a second-place finish at the NCAA Championships
in 1968.
Duncan Mac Donald, American 5000-meter record holder, and
Don Kardong, an Olympic marathoner, developed under Clark's
tutelage.
DANTE DETTAMANTI — First-year Cardinal mentor Dettamanti
assumes the helm of the defending NCAA champion Stanford water
polo team.

of the Cauchos. Dettamanti had a 42-29 record in three years at
UCSB.
Head coach of swimming and water polo at Occidental College
before going to Santa Barbara, Dettamanti will assist with Stanford's
swimming program.
DICK DIBIASO — Dißiaso brought a quicker, more aggressive
style of basketball to the Farm two years ago but the new style of play
has not yet yielded Stanford a winning basketball season.
In his first two seasons with the Cards, Dißiaso has led his cageis
to identical 3-11 marks in Pacific-8 play.
Despite the less-than-phenomenal record, fellow coaches
selected Dißiaso as the Pac-8 Co-Coach of the Year in his first
season.
Dißiaso was an assistant at Virginia before moving to Notre Dame
where he worked with Digger Phelps for four years. Dißiaso came to
Stanford from South Bend.

swimming program, Gaughran begins his 18th year as Stanford's

both the swimming and water polo teams during his senior year as
an undergraduate here.

Anne, finished among the top three women's collegiate teams in
both the last two years.

tennis in 1960 while a member of the Card team.

Marcy and Steve Hug, winner of four NCAA individual titles and
twice a competitor for the U.S. Olympic team.
PAYTON )ORDAN — In his 22nd year at Stanford, Jordan is the

dean of current Card coaches.
His more than two decades of coaching track at Stanford were
highlighted by the Cards' second-place finish at the 1963 NCAA
meet.
Jordan was the head coach of the 1968 U.S. Olympic track team.
Histeamin Mexico City won more gold medals and set more records
than any team in Olympic history.
Jordan was a track and football star at USC before joining the
coaching ranks. He still competes in track and holds innumerable
age-group world records in the sprints.
