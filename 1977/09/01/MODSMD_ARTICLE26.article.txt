# Campus facilities: do-it-yourself sports are twice the fun
## 
### 
If you captained your high
school tennis team but can't
make Stanford's varsity net
squad, don't worry.
If you were an All-Conference
lineman as a prep football player
but don't stand 6-foot-4 and
weigh 230 pounds, don't fret.
If you held the high school re
cord in the backstroke but won't
have time to go out for the Car
dinal swim team, no sweat.
Varsity sports at Stanford
comprise but a small part of the
athletic and recreational ac
tivities pursued on campus. A
myriad of physical education

classes, recreational oppor
tunities and intramural and club
sports await the person bent on
physical activity.
The intramural program offers
31 varieties of sports to the en
tire University, 19 all-women
sports and six choices for sum
mer school students. Competi
tion ranges from such standards
as football, basketball and
softball to the more exotic ulti
mate frisbee and inner-tube
water polo.
Information regarding
scheduling and IM signups ap

tramural office in Encina Gym
will answer questions about the
program.

vides competition in sports
which do not have varsity status
at Stanford. Among these sports
are crew, lacrosse, rugby,
wrestling, karate, ice hockey,
badminton, bowling and skiing.

which offer instruction and,-a
chance for participation in
sports, dancing and aquatic and
other activities.
