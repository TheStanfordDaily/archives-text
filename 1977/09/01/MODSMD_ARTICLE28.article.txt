# There's more than one way to kill an afternoon...
## Look for an improved cross-country season 
### 
Cross country coach Marshall
Clark termed last fall's season a
"downer."
Stanford lost four of its top
harriers to injuries before the
season started.
With a flock of veterans and
talented newcomers vying for
spots on the team and no one
hurt before the beginning of
school, the cross country team
looks to fare better than it did
during last year's disastrous sea
son.
Steve Crowley and Jeff Nor
ton, seniors last year, each have
a year of cross country eligibility
remaining and Clark said there is
a good chance both will com
pete for the Cards this fall.
Crowley, a top miler for Stan
ford three of the last four years,
competed in Europe this sum
mer. Norton, the top runner on
the team last year, sat out track
season with an injury but is heal
thy again.
Kissin hack
lunior Roy Kissin, who sat out
last cross country season with an
injury, had a six-mile best of
29:47 as a freshman in 1975 and
will run for the Cards this fall.
Jerry Emory was a model of

consistency last season and
earned a trip to the NCAA meet
with a top performance in the
conference meet. He too will
help the team.
Other veterans battling for
spots in the top seven include
Greg Eger, Bill Haldeman, Stacy
Geiken, Harold Celms and Craig

Corey.
The Cards also have four top
freshman prospects this year.
Tom O'Neill and Pete Gall
have both gone under 30 mi
nutesforsix miles, O'Neill witha
best of 29:39. Mark Stillman,
winner of the mile at the Califor
nia state meet in June, finished

second in the Central Coast Sec
tion cross country champion
ships as a high school senior.
O'Neill, Gail and Stillman will
all contribute to the Cards' for
tunes but the freshman with the
most promise is Canadian Tom
Lobsinger.
Top dog
As a prep Lobsinger won the
three-mile at the Springbank In
ternational High School Meet
with a 13:26 clocking. Only two
Card runners — Don Kardong
and Tony Sandoval — have re
corded better three-mile times
while running for Stanford.
The best collegiate teams in
the nation annually grace the
Stanford Golf Course with their
presence. This year will be no
exception.
Texas El-Paso, winner of the
NCAA team title the last two sea
sons, and tough UC-lrvine will
be heading the entrants' list at
the Oct. 15 Stanford Invitational.
Washington State, boasting
world 10,000-meter record hol
der Samson Kimombwa, and
Oregon finished second and
third the NCAA meet last season
and will be here for the confer
ence meet Nov. 12.

Saturday the harriers open the
season by hosting the San Diego
State, No. 8 in the NCAA meet
last season, and the West Valley
Track Club. The 4.2-mile race
begins at the Stanford Golf
Course at 10 a.m.
Women's team
The women's team will com
pete for the first time this year
with varsity status. And while the
women have been few in num
bers the last two seasons, Clark
said that this year he expects to
have at least 25 women out —
foremost among them junior
Ann Thrupp.
Thrupp finished 15th last
November in the AIAW national
championships — she being the
first woman from Stanford to
compete in that event.
This summer she finished
third in the AAU 5000-meter run.
She also recorded an outstand
ing 10,000-meter time of 34:40.5.
Veterans Audrey Kemp and
Sandy Briscoe will be the Cards'
No. 2 and 3 punches.
The women begin the season
at 9 a.m. Saturday at the golf
course running against West Val
ley Track Club and De Anza Col
lege.
