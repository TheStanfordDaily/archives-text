# Class of 1981: most feminine ever
## 
### 
The Daily has received the following
communication from a highly placed source
in the admissions office:
Admissions officers tend to see the
freshmen as individuals and yet have to re
port on the class in aggregate terms. So be it.
The Class of 1981 is your average outstand
ing incoming freshman class.
Whatever else they may be, they are larger
in number than recent entering classes, and
that should help them throw their weight
around. They will number 1560-plus.
About 44 per cent of them will be females,
the largest such number of women in any
freshmen class ever to enter Stanford. The
class was selected from 9,900 applicants (38
per cent, or 3,717, of whom were women).
The applicants came from 3,107 secondary
schools (also the largest number ever), and
the incoming freshmen will represent 913
secondary schools. While 45 come from
foreign countries, the rest of the class come

from every state except one: Nebraska. We
are unable to explain that lapse. After
California, the states most heavily rep
resented include Washington, Oregon,
Texas, Massachusetts, Illinois, Colorado,
Arizona, Ohio and Minnesota.
Of the Class of 1981, 72 per cent come
from public schools and 28 per cent from
independent schools. Sons and daughters

of alumni comprise 13 per cent. And those
who have had brothers and/or sisters attend
ing Stanford comprise 13 per cent also.
Of the applicant group from which the
Class of 1981 was selected, 52 per cent
ranked in the top 10 per cent of their senior
class. Of the 9,900 applicants, 1537 had 4.0
(or straight "A") averages throughout high
school. The median test scores are healthy
ones, but we are not inclined to publish
them to try to minimize the tendency of stu
dents to compare, contrast and fret. Let's
just say they are at the point where the stu
dents shouldn't worry about having the abil
ity to succeed here and the faculty shouldn't
worry about not having enough work to do.
The Class of 1981 is no less accomplished
and energetic than the upperclassmen who
will give them a hard time, and those of us
who have corresponded with them over the
past year really do look forward to seeing
them.
