# ...or five fall alternatives to the football frolics Champion water poloists up against toughest foes yet
## 
### 
Art Lambert took the Stanford
water polo team from the cellar
of the Pacific-8 Conference to an
NCAA crown in three seasons.
Having led the poloists to the
national title, Lambert resigned
as water polo mentor to devote
his full energies to Stanford's
volleyball programs and to ex
press his dissatisfaction with the
national water polo program.
Lambert's exit at the top of the
collegiate water polo heap
leaves successor Dante De
ttamanti with a tough act to fol
low.
Dettamanti, coach of UC-
Santa Barbara the past three
years, has several returning Ail-
Americans from last season's
20-2 squad around which to
build another championship
contender.
Three-year letterman Rick
lohannsen, a collegiate All-
America, heads the list of return
ing regulars for the Cards.
Four drivers who started for
last year's title squad return:
Tom Angelo, Doug Burke,
Robby Arnold and Marty Davis.
Juniors Angelo and Burke are
both All-Americans. Burke
played on the U.S. national team

this summer and Angelo played
for the team that represented
the United States in the World
University Games in Bulgaria his
August.
Arnold, also a junior, made
the all-tournament team during
the NCAA playoffs last falls.
But to have a chance to repeat
as national champs Stanford will
have to stave off three confer
ence rivals. California, a three
time winner of the national
crown, did not lose a starter off
last season's squad. UCLA and
USC will also field contending
teams, Dettamanti feels.
To successfully defend their ti
tle, the Cards must also replace
graduated goalie Chris Dorst.
Dorst won the Most Valuable
Player award during the NCAA
tournament for his outstanding
play in the goal.
Dettamanti has four candi
dates for the goal spot. Craig
Schwarberg, who started for
USC his freshman year, transfer
red to Stanford, then sat out the
last two years to gain conference
eligibility, appears to have the
inside track for the spot at goal.

Three freshmen will push
Schwarberg for the job: John
Gansel, Alan Launer and Vince
Vannelli.
In addition to Dorst, the Cards
must replace All-America Drew
McDonald and hole man Paul

Clark.
The Cards have two freshmen,
Steve Smith and Bill Taylor, who,
they hope, will aid the Stanford
attack.
Dettamanti said the Cards will
have a quick, driving team which

will rely on overall team speed to
combat opponents. He said that
Stanford won't outmuscle any
one.
Dettamanti had a chance to
work with many of the Cards
during the AAU championships

this summer when he directed
the Stanford AAU team to a
fourth-placetinish. Dettamanti's
summer squad upended even
tual tournament champion Con
cord for one of the surprising
wins of the tournament.

To catch a view of the fall edi
tion of the Cardinals drop by
deCuerre Pool Saturday for the
Cards' 11 a.m. matchup against
UCSB, Dettamanti's old school
and the fourth-place finisher in
the NCAA tournament last fall.
