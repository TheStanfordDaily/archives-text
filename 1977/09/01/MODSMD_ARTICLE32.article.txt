Stanford soccer coach Nel
son Lodge gave the Cardinals
a facelift last fall in his first
season on the Farm with a
new offense, defense and
approach to the game.
And with 10 lettermen and
eight starters returning from
last season's team, Lodge
said, "I believe we will have a
better season than last. Last
year we had to rely on
freshmen.
"We'll still be going against
teams more mature than us,
but our younger players
won't be so awed by the
transition to the college
game."
Lodge is right — with only

three returning seniors, the
Cards will inevitably face
teams of greater maturity. But
the Cards, too, have done a
great deal of maturing.
The Cards, 9-9-2 last au
tumn, went 4-1-1 during the
final six games.
The 10 returning lettermen
not only have added experi
ence but have a working un
derstanding of Lodge's offen
sive and defensive system.
The Stanford attack is a
fast-breaking, running of
fense. The defense, pat
terned after the Dutch whirl,
has been dubbed the "Stan
ford Swirl."
The key returnee from

Lodge's first Stanford team is
Paul Koschenko, the second
leading scorer on last sea
son's team.
Lodge said he also feels the
play of striker Ron Johnson,
fullback Greg Delgado and
midfielders Jonathan Hecht
and Steve Dietz, all sopho
mores, is essential to the suc
cess of the Cards.
Lewis Butler and Craig
Uland will view for the start
ing goal position. Butler held
down the starting job last fall,
but Uland had an outstanding
spring according to Lodge and
will push for the No. Tspot.
Missing from the Card
lineup this season will be Bob

Ceiger, one of the nation's
top scorers last year with 26
goals. He was the only person
last fall to record a hat trick
against national champion
University of San Francisco.
Picking up the slack left by
Geiger's graduation will be
four first-year players. Three
freshmen, Andre Mann, Dan
McNevin and Mark Agnew,
rank as Lodge's top recruits
for the new season. Mann
seems to have the most po
tential of the incoming group
having lived in Holland for 14
years where he gained in
valuable amateur soccer ex
perience.

Lodge said he also expects
help at wing from junior Atta
Owuju. A native of Ghana,
Owuju did not play his first
two years at Stanford but
Lodge expects him to make a
contribution this season.
Stanford's bearded
second-year mentor looks for
Stanford to battle Santa Clara
tor the third spot in the con
ference, conceding the battle
for first to USF and San )ose
State, teams he rates among
the best in the nation.
The Cards host Fullerton
State at 2 p.m. Saturday on
Harry Maloney Field.

Uland will view for the start
ing goal position. Butler held
down the starting job last fall,
but Uland had an outstanding
spring according to Lodge and
will push for the No. Tspot.
Missing from the Card
lineup this season will be Bob

Ceiger, one of the nation's
top scorers last year with 26
goals. He was the only person
last fall to record a hat trick
against national champion
University of San Francisco.
Picking up the slack left by
Geiger's graduation will be
four first-year players. Three
freshmen, Andre Mann, Dan
McNevin and Mark Agnew,
rank as Lodge's top recruits
for the new season. Mann
seems to have the most po
tential of the incoming group
having lived in Holland for 14
years where he gained in
valuable amateur soccer ex
perience.

Lodge said he also expects
help at wing from junior Atta
Owuju. A native of Ghana,
Owuju did not play his first
two years at Stanford but
Lodge expects him to make a
contribution this season.
Stanford's bearded
second-year mentor looks for
Stanford to battle Santa Clara
tor the third spot in the con
ference, conceding the battle
for first to USF and San )ose
State, teams he rates among
the best in the nation.
The Cards host Fullerton
State at 2 p.m. Saturday on
Harry Maloney Field.

Stanford soccer coach Nel
son Lodge gave the Cardinals
a facelift last fall in his first
season on the Farm with a
new offense, defense and
approach to the game.
And with 10 lettermen and
eight starters returning from
last season's team, Lodge
said, "I believe we will have a
better season than last. Last
year we had to rely on
freshmen.
"We'll still be going against
teams more mature than us,
but our younger players
won't be so awed by the
transition to the college
game."
Lodge is right — with only

three returning seniors, the
Cards will inevitably face
teams of greater maturity. But
the Cards, too, have done a
great deal of maturing.
The Cards, 9-9-2 last au
tumn, went 4-1-1 during the
final six games.
The 10 returning lettermen
not only have added experi
ence but have a working un
derstanding of Lodge's offen
sive and defensive system.
The Stanford attack is a
fast-breaking, running of
fense. The defense, pat
terned after the Dutch whirl,
has been dubbed the "Stan
ford Swirl."
The key returnee from

Lodge's first Stanford team is
Paul Koschenko, the second
leading scorer on last sea
son's team.
Lodge said he also feels the
play of striker Ron Johnson,
fullback Greg Delgado and
midfielders Jonathan Hecht
and Steve Dietz, all sopho
mores, is essential to the suc
cess of the Cards.
Lewis Butler and Craig
Uland will view for the start
ing goal position. Butler held
down the starting job last fall,
but Uland had an outstanding
spring according to Lodge and
will push for the No. Tspot.
