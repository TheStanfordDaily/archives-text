# LSJUMB as a reluctant institution
## 
### 
They're out on the field, near the end of the show, and they've
arranged themselves into the traditional tribute to the opposing
team. It says O-H-l-O S-T-A-T-E. As the spectators appreciate the
gesture the band begins leaving the field. The first T, and the A and
the E in S-T-A-T-E dissolve, and the Hand I from O-H-l-O drop down
into the word below. The second O flattens out on each side and
becomes an H. The Band pauses for just a moment in this formation
and then leaves the field completely.
They are honoring the Apollo-Soyuz space hookup - the band has
split into two groups, Representing the U.S. and Soviet spacecraft.
After missing each other on the first pass, the cone of the American
ship finds an opening, and enters the Russian machine. As if imper
fectly docked, it withdraws, then enters again. The process is re
peated once or twice more. Finally several clarinet players explode
from the nose of the U.S. vessel, while the announcer explains that
this signifies the exchange of information that comes as part and
parcel of detente.
The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band has prob
lems with its hate mail.
"There isn't enough," said manager Rich Johnson. "We like to
keep a large inventory of hate mail around all the time. Except for the
death of Mao show at the San Jose State game last year, nothing
got a really healthy response. That bothers us."
Several people sat in the manager's office discussing the effects of
time and popularity on LSJUMB. A few of the real zealots were there
— Rich, assistant manager Al Jarketsky, properties manager Ken
Doxsee, section leaders Chip Laub and Ken Johnson. All of them
were aware of the drawbacks of being an institution. At the same
time they were looking forward to the year ahead with great glee.
Rich agreed that the status of the band had changed considerably
over the past few years. "Used to be we had to shanghai players. We
had to go to the dorms and solicit trombone and trumpet persons.
Now we haven't got enough spots.
"It also used to be that only the real red hots were interested. They
may have been the shiftiest musicians in the world, but they were
red hots, and they were always there when you needed them. . .
"Now people join so they can tell their friends," interjected Dox
see. "Some of them do, and I think that that's a problem. We don't
want to stagnate. We don't want to get so involved in other things
that we forget that a band is supposed to be able to play music. If that
happens it will be difficult to keep pointing a satirical finger at reality,
so to speak."
That's where the hate mail comes in. "We're proud of our hate
mail," Ken said."Not for its own sake, but because it tells us that
people are still paying attention. It lets us know that we're still close
to home."
Nobody in the Band wants LSJUMB to get fat and smug. They talk
about it a lot. At the same time all of them seem confident that this
will not be the case.
"We could do other things if we wanted," said Jarketsky. "We've
even thought about doing a precision marching show sometime
next year. Probably not, though. We could do it, but its hard to enjoy
that kind of thing. You have to be a real fascist to enjoy precision
marching."
Next year the band plans to pay considerable attention to the
quality of the sounds it makes, without abandoning the traditional
methods of making those sounds, or the traditional subject matter
whence said sounds are derived. Anita, Groucho, Elvis, and Sam
(son of) are possibilities, not to mention the purposefully incom
prehensible productions, or those invented in response to an as yet
unoccurred occurrence. ("Mao didn't go until Wednesday before
the show.")
Whatever happens, it looks as though LSJUMB is in good hands
next year. It isn't letting success go to its head, and that is good,
since it means that they're keeping things down around the kidneys,
where they belong. I expect that the cards and letters will keep
coming.

Gentlemen:
I was greatly em
barrassed by the
language and de
portment of the
Stanford Band at
last Saturday's
football game.
Its crude language
and insulting vis
ual demonstrations
are inexcusable...
in inconceivably
poor taste... the
ultimate in degen
eracy. ..something
I find impossible
to describe ade
quately. .. I wish
I were a large
financial contrib
utor to Stanford—
it would give me
great pleasure to
cut you off com
pletely.

Gentlemen:
I was greatly em
barrassed by the
language and de
portment of the
Stanford Band at
last Saturday's
football game.
Its crude language
and insulting vis
ual demonstrations
are inexcusable...
in inconceivably
poor taste... the
ultimate in degen
eracy. ..something
I find impossible
to describe ade
quately. .. I wish
I were a large
financial contrib
utor to Stanford—
it would give me
great pleasure to
cut you off com
pletely.

the LSJUMB
letter files.


They're out on the field, near the end of the show, and they've
arranged themselves into the traditional tribute to the opposing
team. It says O-H-l-O S-T-A-T-E. As the spectators appreciate the
gesture the band begins leaving the field. The first T, and the A and
the E in S-T-A-T-E dissolve, and the Hand I from O-H-l-O drop down
into the word below. The second O flattens out on each side and
becomes an H. The Band pauses for just a moment in this formation
and then leaves the field completely.
They are honoring the Apollo-Soyuz space hookup - the band has
split into two groups, Representing the U.S. and Soviet spacecraft.
After missing each other on the first pass, the cone of the American
ship finds an opening, and enters the Russian machine. As if imper
fectly docked, it withdraws, then enters again. The process is re
peated once or twice more. Finally several clarinet players explode
from the nose of the U.S. vessel, while the announcer explains that
this signifies the exchange of information that comes as part and
parcel of detente.
The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band has prob
lems with its hate mail.
"There isn't enough," said manager Rich Johnson. "We like to
keep a large inventory of hate mail around all the time. Except for the
death of Mao show at the San Jose State game last year, nothing
got a really healthy response. That bothers us."
Several people sat in the manager's office discussing the effects of
time and popularity on LSJUMB. A few of the real zealots were there
— Rich, assistant manager Al Jarketsky, properties manager Ken
Doxsee, section leaders Chip Laub and Ken Johnson. All of them
were aware of the drawbacks of being an institution. At the same
time they were looking forward to the year ahead with great glee.
Rich agreed that the status of the band had changed considerably
over the past few years. "Used to be we had to shanghai players. We
had to go to the dorms and solicit trombone and trumpet persons.
Now we haven't got enough spots.
"It also used to be that only the real red hots were interested. They
may have been the shiftiest musicians in the world, but they were
red hots, and they were always there when you needed them. . .
"Now people join so they can tell their friends," interjected Dox
see. "Some of them do, and I think that that's a problem. We don't
want to stagnate. We don't want to get so involved in other things
that we forget that a band is supposed to be able to play music. If that
happens it will be difficult to keep pointing a satirical finger at reality,
so to speak."
That's where the hate mail comes in. "We're proud of our hate
mail," Ken said."Not for its own sake, but because it tells us that
people are still paying attention. It lets us know that we're still close
to home."
Nobody in the Band wants LSJUMB to get fat and smug. They talk
about it a lot. At the same time all of them seem confident that this
will not be the case.
"We could do other things if we wanted," said Jarketsky. "We've
even thought about doing a precision marching show sometime
next year. Probably not, though. We could do it, but its hard to enjoy
that kind of thing. You have to be a real fascist to enjoy precision
marching."
Next year the band plans to pay considerable attention to the
quality of the sounds it makes, without abandoning the traditional
methods of making those sounds, or the traditional subject matter
whence said sounds are derived. Anita, Groucho, Elvis, and Sam
(son of) are possibilities, not to mention the purposefully incom
prehensible productions, or those invented in response to an as yet
