# Billy Erb and his symbol of rivalry
## 
### 
At the end of the 48-15 Big
Game farce in 1975, Cal's Rally
Committee came over to the
Stanford side to claim the prize
that goes to the winner of the
80-year old rivalry.
They picked up the 50-pound
plaque upon which the
Stanford-California Axe is
mounted and ran over to the
other side of Stanford Stadium.
They forgot one thing though.
You see, Stanford band member
Bob Tiffany had removed the
10-pound broad Axe from the
plaque. He was hiding it under
his pants.
The bandsman gave it back.
You see, when you steal the Axe
months of planning must go into
the venture. That's why it's only
been stolen eight times.
The Stanford Axe ranks right
up there with such cherished
fo'otball trophies as the
Indiana-Purdue "Old Oaken
Bucket" and the Michigan-
Michigan State "Little Brown
)ug."
Billy Erb
Why, Billy Erb would be
proud. Oh, he's the quarterback
who took us to the 1952 Rose
Bowl. Right?
No, you're dead wrong. Al
though Erb's picture doesn't
hang next to )im Plunkett's, or
even Mike Cordova's, in the
football office, he's done more
for the Big Game than anyone.
It was Erb who started this
nonsense. And 75 years later,
the Axe:
—has been fought over at
sword point;
—caused cancellation of clas

ses for two days in 1930;
—was heisted at a sportswrit
ers luncheon in a cross between
armed robbery and a con game
Worthy of The Sting.
And all this over a 10-pound
broad Axe with a 15-inch blade.
Actually the Axe yell preceeded
the Axe. Since 1896 it had been
used to symbolically taunt Cal.
But after losing the first two
games of a three-game baseball
series to the Bears, Billy Erb
came up with the marvelous idea
of getting a real Axe.
So in 1899, Erb brought an un
sharpened broad Axe to a pre
game bonfire and in a satanic
like ritual chopped up a dummy
bear. Charlie Manson would
have loved it.
E b took the Aye up to the
game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the
game, which Stanford lost 9-7,
Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of
his new improved razor.
After the Contest Erb en
trusted the Axe to a group of
guards including former Arizona
Sen. Carl Hayden. They were no
match for a Cal mob which in
cluded Bear football player Paul
Castlehun. The Cal people
grabbed it, then Stanford's
Frank Strout snatched it away
momentarily, but it was taken
from his hands by Cal "wonder
quarterback" Jim Hooper.
It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On

April 3,1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
followed the armed truck back
to the bank, and posing as
newspaper photographers,
the Cat freshmen guard
ing the Trophy to pose for pic
tures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, the Cal idiots discovered
that they were teargas bombs.
The next day one Berkeley pro
fessor said, "Gentlemen, this
shows the value of chemical war
fare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol
lowed and tossed it into the back
of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
But Cal students were talking
of violence, and officials from
both schools signed a pact, mak
ing the Axe the Big Game trophy.
Thefts continued occasion
ally, but it was not until three
years ago that another grand
theft occurred. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, calling them

selves the "Infamous Three,"
imitated Cal Coach Mike White
and asked to pick up the Axe for
photos at the Big Came lunc
heon at Ming's Restaurant.
'Infamous three'
Dave Silteanu and Tim Con
way arrived at the Cal Student
Union, where the Axe is kept in a
nuclear-attack-proof display
case after Cal wins, and asked
for the Axe. But the Cal Axe
Commission had taken the Axe
down for safekeeping. The pair
convinced the Union manager
to call the Axe Commission and
produce the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast, Matt Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to
call for reinforcement at Ming's.
But when the car pulled into
Ming's there were no Theta
Delts.
Suddenly they came out from
behind the parked cars and it
was no contest.
The Axe was home.

though Erb's picture doesn't
hang next to )im Plunkett's, or
even Mike Cordova's, in the
football office, he's done more
for the Big Game than anyone.
It was Erb who started this
nonsense. And 75 years later,
the Axe:
—has been fought over at
sword point;
—caused cancellation of clas

ses for two days in 1930;
—was heisted at a sportswrit
ers luncheon in a cross between
armed robbery and a con game
Worthy of The Sting.
And all this over a 10-pound
broad Axe with a 15-inch blade.
Actually the Axe yell preceeded
the Axe. Since 1896 it had been
used to symbolically taunt Cal.
But after losing the first two
games of a three-game baseball
series to the Bears, Billy Erb
came up with the marvelous idea
of getting a real Axe.
So in 1899, Erb brought an un
sharpened broad Axe to a pre
game bonfire and in a satanic
like ritual chopped up a dummy
bear. Charlie Manson would
have loved it.
E b took the Aye up to the
game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the
game, which Stanford lost 9-7,
Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of
his new improved razor.
After the Contest Erb en
trusted the Axe to a group of
guards including former Arizona
Sen. Carl Hayden. They were no
match for a Cal mob which in
cluded Bear football player Paul
Castlehun. The Cal people
grabbed it, then Stanford's
Frank Strout snatched it away
momentarily, but it was taken
from his hands by Cal "wonder
quarterback" Jim Hooper.
It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On

April 3,1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
followed the armed truck back
to the bank, and posing as
newspaper photographers,
the Cat freshmen guard
ing the Trophy to pose for pic
tures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, the Cal idiots discovered
that they were teargas bombs.
The next day one Berkeley pro
fessor said, "Gentlemen, this
shows the value of chemical war
fare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol
lowed and tossed it into the back
of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
But Cal students were talking
of violence, and officials from
both schools signed a pact, mak
ing the Axe the Big Game trophy.
Thefts continued occasion
ally, but it was not until three
years ago that another grand
theft occurred. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, calling them

selves the "Infamous Three,"
imitated Cal Coach Mike White
and asked to pick up the Axe for
photos at the Big Came lunc
heon at Ming's Restaurant.
'Infamous three'
Dave Silteanu and Tim Con
way arrived at the Cal Student
Union, where the Axe is kept in a
nuclear-attack-proof display
case after Cal wins, and asked
for the Axe. But the Cal Axe
Commission had taken the Axe
down for safekeeping. The pair
convinced the Union manager
to call the Axe Commission and
produce the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast, Matt Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to
call for reinforcement at Ming's.
But when the car pulled into
Ming's there were no Theta
Delts.
Suddenly they came out from
behind the parked cars and it
was no contest.
The Axe was home.

At the end of the 48-15 Big
Game farce in 1975, Cal's Rally
Committee came over to the
Stanford side to claim the prize
that goes to the winner of the
80-year old rivalry.
They picked up the 50-pound
plaque upon which the
Stanford-California Axe is
mounted and ran over to the
other side of Stanford Stadium.
They forgot one thing though.
You see, Stanford band member
Bob Tiffany had removed the
10-pound broad Axe from the
plaque. He was hiding it under
his pants.
The bandsman gave it back.
You see, when you steal the Axe
months of planning must go into
the venture. That's why it's only
been stolen eight times.
The Stanford Axe ranks right
up there with such cherished
fo'otball trophies as the
Indiana-Purdue "Old Oaken
Bucket" and the Michigan-
Michigan State "Little Brown
)ug."
Billy Erb
Why, Billy Erb would be
proud. Oh, he's the quarterback
who took us to the 1952 Rose
Bowl. Right?

game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the
game, which Stanford lost 9-7,
Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of
his new improved razor.
After the Contest Erb en
trusted the Axe to a group of
guards including former Arizona
Sen. Carl Hayden. They were no
match for a Cal mob which in
cluded Bear football player Paul
Castlehun. The Cal people
grabbed it, then Stanford's
Frank Strout snatched it away
momentarily, but it was taken
from his hands by Cal "wonder
quarterback" Jim Hooper.
It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On

April 3,1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
followed the armed truck back
to the bank, and posing as
newspaper photographers,
the Cat freshmen guard
ing the Trophy to pose for pic
tures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, the Cal idiots discovered
that they were teargas bombs.
The next day one Berkeley pro
fessor said, "Gentlemen, this
shows the value of chemical war
fare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol
lowed and tossed it into the back
of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
But Cal students were talking
of violence, and officials from
both schools signed a pact, mak
ing the Axe the Big Game trophy.
Thefts continued occasion
ally, but it was not until three
years ago that another grand
theft occurred. Residents of
Theta Delta Chi, calling them

selves the "Infamous Three,"
imitated Cal Coach Mike White
and asked to pick up the Axe for
photos at the Big Came lunc
heon at Ming's Restaurant.
'Infamous three'
Dave Silteanu and Tim Con
way arrived at the Cal Student
Union, where the Axe is kept in a
nuclear-attack-proof display
case after Cal wins, and asked
for the Axe. But the Cal Axe
Commission had taken the Axe
down for safekeeping. The pair
convinced the Union manager
to call the Axe Commission and
produce the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast, Matt Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to
call for reinforcement at Ming's.
But when the car pulled into
Ming's there were no Theta
Delts.
Suddenly they came out from
behind the parked cars and it
was no contest.
The Axe was home.
