## A good argument for live music
### 
It is possible, given the prolif
eration of the electronic means
for reproducing plastic
preserved music, and given the
increasing frequency with which
such devices are employed, to
go for great lengths of time
without encountering a har
monic experience first hand. It is
possible, but it would also be a
strategy of questionable wis
dom. In addition to contributing
to the insidious habit of vicari
ous living, such a policy pursued
on campus would require that
one ignore over 100 concerts to
be presented by the music de
partment this year.
Highlights of the 1977-78 sea
son run as follows:
Dr. Walter Ducloux, as guest
conductor and visiting profes
sor, will conduct the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra in perfor
mances of music by Beethoven,
Mozart, Brahms, Wagner, De
bussey, Dvorak, and others.
The Francesco Trio, Stanford's
famed ensemble-in-residence,
with violinist David Abel, cellist
Bonnie Hampton, and pianist
Nathan Schwartz, will perform a
new chamber music series
featuring the works of Schubert
and Dvorak, as well as West
Coast premieres of the new
trios: Ciacona, by Mario
Davidovsky, and a work by Earl
Kim composed especially for the
group as a Naumberg Award
commission. The Trio will be
joined by a number of guest ar
tists throughout the year.
Opera
In December, the department
will undertake a major produc
tion of the early Italian opera La
Dafne by the 17th century Floren
tine composer Marco da Gag
liano, under the direction of
George Houle, director of the
New York Pro Musica in the
American premiere of Dafne in
1974. Guest soloists, the Early
Music Singers, and an ensemble
of Baroque instruments will be
featured. Renaissance dances
will be choreographed and di
rected by Wendy Hilton, with set
designs and costumes from the
original New York production.
Ongoing events include:
—the Sunday Afternoon
Series: chamber ensembles,
and the Stanford Chamber Or
chestra conducted by Walter
Ducloux and student conduc
tors, exploring the orchestral
repertoire in performances of
music by Mozart, Schubert,
Mendelssohn and others;
—the Stanford Chorale, with
William Ramsey, conductor, in
performances of vocal chamber
music from the Renaissance to
the present;
—the Stanford Wind Ensem
ble conducted by Arthur Barnes,
playing classical concert music
for band;
—performances of sacred and
secular music from the Medieval
period through the Baroque, by

the Early Music Singers under
the direction of William Mahrt;
—the University Chorus, di
rected by William Ramsey,
exploring the choral literature of
every nation through the cen
turies, and performing one
major choral work each quarter;
—the Renaissance Wind Band
directed by Herbert Myers, play
ing early music for shawns, sac
kbuts, cornets, crumhorns,
recorders and zinks.
New music
In a less classical vein will be:
—Alea 11, Stanford's ensemble

Peterson, presenting premieres
of a variety of contemporary

works including many by young
Stanford composers;
—computer-generated music
from Stanford's Computer
Center for Research in Music
and Acoustics;

the direction ot saxophonist

More free music can be heard
at the noon musicals presented
by the music department in Tre
sidder Lounge throughout the
year. The musicals will be duly
noted in "Once Around the
Quad" and "Spectrograph," as
are possible changes in the con
cert schedule.
The concert schedule in its en

tirety is contained in the Music
Department fall calendar which
can be found at the information
desk on the second floor of Tre
sidder Union. The Season be
gins October 7, with the Fran
cesco Trio's performance. For
further information contact the
music department office, at
497-3812. For further edification
contemplate the words of Fried
rich Nietzsche: "Life without
music would be a mistake.
Contemplate also the words of
Tom Waits: "It would have been
a real shame if nobody had
shown up tonight.'' In short, at
tend the concerts — head
phones are bad for your neck.
