# Straight from the Ram's Head
## 
### 
Ram's Head, the recently re
vived student theatre company,
has ambitious plans for the com
ing year.
From 1911 until 1971 Ram's
Head was a prominent fixture of
campus life. At its peak it was
doing three shows a year: the
student written Big Game
Gaities and the Winter One Acts,
as well as a broadway musical in
the spring.
Contemporary interests in
drama have always been re
flected in Ram's Head's choice
of material. In the '30s, it was
pom poms, in the '60s it was pro
test and by '71 the focus had be
come so diffuse that the group
was disbanded.
If you had been an under
graduate here three years ago
the name Ram's Head would
have meant little to you. As one
Stern Hall resident once said,
"Ram's Head sounds like a Food
Service lunch." In 1977, how
ever, it is an organization of
which an increasing number of
people are aware. It is, in es
sence, a new-old tradition.
Dorm drama is big at Stanford.
Many residence halls put on at
least one show a year, often a
musical. Some of the most
committed and ambitious of the
dorm dramatists decided to
bring Ram's Ffead back. They
produced Guys and Dolls in
Mem Aud in the spring of 1976. It
played to an enthusiastic audi
ence of 4000 over a four night
run. This past year's show, Fid
dler on the Roof, was seen by
bOOO people.
This year the group is reinstat
ing the Big Game Gaities in
Memorial Auditorium on
November 18 (the night before
the Berkeley-Stanford game).
The satirical musical revue
focusing on a campus theme has
been in the works since last
spring. The staff ot writers is
headed by the director Paul Ed
wards (class of '77). Auciitions
will be held Oct. 4 and 5.
The spring show will be The

Music Man, directed by |unior
Robert Wildman. It is a very dif
ferent show from Fiddler, one
reason why it was chosen. Other
factors taken into consideration
were the large cast si/e, the c hal
lenging roles tor the leads, the
substantial chorus involvement
and its salability.
Ram's Head is no longer the
exclusive organization that it
formerly was. You're a
"member" as soon as you've
participated in any capacity.
There is a production staff which
begins work in the spring on the
shows of the following year.
Through working on the pro
duction from offstage, the stu
dents have the opportunity tc
see how putting on a show r

more than memorizing a tew
lines and dancing a few steps.
One theme that Ram's Head
emphasizes is a high level of
student involvement. The two
most recent shows had 150 to
200 participants distributed bet
ween the cast, orchestra, tech
nical and production staffs. But
the present directors feel that
more people could and should
get in on the act.
Keith Light had never been in a
play before he.was a villager in
Fiddler. A large percentage of
the cast was inexperienced. A
true example of the doors that
Ram's Ftead can open for aspir
ing thespians, Keith is now co
producer of the Gaities.
