# Lively season for Lively Arts
## 
### 
"If you think chamber music is stuffy—"
reads a certain promotional poster, on which
are depicted a very well dressed and very well
stuffed elderly couple, woman holding her
lorgnette, man with his monocle in place —
"gadzooks, you gotta (sic) hear the Saint Paul
Chamber Orchestra.'
For better or worse, the poster captures the
mood of the Lively Arts at Stanford program. It
is the Lively Arts' business to bring to campus
things cultural, i lassical and artistic, yet it does
so without creating the stagnant, preserved
in-ritual atmosphere epitomized by the poster.
Soon to be under the directorship of Vicky
Holt (late of the Mississippi River Festival), the
program grew out of the Office of Public
Events' Tuesday Night Series of the late '60s.
Former Lively Arts' director Tom Bachetti, who
has since departed to head the Tennessee Arts
Commission, played a major role in shaping the
new program out of the attractions featured on
Tuesday evenings.
Traveling companies and touring musicians
form the staft of the Lively Arts' offerings. In the
past, the program coordinators have shown
considerable facility in assembling a varied but
high quality schedule. This year they seem to
have outdone themselves, t)ut of course, the
individual is the judge.
The individual should consider, therefore,

the offerings of fall quarter. On the 14th, pianist 1 1
Philippe Entremont will appear in Memorial ]|
Auditorium. An established musician of the I
first rank, Entremont will remain in the area ' |
after his performance here'to conduct the San j 1
Francisco Symphony for part of its November i
Mozart festival. \ |
The baroque ensemble Aston Magna will play \ |
in Memorial Auditorium one week later and j j
one week after that the classical guitarist ( ,
Carlos-Barbosa Lima will appear. ] |
November will be a time of small ensembles, ii
Starting the month off, on the fourth, will be J |
the Chiligirian String Quartet, members of the 11
Young Concert Artists program. 1 hey will play k
in Kresge Auditorium. Ever popular favorites, ©

performances in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the 8
sixth, eighth and eleventh. Gary Karr and Har- o
mon lewis, playing respectively double bass x
and keyboard, will round the quarter out the ©
18th, also in Dinkelspiel. X
The accent will remain on classical music the 0
rest of the year, but diversity will be supplied by X
such notables as the Paul Taylor Dance Com- 0
pany and actor Anthony Zerbe. Of special note o
is the April performance scheduled for the New x
York Chamber Solists. They will play all six of ©

The Guarneri Quartet
"If you think chamber music is stuffy—"
reads a certain promotional poster, on which
are depicted a very well dressed and very well
stuffed elderly couple, woman holding her
lorgnette, man with his monocle in place —
"gadzooks, you gotta (sic) hear the Saint Paul
Chamber Orchestra.'
For better or worse, the poster captures the
mood of the Lively Arts at Stanford program. It
is the Lively Arts' business to bring to campus
things cultural, i lassical and artistic, yet it does
so without creating the stagnant, preserved
in-ritual atmosphere epitomized by the poster.
Soon to be under the directorship of Vicky
Holt (late of the Mississippi River Festival), the
program grew out of the Office of Public
Events' Tuesday Night Series of the late '60s.
Former Lively Arts' director Tom Bachetti, who
has since departed to head the Tennessee Arts
Commission, played a major role in shaping the
new program out of the attractions featured on
Tuesday evenings.
Traveling companies and touring musicians
form the staft of the Lively Arts' offerings. In the
past, the program coordinators have shown
considerable facility in assembling a varied but
high quality schedule. This year they seem to
have outdone themselves, t)ut of course, the
individual is the judge.
The individual should consider, therefore,

the offerings of fall quarter. On the 14th, pianist 1 1
Philippe Entremont will appear in Memorial ]|
Auditorium. An established musician of the I
first rank, Entremont will remain in the area ' |
after his performance here'to conduct the San j 1
Francisco Symphony for part of its November i
Mozart festival. \ |
The baroque ensemble Aston Magna will play \ |
in Memorial Auditorium one week later and j j
one week after that the classical guitarist ( ,
Carlos-Barbosa Lima will appear. ] |
November will be a time of small ensembles, ii
Starting the month off, on the fourth, will be J |
the Chiligirian String Quartet, members of the 11
