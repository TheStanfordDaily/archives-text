The Savoyards are, according
to producer Rita Taylor, "a mic
rocosm of Stanford." Twice dur
ing the academic year, Taylor
says, an improbable collection
of individuals pool their talents
and enthusiasm to produce a
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.
This assemblage typically in
cludes students of all ages from a
wide variety of departments,
staff members of all descrip
tions, faculty, alumni, adminis
trators — even President Lyman
has been known to participate.
The Savoyards were formed in
the spring of 1973 by a small
group of Gilbert and Sullivan en
thusiasts eager to see G&S on
the stage at Stanford. It began as
SCIRE 113, with a grant of $600 to
produce The Pirates of Pen
zance. Since then, to quote
Taylor, "We've never looked
back." Subsequent productions
have been paid for by box-office
receipts. No one in the company
is paid for his or her work — the
only payment they receive is two
complimentary tickets and the
gratification of seeing a good
show on opening night.
"We've been lucky," says
Taylor, "to have so many Gilbert
and Sullivan fansat Stanford. We
usually have a very good turnout
for auditions. I wish," she adds
ruefully, "that the response for
backstage people was half as
good. People seem to think that
if they can't sing there's no place
for them in the production. But
we need lots of other support

people — carpenters, costum
ers, typists. Even those who
think they haven't any skills can
paint sets or cut gels."
For their sixth season opener,
the Savoyards are presenting a
double bill of old favorites,
H.M.S. Pinafore and Trial By
jury. Auditions will be held on
Monday and Tuesday, Sept. 26
and 27 from 7-10 p.m. in Din
kelspiel Auditorium. Orchestra
members and production crew
may also sign up at this time.
Further information may be ob
tained by phoning Rita Taylor —

In the spring the Savoyards
will present a lesser-known
work, Princess Ida, a parody of
Tennyson's "The Princess."
The story concerns a princess
who has been betrothed in in
fancy to Prince Hilarion. Prin
cess Ida, however, despises
men, and has founded a Wo
men's University in the Castle
Adamant. She refuses to marry
Hilarion, so he and two friends
dress as women and infiltrate
the University. They are eventu
ally discovered, and in act
threei war ensues between Ida's
family and Hilarion's. As in all
Gilbert and Sullivan, a solution is
found in the end.
Planning has already begun
for the spring production. The
Savoyards are now accepting
applications for music and stage
directors, set, costume and
lighting designers and other
production personnel.
