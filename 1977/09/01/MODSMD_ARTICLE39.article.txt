The drama department's metamorphosis of the
last several years has produced . . . well . . .
dramatic results.
Since the 1973 arrival of director, critic and scho
lar Charles Lyons to head the department, the goal
has been to integrate the theoretical with the prac
tical. "We assume that performance and theoreti
cal study are not two activities which should be put
together but that they are part of a single process
of aesthetic experiment and exploration," Lyons
says in a written description of the department.
A master of fine arts program which "stressed
craft rather than art" was phased out and attention
was devoted to building a faculty which "integ
rated theory and practice in their own work."
The success of this approach is self-evident.
Productions of the last two years which have
earned favorable reviews include Aeschylus' Ores
teia (from an original translation by Drama Prof,
john Chioles), Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade and
Shakespeare's As You Like It.
These are tough acts to follow, perhaps, but the
department has set itself an ambitious schedule
for the coming academic year.
Autumn will bring William Wycherly's The
Country Wife, a restoration comedy fleet of mouth
but clear of mind. The play passes judgement
upon 17th century social, sexual and marital
mores, and though it is true to its age, its insights
remain potent. The Country Wife was banned in
England for two centuries (it was held to appeal

Erimarily to the purient interests of the viewer),
ut Wycherly's caustic wit refused to stay buried.
John Rouse, a third year graduate student in drama
will direct. Performance dates are scheduled for
November 9-12 and 14-19.
In February Robert Lane will direct Edward
Bond's The Sea, wherein a small English seaside
town is dissected with the dramatist's scalpel.
The play has been called "a comedy of terrors" â€”
it is clearly among Bond's best.
In the spring Drama Prof. Martin Esslin will di
rect The Purging and Don't Co Walking Around
Naked, two plays by Georges Feydeau, the great
premier of French farce. Esslin is the most recent
addition to the department's faculty and his accep
tance of a professorship here was considered
quite acoup by the theatrical press. Responsible in
large part for bringing such playwrights as Beckett
and lonesco to public attention with his classic
book The Theatre of the Absurd, Esslin has also
written major studies on Bertolt Brecht and Harold
Pinter. He headed the 8.8.C.'s drama division for
many years and will maintain his ties with Euro
pean theatre by spending six months of the year
abroad.
In addition to these major undertakings, the
drama department has plans for a number of more
modest productions in the form of the Directing
Workshops for graduate students. They will stage
several works each quarter.
