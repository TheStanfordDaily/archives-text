# the 						Bay Area performing arts – entering the major leagues
## 
### 
The California Reflex, that
quick glance over the shoulder
to see what the East Coast is up
to, is on the decline among the
producers of San Francisco's
performing arts. In the past, the
word "provincial" on the lips of
a visiting New Yorker or Bosto
nian was enough to start heads
turning toward the traditional
centers of culture. Now, how
ever, the city's music and drama
community is on the verge of
transforming the Bay Area into
one of the world's capitals of the
performing arts.
The Symphony, the Ballet and
the Opera have all been in San
Francisco for more than four de
cades. During this time, none of
them has been completely de
void of brilliance, but neither
have they consistently inspired
ecstatic reviews. The problem
took the form of a vicious circle
of belief creating fact creating
belief; top caliber artists would
not risk their careers by ventur
ing out into what they consi
dered a cultural trough and so

assured that the area would re
main in the depths of philis
tinism.
The Symphony was founded
in 1911 by members of the small
but influential community of
classical music patrons which
had existed almost since the Ci
ty's birth.
During Jthe next 50 years the
Orchestra went through a
number of artistic ups and
downs. Josef Krips, appointed
music director in 1963, started
the Symphony on the road to
permanent improvement. Seiji
Ozawa took the reins in 1970
and held them until this last sea
son.
The Dutch-born Edo De
Waart, principal guest conduc
tor since 1975, will start his first
season as music director in
November. The 34-year-old
maestro has established a solid
reputation both in this country
and abroad, having assisted
such conductors as Leonard
Bernstein and George Szell.
The Ballet has the distinction

of being the oldest classical bal
let company in the United
States. Founded in 1933, the
company has suffered, and still
suffers, in the opinion of many,
although to an ever-decreasing
degree, in comparison with the
American Ballet Company of
New York.
The Ballet is directed by
Lew Christensen and Michael
Smuin.
Opera
The Opera has presented 2105
performances since it was
founded in 1923. The company
has been in the forefront of
American opera consistently,
having staged 18 United States
premieres as well as two world
premieres and having provided
American opera debuts of the
likes of Renata Tebaldi and Sir
Ceorg Solti. General Director
Kurt Herbert Adler has been the
major force in opera in the west
ern United States for many years
and has played a important role
in forming offshoots of the
Opera such as the Western

Opera Theater and the Brown
Bag Opera.
The most dramatic recent im
provement in San Francisco's
performing arts has taken place
in the realm of theatre. Writing
in San Francisco Theatre, Ber
keley Repertory Theatre As
sociate Director Douglas
Johnson says that "20 years ago,
when I was about to leave high
school to pursue a career in
theatre, the Bay Area was a
wasteland, theatrically speak
ing." He contrasts this condition
with the present state, which he
calls "a veritable boom of theat
rical activity — one whose qual
ity and quantity rivals most of the
major metropolitan centers in
the countrv."
Leading the way in this bloom
of dramatic activity has been the
American Conservatory Theatre
(ACT), perhaps the City's
strongest candidate for a super
lative rating when compared
with similar companies across
the country. William Ball, the
troupe's founder, first con

ceived of ACT while he was in
England studying repertory
theatre. Disenchanted on his re
turn with what he calls "those
cold, icy New York perfor
mances," he founded the com
pany 12 years ago in Pittsburgh.
In 1966 the troupe set out look
ing for a new home and, after
brief stops in Westport,
Chicago, Phoenix and the Stan
ford Summer Festival, it came to
rest in the Geary Theatre.
It took four seasons for the
company to become firmly es
tablished (i.e. fiscally sound) but
since it has been solvent, the
company has continued to im
prove, refine and innovate. It is
now the largest company of its
kind in the country, with roughly
10 plays in repertory at any one
time and an annual budget of $4
million.
The Conservatory, its actor
training program, accommo
dates 35 professional actors and
actresses and 85 students. Its
unusual curriculum, becominga
model worldwide, includes, in

addition to the standard acting,
voice, singing and dance
courses, exotic offerings such as
Transcendental Meditation (ab
out half of the company prac
tices TM), bio-energetics, yoga
and karate.
Ball, now 45, continues to be
the guiding genius of the com
pany.
Civic Light Opera
The Civic Light Opera, now in
its 40th year, brings four Broad
way musicals to the City each
year. Founded by Homer Cur
ran, for whom the Curran
Theatre is named, and Edward
Lester in both Los Angeles and
San Francisco, the Light Opera
has been a consistently success
ful enterprise. Its current pro
duction is Irma la Douce and
Kismet is planned for a six week
run starting in November.
About 80 other theatre
troupes make their home in the
Bay Area. These range from the
New City Theatre ("We present
works of social and political vis
ion from the working class point

of view and participate culturally
in the struggles of all people for
a better life,") to the Chamber
Theatre Croup ("Eight.to 10
people who wish to present an
integration of music and choir in
performances of Sacred
Theatre,") to the Alameda Little
Theatre ("Five shows are pre
sented each year with open au
ditions held approximately
seven weeks prior to opening,")
to the Action Theatre ("improvi
sational, spontaneous, physical
theatre").
Some of the better known
companies of the Bay Area in
clude the Berkeley Mime
Troupe, the Berkeley Repertory
Company, California Actors
Theatre, and the San Francisco
Mime Troupe. In addition, a
number of companies are
oriented toward specific racial
or cultural groups. Included in
this category are the Asian
American Theatre Workshop,
the Black Repertory Croup,
Teatro Latino and the Women's
Ensemble.

its 40th year, brings four Broad
way musicals to the City each
year. Founded by Homer Cur
ran, for whom the Curran
Theatre is named, and Edward
Lester in both Los Angeles and
San Francisco, the Light Opera
has been a consistently success
ful enterprise. Its current pro
duction is Irma la Douce and
Kismet is planned for a six week
run starting in November.
About 80 other theatre
troupes make their home in the
Bay Area. These range from the
New City Theatre ("We present
works of social and political vis
ion from the working class point

of view and participate culturally
in the struggles of all people for
a better life,") to the Chamber
Theatre Croup ("Eight.to 10
people who wish to present an
integration of music and choir in
performances of Sacred
Theatre,") to the Alameda Little
Theatre ("Five shows are pre
sented each year with open au
ditions held approximately
seven weeks prior to opening,")
to the Action Theatre ("improvi
sational, spontaneous, physical
theatre").
Some of the better known
companies of the Bay Area in
clude the Berkeley Mime
Troupe, the Berkeley Repertory
Company, California Actors
Theatre, and the San Francisco
Mime Troupe. In addition, a
number of companies are
oriented toward specific racial
or cultural groups. Included in
this category are the Asian
American Theatre Workshop,
the Black Repertory Croup,
Teatro Latino and the Women's
Ensemble.


The California Reflex, that
quick glance over the shoulder
to see what the East Coast is up
to, is on the decline among the
producers of San Francisco's
performing arts. In the past, the
word "provincial" on the lips of
a visiting New Yorker or Bosto
nian was enough to start heads
turning toward the traditional
centers of culture. Now, how
ever, the city's music and drama
community is on the verge of
transforming the Bay Area into
one of the world's capitals of the
performing arts.
The Symphony, the Ballet and
the Opera have all been in San
Francisco for more than four de
cades. During this time, none of
them has been completely de
void of brilliance, but neither
have they consistently inspired
ecstatic reviews. The problem
took the form of a vicious circle
of belief creating fact creating
belief; top caliber artists would
not risk their careers by ventur
ing out into what they consi
dered a cultural trough and so

assured that the area would re
main in the depths of philis
tinism.
The Symphony was founded
in 1911 by members of the small
but influential community of
classical music patrons which
had existed almost since the Ci
ty's birth.
During Jthe next 50 years the
Orchestra went through a
number of artistic ups and
downs. Josef Krips, appointed
music director in 1963, started
the Symphony on the road to
permanent improvement. Seiji
Ozawa took the reins in 1970
and held them until this last sea
son.
The Dutch-born Edo De
Waart, principal guest conduc
tor since 1975, will start his first
season as music director in
November. The 34-year-old
maestro has established a solid
reputation both in this country
and abroad, having assisted
such conductors as Leonard
Bernstein and George Szell.
The Ballet has the distinction

of being the oldest classical bal
let company in the United
States. Founded in 1933, the
company has suffered, and still
suffers, in the opinion of many,
although to an ever-decreasing
degree, in comparison with the
American Ballet Company of
New York.
The Ballet is directed by
Lew Christensen and Michael
Smuin.
Opera
The Opera has presented 2105
performances since it was
founded in 1923. The company
has been in the forefront of
American opera consistently,
having staged 18 United States
premieres as well as two world
premieres and having provided
American opera debuts of the
likes of Renata Tebaldi and Sir
Ceorg Solti. General Director
Kurt Herbert Adler has been the
major force in opera in the west
ern United States for many years
and has played a important role
in forming offshoots of the
Opera such as the Western

Opera Theater and the Brown
Bag Opera.
The most dramatic recent im
provement in San Francisco's
performing arts has taken place
in the realm of theatre. Writing
in San Francisco Theatre, Ber
keley Repertory Theatre As
sociate Director Douglas
Johnson says that "20 years ago,
when I was about to leave high
school to pursue a career in
theatre, the Bay Area was a
wasteland, theatrically speak
ing." He contrasts this condition
with the present state, which he
calls "a veritable boom of theat
rical activity — one whose qual
ity and quantity rivals most of the
major metropolitan centers in
the countrv."
Leading the way in this bloom
of dramatic activity has been the
American Conservatory Theatre
(ACT), perhaps the City's
strongest candidate for a super
lative rating when compared
with similar companies across
the country. William Ball, the
troupe's founder, first con

ceived of ACT while he was in
England studying repertory
theatre. Disenchanted on his re
turn with what he calls "those
cold, icy New York perfor
mances," he founded the com
pany 12 years ago in Pittsburgh.
In 1966 the troupe set out look
ing for a new home and, after
brief stops in Westport,
Chicago, Phoenix and the Stan
ford Summer Festival, it came to
rest in the Geary Theatre.
It took four seasons for the
company to become firmly es
tablished (i.e. fiscally sound) but
since it has been solvent, the
company has continued to im
prove, refine and innovate. It is
now the largest company of its
kind in the country, with roughly
10 plays in repertory at any one
time and an annual budget of $4
million.
The Conservatory, its actor
training program, accommo
dates 35 professional actors and
actresses and 85 students. Its
unusual curriculum, becominga
model worldwide, includes, in

addition to the standard acting,
voice, singing and dance
courses, exotic offerings such as
Transcendental Meditation (ab
out half of the company prac
tices TM), bio-energetics, yoga
and karate.
Ball, now 45, continues to be
the guiding genius of the com
pany.

the country. William Ball, the
troupe's founder, first con

ceived of ACT while he was in
England studying repertory
theatre. Disenchanted on his re
turn with what he calls "those
cold, icy New York perfor
mances," he founded the com
pany 12 years ago in Pittsburgh.
In 1966 the troupe set out look
ing for a new home and, after
brief stops in Westport,
Chicago, Phoenix and the Stan
ford Summer Festival, it came to
rest in the Geary Theatre.
It took four seasons for the
company to become firmly es
tablished (i.e. fiscally sound) but
since it has been solvent, the
company has continued to im
prove, refine and innovate. It is
now the largest company of its
kind in the country, with roughly
10 plays in repertory at any one
time and an annual budget of $4
million.
The Conservatory, its actor
training program, accommo
dates 35 professional actors and
actresses and 85 students. Its
unusual curriculum, becominga
model worldwide, includes, in

addition to the standard acting,
voice, singing and dance
courses, exotic offerings such as
Transcendental Meditation (ab
out half of the company prac

and karate.
Ball, now 45, continues to be
the guiding genius of the com
pany.
Civic Light Opera
The Civic Light Opera, now in
its 40th year, brings four Broad
way musicals to the City each
year. Founded by Homer Cur
ran, for whom the Curran
Theatre is named, and Edward
Lester in both Los Angeles and
San Francisco, the Light Opera
has been a consistently success
ful enterprise. Its current pro
duction is Irma la Douce and
Kismet is planned for a six week
run starting in November.
About 80 other theatre
troupes make their home in the
Bay Area. These range from the
New City Theatre ("We present
works of social and political vis
ion from the working class point

of view and participate culturally
in the struggles of all people for
a better life,") to the Chamber
Theatre Croup ("Eight.to 10
people who wish to present an
integration of music and choir in
performances of Sacred
Theatre,") to the Alameda Little
Theatre ("Five shows are pre
sented each year with open au
ditions held approximately
seven weeks prior to opening,")
to the Action Theatre ("improvi
sational, spontaneous, physical
theatre").
Some of the better known
companies of the Bay Area in
clude the Berkeley Mime
Troupe, the Berkeley Repertory
Company, California Actors
Theatre, and the San Francisco
Mime Troupe. In addition, a
number of companies are
oriented toward specific racial
or cultural groups. Included in
this category are the Asian
American Theatre Workshop,
the Black Repertory Croup,
Teatro Latino and the Women's
Ensemble.


The California Reflex, that
quick glance over the shoulder
to see what the East Coast is up
to, is on the decline among the
producers of San Francisco's
performing arts. In the past, the
word "provincial" on the lips of
a visiting New Yorker or Bosto
nian was enough to start heads
turning toward the traditional
centers of culture. Now, how
ever, the city's music and drama
community is on the verge of
transforming the Bay Area into
one of the world's capitals of the
performing arts.
The Symphony, the Ballet and
the Opera have all been in San
Francisco for more than four de
cades. During this time, none of
them has been completely de
void of brilliance, but neither
have they consistently inspired
ecstatic reviews. The problem
took the form of a vicious circle
of belief creating fact creating
belief; top caliber artists would
not risk their careers by ventur
ing out into what they consi
dered a cultural trough and so

assured that the area would re
main in the depths of philis
tinism.
The Symphony was founded
in 1911 by members of the small
but influential community of
classical music patrons which
had existed almost since the Ci
ty's birth.
During Jthe next 50 years the
Orchestra went through a
number of artistic ups and
downs. Josef Krips, appointed
music director in 1963, started
the Symphony on the road to
permanent improvement. Seiji
Ozawa took the reins in 1970
and held them until this last sea
son.
The Dutch-born Edo De
Waart, principal guest conduc
tor since 1975, will start his first
season as music director in
November. The 34-year-old
maestro has established a solid
reputation both in this country
and abroad, having assisted
such conductors as Leonard
Bernstein and George Szell.
The Ballet has the distinction

of being the oldest classical bal
let company in the United
States. Founded in 1933, the
company has suffered, and still
suffers, in the opinion of many,
although to an ever-decreasing
degree, in comparison with the
American Ballet Company of
New York.
The Ballet is directed by
Lew Christensen and Michael
Smuin.
Opera
The Opera has presented 2105
performances since it was
founded in 1923. The company
has been in the forefront of
American opera consistently,
having staged 18 United States
premieres as well as two world
premieres and having provided
American opera debuts of the
likes of Renata Tebaldi and Sir
Ceorg Solti. General Director
Kurt Herbert Adler has been the
major force in opera in the west
ern United States for many years
and has played a important role
in forming offshoots of the
Opera such as the Western

Opera Theater and the Brown
Bag Opera.
The most dramatic recent im
provement in San Francisco's
performing arts has taken place
in the realm of theatre. Writing
in San Francisco Theatre, Ber
keley Repertory Theatre As
sociate Director Douglas
Johnson says that "20 years ago,
when I was about to leave high
school to pursue a career in
theatre, the Bay Area was a
wasteland, theatrically speak
ing." He contrasts this condition
with the present state, which he
calls "a veritable boom of theat
rical activity — one whose qual
ity and quantity rivals most of the
major metropolitan centers in
the countrv."
Leading the way in this bloom
of dramatic activity has been the
American Conservatory Theatre
(ACT), perhaps the City's
strongest candidate for a super
lative rating when compared
with similar companies across
the country. William Ball, the
troupe's founder, first con

ceived of ACT while he was in

theatre. Disenchanted on his re
