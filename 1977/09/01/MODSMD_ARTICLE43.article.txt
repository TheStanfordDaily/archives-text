# From antique stores to 'body shops' on Union Street
## 
### 
Between the shrimp cocktail of the wharves
and tourist cocktail of Chinatown lies Union
Street, a mixture ol what San Francisco is fam
ous for — things peculiar and edible.
The order of the day is shopping for items
varying from Finnish cheese to antique pipes
and the order of the night is shopping for a
partner and/or a good time (often the same
thing) in places ranging from a quiet corner of
a restaurant to a dance floor of a disco, or even
one of numerous, narrow back alleys, if that's
your whim.
The central, busiest section of Union Street
stretches about five blocks, from Laguna to
Pierce. It is a combination of manv-colored

doors, unusual spots to eat, parallel parking,
and people who are dressed well and know it.
Everything is packed close together, even
more so than in the rest of the City, making
slow feet and sharp eyes necessary for catch
ing all the sights.
Eat
The first thing is to eat, either brunch or
lunch, in order to be able to walk it off during

the afternoon. Park Place, one of the newer
restaurants, serves an excellent brunch on the
weekends. Choices include various poached
eggs and omelettes, salmon, chile rellenos,
and even a ground beef casserole called "Joe's
Special," which is supposedly cooked better
than when Joe invented it at another restau rant
a few years back. The tone in Park Place is set
by caneback chairs, redwood beams, over
head ferns and a clear, glass roof. The waiters
are young and friendly, and one of them is an
almost exact likeness of Ciancarlo Ciannini.
Prices for brunch are $2.75 to $3.95, and the
servings are generous. Don't hesitate to go for
dinner, too. The chef was stolen from Port
land, and seafood is his specialty.
A bit down the block is Thomas Lord's, with a
pub setting and pretzels at every table. There
are pictures of cricket matches on the walls,
and a type of food named Wimbledon Fries,
which does not, incidentally, mean potatoes in
the shape of tennis rackets. A fireplace and
television by the bar complete the decor. On
the menu are crepes, quiche, crab, burgers,
and eggs, costing about $2.95 to $4.95. Most of
the patrons are in their 30s and 40s, though
younger patrons are quite welcome. Wear a
heavy, wool sweater if you really want to fit in.
Cup cantata
Another spot is Coffee Cantata which boasts
exhibits of local artists and a patio facing the
street, so you can watch the walkers watch you
eat. Cups and plates seem to clatter continu
ally, as if to keep reminding you that you're in a
restaurant. Prices range from $2.50 to $4.50.
There's also the Bohemian Gardens, which
no doubt looks something like Bohemia even
though the food seems a bit American. Color
ful murals of the French Riviera cover the walls.
In back is a protected outside cafe where you
can eat cordonbleu and stuffed cabbage, or
more average delights such as corned beef and
roast beef, at prices from $2 to $4.
Two other small and interesting places are
Delancey Street, run Solely by ex-cons, and
Bogart's Shellfish Bar, which specializes in
guess what.
After eating, it's time to take to the streets.
The choice of shops in which to browse is
nearly burdensome. A good deal of furi and a
greater deal of money can be spent in the an
tique stores. Undoubtedly, many of the an
tiques are good investments, and who has not
dreamt of owning a 1928 gramophone to blast
out the neighbors? One of the stores even
carries antique clothing, assuredly sewn by an

tique seamstresses. If you want that grandpa
rent look, this is the spot for you. In any case,
romping through the goods of days past for an
hour or two is entertaining and even educa
tional.
The new
Union Street is also filled with modern trin
ket shops which carry every sort of gumball
machine known to man, imaginative cards to

send for mother's or father's or grand aunt's
day, and numerous games, including a new
version of Monopoly, with San Francisco as the
scene instead of plain old Atlantic City. These
trinket shops, and the antique stores, are often
owned and run by one person. Apparently it's
customary for these people to be interesting
and able to tell good stories, so staying a while
and talking to them can be quite enjoyable.
A great number of additional odds and ends
are scattered along the street. Several bars,
such as the Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers, not
as busy in the afternoon as at night when they
fill completely, are good places to have a few
drinks in the afternoon, relax and talk.
In the alleys lie various merchants-in
waiting, like the Flower Boutique, complete
with birdsongs, and a well-stocked poster
store. If your tastes run to the more exotic,
there's a pet shop displaying some of the
"weirdest-looking birds," as one passerby de
scribed them. You can also find a sheepskin
shop, and an art gallery, showing, with other
exhibits, food art (to prepare you for dinner).
Safari
If you like old buildings, explore the Sher
man School on a weekday. And for the
internationally-minded, there's a Safari travel
agent a short distance down the block.
Finally, sometime during the afternoon, you
need to visit the Garden Cheese Company. To
reach the shop, you stroll down an alley built
for one way traffic, and as you proceed, the
smell of cheese becomes more and more
gouda until you finally arrive in a frenzy of tasty
anticipation.
A man named Nicholas van Beek, who
seems to have just popped out of the French
countryside, runs Garden Cheese, called such
because of a small, spotless garden next door,
where, as van Beek says, "an old man rakes it
with a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Finland, Greece and even the old
staple, France, line the shelves of the store, as
well as wine and an assortment of gourmet
foods. A visit is worth the time.
Night
At night, especially on weekends, Union
Street does it's own imitation of Mr. Hyde. In
place of the calm, shopping and strolling
crowd comes a mass of people in their 20s and
early 30s to infiltrate the bars and restaurants.
And as one man declared, "these places get to
be body shops late at night. People are on the
take, and no one's trying to hide it."
The best example, with some of the best of
everything, is Perry's. Prices go from $4.75 to
$8.50, and the meal is worth every bite of the
money. It is definitely some of the finest eating
around — London broil, skewered lamb, chic
ken — all good and plentiful. The salads are
large and green, and the drinks are as strong as
you'd fix them for yourself, unless your name
is W.C. and you hate babies. The service is
fine, and you're given time to eat each course
and relax before the next, instead of hurrying

through the meal.
But "most of the people don't just come in
here for dinner," one waiter stated. "This is
self-made entertainment. It's a people show."
At the bar and all around the front area of
Perry's, men and women stand and converse
and watch who's walking by. It's one of the
best places to meet someone easily and
quickly, so if that's what you desire, eat and
drink out front. If you want a quiet dinner with
someone you already know, ask for a table in
the back. Either way, you've got a good deal.
Antebellum atmosphere
Of course, a good number of other restaur
ants stand patiently along the street. La Creole,
with table settings and authentic New Orleans
food, gives the feeling of eating at the home of
an antebellum Southern aristocrat. Prices are
low, only $4 to $6.
For wine drinkers, the Vintner is decorated,
in principle, like an underground wine cellar.
A big cask sticks out at the entrance and on the
walls are pictures of old cellars and vintners.
There's a second floor, for height-lovers, pri
vate booths if you wish, and claims of carrying
the best of the California North Coast wines.
Prices are from $6 to $9, mostly for steak and
such things.
At Mingei-Ya, one eats in japanese country
style (i.e. you take off your shoes and sit on rice
mats). Prices are high, about $8 or $9, for
sukiyaki, teriyaki or tempura. The atmosphere
is comfortable, not too ornate, and an older,
more restrained crowd frequents Mingei-Ya.

Another factor to consider is the menu, which
teaches several useful Japanese words, like
ne/san (waitress)andmaneki-neko (beckoning
cat).
To be really native, eat at Marhaba, a Moroc
can restaurant. The waiters wear Moroccan
clothing, Moroccan music fills the room, and
the tables are low, round and brass, with soft,
thick pillows for chairs. The food is expensive
— $9.50/ person — but unusual. If you're ad
venturous, try it.
Two other good possibilities are the
Peanuts, $3 to $5, one room and cozy, and
McGreevy's Fish Market, $4.50 to $7.50, both
specializing in seafood. McGreevy's has a bar
and Sunday brunch, in addition.
After dinner, the bars not associated with
restaurants begin to crowd up, and the musical
entertainment starts. The two spots men
tioned earlier, Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers,
have evening music, usually a guitarist or small
group. Another more boisterous bar is Ivan
Alexander's, where mostly jazz is played.
One of the most popular meeting places is
Mother Lode. An agreeable meal can be found
here ranging from seafood, such as sole or
trout, to a good thick steak or prime rib on
Fridays and Saturdays. Entrees include soup
and a large salad (big enough for three — that
is if there's only two) served in a big bowl (no
choice of dressing, though). Prices are in the
$5 to $8 range and don't forget to order the
coffee to get the cinnamon surprise.
Straight crowd
Yet, there is the "bodyshop" — and that's a
big part of an evening here, for the Mother
Lode works in cooperation with the Disco 2001
(no relation to the movie). This is a swinging
bar-discotheque geared to the straight crowd.
There is a minor dress code: no sneakers, hats
or dirty jeans. There is also a good turnover in
the clientele, but not too many tourists. The
two dance floors, giant videoscreens, and
whirling lights of Disco 2001 and the rustic
western setting of the Mother Lode provide a
lively night stop.
If dancing doesn't inspire you, and you'd
rather listen to music from established artists,
go to the Great American Music Hall on O'Far
rell Street. The performers are generally top
notch and the cost per person to see the show
ranges from $3 to $7.50, depending on the
performer. Drinks and food are extra and so is
a smile from any of the cocktail waitresses. The
building itself is well-decorated, and the
acoustics are good. The majority of the audi
ence is single and in their 20s.
That's about it. Take your time on Union
Street and look around at what you can. It's
similar to certain paintings — the more you
see, the more you realize how much more
there is to see.

Another factor to consider is the menu, which
teaches several useful Japanese words, like
ne/san (waitress)andmaneki-neko (beckoning
cat).
To be really native, eat at Marhaba, a Moroc
can restaurant. The waiters wear Moroccan
clothing, Moroccan music fills the room, and
the tables are low, round and brass, with soft,
thick pillows for chairs. The food is expensive
— $9.50/ person — but unusual. If you're ad
venturous, try it.
Two other good possibilities are the
Peanuts, $3 to $5, one room and cozy, and
McGreevy's Fish Market, $4.50 to $7.50, both
specializing in seafood. McGreevy's has a bar
and Sunday brunch, in addition.
After dinner, the bars not associated with
restaurants begin to crowd up, and the musical
entertainment starts. The two spots men
tioned earlier, Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers,
have evening music, usually a guitarist or small
group. Another more boisterous bar is Ivan
Alexander's, where mostly jazz is played.
One of the most popular meeting places is
Mother Lode. An agreeable meal can be found
here ranging from seafood, such as sole or
trout, to a good thick steak or prime rib on
Fridays and Saturdays. Entrees include soup
and a large salad (big enough for three — that
is if there's only two) served in a big bowl (no
choice of dressing, though). Prices are in the
$5 to $8 range and don't forget to order the
coffee to get the cinnamon surprise.
Straight crowd
Yet, there is the "bodyshop" — and that's a
big part of an evening here, for the Mother
Lode works in cooperation with the Disco 2001
(no relation to the movie). This is a swinging
bar-discotheque geared to the straight crowd.
There is a minor dress code: no sneakers, hats
or dirty jeans. There is also a good turnover in
the clientele, but not too many tourists. The
two dance floors, giant videoscreens, and
whirling lights of Disco 2001 and the rustic
western setting of the Mother Lode provide a
lively night stop.
If dancing doesn't inspire you, and you'd
rather listen to music from established artists,
go to the Great American Music Hall on O'Far
rell Street. The performers are generally top
notch and the cost per person to see the show
ranges from $3 to $7.50, depending on the
performer. Drinks and food are extra and so is
a smile from any of the cocktail waitresses. The
building itself is well-decorated, and the
acoustics are good. The majority of the audi
ence is single and in their 20s.
That's about it. Take your time on Union
Street and look around at what you can. It's
similar to certain paintings — the more you
see, the more you realize how much more
there is to see.

Between the shrimp cocktail of the wharves
and tourist cocktail of Chinatown lies Union
Street, a mixture ol what San Francisco is fam
ous for — things peculiar and edible.
The order of the day is shopping for items
varying from Finnish cheese to antique pipes
and the order of the night is shopping for a
partner and/or a good time (often the same
thing) in places ranging from a quiet corner of
a restaurant to a dance floor of a disco, or even
one of numerous, narrow back alleys, if that's
your whim.
The central, busiest section of Union Street
stretches about five blocks, from Laguna to
Pierce. It is a combination of manv-colored

doors, unusual spots to eat, parallel parking,
and people who are dressed well and know it.
Everything is packed close together, even
more so than in the rest of the City, making
slow feet and sharp eyes necessary for catch
ing all the sights.
Eat
The first thing is to eat, either brunch or
lunch, in order to be able to walk it off during

the afternoon. Park Place, one of the newer
restaurants, serves an excellent brunch on the
weekends. Choices include various poached
eggs and omelettes, salmon, chile rellenos,
and even a ground beef casserole called "Joe's
Special," which is supposedly cooked better
than when Joe invented it at another restau rant
a few years back. The tone in Park Place is set
by caneback chairs, redwood beams, over
head ferns and a clear, glass roof. The waiters
are young and friendly, and one of them is an
almost exact likeness of Ciancarlo Ciannini.
Prices for brunch are $2.75 to $3.95, and the
servings are generous. Don't hesitate to go for
dinner, too. The chef was stolen from Port
land, and seafood is his specialty.
A bit down the block is Thomas Lord's, with a
pub setting and pretzels at every table. There
are pictures of cricket matches on the walls,
and a type of food named Wimbledon Fries,
which does not, incidentally, mean potatoes in
the shape of tennis rackets. A fireplace and
television by the bar complete the decor. On
the menu are crepes, quiche, crab, burgers,
and eggs, costing about $2.95 to $4.95. Most of
the patrons are in their 30s and 40s, though
younger patrons are quite welcome. Wear a
heavy, wool sweater if you really want to fit in.
Cup cantata
Another spot is Coffee Cantata which boasts
exhibits of local artists and a patio facing the
street, so you can watch the walkers watch you
eat. Cups and plates seem to clatter continu
ally, as if to keep reminding you that you're in a
restaurant. Prices range from $2.50 to $4.50.
There's also the Bohemian Gardens, which
no doubt looks something like Bohemia even
though the food seems a bit American. Color
ful murals of the French Riviera cover the walls.
In back is a protected outside cafe where you
can eat cordonbleu and stuffed cabbage, or
more average delights such as corned beef and
roast beef, at prices from $2 to $4.
Two other small and interesting places are
Delancey Street, run Solely by ex-cons, and
Bogart's Shellfish Bar, which specializes in
guess what.
After eating, it's time to take to the streets.
The choice of shops in which to browse is
nearly burdensome. A good deal of furi and a
greater deal of money can be spent in the an
tique stores. Undoubtedly, many of the an
tiques are good investments, and who has not
dreamt of owning a 1928 gramophone to blast
out the neighbors? One of the stores even
carries antique clothing, assuredly sewn by an

tique seamstresses. If you want that grandpa
rent look, this is the spot for you. In any case,
romping through the goods of days past for an
hour or two is entertaining and even educa
tional.
The new
Union Street is also filled with modern trin
ket shops which carry every sort of gumball
machine known to man, imaginative cards to

send for mother's or father's or grand aunt's
day, and numerous games, including a new
version of Monopoly, with San Francisco as the
scene instead of plain old Atlantic City. These
trinket shops, and the antique stores, are often
owned and run by one person. Apparently it's
customary for these people to be interesting
and able to tell good stories, so staying a while
and talking to them can be quite enjoyable.
A great number of additional odds and ends
are scattered along the street. Several bars,
such as the Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers, not
as busy in the afternoon as at night when they
fill completely, are good places to have a few
drinks in the afternoon, relax and talk.
In the alleys lie various merchants-in
waiting, like the Flower Boutique, complete
with birdsongs, and a well-stocked poster
store. If your tastes run to the more exotic,
there's a pet shop displaying some of the
"weirdest-looking birds," as one passerby de
scribed them. You can also find a sheepskin
shop, and an art gallery, showing, with other
exhibits, food art (to prepare you for dinner).
Safari
If you like old buildings, explore the Sher
man School on a weekday. And for the
internationally-minded, there's a Safari travel
agent a short distance down the block.
Finally, sometime during the afternoon, you
need to visit the Garden Cheese Company. To
reach the shop, you stroll down an alley built
for one way traffic, and as you proceed, the
smell of cheese becomes more and more
gouda until you finally arrive in a frenzy of tasty
anticipation.
A man named Nicholas van Beek, who
seems to have just popped out of the French
countryside, runs Garden Cheese, called such
because of a small, spotless garden next door,
where, as van Beek says, "an old man rakes it
with a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Finland, Greece and even the old
staple, France, line the shelves of the store, as
well as wine and an assortment of gourmet
foods. A visit is worth the time.
Night
At night, especially on weekends, Union
Street does it's own imitation of Mr. Hyde. In
place of the calm, shopping and strolling
crowd comes a mass of people in their 20s and
early 30s to infiltrate the bars and restaurants.
And as one man declared, "these places get to
be body shops late at night. People are on the
take, and no one's trying to hide it."
The best example, with some of the best of
everything, is Perry's. Prices go from $4.75 to
$8.50, and the meal is worth every bite of the
money. It is definitely some of the finest eating
around — London broil, skewered lamb, chic
ken — all good and plentiful. The salads are
large and green, and the drinks are as strong as
you'd fix them for yourself, unless your name
is W.C. and you hate babies. The service is
fine, and you're given time to eat each course
and relax before the next, instead of hurrying

through the meal.
But "most of the people don't just come in
here for dinner," one waiter stated. "This is
self-made entertainment. It's a people show."
At the bar and all around the front area of
Perry's, men and women stand and converse
and watch who's walking by. It's one of the
best places to meet someone easily and
quickly, so if that's what you desire, eat and
drink out front. If you want a quiet dinner with
someone you already know, ask for a table in
the back. Either way, you've got a good deal.
Antebellum atmosphere
Of course, a good number of other restaur
ants stand patiently along the street. La Creole,
with table settings and authentic New Orleans
food, gives the feeling of eating at the home of
an antebellum Southern aristocrat. Prices are
low, only $4 to $6.
For wine drinkers, the Vintner is decorated,
in principle, like an underground wine cellar.
A big cask sticks out at the entrance and on the
walls are pictures of old cellars and vintners.
There's a second floor, for height-lovers, pri
vate booths if you wish, and claims of carrying
the best of the California North Coast wines.
Prices are from $6 to $9, mostly for steak and
such things.
At Mingei-Ya, one eats in japanese country
style (i.e. you take off your shoes and sit on rice
mats). Prices are high, about $8 or $9, for
sukiyaki, teriyaki or tempura. The atmosphere
is comfortable, not too ornate, and an older,
more restrained crowd frequents Mingei-Ya.

Another factor to consider is the menu, which
teaches several useful Japanese words, like
ne/san (waitress)andmaneki-neko (beckoning
cat).
To be really native, eat at Marhaba, a Moroc

because of a small, spotless garden next door,
where, as van Beek says, "an old man rakes it
with a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Finland, Greece and even the old
staple, France, line the shelves of the store, as
well as wine and an assortment of gourmet
foods. A visit is worth the time.
Night
At night, especially on weekends, Union
Street does it's own imitation of Mr. Hyde. In
place of the calm, shopping and strolling
crowd comes a mass of people in their 20s and
early 30s to infiltrate the bars and restaurants.
And as one man declared, "these places get to
be body shops late at night. People are on the
take, and no one's trying to hide it."
The best example, with some of the best of
everything, is Perry's. Prices go from $4.75 to
$8.50, and the meal is worth every bite of the
money. It is definitely some of the finest eating
around — London broil, skewered lamb, chic
ken — all good and plentiful. The salads are
large and green, and the drinks are as strong as
you'd fix them for yourself, unless your name
is W.C. and you hate babies. The service is
fine, and you're given time to eat each course
and relax before the next, instead of hurrying

through the meal.
But "most of the people don't just come in
here for dinner," one waiter stated. "This is
self-made entertainment. It's a people show."
At the bar and all around the front area of
Perry's, men and women stand and converse
and watch who's walking by. It's one of the
best places to meet someone easily and
quickly, so if that's what you desire, eat and
drink out front. If you want a quiet dinner with
someone you already know, ask for a table in
the back. Either way, you've got a good deal.
Antebellum atmosphere
Of course, a good number of other restaur
ants stand patiently along the street. La Creole,
with table settings and authentic New Orleans
food, gives the feeling of eating at the home of
an antebellum Southern aristocrat. Prices are
low, only $4 to $6.
For wine drinkers, the Vintner is decorated,
in principle, like an underground wine cellar.
A big cask sticks out at the entrance and on the
walls are pictures of old cellars and vintners.
There's a second floor, for height-lovers, pri
vate booths if you wish, and claims of carrying
the best of the California North Coast wines.
Prices are from $6 to $9, mostly for steak and
such things.
At Mingei-Ya, one eats in japanese country
style (i.e. you take off your shoes and sit on rice
mats). Prices are high, about $8 or $9, for
sukiyaki, teriyaki or tempura. The atmosphere
is comfortable, not too ornate, and an older,
more restrained crowd frequents Mingei-Ya.

Another factor to consider is the menu, which
teaches several useful Japanese words, like
ne/san (waitress)andmaneki-neko (beckoning
cat).
To be really native, eat at Marhaba, a Moroc
can restaurant. The waiters wear Moroccan
clothing, Moroccan music fills the room, and
the tables are low, round and brass, with soft,
thick pillows for chairs. The food is expensive
— $9.50/ person — but unusual. If you're ad
venturous, try it.
Two other good possibilities are the
Peanuts, $3 to $5, one room and cozy, and
McGreevy's Fish Market, $4.50 to $7.50, both
specializing in seafood. McGreevy's has a bar
and Sunday brunch, in addition.
After dinner, the bars not associated with
restaurants begin to crowd up, and the musical
entertainment starts. The two spots men
tioned earlier, Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers,
have evening music, usually a guitarist or small
group. Another more boisterous bar is Ivan
Alexander's, where mostly jazz is played.
One of the most popular meeting places is
Mother Lode. An agreeable meal can be found
here ranging from seafood, such as sole or
trout, to a good thick steak or prime rib on
Fridays and Saturdays. Entrees include soup
and a large salad (big enough for three — that
is if there's only two) served in a big bowl (no
choice of dressing, though). Prices are in the
$5 to $8 range and don't forget to order the
coffee to get the cinnamon surprise.
Straight crowd
Yet, there is the "bodyshop" — and that's a
big part of an evening here, for the Mother
Lode works in cooperation with the Disco 2001
(no relation to the movie). This is a swinging
bar-discotheque geared to the straight crowd.
There is a minor dress code: no sneakers, hats
or dirty jeans. There is also a good turnover in
the clientele, but not too many tourists. The
two dance floors, giant videoscreens, and
whirling lights of Disco 2001 and the rustic
western setting of the Mother Lode provide a
lively night stop.
If dancing doesn't inspire you, and you'd
rather listen to music from established artists,
go to the Great American Music Hall on O'Far
rell Street. The performers are generally top
notch and the cost per person to see the show
ranges from $3 to $7.50, depending on the
performer. Drinks and food are extra and so is
a smile from any of the cocktail waitresses. The
building itself is well-decorated, and the
acoustics are good. The majority of the audi
ence is single and in their 20s.
That's about it. Take your time on Union
Street and look around at what you can. It's
similar to certain paintings — the more you
see, the more you realize how much more
there is to see.

Between the shrimp cocktail of the wharves
and tourist cocktail of Chinatown lies Union
Street, a mixture ol what San Francisco is fam
ous for — things peculiar and edible.
The order of the day is shopping for items
varying from Finnish cheese to antique pipes
and the order of the night is shopping for a
partner and/or a good time (often the same
thing) in places ranging from a quiet corner of
a restaurant to a dance floor of a disco, or even
one of numerous, narrow back alleys, if that's
your whim.
The central, busiest section of Union Street
stretches about five blocks, from Laguna to
Pierce. It is a combination of manv-colored

doors, unusual spots to eat, parallel parking,
and people who are dressed well and know it.
Everything is packed close together, even
more so than in the rest of the City, making
slow feet and sharp eyes necessary for catch
ing all the sights.
Eat
The first thing is to eat, either brunch or
lunch, in order to be able to walk it off during

the afternoon. Park Place, one of the newer
restaurants, serves an excellent brunch on the
weekends. Choices include various poached
eggs and omelettes, salmon, chile rellenos,
and even a ground beef casserole called "Joe's
Special," which is supposedly cooked better
than when Joe invented it at another restau rant
a few years back. The tone in Park Place is set
by caneback chairs, redwood beams, over
head ferns and a clear, glass roof. The waiters
are young and friendly, and one of them is an
almost exact likeness of Ciancarlo Ciannini.
Prices for brunch are $2.75 to $3.95, and the
servings are generous. Don't hesitate to go for
dinner, too. The chef was stolen from Port
land, and seafood is his specialty.
A bit down the block is Thomas Lord's, with a
pub setting and pretzels at every table. There
are pictures of cricket matches on the walls,
and a type of food named Wimbledon Fries,
which does not, incidentally, mean potatoes in
the shape of tennis rackets. A fireplace and
television by the bar complete the decor. On
the menu are crepes, quiche, crab, burgers,
and eggs, costing about $2.95 to $4.95. Most of
the patrons are in their 30s and 40s, though
younger patrons are quite welcome. Wear a
heavy, wool sweater if you really want to fit in.
Cup cantata
Another spot is Coffee Cantata which boasts
exhibits of local artists and a patio facing the
street, so you can watch the walkers watch you
eat. Cups and plates seem to clatter continu
ally, as if to keep reminding you that you're in a
restaurant. Prices range from $2.50 to $4.50.
There's also the Bohemian Gardens, which
no doubt looks something like Bohemia even
though the food seems a bit American. Color
ful murals of the French Riviera cover the walls.
In back is a protected outside cafe where you
can eat cordonbleu and stuffed cabbage, or
more average delights such as corned beef and
roast beef, at prices from $2 to $4.
Two other small and interesting places are
Delancey Street, run Solely by ex-cons, and
Bogart's Shellfish Bar, which specializes in
guess what.
After eating, it's time to take to the streets.
The choice of shops in which to browse is
nearly burdensome. A good deal of furi and a
greater deal of money can be spent in the an
tique stores. Undoubtedly, many of the an
tiques are good investments, and who has not
dreamt of owning a 1928 gramophone to blast
out the neighbors? One of the stores even
carries antique clothing, assuredly sewn by an

tique seamstresses. If you want that grandpa
rent look, this is the spot for you. In any case,
romping through the goods of days past for an
hour or two is entertaining and even educa
tional.
The new
Union Street is also filled with modern trin
ket shops which carry every sort of gumball
machine known to man, imaginative cards to

send for mother's or father's or grand aunt's
day, and numerous games, including a new
version of Monopoly, with San Francisco as the
scene instead of plain old Atlantic City. These
trinket shops, and the antique stores, are often
owned and run by one person. Apparently it's
customary for these people to be interesting
and able to tell good stories, so staying a while
and talking to them can be quite enjoyable.
A great number of additional odds and ends
are scattered along the street. Several bars,
such as the Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers, not
as busy in the afternoon as at night when they
fill completely, are good places to have a few
drinks in the afternoon, relax and talk.
In the alleys lie various merchants-in
waiting, like the Flower Boutique, complete
with birdsongs, and a well-stocked poster
store. If your tastes run to the more exotic,
there's a pet shop displaying some of the
"weirdest-looking birds," as one passerby de
scribed them. You can also find a sheepskin
shop, and an art gallery, showing, with other
exhibits, food art (to prepare you for dinner).
Safari
If you like old buildings, explore the Sher
man School on a weekday. And for the
internationally-minded, there's a Safari travel
agent a short distance down the block.
Finally, sometime during the afternoon, you
need to visit the Garden Cheese Company. To
reach the shop, you stroll down an alley built
for one way traffic, and as you proceed, the
smell of cheese becomes more and more
gouda until you finally arrive in a frenzy of tasty
anticipation.
A man named Nicholas van Beek, who
seems to have just popped out of the French
countryside, runs Garden Cheese, called such
because of a small, spotless garden next door,
where, as van Beek says, "an old man rakes it
with a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the

though the food seems a bit American. Color
ful murals of the French Riviera cover the walls.
In back is a protected outside cafe where you
can eat cordonbleu and stuffed cabbage, or
more average delights such as corned beef and
roast beef, at prices from $2 to $4.
Two other small and interesting places are
Delancey Street, run Solely by ex-cons, and
Bogart's Shellfish Bar, which specializes in
guess what.
After eating, it's time to take to the streets.
The choice of shops in which to browse is
nearly burdensome. A good deal of furi and a
greater deal of money can be spent in the an
tique stores. Undoubtedly, many of the an
tiques are good investments, and who has not
dreamt of owning a 1928 gramophone to blast
out the neighbors? One of the stores even
carries antique clothing, assuredly sewn by an

tique seamstresses. If you want that grandpa
rent look, this is the spot for you. In any case,
romping through the goods of days past for an
hour or two is entertaining and even educa
tional.
The new
Union Street is also filled with modern trin
ket shops which carry every sort of gumball
machine known to man, imaginative cards to

send for mother's or father's or grand aunt's
day, and numerous games, including a new
version of Monopoly, with San Francisco as the
scene instead of plain old Atlantic City. These
trinket shops, and the antique stores, are often
owned and run by one person. Apparently it's
customary for these people to be interesting
and able to tell good stories, so staying a while
and talking to them can be quite enjoyable.
A great number of additional odds and ends
are scattered along the street. Several bars,
such as the Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers, not
as busy in the afternoon as at night when they
fill completely, are good places to have a few
drinks in the afternoon, relax and talk.
In the alleys lie various merchants-in
waiting, like the Flower Boutique, complete
with birdsongs, and a well-stocked poster
store. If your tastes run to the more exotic,
there's a pet shop displaying some of the
"weirdest-looking birds," as one passerby de
scribed them. You can also find a sheepskin
shop, and an art gallery, showing, with other
exhibits, food art (to prepare you for dinner).
Safari
If you like old buildings, explore the Sher
man School on a weekday. And for the
internationally-minded, there's a Safari travel
agent a short distance down the block.
Finally, sometime during the afternoon, you
need to visit the Garden Cheese Company. To
reach the shop, you stroll down an alley built
for one way traffic, and as you proceed, the
smell of cheese becomes more and more
gouda until you finally arrive in a frenzy of tasty
anticipation.
A man named Nicholas van Beek, who
seems to have just popped out of the French
countryside, runs Garden Cheese, called such
because of a small, spotless garden next door,
where, as van Beek says, "an old man rakes it
with a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Finland, Greece and even the old
staple, France, line the shelves of the store, as
well as wine and an assortment of gourmet
foods. A visit is worth the time.
Night
At night, especially on weekends, Union
Street does it's own imitation of Mr. Hyde. In
place of the calm, shopping and strolling
crowd comes a mass of people in their 20s and
early 30s to infiltrate the bars and restaurants.
And as one man declared, "these places get to
be body shops late at night. People are on the
take, and no one's trying to hide it."
The best example, with some of the best of
everything, is Perry's. Prices go from $4.75 to
$8.50, and the meal is worth every bite of the
money. It is definitely some of the finest eating
around — London broil, skewered lamb, chic
ken — all good and plentiful. The salads are
large and green, and the drinks are as strong as
you'd fix them for yourself, unless your name
is W.C. and you hate babies. The service is
fine, and you're given time to eat each course
and relax before the next, instead of hurrying

through the meal.
But "most of the people don't just come in
here for dinner," one waiter stated. "This is
self-made entertainment. It's a people show."
At the bar and all around the front area of
Perry's, men and women stand and converse
and watch who's walking by. It's one of the
best places to meet someone easily and
quickly, so if that's what you desire, eat and
drink out front. If you want a quiet dinner with
someone you already know, ask for a table in
the back. Either way, you've got a good deal.
Antebellum atmosphere
Of course, a good number of other restaur
ants stand patiently along the street. La Creole,
with table settings and authentic New Orleans
food, gives the feeling of eating at the home of
an antebellum Southern aristocrat. Prices are
low, only $4 to $6.
For wine drinkers, the Vintner is decorated,
in principle, like an underground wine cellar.
A big cask sticks out at the entrance and on the
walls are pictures of old cellars and vintners.
There's a second floor, for height-lovers, pri
vate booths if you wish, and claims of carrying
the best of the California North Coast wines.
Prices are from $6 to $9, mostly for steak and
such things.
At Mingei-Ya, one eats in japanese country
style (i.e. you take off your shoes and sit on rice
mats). Prices are high, about $8 or $9, for
sukiyaki, teriyaki or tempura. The atmosphere
is comfortable, not too ornate, and an older,
more restrained crowd frequents Mingei-Ya.

Another factor to consider is the menu, which
teaches several useful Japanese words, like
ne/san (waitress)andmaneki-neko (beckoning
cat).
To be really native, eat at Marhaba, a Moroc
can restaurant. The waiters wear Moroccan
clothing, Moroccan music fills the room, and
the tables are low, round and brass, with soft,
thick pillows for chairs. The food is expensive
— $9.50/ person — but unusual. If you're ad
venturous, try it.
Two other good possibilities are the
Peanuts, $3 to $5, one room and cozy, and
McGreevy's Fish Market, $4.50 to $7.50, both
specializing in seafood. McGreevy's has a bar
and Sunday brunch, in addition.
After dinner, the bars not associated with
restaurants begin to crowd up, and the musical
entertainment starts. The two spots men
tioned earlier, Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers,
have evening music, usually a guitarist or small
group. Another more boisterous bar is Ivan
Alexander's, where mostly jazz is played.
One of the most popular meeting places is
Mother Lode. An agreeable meal can be found
here ranging from seafood, such as sole or
trout, to a good thick steak or prime rib on
Fridays and Saturdays. Entrees include soup
and a large salad (big enough for three — that
is if there's only two) served in a big bowl (no
choice of dressing, though). Prices are in the
$5 to $8 range and don't forget to order the
coffee to get the cinnamon surprise.
Straight crowd
Yet, there is the "bodyshop" — and that's a
big part of an evening here, for the Mother
Lode works in cooperation with the Disco 2001
(no relation to the movie). This is a swinging
bar-discotheque geared to the straight crowd.
There is a minor dress code: no sneakers, hats
or dirty jeans. There is also a good turnover in
the clientele, but not too many tourists. The
two dance floors, giant videoscreens, and
whirling lights of Disco 2001 and the rustic
western setting of the Mother Lode provide a
lively night stop.
If dancing doesn't inspire you, and you'd
rather listen to music from established artists,
go to the Great American Music Hall on O'Far
rell Street. The performers are generally top
notch and the cost per person to see the show
ranges from $3 to $7.50, depending on the
performer. Drinks and food are extra and so is
a smile from any of the cocktail waitresses. The
building itself is well-decorated, and the
acoustics are good. The majority of the audi
ence is single and in their 20s.
That's about it. Take your time on Union
Street and look around at what you can. It's
similar to certain paintings — the more you
see, the more you realize how much more
there is to see.
—STEVE MUSHKIN




Between the shrimp cocktail of the wharves
and tourist cocktail of Chinatown lies Union
Street, a mixture ol what San Francisco is fam
ous for — things peculiar and edible.
The order of the day is shopping for items
varying from Finnish cheese to antique pipes
and the order of the night is shopping for a
partner and/or a good time (often the same
thing) in places ranging from a quiet corner of
a restaurant to a dance floor of a disco, or even
one of numerous, narrow back alleys, if that's
your whim.
The central, busiest section of Union Street
stretches about five blocks, from Laguna to
Pierce. It is a combination of manv-colored

doors, unusual spots to eat, parallel parking,
and people who are dressed well and know it.
Everything is packed close together, even
more so than in the rest of the City, making
slow feet and sharp eyes necessary for catch
ing all the sights.
Eat
The first thing is to eat, either brunch or
lunch, in order to be able to walk it off during

the afternoon. Park Place, one of the newer
restaurants, serves an excellent brunch on the
weekends. Choices include various poached
eggs and omelettes, salmon, chile rellenos,
and even a ground beef casserole called "Joe's
Special," which is supposedly cooked better
than when Joe invented it at another restau rant
a few years back. The tone in Park Place is set
by caneback chairs, redwood beams, over
head ferns and a clear, glass roof. The waiters
are young and friendly, and one of them is an
almost exact likeness of Ciancarlo Ciannini.
Prices for brunch are $2.75 to $3.95, and the
servings are generous. Don't hesitate to go for
dinner, too. The chef was stolen from Port
land, and seafood is his specialty.
A bit down the block is Thomas Lord's, with a
pub setting and pretzels at every table. There
are pictures of cricket matches on the walls,
and a type of food named Wimbledon Fries,
which does not, incidentally, mean potatoes in
the shape of tennis rackets. A fireplace and
television by the bar complete the decor. On
the menu are crepes, quiche, crab, burgers,
and eggs, costing about $2.95 to $4.95. Most of
the patrons are in their 30s and 40s, though
younger patrons are quite welcome. Wear a
heavy, wool sweater if you really want to fit in.
Cup cantata
Another spot is Coffee Cantata which boasts
exhibits of local artists and a patio facing the
street, so you can watch the walkers watch you
eat. Cups and plates seem to clatter continu
ally, as if to keep reminding you that you're in a
restaurant. Prices range from $2.50 to $4.50.
There's also the Bohemian Gardens, which
no doubt looks something like Bohemia even
though the food seems a bit American. Color
ful murals of the French Riviera cover the walls.
In back is a protected outside cafe where you

similar to certain paintings — the more you
see, the more you realize how much more
there is to see.

Between the shrimp cocktail of the wharves
and tourist cocktail of Chinatown lies Union
Street, a mixture ol what San Francisco is fam
ous for — things peculiar and edible.
The order of the day is shopping for items
varying from Finnish cheese to antique pipes
and the order of the night is shopping for a
partner and/or a good time (often the same
thing) in places ranging from a quiet corner of
a restaurant to a dance floor of a disco, or even
one of numerous, narrow back alleys, if that's
your whim.
The central, busiest section of Union Street
stretches about five blocks, from Laguna to
Pierce. It is a combination of manv-colored

doors, unusual spots to eat, parallel parking,
and people who are dressed well and know it.
Everything is packed close together, even
more so than in the rest of the City, making
slow feet and sharp eyes necessary for catch
ing all the sights.
Eat
The first thing is to eat, either brunch or
lunch, in order to be able to walk it off during

the afternoon. Park Place, one of the newer
restaurants, serves an excellent brunch on the
weekends. Choices include various poached
eggs and omelettes, salmon, chile rellenos,
and even a ground beef casserole called "Joe's
Special," which is supposedly cooked better
than when Joe invented it at another restau rant
a few years back. The tone in Park Place is set
by caneback chairs, redwood beams, over
head ferns and a clear, glass roof. The waiters
are young and friendly, and one of them is an
almost exact likeness of Ciancarlo Ciannini.
Prices for brunch are $2.75 to $3.95, and the
servings are generous. Don't hesitate to go for
dinner, too. The chef was stolen from Port
land, and seafood is his specialty.
A bit down the block is Thomas Lord's, with a
pub setting and pretzels at every table. There
are pictures of cricket matches on the walls,
and a type of food named Wimbledon Fries,
which does not, incidentally, mean potatoes in
the shape of tennis rackets. A fireplace and
television by the bar complete the decor. On
the menu are crepes, quiche, crab, burgers,
and eggs, costing about $2.95 to $4.95. Most of
the patrons are in their 30s and 40s, though
younger patrons are quite welcome. Wear a
heavy, wool sweater if you really want to fit in.
Cup cantata
Another spot is Coffee Cantata which boasts
exhibits of local artists and a patio facing the
street, so you can watch the walkers watch you
eat. Cups and plates seem to clatter continu
ally, as if to keep reminding you that you're in a
restaurant. Prices range from $2.50 to $4.50.
There's also the Bohemian Gardens, which
no doubt looks something like Bohemia even
though the food seems a bit American. Color
ful murals of the French Riviera cover the walls.
In back is a protected outside cafe where you
can eat cordonbleu and stuffed cabbage, or
more average delights such as corned beef and
roast beef, at prices from $2 to $4.
Two other small and interesting places are
Delancey Street, run Solely by ex-cons, and
Bogart's Shellfish Bar, which specializes in
guess what.
After eating, it's time to take to the streets.
The choice of shops in which to browse is
nearly burdensome. A good deal of furi and a
greater deal of money can be spent in the an
tique stores. Undoubtedly, many of the an
tiques are good investments, and who has not
dreamt of owning a 1928 gramophone to blast
out the neighbors? One of the stores even
carries antique clothing, assuredly sewn by an

tique seamstresses. If you want that grandpa
rent look, this is the spot for you. In any case,
romping through the goods of days past for an
hour or two is entertaining and even educa
tional.
The new
Union Street is also filled with modern trin
ket shops which carry every sort of gumball
machine known to man, imaginative cards to

send for mother's or father's or grand aunt's
day, and numerous games, including a new
version of Monopoly, with San Francisco as the
scene instead of plain old Atlantic City. These
trinket shops, and the antique stores, are often
owned and run by one person. Apparently it's
customary for these people to be interesting
and able to tell good stories, so staying a while
and talking to them can be quite enjoyable.
A great number of additional odds and ends
are scattered along the street. Several bars,
such as the Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers, not
as busy in the afternoon as at night when they
fill completely, are good places to have a few
drinks in the afternoon, relax and talk.
In the alleys lie various merchants-in
waiting, like the Flower Boutique, complete
with birdsongs, and a well-stocked poster
store. If your tastes run to the more exotic,
there's a pet shop displaying some of the
"weirdest-looking birds," as one passerby de
scribed them. You can also find a sheepskin
shop, and an art gallery, showing, with other
exhibits, food art (to prepare you for dinner).
Safari
If you like old buildings, explore the Sher
man School on a weekday. And for the
internationally-minded, there's a Safari travel
agent a short distance down the block.
Finally, sometime during the afternoon, you
need to visit the Garden Cheese Company. To
reach the shop, you stroll down an alley built
for one way traffic, and as you proceed, the
smell of cheese becomes more and more
gouda until you finally arrive in a frenzy of tasty
anticipation.
A man named Nicholas van Beek, who
seems to have just popped out of the French
countryside, runs Garden Cheese, called such
because of a small, spotless garden next door,
where, as van Beek says, "an old man rakes it
with a fork." Cheeses from Denmark, the
Netherlands, Finland, Greece and even the old
staple, France, line the shelves of the store, as
well as wine and an assortment of gourmet
foods. A visit is worth the time.
Night
At night, especially on weekends, Union
Street does it's own imitation of Mr. Hyde. In
place of the calm, shopping and strolling
crowd comes a mass of people in their 20s and
early 30s to infiltrate the bars and restaurants.
And as one man declared, "these places get to
be body shops late at night. People are on the
take, and no one's trying to hide it."
The best example, with some of the best of
everything, is Perry's. Prices go from $4.75 to
$8.50, and the meal is worth every bite of the
money. It is definitely some of the finest eating
around — London broil, skewered lamb, chic
ken — all good and plentiful. The salads are
large and green, and the drinks are as strong as
you'd fix them for yourself, unless your name
is W.C. and you hate babies. The service is
fine, and you're given time to eat each course
and relax before the next, instead of hurrying

through the meal.
But "most of the people don't just come in
here for dinner," one waiter stated. "This is
self-made entertainment. It's a people show."
At the bar and all around the front area of
Perry's, men and women stand and converse
and watch who's walking by. It's one of the
best places to meet someone easily and
quickly, so if that's what you desire, eat and
drink out front. If you want a quiet dinner with
someone you already know, ask for a table in
the back. Either way, you've got a good deal.
Antebellum atmosphere
Of course, a good number of other restaur
ants stand patiently along the street. La Creole,
with table settings and authentic New Orleans
food, gives the feeling of eating at the home of
an antebellum Southern aristocrat. Prices are
low, only $4 to $6.
For wine drinkers, the Vintner is decorated,
in principle, like an underground wine cellar.
A big cask sticks out at the entrance and on the
walls are pictures of old cellars and vintners.
There's a second floor, for height-lovers, pri
vate booths if you wish, and claims of carrying
the best of the California North Coast wines.
Prices are from $6 to $9, mostly for steak and
such things.
At Mingei-Ya, one eats in japanese country
style (i.e. you take off your shoes and sit on rice
mats). Prices are high, about $8 or $9, for
sukiyaki, teriyaki or tempura. The atmosphere
is comfortable, not too ornate, and an older,
more restrained crowd frequents Mingei-Ya.

Another factor to consider is the menu, which
teaches several useful Japanese words, like
ne/san (waitress)andmaneki-neko (beckoning
cat).
To be really native, eat at Marhaba, a Moroc
can restaurant. The waiters wear Moroccan
clothing, Moroccan music fills the room, and
the tables are low, round and brass, with soft,
thick pillows for chairs. The food is expensive
— $9.50/ person — but unusual. If you're ad
venturous, try it.
Two other good possibilities are the
Peanuts, $3 to $5, one room and cozy, and
McGreevy's Fish Market, $4.50 to $7.50, both
specializing in seafood. McGreevy's has a bar
and Sunday brunch, in addition.
After dinner, the bars not associated with
restaurants begin to crowd up, and the musical
entertainment starts. The two spots men
tioned earlier, Bus Stop and Tarr and Feathers,
have evening music, usually a guitarist or small
group. Another more boisterous bar is Ivan
Alexander's, where mostly jazz is played.
One of the most popular meeting places is
Mother Lode. An agreeable meal can be found
here ranging from seafood, such as sole or
trout, to a good thick steak or prime rib on
Fridays and Saturdays. Entrees include soup
and a large salad (big enough for three — that
is if there's only two) served in a big bowl (no
choice of dressing, though). Prices are in the
$5 to $8 range and don't forget to order the
coffee to get the cinnamon surprise.
Straight crowd
Yet, there is the "bodyshop" — and that's a
big part of an evening here, for the Mother
Lode works in cooperation with the Disco 2001
(no relation to the movie). This is a swinging
bar-discotheque geared to the straight crowd.
There is a minor dress code: no sneakers, hats
or dirty jeans. There is also a good turnover in
the clientele, but not too many tourists. The
two dance floors, giant videoscreens, and
whirling lights of Disco 2001 and the rustic
western setting of the Mother Lode provide a
lively night stop.
If dancing doesn't inspire you, and you'd
rather listen to music from established artists,
go to the Great American Music Hall on O'Far
rell Street. The performers are generally top
notch and the cost per person to see the show
ranges from $3 to $7.50, depending on the
performer. Drinks and food are extra and so is
a smile from any of the cocktail waitresses. The
building itself is well-decorated, and the
acoustics are good. The majority of the audi
ence is single and in their 20s.
That's about it. Take your time on Union
Street and look around at what you can. It's
similar to certain paintings — the more you
see, the more you realize how much more
there is to see.
