# An Epicurean examination of the Mid-peninsula cuisines...
## 
### 
Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own

who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus

Are you tired of ordering won

tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus

and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

Almost everyone has experi

Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border

Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.

aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino

portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone

and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish

Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed

Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of

Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent

picnic tables, at least, will yield

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the

The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di

(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or

And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.

Although its prices are no longer

China Lion is the new venture

The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal

extra bowl of rice. Service is at

Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be

China First's soups make ex

is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent

picnic tables, at least, will yield

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.


Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh




vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and four
types of dressing. It's $1.20 a
bowl, but you may pile it as high
as you like.
Ramona's pizzas are 10,14 and
16 inches in diameter. A one
item medium is $4.55; a medium
stromboli is $6.05. Pizzas here
are extremely filling, a result of
too much cheese (if that is pos
sible) and an overly thick, chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ously portioned and if one likes
tomato sauce, request an extra
portion. Although pizza prices
are high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, the stromboli
is notable for its greaselessness.
Those who know about For
mico's are not revealing their
secret. Hidden in the shopping
plaza at the junction of Embar
cadero and Highway 101, For
mico's "specializes in all Italian
foods.''
Prices here tend to be lower
than at the other pizzerias,
which makes Formico's tough
competition for its rivals.
The large salad ($1.25) is actu
ally huge with garbanzo and
kidney beans and iceberg let
tuce. The Italian dressing in par
ticular is quite zesty.
Formico's pizzas come in four
sizes (10 to 16 inches). Their spe
cialty pizzas are the same as
those of Frankie's; only the
names are different. "Vincent's
Special," for example, is $4 for a
12-inch and $5.75 for a 16-inch.
Pizzas here strike an excellent
balance of cheese and tomato
sauce. The topping is gener
ously applied and reaches close
to the edge of the pizza. Mus
hrooms, green pepper and on
ions are especially abundant. In
fact, the crust is a little too thin
and brittle to sustain all items. A
bit more thickness would
heighten the pizza's total im
pact.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria is
slightly offbeat. And whoever

labelled pizza "junk food" has
not tried Jose's Cuban-style
pizza with a wheat-germ crust.
These crusts have a unique, or
ganic taste. Although it may not
make every skeptic a devoted
fan, it is certainly worth trying.
Jose's latest culinary innova
tion, however, is his remarkable
deep-dish sourdough crust. It
could be the best crust in the
area, and is recommended for
pizzas with copious topping. But
be prepared to wait longer for a
deep-dish.
The vegetarian pizza ($5.15 for
12 inches) is a lavish yield from
the garden: olives, carrots,
peas, onions, tomato, corn,
green beans, mushrooms and
the odd pineapple speck. Huge
and thick, it is a veritable meal in
itself.
Jose also offers enchiladas and
Cuban-style hamburgers. Sal
tenas, the national dish of
Bolivia, are a specialty. These
pies of cheese ($1.75) or meat
(beef or chicken — $2) are baked
with olives, peas, eggs, potatoes
and raisins.
Jose's prices are a little high
for a self-serve restaurant. Here
a single item 12 inch pizza is
$1.50 more than at Frankie's.
(Editors' note: Several weeks ago
we received a call from the prop
rietor of the Stadium, a very re
cently opened Italian food-pizza
parlor. He claimed to have the
best pizza in the area. Since Mr.
Killas was vacationing, we sent
out an impromptu team of aspir
ing restaurant reviewers. They
brought back the following re
port.)
The Stadium's pizza may or
may not be the best on the Mid
peninsula; it is certainly credita
ble enough, not to mention hot,
gooey, spicy and cheesy enough,
to be in contention. The
Stadium's manager, Steve Hib
bett, is quick to point out that
the crust thickness should be
specified along with the top
pings. The crust was, as a matter
of record, one of the pizza's best
points: tender and flavorful to

the bite, durable to the touch.
The vegetables and meats used
as toppings were apparently of
the best quality — especially the
pepperoni.
The Stadium's most glaring
weakness is its atmosphere. Pic
nic tables covered with plastic
cloths and an eight-foot televi
sion screen do not make for the
most relaxed dining. Hibbet
promises, however, that the
picnic tables, at least, will yield
to improvements in the near fu
ture.

Mexican
Many Mexican restaurants
around here (and there are quite
a few) are of the "hole-in-the
wall" variety. These small,
family-run operations offer not
only the most authentic comida,
but also the most reasonably
priced meals around campus.
Casa Blanca, a small estab
lishment on El Camino in Moun
tain View, has a stark green and
white interior. Napkins folded
into hats rest on all tables. Many
of the restaurant's recipes are
favorites of the owner's mother
and range from $3 to $4. These
include Huevos Rancheros, chic
ken and beef burritos and three
types of enchiladas. A Mexican
steak dinner is under $5.
A side order of mild
guacamole ($1.25) is generously
served in a curled corn tortilla
with plenty of chips. Two com
bination plates ($3.25) that are
good bets are the Encinada (beef
burrito, tostada, enchilada and

rice and refritos) and the Cinaloa
(tacos, enchiladas and chile re
lleno).
Tucked away on cosmopolitan
Castro Street in Mountain View
is a restaurant that has gained
popularity with many students
here. Poblanita Care is totally
unpretentious — it seats 30, the
kitchen is exposed and a Latin
radio station plays in the
background.
The entire menu is in Spanish
and lists five egg dishes. Huevos
Rancheros at $2 is the most

popular. The fried chicken is
only $3 and Mexican butterfried
steak comes with house salad,
guacomole, potatoes and de
ssert for only $4. Menudo (beef
tripe soup) and Paella Valen
chana ($1.75 — the only non-
Mexican item) are weekend
specialties.
All combination plates are ex
cellent ($2.60-$2.80) and include
a crisp house salad, a delectable
Consome de Polio (chicken
broth, garnished with freshly
diced onion, tomato and green
chile peppers) and noteworthy
rice and refritos. Don't pass up
the burrito with chicken chunks
in green tomato sauce or the
chile rellenos that contain real
jalapenos. Poblanito's tostada is
a standout — succulent chicken
pieces on a bed of lettuce
adorned with a liberal amount of
guacomole.
El Calderon is a popular storef
ront restaurant in Mountain
View with the most extensive
Latin menu of the three restaur

ants. The Mexican dishes are ex
cellent, but here the specialties
are Salvadorean.
Of the many combinations,
Plate "B" ($3.75) is a mouthful
and includes tacos, tostada and
Papusa. Although the en
chilada* and the refritos are not
inspired, the Papusas (70 cents a
la carte) are a true find. These are
homemade wheat tortillas stuf
fed with cheese, pork, beans (or
a combination of any two) and
served with pickled cabbage
(curtido).
The Salvadorean dishes range
from beef tongue ($2.95) to
yucca root and pork salad
($2.25). Pol la Encebollado —
tender chicken in a piquant
onion and tomato sauce is $4.25.
The exceptional homemade
beef soup ($1.95) with fresh zuc
chini, tomato, cabbage and corn
on the cob is a meal in itself.
Not to be missed are two un
ique tropical fruit drinks —
quanabana and amarindo —
served in hand carved bowls.
Prices here are higher than
those at the other restuarants,
but the portions are larger. El
Calderon is a fun place to go
and, consequently, reservations
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day are a must.
Seafood
San Francisco is a renowned
mecca for seafood worshippers.
So brilliant is its reputation for
such items as fresh crab, salmon
and abalone, that many people
assume that a trip to the City is
mandatory for superlative fish.
Several local establishments,
however, prove that this is not
so.
The Fish Market at 3150 El
Camino is both a restaurant and
seafood market. Even though
you should expect to pay more
for seafood, The Fish Market is
expensive for what you get be
cause the portions are small.
All entrees are charcoal
broiled over mesquite wood,
which gives the fish a pleasing
flavor.
Each item of the combination

($4.95) — white fish, scallops
and shrimp skewered with green
pepper and onion — is juicy and
not overcooked. Other good
bets are the Pacific Red Snapper
($3.95) and halibut steak ($5.95).
The Fish Market is noisy,
carefree and fun, mostly be
cause of its antiqued decor
complete with bentwood chairs
and old fishing photos, and its
youthful, cheery staff (which is
extremely efficient).
The Square Rigger at 3750 Fa
bian Way, is hard to locate, but
once you do, you will find many
of your seafood favorites. Bouil
labaise ($7.95) is the chef's spe
cial and contains prawns, scal
lops, clams and assorted fish.
Prawns, scallops, crab ($6.95)
and beef ($6.50) are available in a
distinctive but not overpower
ing curry sauce. Condiments in
clude peanuts, raisins, coconut
and chutney.
An exceptional dish is Scallops
Saute Belle Meuniere ($6.50),
especially if you are fortunate
enough to have scallops fresh
that day. Carefully prepared, the
scallops are saved from the
toughness of overcooking.
Entrees are served with a nice
rice pilaf and fresh vegetables.
Again, portionsaren't generous.
El Pescador at 3295 El Camino
offers tough competition for
most San Francisco seafood es
tablishments and has the most
varied menu with the largest
portions in the area. Poached or
broiled salmon ($6.95), Abalone
Meuniere ($8.25), Paella ($7.95)
and even Frog Legs Provencale
($8.25) show the menu's exten
siveness.
All entrees come with soup,
often a steaming bowl of hot fish
chowder; an excellent romaine
and spinach salad with tomato
cubes, croutons and an herbed
oil and vinegar dressing; sour
dough bread and fresh whipped
butter; ravioli, stuffed with
spinach, in a tomato meat stiuce;
and superb al dente vegetables.
You won't leave hungry.
Red Snapper Livornese ($7.95)
is highly recommended. It has a

fragrant garlic aroma and a
piquant Italian tomato sauce
simmered with black olives,
capers and spices.
Pacific Lobster Tail ($9.50) is
equally excellent. Two half lobs
ter tails are stuffed with creamed
crab and mushroom.
Vietnamese
The Mekong Restaurant in
Mountain View is run by
Nguyen-ton Hoan, a former
vice-premier of the Republic of
Vietnam. The same historical
situation which led to the war
which displaced Hoan is respon
sible for the Chinese, Indian and
French elements of Vietnamese
cuisine.
The Mekong's authentic
menu lists five soups (around
$1). Most of the 23 entrees are in
the $3 range and include Viet
namese cuisines, sweet and sour
dishes, barbeque and French
influenced dishes such as chic
ken maison and the Vietnamese
omelet. Side dishes and various
desserts (all in the $1 range) are
also listed.
Most entrees include a crisp
salad of iceberg lettuce, bamboo
shoots and carrots. It is dressed
with a mild combination of soy
sauce, vinegar, garlic and water.
The barbeque chicken ($2.95)
is first marinated in green onion
and soy sauce, then pressed into
a steak and barbequed. Another
dish typical of Vietnam is the
beef brochette ($3.95), two
bamboo skewers of tender
marinated beef interspersed
with crunchy pieces of celery
and green pepper.
Dessert at the Mekong is
worth the calories. Both fritters
— banana beignets ($1) and
pineapple 6e/gnefs(sl.lo)—are
wonderful. But the real treat is
the house special, banana beig
nets smothered with coconut
cream and crushed peanuts.
