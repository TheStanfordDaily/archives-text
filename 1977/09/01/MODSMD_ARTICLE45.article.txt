# An Epicurean examination of the Mid-peninsula cuisines...
## 
### 
Everyone is entitled to his own
opinion about the University
food service. But even those
who look forward with relish to
every meal in the dorm will
probably want to get off campus
once or twice to sample the fare
of a local restaurant.
In direct proportion to the Bay
Area's extreme ethnic diversity
is the extreme cuisinary diversity
of the Mid-peninsula. And in di
rect proportion to this cuisinary
diversity is the number of deci
sions which must be made.
(What kind of food do you want
to eat? Should we go to an ex
pensive restaurant or a cheap
one? Vegetarian or meat? Can
tonese or Mandarin? Haute or
provincial?)
And since too many decisions
lead as surely to a spoiled dinner
as too many sweets, a trustwor
thy restaurant guide is all but in
dispensable. The capsule re
views which follow have been
distilled from the most recent
work of Harry Killas, the Daily's
resident restaurant reviewer.
Harry's taste is wide, reliable and
entirely free of national pre
judices. The prices he quotes are
approximate and are only in
tended to give an idea of the
general range in any particular
restaurant.

Chinese
Are you tired of ordering won
ton soup, sweet and sour pork
and standard Cantonese dishes
each time you want Chinese
food? Then perhaps you haven't
tried the hotter, spicier dishes of
Northern China.
Within minutes of the campus
are at least four restaurants serv
ing Szechuan and Hunan food.
Threeare within hikingdistance.
At all these establishments,
waiters are willing to recom
mend dishes that would com
plement each other (such as the

mild with the spicy). All still
serve your old favorites.
Chef Chu's advertises the
Mandarin cuisine of China. It is
extremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served with
silk-thin crepes, it is distinct
from the pancakes found at most
other places.
Dry braised prawns are
generously served in an irresist
ible tomato-cherry sauce with
scullions and chopped onions.
Hunan chicken ($4.50) consists
of morsels of boneless chicken
— quick-fried in hot oil and
spices with bamboo shoots.
Chu's menu is well-chosen
and varied; one can't go wrong
with any of their "specialities."
Although its prices are no longer
cheap, Chef Chu's is a lively and
fun place to dine, especially with
a large group of people.
China Lion is the new venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger brother.
The menu lists 109 items,
many of which are Hunan-style.
Prices are lower than Chef
Chu's, but the portions are smal
ler. One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is at
tentive.
Kung pao beef ($3.50-spicy)
consists of tender beef slices
and crisp green pepper ac
cented with peanuts. Prawns in
hot sauce, though tasty, is a chal
lenge to eat — the prawns are
not shelled.
An excellent dish at the China
Lion, however, is the pungent
chicken. Juicy deep-fried chic
ken pieces arrive in a slightly
sweet garlic sauce with peppers.
Other successful offerings here

are the squid and shredded pork
and the tender beef and mus
hroom in oyster sauce.
For a more intimate dinner,
China First has low lighting and a
civilized mood. The menu is di
verse and competently served,
and it includes both standards
such as sliced chicken and snow
peas ($3.50), and specialties like
Hunan ham ($22), which must be
ordered in advance.
China First's soups make ex
cellent starters. Its hot and sour
is spicier, but not as sour as Chef
Chu's. The house special soup
($2.25) — sizzling rice with chic
ken, ham, shrimp and vegeta
bles in a rich chicken broth — is
memorable.
Scallops with garlic sauce
($4.50) are treated with respect.
The scallops are not tough from
overcooking and contrast well
with the accompanying water
chestnuts. The generals' chic
ken ($4.50), subtly spiced ten
der chicken in a bed of crunch
snow peas, is excellent.
In general, the portions of
China First are relatively gener
ous, and the prices compare
with Chef Chu's.
Hsi-Nan serves some of the
best Szechuan food near Stan
ford. The spicing at Hsi-Nan is
more distinct and hotter than at
the other restaurants — "the
way the dishes should be pre
pared," says the owner.
Chicken in Peking sauce
($3.50) is extremely tender and a
must for those who enjoy hot
black bean sauce. Szechuan
shredded beef ($3.75) is a
"knockout" dish, not only for its
plentiful serving, but also for the
chile peppers cooked in it.
There is nothing pretentious
about the Hsi-Nan. The prices
are reasonable, the portions
quite generous, and the menu
varied.

French
Several local establishments
offer support to the notion that
for elegant dining, the best
choice is a French restaurant.
Chantilly is that type of re
staurant you'd like to keep a sec
ret. The understated elegance of
roses and pinks give Chantilly an
exclusive atmosphere without
the pretension of other top
flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imagi
nation: sauteed veal and
eggplant ($8.75), L'escalopine de
Veau a la Bolognaise for two
($l9), Chicken Cynthia ($7.25)
with champagne, grapes and
orange (Melanzana a la Feta,
$5.25 — for two).
Soupe a I'Oignon Gratinee
($1.50), with hints of oregano
and bay leaf, was the best sam
pled of all the restaurants. It is
not swamped with cheese. And
the onions and bread are firm
rather than mushy.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
ratherthan stifle the freshness of
Chantilly's dishes. The Liaison
Salad a la Chantilly for two
($5.50) with lettuce, cucumber,
olive, bacon, feta cheese and
herbs, and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb ($8.50) sauteed
with fresh taragon, will both de
light rather than assault your pa
late.
La Terrasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his pol
icy of good food at reasonable
prices.
Le diner includes soup du jour
and a pleasant butter lettuce
salad with a mustardy vinaigrette
dressing.
Hors d'oeuvres include piping
hot escargot de Bourgogne
($2.95) that are plump and not
overwhelmed by garlic. Better
still is the crepe de fruits de mer
($2.75), creamed scallops, crab
and shrimp encased in a thin
crepe. Soupe a I'oignon ($1.75)
has a fine broth but is too
cheesy.
Ris de Veau Financiere
(sweetbreads in cream — $7.50)
are inconsistent. Some are mar
velous, but others, not satisfac
torily demembraned, are chewy
and rubbery with a stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate

mousse ($1.25) and "Floating
Isles" of Meringue ($1.25).
Chez Justine offers eight stan
dard appetizers such as shrimp,
escargots and oysters. Pate
Maison ($2.50) is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. Entrees
come with soup du jour and
salad.
The menu features Abalone
($8.50), Long Island Duckling
($8.50) and New York Steak with
green peppercorns ($9.50)
among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce ($8.25) are extremely ten
der, but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemontaise (fresh trout
with white wine sauce — $7.50)
is outstanding.
For dessert, Strawberries
Romanoff ($2.50) with icecream,
nuts and Grand Marnier is a vis
ual as well as taste treat.
Although better French re
staurants than Chez )ustine exist
on the Peninsula, don't miss
Sunday Champagne Brunch.
The incredible buffet is already a
legend in the Bay Area. Many
students here fast for two days
before parting with their $6.
Les Provinces is a luxury re
staurant. Only a year old, it
shows consistency in all areas of
its menu.
Everything is a specialty of the
provinces of France: Lambon
Fume d' Alsace ($2.50), Canard
Normande for two ($l7), Care
d'Agneau Dijonnaise for two
($18). The imagination of Chef
lean-Pierre Doigneau shows in
his sterling sauces and in his sea
sonings.
Sorrel delicately accents the
fresh salmon ($6.75), poached in
white wine. The admirable
home-made pate ($2.25) is fla
vored with armagnac. Two first
rate appetizers are the savoury
escargots ($3.25), pungent with

garlic, and the meaty ham crepes
($2.50) in a superior sauce mor
nay. Two interesting soups are
the Sherried Consomme (warm
or cold — $1.50), and when av
ailable, cream of fresh crayfish
or Maine lobster ($2.75).
Medallion of veal forestiere
($8.50) is terrific. Listed as a
house specialty, the unique
pauplette of duck (stuffed duck)
in particular is outstanding.
Avoid the chocolate mousse
($1.75) for dessert. Rather, try
the frozen strawberry mousse
($1.75) or the dramatic Grand
Marnier souffle ($3). Don't pass
up another house specialty —
the apple tart ($1.75). Classically
executed with puff pastry, cus
tard and apricot glaze, it is a
model of its kind.
The cuisines of France and
Italy harmonize well atLiaison.
One of Liaison's pastas split
two or even three ways, make an
ideal starter. I recommend Lin
guine con Vongole ($5), or the
Tortellini "Liaison," in a
tomato-cream sauce with on
ions. Not overcooked, the pas
tas resist just enough to the bite.
Besides the soup of the day
and the übiquitous onion
($1.50), a refreshing cold water
cress ($1.50) is generous in por
tion but too heavy on the potato.
Entrees come with a choice of
soup or salad (the house oil and
vinegar dressing is a little glutin
ous). Veal dishes here are
exemplary. Veal Piccata with
capers ($8.50) and Scaloppini of
Veal with fresh mushrooms ($8)
are fork-tender. The veal iswhite
and milk fed — you won't find
better anywhere. Medallions of
Beef Bearnaise ($8.50) and Roast
Saddle of Lamb Florentine for
two ($2l) are also good bets.
Liaison's portions are larger
than the other restaurants, but
you don't have to struggle for
dessert.

Italian
Almost everyone has experi
enced that inexplicable longing
which can only be satisfied by
pizza. And not the warm
cardboard prepared by the fast
food outlets. It has to be real
pizza with, yes, a doughy crust,
gobs of mushrooms, bountiful
meat and mozzarella cheese.
Fortunately, the Mid
peninsula is blessed with an in
ordinate number of quality piz
zerias.
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too,
just 15 minutes down El Camino
Real in Mountain View, has a
reputation as the students'
choice.
Pizzas are 12,14 and 16inches.
Two specialty pizzas — "Luigi's
Treat" and the famous "Strom
boli" — presently cost $4, $5.50
and $6.75.
Frankie's has the most gener
ous meat toppings of all local re
staurants. A healthy dose of
mushrooms counterbalances
the meager helping of green
pepper. The fresh-tasting to
mato sauce harmonizes well
with the mozzarella cheese and
except for the wide border
around the pizza, the crust is ex
cellent.
Pizza may be the most popular
item at Frankie's, but there are
other Italian dishes which are
equally commendable. The veal
scallopini dinner ($6.50) in
cludes soup, salad, bread, pasta,
coffee and dessert. Lasagne
($5.25) is the house specialty.
Three appetizers are stand
outs. A huge bowl of homemade
minestrone ($1.25) is hearty and
aromatic. This memorable star
ter contains fresh carrots and
zucchini, cubes of ham and beef
and herbs. Fresh mushrooms
($1.50) sauteed in a wine sauce
and pungent with garlic are al
ways reliable for their juiciness.
Ramona's is just in downtown
Palo Alto and mere minutes
away by bicycle. One of its best
features is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
