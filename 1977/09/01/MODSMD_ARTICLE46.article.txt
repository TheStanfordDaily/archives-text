# The
						complete geographic guide to the Mid-peninsula

### 
Taking the wrong path and getting lost in the
forest certainly ranks among mankind's most
enduring fears. In the Bay Area, the paths may
take the form of 12 lane highways, the wolves
tandem trailer trucks and the swamps
stretches of interminably red traffic lights, but
the troubles of getting around are no less
bothersome here than they are in the Amazon
basin and the Siberian steppes.
Maps, of course, were invented to take the
guesswork out of traveling from A to B. But if A
happens to be the Stanford campus and B hap
pens to be anywhere farther afield than
downtown Palo Alto, a map does almost more
harm than good to the unexperienced travel
ler. Should he follow that heavy red line which
looks as if it ought to be a major thoroughfare?
Or is it in fact a traffic-snarled thicket of stop
lights, stop signs and left hand turners? Or,
foregoing the use of his car, should he ride the
bus which follows the route marked out in
blue, or maybe see if he could take a train?
What he should do is use the following as a
general guide and refer frequently to the ac
companying map. Given enough time and dili
gence, he could probably figure it all out for
himself, but no true humanitarian would want
to make him do it.

The first thing to bear in mind is that local
topography plays a large part in determining
the direction and nature of the lines of trans
portation. The Bay to the east and the hills to
the west accentuate the peninsularity of San
Francisco and environs. The towns and cities
between San Francisco and San Jose can be
thought of as pearls (or more aptly, beans) on a
multi-stranded necklace. The two main strands
are the Bayshore Freeway (highway 101), which
can be considered the eastern border of
Peninsula civilization, and interstate 280 which
is the western border. In between run several
minor strands for greater or lesser stretches
between the two ends. The most important of
these are El Camino Real (highway 82), with
which everyone soon becomes familiar, although
few realize how remarkably uniform it is over its
entire 50 mile length, and Alameda de las Pulgas
(known to the south as Foothill Expressway)
which ranges from residential to rural and con
sequently is much easier and faster going than El
Camino.
Which north-south route to take is best de
termined according to the length of the trip. If
the destination is not a great distance, El
Camino is satisfactory; if it is several miles, the

Alameda starts to become more worthwhile;
and if it is further, one of the freeways is the
only reasonable choice.
Carless
For the carless, the San Mateo County
Transit District operates bus service between
various points in Palo Alto, including a pair on
or near campus, and destinations along El
Camino to the north all the way to San Fran
cisco.
Which of the two freeways to take to San
Francisco is the subject of an on-going con
troversy. Long-time local residents tend to line
up behind 101. They claim it is faster than 280.
On the other hand, 280 (officially named the
Junipero Serra Freeway, after the Spanish
monk who first explored this part of California)
is designated "the world's most beautiful
freeway." Whether this title is deserved or not
is a matter of personal taste, but 280 is indis
putably the pleasanter of the two roads; it is
newer, wider, smoother, and much more rural
than its bayside counterpart. It is also easier to
reach from campus: it has access ramps off
Page Mill, Alpine and Sand Hill Roads. The
Bayshore, in contrast, is separated from the
University by a forbidding sequence of traffic

hindrances regardless of which approach is
attempted.
It is not, however, necessary to have a car to
get to the City. The Southern Pacific Railroad
runs, as of August 6, 17 trains daily from Palo
Alto to San Francisco and an equal number back.
The ride is comfortable and the depot is lo
cated just off campus near the El Camino-
University Avenue overpass.
BART
One ingenious and little known alternative
route is to take the Peerless Stage bus service
from the Palo Alto Greyhound Terminal (on
Alma Street) over the Dumbarton Bridge to
Fremont and take BART (acronymic for Bay
Area Rapid Transit). The route is partly above
ground, partly subterranean, and goes
through Oakland, most of the popular destina
tions in San Francisco and winds up in Daly
City.
The problem with going earless is getting
around the City. But as it turns out, this is more
easily done than said. In addition to BART, San
Francisco has its famous cable cars and a full
complement of public buses. While not re
commended for scantily clad young beauties
of either sex, this public transportation is fairly

safe and quick and not really all that unbeara
ble.
The possibilities for east-west travel are
more limited. Highway 84 crosses the Dumbar
ton Bridge from the East Bay and runs all the
way to the Pacific coast via Redwood City,
Woodside and La Honda. Highway 92 crosses
the San Mateo Bridge and passes through San
Mateo on its way to Half Moon Bay. Both these
roads become narrow country lanes when they
climb into the hills to the west. They intersect
Skyline Boulevard at the crest of the highlands
and end at Route 1 which runs along the coast.
To escape this area altogether, there are five
main routes. To the north, the best choice is
Highway 101, which is also the preferred route
south. (The exception to this rule is when the
destination is Santa Cruz and vicinity, in which
case Highway 17, the major north-south route
of the East Bay which intersects 280 in Sap lose,
is regrettably but unavoidably the way to go.)
To Sacramento and points north or west, the
Bay Bridge and Interstate 80 is the accepted
route. Points south of west can best be
reached by the improbable highway 152. This
branches off 101 in Cilroy about 25 miles south
of San )ose.
