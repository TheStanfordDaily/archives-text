# Where the land meets the sea — the Pacific coast
## 
### 
Early morning. Or late evening. Or midday.
The time is indeterminate. The lambency of
the low clouds and fog is a neutrality between
dark and light. A light breeze stirs the mist. The
sound of waves is hushed against the sand,
pronounced against the rocks, amplified out of
all proportion to the cause of the sound. The
water creates an infinity of wet noise: trickles,
gurgles, splashes, drops. A crab picks its way
across a bed of limp seaweed. A flock of sea
gulls huddle together on a patch of sand.
The 60-mile coastline between San Francisco
and Santa Cruz has little to distinguish it
from the other 500 or so miles of Northern
California coastline. This is perhaps its most
surprising attribute. About two and a half mill
ion people, or slightly more than one per cent
of this country's population, can reach the
shore in less than an hour. Yet on most days, at
most places, humanity is not much in evi
dence. Solitude is not hard to come by if it is
desired: a half a mile walk from any of the
beaches is usually enough to separate the re
clusive from everything but the rocks and the
sea.
The coast road between San Francisco and
Santa Cruz, within sight of the Pacific for about
four fifths of its length, is a popular drive. Most
of those who make it, however, rarely leave
their cars. Between towns there are virtually no
refreshment stands or tourist parks to encour
age them to stop.
Three factors conspire to keep the coast in
its sparsely populated, undeveloped state: the
climate, the cliffs and the California Coastal
Commission. The development of other
coastlines in other parts of the country has
typically taken place as soon as enough people
and enough capital have accumulated in a
nearby urban area to create a demand for
"summer estates" for the rich and "summer
cottages" for the not-so-rich. This process has
occurred around such cities as New York and
Boston, and is continuing near Charleston,
New Orleans and Houston, to name just a few.
It was not a lack of either people or capital
which prevented this from happening near San
Francisco. A combination of chronic fog, cool
temperatures and steep terrain along the coast
in addition to the availability of the bayshore
as a desirable alternative spared the ocean
front the mansions and bungalows.
And just when unrelenting population pres
sure was starting to turn developers eyes to
ward the Pacific waves, fog or no fog, the Coas
tal Commission was created.
The Presidio, known also to members of the
United States Army as Fort Winfield Scott,
occupies the northernmost tip of San Francis
co's Pacific coast. Part of the Scenic 49 Mile
drive through the City follows Lincoln
Boulevard and El Camino del Mar through the
military installation and out into Lincoln Park
and to Point Lobos. Located along this stretch,
Baker and James D. Phelan State Beaches do
not offer much beyond uninviting gray sand
and excellent views of the Golden Gate.
The Sunset District borders the ocean between
Golden Gate and Harding Parks. Said one ex
resident: "It can be a really miserable

place to live if you're close
to the beach. You

go down there
on a
sunny
day

and you think it's great, so close to the park and
the beach and the rents aren't that high. But when
you move in you get nothing but fog and drizzle
and sand. Especially sand. You think you're living
in a desert. Except it's so cold and wet."
San Francisco's five mile long Ocean Front
Beach is by far the longest for many miles in
both directions. It is posted with terse signs:
"No swimming. Undertow." A gap in the mig
ratory mounds of sound encroaching on the
parking lot is labelled "Sand control." Most
cars which are pulled off the road along the
beach have people in them. Through salt
streaked windshields they contemplate the
grayness before them and the hardier types
who brave the grit and the damp for a stroll by
the breakers.
A dozen blocks inland, sunshine is fre
quently visible.
Coastal fog is so much the normal state of
affairs during the spring, summer and fall
"that its absence indicates unsettled weather,
according to Meteorologist Bill Hackel of the
National Weather Service's Redwood City of
fice.
Explaining the phenomenon, Hackel said,
"The California current flows from the
Japanese islands, toward the Aleutians and
drives down the west coast past Washington
down to California. The normal winds along
the coast — all year but in particular in the
spring, summer and fall — are westerly. This
means that they're blowing perpindicular to
the current going down the coast.
"It's a little difficult to explain in terms of
oceanography but this causes a phenomenon
known as upwelling. This brings colder water
up from several hundred feet below the sur
face close in to the coast, from, say, five to 50
miles out.
"Farther out the water is warmer so the air is
quite humid. When this air is blown across the
colder water, it cools and the moisture con
denses into fog or low overcast. When there's
no fog, this indicates a break in the prevailing
winds and the prevailing weather."
Differential heating of the ocean and the
interior by the sun is responsible for on-shore
breezes, according to Hackel. Carried by these
breezes, the fog is swept inland by the paths of
least resistance — breaks in the hills such as
the Golden Gate.
Just north of the San Mateo County line Hard
ing Municipal Golf Course slopes down to
ward the waves. One golfer there described it
as "a real exciting place to play." Adjacent to
the links are the San Francisco Zoological Gar
dens, Old Fort Funston and the San Francisco
Police Department Pistol Range.
The most arresting sight in the area, how
ever, is the profusion of air-born hang-gliders.
Fanning out from the launching area just south
of the golf course, the 10 yard wing spans can
be observed in flight far out over the cliffs and
beach below.
Daly City and Pacifica interpose themselves
between San Francisco and the start of the
unspoiled coast. The former, straddling the
seaside hills, is notable chiefly because of its
myriad rows of small, uniform houses which
follow the contours of the terrain in densely
packed lines.
The Sharp Park district of Pacifica lies at the
foot of the hills and incorporates a moderately
sized beach. There is little to recommend the
locality save a beach-side restaurant called
"Hamburgers" which serves hamburgers.
/ / I f we had more granite, there would be some

tacular
cliffs,"

Emeritus Professor Benjamin Page said, discus
sing the geology of the coastal terrain.
"The coast ranges are largely made of
sedimentary rocks, though, so they aren't as
steep and high as they might have been. But
they do create some spectacular steep
slopes."
The plate tectonics theory of global geology
has gained general acceptance only in the last
half dozen years, yet geologists have been
quick to recognize its applicability in almost
every aspect of geology. It has been postulated
that the mountain ranges of the western Un
ited States were formed by an interaction of
two parts of the earth's crust known as the
Pacific Ocean plate and the North American
plate. According to the theory, these sections
of crust have moved, and continue to move,
relative to each other.
At some time in the recent geologic past,
Page said, the Pacific plate was moving "be
neath and against" the North American plate.
"I think it was that that produced at least the
beginnings of the coast ranges," he said.
"The coast ranges are geologically young,"
he continued, "because the plate interactions
which produced them were relatively recent,
geologically speaking.
"That's caused a good many local uplifts and
caused steep topography."
The same forces which built the cliffs, how
ever, will undoubtedly have a hand in tearing
them down. Page explained that the relative
movements of the plates has changed since
the mountains were formed. "The relative mo
tion today is that if you hold the North Ameri
can plate still, the Pacific plate is moving to the
northwest. That is what makes the San An
dreas fault operate."
At the southern end of Sharp Park, the road
enters a eucalyptus grove and climbs ab
ruptly away from civilization. The trees quickly
give way to grass which in turn gives way to
exposed rock. This takes on the look of un
treated mining slag near the summit of the hills
and appears likely to slide momentarily into
the ocean below. The stretch is, in fact, named
Devil's Slide and offers a windswept but ad
mirable view.
The hamlets Montara, Moss Beach and
Princeton follow in quick succession. At El
Granada the Half Moon Bay airport can be
found as well as Half Moon Bay Harbor and
some of Half Moon Bay's best restaurants. The
town of Half Moon Bay sticks up at the other
end of the smile-shaped coastal configuration
like a broken tooth.
Squash, pumpkin and artichoke fields line
the road in this vicinity A dairy farm is operat
ing just outside the Half Moon Bay city limits.
The barns and sheds associated with these ag
ricultural undertakings were built of wood in a
more forested age and are weathered to a
silver-gray. The recently constructed buildings
associated with the Half Moon Bay Golf Links
are covered with yellow stucco.
Agrarian enterprises continue to crop up at odd
intervals down the coast south of Half Moon
Bay, sometimes spread over broad plateaus a
hundred feet or more above the ocean waves,
sometimes stretching back into valleys
where the cliffs flatten out and the waves
roll onto unimproved beaches.
In 1972, 55 per cent of the California
electorate helped give Richard
Nixon his "mandate." At the
same time, however, an
equal percentage

cast their ballots in favor of Proposition 20,
known as the coastal initiative.
Following years of ever-increasing concern
about the despoiling of the ocean front, first
on the part of a few "radical" conservationists,
later on the part of a broad coalition of citizens'
groups, the bill was conceived amidst a storm
of controversy.
The two opposing camps were divided along
predictable lines. State Building and Construc
tion Trades Council President James Lee be
came the "official" spokesman against the in
itiative while a host of "unofficial" conser
vationists took it upon themselves to defend
the proposal.
Lee argued that the proposition was un
necessary since 65 per cent of the coastal land
was undeveloped and 54 per cent was already
in public ownership. The bill's advocates re
plied that these figures were "misleading"
since the one third already developed was
concentrated largely within 100 feet of the high
tide mark.
Lee charged that "Proposition 20 is a power
grab — and a land grab — by those who would
by-pass the democratic process," and that
local control of the land would be lost. His
opponents replied that nothing could be more
democratic than an initiative and that the bill as
written called for close consultation with local
groups and public hearings.
Lee stated that the proposition would lead to
an annual loss of $25 million in tax revenues.
This was met with charges that the figure was
"unsubstantiated."
Finally, Lee asked the electorate, "Will the
elitists who want to grab our coastline for their
own purposes then be after our mountains,
our lakes and streams and our farmlands?"
This was dismissed as "patently absurd."
The proposition, as passed, put restrictions
on coastal development until a comprehensive
study could be carried out and a long-range
plan prepared. Immediately created were six
regional commissions, half of the members of
which were to be officials elected locally, the
other half to be citizens appointed by the gov
ernor and legislature. These bodies were to
make recommendations regarding their reg
ions while a central state commission coordi
nated the program.
The final recommendations were submitted
to the governor and legislature in fall, 1975.
After several months of legislative processing,
they emerged in a somewhat modified form as
the 1976 Coastal Act. The policies contained
therein went into effect on the first of this year.
It is up to the communities of the coast to make
the next move. Working within the guidelines
established by the legislature, each community
must draw up a plan for its section of shoreline.
This completed, all proposals must pass through
an 11 step reviewprior
to certification.
The com
mission

hopes to see this stage of the program completed
by 1979. In the meantime, coastal development
will proceed at a minimal rate.
The houses to the south of San Gregorio
State Beach stand close to the road but at
great distances from each other. They are low,
Sea Ranch-style structures for the most part,
and frequently incorporate exotic features in
their architecture. One home is adorned with
red rafters reminiscent of a Chinese pagoda.
They share their lots with wild flowers in the
summer.
Down on the beaches, the waves have hol
lowed out the soft rock to form caves and
natural arches.
The Pigeon Point lighthouse stands on a
prominent headland visible for several miles
along the coast in both directions. A beacon
with a past, the tower was named for a ship
which ran aground in 1852 and recently celeb
rated its 105 th birthday.
In the winter, male elephant seals gather for
a pre-mating fraternal bash at Ano Nuevo
Point, the next headland down the coast. The
imposing bachelors are among the relatively
wide variety of aquatic mammals which live in
the coastal waters.
Much of the land between Ano Nuevo and
Santa Cruz, 15 miles to the south, is given over
to agriculture of one type or another. Having
survived from an age of extravagant land
grants, many of the Spanish-named rancheros
occupy large tracts and raise a diversity of
crops from artichokes to beef cattle.
Fishing tends to improve toward the south.
Good angling spots include Greyhound Rock
and Davenport Landing. Ocean perch are the
most common quarry.
Davenport is the last "town" before the "city"
of Santa Cruz. A cement plant, the largest indust
rial enterprise along the coast for many miles,
stands just outside the 200 person village. The
tall, gray towers, apparently dusted with their
own product, seem slightly surreal in the other
wise empty landscape.
A railroad line joins the cement plant with the
Southern Pacific freight terminal in Santa Cruz.
Since the right-of-way runs between the road and
the shore, access to the water is difficult to ob
tain. The fields along this stretch are planted with
Brussels sprouts and cauliflower.
The turnoff to Natural Bridges State Beach
leads down to West Cliff Drive. This winding road
along the shoreline bluffs ends up in Santa Cruz
center near the small crafts harbor.
7 he late afternoon sun lays down a path of
brilliant, dynamic gold across the bound
less expanse of water. Some people shake
sand off their towels before folding them;
some remain supine under dark glasses. In the
parking lot, small groups walk gingerly over the
sharp-pointed stones. Vans, pickups, station
wagons start grudgingly with a roar

and a cloud of exhaust.
Cars line up at the
exit, waiting for a

break in the
steady stream
of traffic.
