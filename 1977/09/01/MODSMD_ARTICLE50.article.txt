# The lonely rock they call Alcatraz ...

### 
"This is just 12 acres of 34,000
that we control, although I guess
this is the most famous part,"
said Bill Whalen, a Golden Gate
National Recreation Area offi
cial, nodding toward the tiny
finger of rock across the Bay.
Alcatraz Island lay quietly in
the water, whipped by a chilly
wind, pummeled by the Pacific
Ocean's blue waves. The one
time home of Al Capone was
greeting visitors who had no in
tention of staying more than a
few hours.
Alcatraz, once the object of
more fear and hate than any
place else in America, opened to
the public in 1973 for the first
time since Mexico ceded the is
land in Itt4B.
From 1934, when federal
prison administrators made the
island a home for America's in
corrigibles, until 1963, when of
ficials declared it obsolete, few
citizens could honestly claim
neutral feelings for "The Rock."
For millions of Americans, Al
catraz represented protection, a
fortress where the government
held unmitigated evil at bay. For
others, Alcatraz was a monu
ment to barbarous cruelty, a
continuing reminder of Ameri
ca's failures. To the handful of
men who actually served time
there, it was at once a living hell,
a worse existence than they
could ever have imagined, and
paradoxically, a coveted mark of
high status in the underworld.
Psychological myth
"Alcatraz was founded on a
psychological myth," Whalen

said. "It was a place that would
make the public feel safe from
the big criminals of the 19305,
that would make the public feel
'we've really taken care of those
guys.'
"At the same time, there was a
lot of trouble in existing prisons,
a lot of riots and violence, and
this was something the prison
people could use as a discipli
nary measure.
"They really built up the image
of Alcatraz ... no one was ever
taken to other prisons for re
lease, because the prison
people wanted to build up the
image that you never get off 'The
Rock.'
"Even today, the Bureau of
Prisons is reluctant to talk about
it to us," he said.
A little over a mile from
Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz still
has an air of ominous entice
ment that the years of isolation
have not dimmed.
A large sign warns: KEEP OFF
— US Gov't Property. The water
tower, looming high above the
island, bears a different mes
sage: "Home of the Free Indian
— Welcome," a remnant of the
lengthy occupation of the island
by militant Indians at the start of
this decade. The automated
lighthouse watches over the
empty settlement, warning away
unwary boats.
Alcatraz has been dead 14
years now, and it shows. Shat
tered windows in the old yellow
administration building give it a
blind, hollow look; rusted bars
reek of decay.

"See if you can feel the at
mosphere; try to imagine you're
a prisoner here," guide Jerry
Rombourg advised visitors. Even
the most skeptical felt a small
chill as the ferry pulled away
from the island and headed back
to Fisherman's Wharf.
Military installation
Alcatraz began as a military in
stallation. The island is solid
rock, with structures built on
two levels. The lower area was
constructed by the military/with
the idea of keeping the enemy
out. A great deal of the upper
level was built or altered by the
prison authorities to keep
another sort of enemy in.
The two areas are connected
by an intricate series of stairways
and catwalks, rusted and sprout
ing weeds in many cases. A
winding road, carved out of
solid stone, winds its way up the
jagged hill. It, like everything
else on the island, has been par
tially eaten up by the greenery.
"All the island's piping and
wiring is contained in a tunnel
underneath this road," Rom
bourg told visitors as they
trudged up the hill. "They built it
into the road because it was the
only way to protect it from the
wind and the sea." The tunnel
caused a number of problems,
though.
"Every time there was an es
cape, or an escape attempt, the
prison authorities had to crawl
through all the tunnels to see if
the prisoners were hiding in
there. And once or twice a week
they had to go through it to see if

the prisoners were hiding any
contraband," Rombourg said.
Even the old warden's office,
in the corner of the sickly pink
main building, has been invaded
by the wildly-proliferating vege
tation.
When Alcatraz was young,
there were about 40 terraced
gardens on the island, tended by
inmates who got outside the
cellblock for good behavior. The
island's vegetary anarchy today
stems from the old gardens.
Command post
Little remains in the warden's
office to indicate that it was once
the command post of a
maximum security system cover
ing an area of 12 acres. An old
desk rots quietly in one corner,
on the wall is a rusted brown
spot, once a control panel that lit
up if trouble flared anywhere on
the island.
'.'The warden had some pretty
tough ideas about security,"
Rombourg recounted. "He
would send guards out to the
rifle range, and tell them to prac
tice during the morning as the
prisoners marched by on their
way to work. He thought that
reinforced the idea that if they
wanted to leave, they wouJd
have some problems.
"He also had the guard put
dummies outside and use them
for target practice while the
prisoners ate. They (prisoners)
could hear the shooting . . .
then, after their meal, they
would go outside and see a
bunch of dummies shot full of
holes. I suppose it was pretty

effective," he continued.
Past the warden's office is the
old visitor's area — a dark,
parched, peeling room, still
heavy with the stench of loneli
ness. In this dimly-lit room wives
and children sat, waiting to catch
a glimpse of husbands and
fathers — through a one-foot
square window with inch-thick
glass.
They spoke only through tele
phones.
On the other side of the win
dow was the heart and soul of
Alcatraz — if it had such a thing
— the three cell blocks. Here the
Al Capones and Robert Strouds
lived out desperate year after
desperate year, watching the
San Francisco skyline just a mile
away.
Here they stayed, in a pain
fully small nine by five foot cell,
with a folding cot, stool, sink,
toilet, light bulb, and folding
bench and table. And their time.
'Silent days'
"From 1934 to 1944 were
what's known as 'the silent
days,' " Rombourg intoned as
visitors moved among the cells.
"The prisoners were notallowed
to talk to each other. They got a
three-minute break on
weekends. Everyone got to be
pretty proficient in arm lan
guage, shoulder language, sign
language, any kind but spoken."
"Reading material was non
existent. In the prison library
there were hardly any books to
read . . . mail did not exist. An
inmate could have one visit a
