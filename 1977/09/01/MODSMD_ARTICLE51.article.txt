# The 						two hundred year evolution of San Francisco Bay ...
## 
### 
In the fourth act of Goethe's Faust Part Two, the hero tells
the devil Mephistopheles that he has been contemplating
the seashore and has been struck with an inspiration:
Thus plan on plan came thronging to my mind-
VV/n for yourself, O Faust, this precious pleasure:
Lock out the lordly sea from shore and measure
A narrower measure for his briny plain,
Drive him far back into his own domain.
Faust's motivation, Mephistopheles learns, is of the nob
lest sort:
It steals along, in countless channels flowing,
Fruitless itself and fruitlessness bestowing;
It swells and grows and rolls and spreads its reign
Over the loathsome desolate domain.
There wave on wave holds tyrant sway unfettered
And then draws back and nothing has been bettered;

And I could thus grow desperate to behold
This aimless power of elements uncontrolled
But here my spirit dared a flight unknown:
Here I could war and warring, win my throne.
To the Europeans who first explored and later settled the
San Francisco Peninsula, the Bay must have seemed no less
a "fruitless, desolate, loathsome domain." The surround
ing land may have been fertile, but the expanse of water
seemed from tht* first an obstacle to progress.
Immense arm
When the Portola-Serra expedition of 1869 discovered
the Bay, one member noted in his diary that "The expedi
tion strove to reach Point Reyes, but was hindered by an
immense arm of the sea, which, extending to a great dis
tance inland, compelled them to make an enormous circuit
for that purpose. In consequence of this and other difficul

ties, the greatest of all being the absolute want ot food, the
expedition was compelled to turn back."
At the time ot the gold rush, in the 1850 sand after, so little
esteemed was the Bay that submerged lots were sold by the
municipality of San Francisco and other cities with the un
derstanding that the purchasers would till in their property
and make it "useful."
This practice continued until the early part of this cen
tury, at which time the state legislature was obliged to step
in and settle the complex inter-municipal disputes which
were flaring around the usage of the Bay. This resulted only
in a juggling of roles, however: instead of disposing of
water rights, the cities could only acquire them on the
condition that "improvements" be made within 10 years.
It was not until the last decade that the Bay Area's citizens
started to acquire an appreciation for the blue expanse. In

1962 the city of Berkeley, tollowing the lead of a dozen
other Bayside communities, tormulated a plan which
would double its land area by filling in 4000 acres ot wet
lands. Compared to other proposals circulating at the time
this was quite a modest sum. San Mateo County, for exam
ple, encouraged by an impromptu consortium of foothill
developers who were selling the earth removed from their
excavations and truckers who were buying and reselling it at
a profit as Bay fill, had decided to push its shoreline two to
three miles turther out into the water.
The Berkeley scheme, however, galvanized a small but
determined group of conservationists into action. Several
faculty wives from the University of California, together
with a handtul of Bay Area conservationists, formed an ac
tivist group which they named the Save San Francisco Bay

Association.
After months of unrelenting effort during which the
group's members consulted engineers, economists,
sociologists and city planners about the necessity of the fill,
they presented their case to the Berkeley City Council.
When the filling plans were withdrawn, the Save the Bay
Movement spread to other communities.
Two years after the movement's inception, the issue be
came one of such political potency that a bill was passed by
the state legislature establishing the San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission and calling
for a detailed study of the issue. The Commission was
directed to examine "All the characteristics of the Bay,
including ... the ecological balance of the Bay, the
economic interests in the Bay, including the needs of the

Bay Area population for industry and employment."
The study was started in 1965 and completed in 1969.
During the course of these five years, reports on 25 diffe
rent aspects of the Bay were prepared, many of which
contained startling information which had not been ap
preciated outside of specialized circles.
In a report entitled "Smog and Weather," for example, it
was stated that "the waters of the Bay play a significant part
in helping to determine the climate in the region: they
serve as a 'heat reservoir,' moderating the extremes of
temperature; they make possible the smooth flow of cool
ing winds from the ocean; and their existence helps pre
vent smog."
If as little as 25 per cent of the Bay were filled, the report
said, a significant increase in summertime temperatures
and a decrease in both winter temperatures and rainfall

around the Bay would result.
The intuitively obvious conclusion that the Bay is a com
plex ecosystem was born out by the half dozen reports
dealing with tidal movement, sedimentation, pollution,
fish and wildlife, marshes and mudflats, and salt, sand,
and shells. The conclusions of each of these reports
start, "The Bay is a single physical mechanism, in which
actions affecting one part may also affect other parts," and
they end with an assessment of the harm which would
result from "any reduction in the surface or volume of the
Bay."
While the study was being conducted, the Commission
had been empowered to regulate local fill of the Bay. Even
before all the evidence was in, the commission believed
strongly enough that Bay fill was deleterious that it permit
ted only 359 acres to be filled in four years, a fraction of the

amount which previously had been filled annually.
"It requires little imagination to picture the Bay region
without the Bay," wrote Harold Gilliam in 1969 in his
chronicle of the Bay's preservation, Between the Devil and
the Deep Blue Bay. "It is only necessary to look at many
another U.S. city, surrounded by mile after mile of tract
houses, asphalt-encircled shopping centers, factories and
freeways — endless stretches of slurbs, choked by traffic,
begrimed by smog.
"However, it requires considerable imagination, and a
great deal of ingenuity, to picture this region if its greatest
natural resource were preserved and developed to its ful
lest potential. This kind of vision of what the Bay might
become has been set forth by the Bay Conservation and
Development Commission in the comprehensive plan it
developed for the Bay and its shores."

This aimless power of elements uncontrolled
But here my spirit dared a flight unknown:
Here I could war and warring, win my throne.
To the Europeans who first explored and later settled the
San Francisco Peninsula, the Bay must have seemed no less
a "fruitless, desolate, loathsome domain." The surround
ing land may have been fertile, but the expanse of water
seemed from tht* first an obstacle to progress.
Immense arm
When the Portola-Serra expedition of 1869 discovered
the Bay, one member noted in his diary that "The expedi
tion strove to reach Point Reyes, but was hindered by an
immense arm of the sea, which, extending to a great dis
tance inland, compelled them to make an enormous circuit
for that purpose. In consequence of this and other difficul

ties, the greatest of all being the absolute want ot food, the
expedition was compelled to turn back."
At the time ot the gold rush, in the 1850 sand after, so little
esteemed was the Bay that submerged lots were sold by the
municipality of San Francisco and other cities with the un
derstanding that the purchasers would till in their property
and make it "useful."
This practice continued until the early part of this cen
tury, at which time the state legislature was obliged to step
in and settle the complex inter-municipal disputes which
were flaring around the usage of the Bay. This resulted only
in a juggling of roles, however: instead of disposing of
water rights, the cities could only acquire them on the
condition that "improvements" be made within 10 years.
It was not until the last decade that the Bay Area's citizens
started to acquire an appreciation for the blue expanse. In

1962 the city of Berkeley, tollowing the lead of a dozen
other Bayside communities, tormulated a plan which
would double its land area by filling in 4000 acres ot wet
lands. Compared to other proposals circulating at the time
this was quite a modest sum. San Mateo County, for exam
ple, encouraged by an impromptu consortium of foothill
developers who were selling the earth removed from their
excavations and truckers who were buying and reselling it at
a profit as Bay fill, had decided to push its shoreline two to
three miles turther out into the water.
The Berkeley scheme, however, galvanized a small but
determined group of conservationists into action. Several
faculty wives from the University of California, together
with a handtul of Bay Area conservationists, formed an ac
tivist group which they named the Save San Francisco Bay

Association.
After months of unrelenting effort during which the
group's members consulted engineers, economists,
sociologists and city planners about the necessity of the fill,
they presented their case to the Berkeley City Council.
When the filling plans were withdrawn, the Save the Bay
Movement spread to other communities.
Two years after the movement's inception, the issue be
came one of such political potency that a bill was passed by
the state legislature establishing the San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission and calling
for a detailed study of the issue. The Commission was
directed to examine "All the characteristics of the Bay,
including ... the ecological balance of the Bay, the
economic interests in the Bay, including the needs of the

Bay Area population for industry and employment."
The study was started in 1965 and completed in 1969.
During the course of these five years, reports on 25 diffe
rent aspects of the Bay were prepared, many of which
contained startling information which had not been ap
preciated outside of specialized circles.
In a report entitled "Smog and Weather," for example, it
was stated that "the waters of the Bay play a significant part
in helping to determine the climate in the region: they
serve as a 'heat reservoir,' moderating the extremes of
temperature; they make possible the smooth flow of cool
ing winds from the ocean; and their existence helps pre
vent smog."
If as little as 25 per cent of the Bay were filled, the report
said, a significant increase in summertime temperatures
and a decrease in both winter temperatures and rainfall

around the Bay would result.
The intuitively obvious conclusion that the Bay is a com
plex ecosystem was born out by the half dozen reports
dealing with tidal movement, sedimentation, pollution,
fish and wildlife, marshes and mudflats, and salt, sand,
and shells. The conclusions of each of these reports
start, "The Bay is a single physical mechanism, in which
actions affecting one part may also affect other parts," and
they end with an assessment of the harm which would
result from "any reduction in the surface or volume of the
Bay."
While the study was being conducted, the Commission
had been empowered to regulate local fill of the Bay. Even
before all the evidence was in, the commission believed
strongly enough that Bay fill was deleterious that it permit
ted only 359 acres to be filled in four years, a fraction of the

amount which previously had been filled annually.
"It requires little imagination to picture the Bay region
without the Bay," wrote Harold Gilliam in 1969 in his
chronicle of the Bay's preservation, Between the Devil and
the Deep Blue Bay. "It is only necessary to look at many
another U.S. city, surrounded by mile after mile of tract
houses, asphalt-encircled shopping centers, factories and
freeways — endless stretches of slurbs, choked by traffic,
begrimed by smog.
"However, it requires considerable imagination, and a
great deal of ingenuity, to picture this region if its greatest
natural resource were preserved and developed to its ful
lest potential. This kind of vision of what the Bay might
become has been set forth by the Bay Conservation and
Development Commission in the comprehensive plan it
developed for the Bay and its shores."


In the fourth act of Goethe's Faust Part Two, the hero tells
the devil Mephistopheles that he has been contemplating
the seashore and has been struck with an inspiration:
Thus plan on plan came thronging to my mind-
VV/n for yourself, O Faust, this precious pleasure:
Lock out the lordly sea from shore and measure
A narrower measure for his briny plain,
Drive him far back into his own domain.
Faust's motivation, Mephistopheles learns, is of the nob
lest sort:
It steals along, in countless channels flowing,
Fruitless itself and fruitlessness bestowing;
It swells and grows and rolls and spreads its reign
Over the loathsome desolate domain.
There wave on wave holds tyrant sway unfettered
And then draws back and nothing has been bettered;

And I could thus grow desperate to behold
This aimless power of elements uncontrolled
But here my spirit dared a flight unknown:
Here I could war and warring, win my throne.

ties, the greatest of all being the absolute want ot food, the
expedition was compelled to turn back."
At the time ot the gold rush, in the 1850 sand after, so little
esteemed was the Bay that submerged lots were sold by the
municipality of San Francisco and other cities with the un
derstanding that the purchasers would till in their property
and make it "useful."
This practice continued until the early part of this cen
tury, at which time the state legislature was obliged to step
in and settle the complex inter-municipal disputes which
were flaring around the usage of the Bay. This resulted only
in a juggling of roles, however: instead of disposing of
water rights, the cities could only acquire them on the
condition that "improvements" be made within 10 years.
It was not until the last decade that the Bay Area's citizens
started to acquire an appreciation for the blue expanse. In

1962 the city of Berkeley, tollowing the lead of a dozen
other Bayside communities, tormulated a plan which
would double its land area by filling in 4000 acres ot wet
lands. Compared to other proposals circulating at the time
this was quite a modest sum. San Mateo County, for exam
ple, encouraged by an impromptu consortium of foothill
developers who were selling the earth removed from their
excavations and truckers who were buying and reselling it at
a profit as Bay fill, had decided to push its shoreline two to
three miles turther out into the water.
The Berkeley scheme, however, galvanized a small but
determined group of conservationists into action. Several
faculty wives from the University of California, together
with a handtul of Bay Area conservationists, formed an ac
tivist group which they named the Save San Francisco Bay

Association.
After months of unrelenting effort during which the
group's members consulted engineers, economists,
sociologists and city planners about the necessity of the fill,
they presented their case to the Berkeley City Council.
When the filling plans were withdrawn, the Save the Bay
Movement spread to other communities.
Two years after the movement's inception, the issue be
came one of such political potency that a bill was passed by
the state legislature establishing the San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission and calling
for a detailed study of the issue. The Commission was
directed to examine "All the characteristics of the Bay,
including ... the ecological balance of the Bay, the
economic interests in the Bay, including the needs of the

Bay Area population for industry and employment."
The study was started in 1965 and completed in 1969.
During the course of these five years, reports on 25 diffe
rent aspects of the Bay were prepared, many of which
contained startling information which had not been ap
preciated outside of specialized circles.
In a report entitled "Smog and Weather," for example, it
was stated that "the waters of the Bay play a significant part
in helping to determine the climate in the region: they
serve as a 'heat reservoir,' moderating the extremes of
temperature; they make possible the smooth flow of cool
ing winds from the ocean; and their existence helps pre
vent smog."
If as little as 25 per cent of the Bay were filled, the report
said, a significant increase in summertime temperatures
and a decrease in both winter temperatures and rainfall

around the Bay would result.
The intuitively obvious conclusion that the Bay is a com
plex ecosystem was born out by the half dozen reports
dealing with tidal movement, sedimentation, pollution,
fish and wildlife, marshes and mudflats, and salt, sand,
and shells. The conclusions of each of these reports
start, "The Bay is a single physical mechanism, in which
actions affecting one part may also affect other parts," and
they end with an assessment of the harm which would
result from "any reduction in the surface or volume of the
Bay."
While the study was being conducted, the Commission
had been empowered to regulate local fill of the Bay. Even
before all the evidence was in, the commission believed
strongly enough that Bay fill was deleterious that it permit
ted only 359 acres to be filled in four years, a fraction of the

amount which previously had been filled annually.
"It requires little imagination to picture the Bay region
without the Bay," wrote Harold Gilliam in 1969 in his
chronicle of the Bay's preservation, Between the Devil and
the Deep Blue Bay. "It is only necessary to look at many
another U.S. city, surrounded by mile after mile of tract
houses, asphalt-encircled shopping centers, factories and
freeways — endless stretches of slurbs, choked by traffic,
begrimed by smog.
"However, it requires considerable imagination, and a
great deal of ingenuity, to picture this region if its greatest
natural resource were preserved and developed to its ful
lest potential. This kind of vision of what the Bay might
become has been set forth by the Bay Conservation and
Development Commission in the comprehensive plan it
developed for the Bay and its shores."


In the fourth act of Goethe's Faust Part Two, the hero tells
the devil Mephistopheles that he has been contemplating
the seashore and has been struck with an inspiration:
Thus plan on plan came thronging to my mind-
VV/n for yourself, O Faust, this precious pleasure:
Lock out the lordly sea from shore and measure
A narrower measure for his briny plain,
Drive him far back into his own domain.
Faust's motivation, Mephistopheles learns, is of the nob
lest sort:
It steals along, in countless channels flowing,
Fruitless itself and fruitlessness bestowing;
It swells and grows and rolls and spreads its reign
Over the loathsome desolate domain.
There wave on wave holds tyrant sway unfettered
And then draws back and nothing has been bettered;

And I could thus grow desperate to behold
This aimless power of elements uncontrolled
But here my spirit dared a flight unknown:
Here I could war and warring, win my throne.
To the Europeans who first explored and later settled the
San Francisco Peninsula, the Bay must have seemed no less
a "fruitless, desolate, loathsome domain." The surround
ing land may have been fertile, but the expanse of water
seemed from tht* first an obstacle to progress.
Immense arm
When the Portola-Serra expedition of 1869 discovered
the Bay, one member noted in his diary that "The expedi
tion strove to reach Point Reyes, but was hindered by an
immense arm of the sea, which, extending to a great dis
tance inland, compelled them to make an enormous circuit
for that purpose. In consequence of this and other difficul

ties, the greatest of all being the absolute want ot food, the
expedition was compelled to turn back."
