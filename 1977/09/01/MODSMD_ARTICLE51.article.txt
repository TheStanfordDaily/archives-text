# The two hundred year evolution of San Francisco Bay ...

### 
In the fourth act of Goethe's Faust Part Two, the hero tells
the devil Mephistopheles that he has been contemplating
the seashore and has been struck with an inspiration:
Thus plan on plan came thronging to my mind-
VV/n for yourself, O Faust, this precious pleasure:
Lock out the lordly sea from shore and measure
A narrower measure for his briny plain,
Drive him far back into his own domain.
Faust's motivation, Mephistopheles learns, is of the nob
lest sort:
It steals along, in countless channels flowing,
Fruitless itself and fruitlessness bestowing;
It swells and grows and rolls and spreads its reign
Over the loathsome desolate domain.
There wave on wave holds tyrant sway unfettered
And then draws back and nothing has been bettered;

And I could thus grow desperate to behold
This aimless power of elements uncontrolled
But here my spirit dared a flight unknown:
Here I could war and warring, win my throne.
To the Europeans who first explored and later settled the
San Francisco Peninsula, the Bay must have seemed no less
a "fruitless, desolate, loathsome domain." The surround
ing land may have been fertile, but the expanse of water
seemed from tht* first an obstacle to progress.
Immense arm
When the Portola-Serra expedition of 1869 discovered
the Bay, one member noted in his diary that "The expedi
tion strove to reach Point Reyes, but was hindered by an
immense arm of the sea, which, extending to a great dis
tance inland, compelled them to make an enormous circuit
for that purpose. In consequence of this and other difficul

ties, the greatest of all being the absolute want ot food, the
expedition was compelled to turn back."
At the time ot the gold rush, in the 1850 sand after, so little
esteemed was the Bay that submerged lots were sold by the
municipality of San Francisco and other cities with the un
derstanding that the purchasers would till in their property
and make it "useful."
This practice continued until the early part of this cen
tury, at which time the state legislature was obliged to step
in and settle the complex inter-municipal disputes which
were flaring around the usage of the Bay. This resulted only
in a juggling of roles, however: instead of disposing of
water rights, the cities could only acquire them on the
condition that "improvements" be made within 10 years.
It was not until the last decade that the Bay Area's citizens
started to acquire an appreciation for the blue expanse. In

1962 the city of Berkeley, tollowing the lead of a dozen
other Bayside communities, tormulated a plan which
would double its land area by filling in 4000 acres ot wet
lands. Compared to other proposals circulating at the time
this was quite a modest sum. San Mateo County, for exam
ple, encouraged by an impromptu consortium of foothill
developers who were selling the earth removed from their
excavations and truckers who were buying and reselling it at
a profit as Bay fill, had decided to push its shoreline two to
three miles turther out into the water.
The Berkeley scheme, however, galvanized a small but
determined group of conservationists into action. Several
faculty wives from the University of California, together
with a handtul of Bay Area conservationists, formed an ac
tivist group which they named the Save San Francisco Bay
