# The
						Mid-peninsula: land of opportunity
## 
### 
Observers from the East Coast
(of whom there are a great many)
tend to remark that California is
the land of the future. The more
traditional of them may speak
disdainfully of it as "a place with
no history," but their presence
indicates an interest in the
state's present.
The present of the area
euphemistically referred to as
the "Mid-peninsula" (Palo Alto,
Los Altos, Mountain View,
Menlo Park and Redwood City),
does owe virtually nothing to
any past more distant than the
second world war and the
period of history known as the
post-war boom.
In the three decades since the
pre-war era, Palo Alto's popula
tion has more than tripled
(16,700 to 54,900). Menlo Park's
has increased by 1000 per cent
(2700 to 27,000) and Santa Clara
County's has gone up more than
600 per cent (174,000 to
1,178,000).
The area's economy, midwif
ing at the double birth of the
electronics and aerospace in
dustries, grew as rapidly as the
technology-intensive twins
thriving on the ambrosia of gov
ernment investment. Today, in a
county which was once almost
exclusively agricultural, only
5100 out of a work force of
583,000 are engaged in farming
while the aerospace industry
employs 88,000 and manufactur
ing, much of it of electronic
equipment, employs 149,000.
The development of the one
time redwood paradise into a
silicon mecca represents the ful
fillment of an American dream.
What has been for two centuries
the ultimate Land of Opportun
ity has finally rewarded vigil
ant opportunists with an El
Dorado of a much different sort
than originally imagined by the
gold-seeking Spaniards.
Portola
The first white men to visit the
Bay Area, Caspar de Portola and
Father ]unipero Serra were fol
lowing the path of the explorer
Viscayno who had discovered
Monterey Bay 166 years prior to
the church-ordered expedition
of 1769. Viscayno, of course, had
been searching for gold, but
Serra and Portola found in the
area only the opportunity to
convert the aboriginal inhabit
ants to Christianity. By 1822, land
seemed to be the only commod
ity of any value. It was doled out
in huge tracts to whomever was
owed a favor by the fledgling
Mexican government.
The first Anglo-Americans ar
rived in the 1840s. They were at
tracted to the area by the poten
tial lumber fortune standing in
the groves of huge redwoods on
the western side of the Bay.
By 1850 when the gold rush
was in full swing, more than 50
saw mills were in operation. San
Francisco became a boom town
whose hotels and saloons,
houses and stores were built of
wood cut in the Mid-peninsula
hills and shipped out of Red
wood City.
The fortune-hunting stam
pede had hardly abated when
the Redwood City-Mountain
View area began to lose its
backwoods character. A railroad
line between San Francisco and
San lose, opened in 1963, made
land speculation into a lucrative

enterprise. It was not long be
fore the San Franciscan elite
were arriving in droves to build
themselves country estates; not
least among them was Leland
Stanford, fresh from the Gover
nor's mansion.
Bucolic
The area's bucolic atmos
phere persisted through such
events as the University's open
ing in 1891, Palo Alto's incorpo
ration in 1894 and Mountain
View's incorporation in 1902.
The first world war provided a
brief preview of what would be
brought3o years later by another
global conflict. More than 43,000
soldiers were brought to Camp
Fremont in Menlo Park for train
ing. When the tent city was
folded away in 1919, several
thousand remained in a hospital
for the "neuropsychiatrically
disabled." The Veteran's Ad
ministration hospital on Page
Mill Road is a direct descendant
of this facility.
The evolution of the Mid
peninsula into a technology
intensive economic district
coincided with the second world
war. Electronics firms such as
Hewlett and Packard, Varian and
Ampex took root during the
post-war era while government
facilities such as the NASA Ames
Research Center in Mountain
View grew up next to military in
stallations such as Moffett Air
Field.
By the early '60s, when it be
came apparent that innovations
in electronics and increases in
the nation's defense budget
would maintain the Mid
peninsula's affluence for many
years to come, the area began to
develop a social conscience.
Urban planning
Palo Alto, for example, en
tered the avant garde of urban
planning by coming to grips with
such issues as drug abuse, hous
ing for the elderly, and transpor
tation before they were recog
nized as potential small-city
problems. A court battle bet
ween developers and conser
vationists led to the protection
of Palo Alto's baylands and the
establishment of several munic
ipal parks in the foothills.
That the city fathers are not
deeply concerned with main
taining a "liberal" ideology is at
tested to by the most recent at
tempt at social amelioration: the
massage parlors within city
limits and a pair of "adult estab
lishments" were shut down in a
pre-dawn police raid last De
cember.
The Mid-peninsula's political
complexion is far from simple.
Representative Pete McCloskey
probably comes as close as any
one to personifying the appa
rently paradoxical voting pat
terns of the area's electorate.
The four-term ex-marine Repub
lican is known as a thinking, in
dependent politician who takes
a stance as frequently to the left
as to the right.
His opponent in the 1976 elec
tion was former ASSU President
David Harris. The 32-year-old
Democrat lost by a landslide, a
number of his supporters specu
lated, because the influential
voters felt that Harris was politi
cally and ideologically unpre
pared to watch out for the flow
of federal money to the area.
