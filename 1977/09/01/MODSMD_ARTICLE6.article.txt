# Answers to the academic question
## 
### 
At some point during his or
her Stanford career, nearly every
student is sure to encounter an
academic question to which no
one seems to have an answer.
More often than not, the
Academic Information Center
(AIC), housed on the third floor
of Old Union, can provide a
satisfactory solution.
The AIC exists to help under
graduate students define and
achieve their academic and edu
cational goals. The center serves
as a clearinghouse of informa
tion dealing with academic af
fairs.
One of the most frequently
used AIC services is the im
mense collection of literature
from various colleges, univer
sities and graduate schools.
They have information about
scholarships at other institu
tions, plus those available speci
fically to women and minorities.
Here, too, can be found applica
tions to the staggering array of
graduate school admissions
examinations: MCAT, LSAT,
GRE and others.
Another AIC program involves
preprofessional counseling, av
ailable for students in any field,
but especially those in pre-med,
pre-law and pre-business.

Because of specific curricula
requirements, pre-med stu
dents are assigned individual
advisors, most of whom are
physicians. Because of less
specific requirements, other
preprofessional advising is less
structured.
However, the AIC does not
stress preprofessionalism. Ac
cording to foi mer Center Direc
tor Robert Hamrdla, . . there
is nothing further from our
minds. The service exists be
cause students feel the need for
it."
In addition, the AIC offers
preprofessional (rather than just
pre-med or pre-law) advising in
order to encourage students to
consider other career alterna
tives within their major field.
For students outside the pre
professional areas, the AIC
primarily offers help in dealing
with advisors and advising. All
undergraduates who have not
declared a major and all inter
departmental majors are under
the supervision of the AIC.
The AIC also is in charge of all
transfer advising and keeps track
of writing and departmental dis
tribution requirements for every
student.
