# ASSUmed powers
## 
### 
ASSU is not an expletive. It
stands for Associated Students
of Stanford University, the rep
resentative organization of the
student body here. The ASSU
has two separate arms of rep
resentation: the Senate and the
Council of Presidents.
Senators are elected in the fall
for one academic year. Anyone
who turns in a petition with the
required number of signatures
may run.
Last year's senate was domi
nated by members of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society, the
campus "humor" organization.
One student summarized a
widespread sentiment when he
said, "The best thing to happen
to the ASSU Senate was to have
Hammer and Coffin elected last
year. It was the first time anyone
could take the senate for what it
really is — a joke."
Of course, some senators did
not treat the senate as a joke and
took themselves very seriously.
Dorm sherry hours were held to
gain student input on campus is
sues.

The character of student poli
tics changes each year, and it
is difficult to predict what will
happen.
The four ASSU co-presidents
this year are Glenn Jordan, Steve
Westly, Greg Larson and Anne
Henkels. Some of the issues
they stressed during their cam
paign last spring were the in
stitution of an exam file and a
typing service.
Westly and Larson consider
themselves to be the student
services-oriented members of
the COP, and they plan to help
improve ASSU Special Events,
pushing for closer ties between
Special Events and the Universi
ty's Public Events.
Jordan and Henkels are the
activist-oriented members of the
COP, and Henkels said they will
seek to commission a study on
all the stock held by the Univer
sity.
Henkels said that she would
like to see an intra-university co
alition of women established or
campus.
