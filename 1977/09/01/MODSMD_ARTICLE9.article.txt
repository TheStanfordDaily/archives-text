# Study trouble? Luckily there's a LAC
## 
### 
At Stanford, where the aver
age high school CPA of entering
freshmen is 3.8, it is ironic that
one of the most popular groups
of classes is taught by the Learn
ing Assistance Center (LAC).
The center, which opened in
1972, offers courses in study
skills improvement, reading,
vocabulary, peer counseling and
tutoring, as well as methods of
tackling term papers and theses.
According to LAC director
Michael McHargue, "Stanford
students are so bright they ha
ven't had to develop effective
learning skills. They have
achieved high marks without
such instruction."
He explains that poor learning
skills develop because most stu
dents have had no formal in
struction in reading since
elementary school.
The challenges present in the
environment here — peer pres
sure, competition for admission
to graduate and professional
schools and personal expecta
tions formed in high school —
have led students to the realiza
tion that efficiency will be what
distinguishes them from other
students of equal intelligence.
Besides offering the learning
skills improvement classes, LAC
was instrumental in developing
departmental tutoring programs
such as the Physics Reference
Frame, the Chemistry Informa
tion Room and the Math Con
sulting Center.
Individual tutoring is handled
by undergraduates who enroll in
the tutor training course and
earn credit for both their train
ing and the tutoring services.
In 1974, LAC received a grant
of $6000 from the Exxon Educa
tion Foundation to plan, de
velop and evaluate a peer coun
seling program aimed at improv
ing study skills.
The peer counselors them
selves must take the LAC-1 "Ef
fective Learning Skills" class to
reinforce their knowledge of
learning skills. After viewing the
success of the LAC peer counsel
ing program, former Under

graduate Studies Dean lames
Cibbs allowed LAC to become
the accrediting agency for all
campus peer counseling prog
rams.
The LAC program was the sub
ject of a Time article two years
ago, and was labeled a "reme
dial program for the bright."
McHargue takes a slightly diffe

rent approach, wanting to
"make it clear that people don't
have to get into an academic jam
in order to use our services.
Stanford students have a lot of
difficulty accepting help — but
everyone including graduate
students and faculty use our
program."
The techniques of the LAC

seem to be effective. McHargue
reports that after taking one or
more LAC courses, grades, units
completed, and academic read
ing rates all improve.

Center is located in Meyer 123.

one of the most popular groups
of classes is taught by the Learn
ing Assistance Center (LAC).
The center, which opened in
1972, offers courses in study
skills improvement, reading,
vocabulary, peer counseling and
tutoring, as well as methods of
tackling term papers and theses.
According to LAC director
Michael McHargue, "Stanford
students are so bright they ha
ven't had to develop effective
learning skills. They have
achieved high marks without
such instruction."
He explains that poor learning
skills develop because most stu
dents have had no formal in
struction in reading since
elementary school.
The challenges present in the
environment here — peer pres
sure, competition for admission
to graduate and professional
schools and personal expecta
tions formed in high school —
have led students to the realiza
tion that efficiency will be what
distinguishes them from other
students of equal intelligence.
Besides offering the learning
skills improvement classes, LAC
was instrumental in developing
departmental tutoring programs
such as the Physics Reference
Frame, the Chemistry Informa
tion Room and the Math Con
sulting Center.
Individual tutoring is handled
by undergraduates who enroll in
the tutor training course and
earn credit for both their train
ing and the tutoring services.
In 1974, LAC received a grant
of $6000 from the Exxon Educa
tion Foundation to plan, de
velop and evaluate a peer coun
seling program aimed at improv
ing study skills.
The peer counselors them
selves must take the LAC-1 "Ef
fective Learning Skills" class to
reinforce their knowledge of
learning skills. After viewing the
success of the LAC peer counsel
ing program, former Under

graduate Studies Dean lames
Cibbs allowed LAC to become
the accrediting agency for all
campus peer counseling prog
rams.
The LAC program was the sub
ject of a Time article two years
ago, and was labeled a "reme
dial program for the bright."
McHargue takes a slightly diffe

rent approach, wanting to
"make it clear that people don't
have to get into an academic jam
in order to use our services.
Stanford students have a lot of
difficulty accepting help — but
everyone including graduate
students and faculty use our
program."
The techniques of the LAC

seem to be effective. McHargue
reports that after taking one or
more LAC courses, grades, units
completed, and academic read
ing rates all improve.
The Learning Assistance
Center is located in Meyer 123.
