IMPORTANT ADVANCE
IN OFFICE TYPEWRITERS
FINALLY COMES HOME.
Several years ago, an
interchangeable typing ball
like the one you see above
revolutionized office typing.
It made it possible to
change type styles in seconds.
And made all other
typewriters obsolete.
And now, at long last,
Olivetti is bringing this revo
lution into the American
home.
The Olivetti Lexikon
82 and the more deluxe
Lexikon 83. The most ad
vanced electric portable typewriters in the world.
Now, for the first time, you can select the
typeface that most clearly expresses what you are try
ing to say (type styles are available in ten different
faces, including script).
Simply pop one ball out and another in, and a
love letter doesn't have to resemble a letter to the
electric company. Any more than homework has to
look like poetry.
And because the typing ball remains stationary,
it's not subject to the whims of flying keys. And you're
spared the nuisance of flying capitals, uneven lines
and jamming keys.
Of course, the ball alone does not make this the
world's most advanced portable typewriter.
Interchangeable ribbon cartridges let you
change the color of the rib
bon instantly;
Mylar film ribbon is
available for those times
when you want to leave a
particularly vivid impression.
And Mario Bellini has
designed the Lexikon 82 with
such absolute grace and
. simplicity, The Museum of
Modern Art recently ac
quired one for its Design
Collection.
But to discover just
how advanced the Olivetti
Lexikon 82 is designed both inside and out, we
suggest you visit your Olivetti dealer (he's in the
Yellow Pages). Or mail in the coupon below for more
information.
Once you get your hands on one, you'll be de
lighted that this revolutionary advance has finally
come home from the office.
