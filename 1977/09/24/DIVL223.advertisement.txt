Check Into Bank of America.
Our College Plan®
is made for students.
Lets begin at the beginning.
The first thing every student needs is a no-nonsense checking
account. And in that category, our College Plan® Checking Account
is pretty tough to beat.
For just $1 a month for the nine-month school year, you get
unlimited checkwriting, with no minimum balance required. There's
no service charge at all for June, July, August, or for any month you
maintain at least a $3OO minimum balance. You get our
Timesaver® Statement every month. And your account stays open
through the summer, even with a zero balance, saving you the
trouble of having to close it at the end of the school year, and re
open it in the fall. Complimentary personalized regular checks are
available, or premium checks may be purchased.
To shed a little more light on the subject, all our branches
also offer an array of free Consumer Information Reports. Includ
ing "A Guide to Checks and Checking', which explains what you
need to know about cashing and depositing checks, holds and stop
payment procedures.
Now, that's not all the bank you'll ever need. And it's certainly
not all the bank we offer. But it does make for a good start.
We also offer a wide variety of other banking services you
might find useful, both in school and after. So why not check in with
us. You may never have to check anywhere else.
Depend on us. More California college students do.
