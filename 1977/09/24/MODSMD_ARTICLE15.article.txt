# Ernie Nevers
## Best Cardinal ever 
### Bill Burger 
Today's game features a spe
cial halftime tribute to the late
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's All-
America fullback in 1924-25.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz will present Never's
widow, Margery, with San
Francisco artist Lowell Her
rero's original portrait of Nev
ers at halftime.
Seventeen of Nevers' Stan
ford teammates will also be in
troduced at halftime and 20,000
Stanford football posters carry
ing a reproduction of the Nev
ers portrait will be distributed
to fans after the game.
Nevers, who died on May 3,
1976 at the age of 73, is thought
of as Stanford's greatest foot
ball player by most of the
game's historians and is rated
by many football experts as
one of the best fullbacks ever
to play the game.
Did it all
As a Stanford star of the
19205, the football era of Jim
Thorpe and Red Grange, Nev
ers was a 60-minute player.
Running, passing and kicking
on offense and playing
linebacker on the defensive
squad, Nevers was the com
plete athlete. But it was at

fullback that Nevers' talent
brought the big blond All-
American status.
Stanford's football teams the
three years Nevers started at
fullback —1923,1924 and 1925
compiled a 28-5-1 record
under coach Pop Warner.
Warner, who had previously
coached Thorpe, called Nevers
the greatest football player he
ever coached.
"Nevers could do everything
Thorpe could do," Warner
said, "and Ernie always tried
harder. Ernie gave 60 minutes
of himself in every game."
jock of all trades
Nevers also played baseball
and basketball while at Stan
ford and pitched for three years
with the St. Louis Browns of the
American League, giving up
two of Babe Ruth's 60 home
runs in 1927.
The 6-foot, 205-pound
bruiser fared much better in
the professional football ranks,
however, scoring an NFL re
cord 40 points in a single game*
in the 1929 season. Playing for
the Chicago Cardinals, Nevers
scored every point in the Car
dinals'4o-6 rout of the Chicago
Bears.
The grid immortal was one of
the first players admitted to
both the college and profes
sional football Halls of Fame
and in 1969 was selected to the
Football Writer's Association
of America's all-time college
football team.
The Minnesota native's
greatest moment in a Stanford
uniform came in the 1925 Rose
Bowl when Stanford played the
Fighting Irish of Notre Dame

and a team that boasted the
legendary "Four Horsemen."
Notre Dame had never ac
cepted a bowl invitation (and
did not do so again for nearly
50 years) but the 1924 team,
undefeated with its celebrated
backfield, was destined to be
among the most heralded ele
vens in South Bend football
annals.
The team's play and Grant
land Rice's "Four Horsemen"
prose had fired the imagina
tion of the American public
and Notre Dame presented the
biggest box office draw in the
game.
Although Notre Dame de
feated the Cardinals, 27-10,
Nevers carried the ball 34 times
for 114 yards and earned the
game's most valuable player
award. The amazing fact is that
Nevers was playing on two
heavily taped ankles taped
as a result of two broken ankles
he had suffered during the
regular season. Teammates re
portedly had to help Nevers to
nis feet after some plays.
But only on the scoreboard
did Stanford fail to dominate
the Irish as Nevers and crew
led in total yardage, 298 yards
to 179; on first downs, 17 to 7,
and in completed passes, 11 to
3.
It seems no wonder to Stan
ford students and football fans
of today then that Nevers'
numeral 1 jersey was retired at
the end of his college football
career by an act of the Universi
ty's student body which
wanted to insure that no Stan
ford player ever again wore
No. 1.
