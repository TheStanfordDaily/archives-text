# An "Incomparable" salute
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following is a
summary of today's program by
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band, pre
pared for the Daily by a special
committee of the Band, which
is responsible for its content.
With summer at an end, and
professors reaping royalties
from textbook sales, the Stan
ford Band once again emerges
from the campus low-life this
week to welcome entering
freshmen to little Leland's
Playground of Pleasure. Pick
ing up where freshman orien
tation left off, we call this
week's pregame show "Survi
val at Stanford: Things your
Adviser Wouldn't Tell You."
Using their famous precision
marching techniques, the
Band assumes the "Fanfare"
position (No. 143 in your Kama
Sutra book), then forms the
traditional axe, symbol of Dean
Hargadon's admission
policies, and invites everyone

to "Come Join the Band."
Next, the Band warns the
freshman male about that in
valuable resource, the Stan
ford female, with the advice,
"Unless your key is the right
size, you're doomed to the
'Roundabout.' "

The razor-sharp minds of
Stanford students are con
stantly seeking new forms of
mental stimulation. The
LSJUMB now "lines up" to mir
ror what many students already
imbibe in to satisfy their
"higher" needs. With a deep
breath the Band musically sa
lutes the "Snow Queen."
Realizing that hundreds of
disgusted alums have already
begun writing hate mail, the
LSJUMB turns the other cheek,
playing "Sons of Stanford Red"
in preparation for Arthur P.
Barnes' famed arrangement of
"The Star Spangled Banner."
American Government, bas
tion of democracy and political

scandal, in conjunction with
the Colombian Department of
Agriculture has provided the
inspiration for this week's
half-time show "Bert Bites the
Big One."
Gathering its remaining 48
brain cells, the Band quickly
falls into their first formation
spelling out our victim's name,
who, after his resignation is
now a "Lonely Boy."
The LSJUMB amazingly finds
its way into the next formation
to salute the Director of the Of
fice of Management and
Budget, or more appropriately,
what is left after Lance's de
mise, to the strains of "This
Time It's Real."
Bert's own brand of over
draft protection could very
well be the banking practice of
millions. Seeking new ways of
financing the Band's beer bill,
the LSJUMB forms a rubber
check while requesting Lance
to "Show Me the Way."

Questioned before the Se
nate Subcommittee, it was
suggested Lance might be en
gaging in monetary practices
which overextended his cre
dibility rating, stretching his
checkbook "Just Enough and

Too Far."
And what about Bert's best
friend? Yes, Jimmy ate it too.
Despite his efforts to keep it
up, Carter's Lance went limp
when Bert said "It's Over."
