# Rude guests
## Illini invited to home premiere 
### David Georgette 
Home at last!
The Stanford football home
opener the last few seasons has
always been greeted with a
sigh of relief by the players and
coaches, and this year's no dif
ferent.
The reason the home opener
has been welcomed is because
in the last two seasons, Stan
ford managed only a 19-19 tie
with Michigan in 1975 while
dropping all its other road
games prior to the home pre
miere.
While new head football
coach Bill Walsh has already
improved on that record with
last week's 21-17 win atTulane,
he is also glad to finally be get
ting back to the usuallyfriendly
confines of Stanford Stadium

for today's game against Il
linois.
"It'll just be good not getting
on the plane and traveling 1000
or 2000 miles," said Walsh.
A look at the past, though,
will show the Fighting lllini are
not the most cooperative
guests to ask to a home debut.
In 1974, then-freshman Car
dinal quarterback Guy Benja
min got his first start against
Illinois. Trailing at half, Benja
min was benched by former
coach Jack Christiansen in
favor of Mike Cordova. Benja
min was 11 of 15 when taken
out. The lllini routed the
Cards, 41-7.

With Cordova and Christian
sen now in pro football, Ben
jamin finally has the whole

show to himself. And in
Walsh's pro style offense, Ben
jamin, the top percentage pas
ser in the school's history, has
connected on 65 per cent of his
attempts this year for 457 yards
and four touchdowns.
"Guy really hasn't had a
great game yet," said Walsh.
"He's played well, but not up
to his own expectations or
ours. He's due for a truly out
standing performance very
soon.
"I hope we open up more on
offense," said Walsh. "We had
to start slow since we had a
new coaching staff and a new
system." But the Cards won't
pull out all the stops. "Those
things we can do best we'll
utilize," he said.
Illinois also had a slow start,
getting ripped by Michigan in
its opener 37-9 and then
squeezing by Missouri last
week, 11-7. Illinois has a new
coach, too Gary Moeller,
who worked with Bo Schem
bechler at Michigan for eight
years.

"Illinois is a typical Big Ten
power," said Walsh. "They're a
strong, physical team with
depth at most positions. In the
preseason, they were rated
third behind Michigan and
Ohio State."
The eight years with Schem
bechler have made themselves
apparent in Moeller's em
phasis on defense. "The de
fense appears to be the strong
point of the team," Walsh said.
"Coach Moeller is a defensive

genius. He will make our job
very difficult."
The lllini running game
could find the Stanford de
fense to its liking, since the
Cards have given up an average
of 255 yards per game on the
ground. But Walsh has seen
improved play in the defense
and praised the play of middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino,
who has 43 tackles thus far, as
well as some of the younger
players.
