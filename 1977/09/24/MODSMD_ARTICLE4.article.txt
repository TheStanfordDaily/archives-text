# Freshman phenom lights 'em up
## Nelson bursts onto scene 
### Jay Roach 
Before you read on, listen for
a moment to the spectators'
conversations around you.
If you didn't hear anyone
talking about some new Card
halfback with lightning-quick
feet, be surprised. The word is
out, and it's moving almost as
quickly as he does: Stanford
finally has one of those
"natural" running backs
naturally fast, naturally quick,
naturally strong and naturally
fun to watch.
As an old alumnus said while
watching practice one day, "At
last Stanford has what
everyone who's been beating
us has had."
California had Chuck Mun
cie, USC had Ricky Bell, UCLA
has Theotis Brown . . . and
now Stanford has Darrin Nel
son.
Three weeks before Nelson
played his first college game in
Colorado against the CU Buf
falos, he was listed as the No. 5
halfback on coach Bill Walsh's
depth chart. Two weeks later
he had run his way into a start
ing position and two weeks
after that he was Stanford's
leading runner (149 yards in 22
carries), receiver (12 catches
for 154 yards and two TDs) and
scorer (with 12 points).
Unregistered weapon
And, notably enough, Darrin
Nelson won't even register for
his first year of college until
Monday. Know what that
means? It means this: FOUR
MORE YEARS.
That's right. At 5-foot-9 and
170 pounds, Nelson is solid
freshman. Rejoice.
After you see him run, the
adjective 'solid' may not seem
accurate. Nelson is, as 'solid'
defenseman Gordy Ceresino
says, "extremely fluid." Gordy
knows.
He has practiced against him
and he was in Boulder when
Nelson 'flowed' (spurted?)
over the Buffaloes' artificial
turf for 99 yards on the ground,
and that doesn't include 56
yards covered after he took a
Guy Benjamin screen pass and
raced downfield for his first
collegiate touchdown.

"No longer," Guy Benjamin
says, "can opponents leave
only three or four guys for the
running game and focus on our
receivers like USC did to us last
year."
A Guy's best friend
That, and Nelson's handy re
ceiving abilities, makes Benja
min's job a lot easier.
To protect against
impressive-fact overload in
your pre-game conversation,
discuss for a minute what it's

like being a surprise freshman
star from St. Piux X High School
in Los Angeles on a team with a
new coaching staff, a new sys
tem and lots of big up
perclassmen.
Nelson says it has been fun.
Already, he's soaked up a lot of
kidding about his relatively
diminutive stature. Nelson's
backfield comrade Phil Francis
began calling him "Junior" in
early pre-season meetings
after mistaking him for coach

Denny Green's son. He's rarely
been called by his right name
around teammates ever since.
The fact that Walsh's systems
were new to all Stanford's
players this year partially
closed the gap between the
experienced and the inexperi
enced players.
"I feel like I really got a break
coming in under a new sys
tem," Nelson admits. "They
taught all of us pretty carefully,
so I at least had a shot at start
ing." A good shot.
Nelson had little trouble
gaining the respect of his up
perclassmen teammates, but
as Francis explained, "Junior
and all the freshmen were
more readily accepted than in
the past."
Francis adds that a tradition
supported by past coaches cal
led the "Rookie Show Night,"
in which all the freshmen
players were put on a stage and

forced to "perform" for the
upperclassmen during pre
season training camp, was
eliminated this fall.
According to Nelson, play
ing at Stanford isn't much dif
ferent from playing high
school ball, except for one
thing: people are bigger in col
lege.
Hide and go seek
About running behind big
ger offensive linemen, he says,
"I like it because I can hide be
hind them."
But about blocking the larger
strain of defensive players he
admits: "That bothers me.
Some times I can cut them out
and sometimes I just try to get
in their way."
When Nelson gets the ball,
he looks like some weightless
space shuttle-craft, with retro
rockets powerful enough to
send him in any direction, at

full speed, at any moment.
He can get from zero to top
end (4.5 in the4o) in two steps,
and back to zero in an instant,
only to dart off in another di
rection. He leans far forward
when he runs, and as coach
Green says, "he can cut at full
speed" with just a tip of a
shoulder.
"I wait for a defender to run
up to me and then I try to make
him have to stop," Nelson exp
lains. "If he does, I know I'll get
around him."
"I think you could put him
on broken field with three
players, and he'd always get
away," Ceresino says.
Though Nelson's abilities
snuck up on some here at Stan
ford, including a few up
perclassmen competing for his
position, coach Green says he
wasn't surprised. After all, as
an All-CIF back in Los Angeles
Nelson scampered for 1667
yards and 19 touchdowns.
Needn't be Einstein
After receiver coach Rod
Dowhower spotted Nelson in
L.A., and brought up some
films, "You didn't have to be a
genius to see he was good."
Green says now.
You didn't have to be from
Stanford to see that, either.
UCLA and both Oregon
schools, among others, saw it
too, but the recruiting efforts
of Walsh's staff paid off.
"I didn't want to wait two
years to play," Nelson exp
lains, referring to UCLA's cur
rent abundance of standout

running backs. "Coach Walsh
told me we'd be running more
than they had before and he
said I had a chance to play." He
adds, "Besides, they (Walsh's
staff) seemed to be thinking
about my education."
Who's on first?
Academics are important to
Nelson. Asked about his
priorities in that regard, he was
emphatic: "Football doesn't
come first." He didn't say,
specifically, what does, but he
is considering majoring in
marine biology or psychology.
One thing he says he will
shoot for is the honor of be
coming the first Stanford run
ner to gain 1000 yards in a
single season. Stanford has
never had one, although Ray
Handly got close in 1964 with
963 yards.
"If I go away from here with
that, I'll know I've done some
thing. I'd like to do it all four
years."
That, fellow spectators, gives
us all something to talk about.

That, and Nelson's handy re
ceiving abilities, makes Benja
min's job a lot easier.
To protect against
impressive-fact overload in
your pre-game conversation,
discuss for a minute what it's

like being a surprise freshman
star from St. Piux X High School
in Los Angeles on a team with a
new coaching staff, a new sys
tem and lots of big up
perclassmen.
Nelson says it has been fun.
Already, he's soaked up a lot of
kidding about his relatively
diminutive stature. Nelson's
backfield comrade Phil Francis
began calling him "Junior" in
early pre-season meetings
after mistaking him for coach

Denny Green's son. He's rarely
been called by his right name
around teammates ever since.
The fact that Walsh's systems
were new to all Stanford's
players this year partially
closed the gap between the
experienced and the inexperi
enced players.
"I feel like I really got a break
coming in under a new sys
tem," Nelson admits. "They
taught all of us pretty carefully,
so I at least had a shot at start
ing." A good shot.
Nelson had little trouble
gaining the respect of his up
perclassmen teammates, but
as Francis explained, "Junior
and all the freshmen were
more readily accepted than in
the past."
Francis adds that a tradition
supported by past coaches cal
led the "Rookie Show Night,"
in which all the freshmen
players were put on a stage and

forced to "perform" for the
upperclassmen during pre
season training camp, was
eliminated this fall.
According to Nelson, play
ing at Stanford isn't much dif
ferent from playing high
school ball, except for one
thing: people are bigger in col
lege.
Hide and go seek
About running behind big
ger offensive linemen, he says,
"I like it because I can hide be
hind them."
But about blocking the larger
strain of defensive players he
admits: "That bothers me.
Some times I can cut them out
and sometimes I just try to get
in their way."
When Nelson gets the ball,
he looks like some weightless
space shuttle-craft, with retro
rockets powerful enough to
send him in any direction, at

full speed, at any moment.
He can get from zero to top
end (4.5 in the4o) in two steps,
and back to zero in an instant,
only to dart off in another di
rection. He leans far forward
when he runs, and as coach
Green says, "he can cut at full
speed" with just a tip of a
shoulder.
"I wait for a defender to run
up to me and then I try to make
him have to stop," Nelson exp
lains. "If he does, I know I'll get
around him."
"I think you could put him
on broken field with three
players, and he'd always get
away," Ceresino says.
Though Nelson's abilities
snuck up on some here at Stan
ford, including a few up
perclassmen competing for his
position, coach Green says he
wasn't surprised. After all, as
an All-CIF back in Los Angeles
Nelson scampered for 1667
yards and 19 touchdowns.
Needn't be Einstein
After receiver coach Rod
Dowhower spotted Nelson in
L.A., and brought up some
films, "You didn't have to be a
genius to see he was good."
Green says now.
You didn't have to be from
Stanford to see that, either.
UCLA and both Oregon
schools, among others, saw it
too, but the recruiting efforts
of Walsh's staff paid off.
"I didn't want to wait two
years to play," Nelson exp
lains, referring to UCLA's cur
rent abundance of standout

running backs. "Coach Walsh
told me we'd be running more
than they had before and he
said I had a chance to play." He
adds, "Besides, they (Walsh's
staff) seemed to be thinking
about my education."
Who's on first?
Academics are important to
Nelson. Asked about his
priorities in that regard, he was
emphatic: "Football doesn't
come first." He didn't say,
specifically, what does, but he
is considering majoring in
marine biology or psychology.
One thing he says he will
shoot for is the honor of be
coming the first Stanford run
ner to gain 1000 yards in a
single season. Stanford has
never had one, although Ray
Handly got close in 1964 with
963 yards.
"If I go away from here with
that, I'll know I've done some
thing. I'd like to do it all four
years."
That, fellow spectators, gives
us all something to talk about.
Before you read on, listen for
a moment to the spectators'
conversations around you.
If you didn't hear anyone
talking about some new Card
halfback with lightning-quick
feet, be surprised. The word is
out, and it's moving almost as
quickly as he does: Stanford
finally has one of those
"natural" running backs
naturally fast, naturally quick,
naturally strong and naturally
fun to watch.
As an old alumnus said while
watching practice one day, "At
last Stanford has what
everyone who's been beating
us has had."
California had Chuck Mun
cie, USC had Ricky Bell, UCLA
has Theotis Brown . . . and
now Stanford has Darrin Nel
son.
Three weeks before Nelson
played his first college game in
Colorado against the CU Buf
falos, he was listed as the No. 5
halfback on coach Bill Walsh's
depth chart. Two weeks later
he had run his way into a start
ing position and two weeks
after that he was Stanford's
leading runner (149 yards in 22
carries), receiver (12 catches
for 154 yards and two TDs) and
scorer (with 12 points).
Unregistered weapon
And, notably enough, Darrin
Nelson won't even register for
his first year of college until
Monday. Know what that
means? It means this: FOUR
MORE YEARS.
That's right. At 5-foot-9 and
170 pounds, Nelson is solid
freshman. Rejoice.
After you see him run, the
adjective 'solid' may not seem
accurate. Nelson is, as 'solid'
defenseman Gordy Ceresino
says, "extremely fluid." Gordy
knows.
He has practiced against him
and he was in Boulder when
Nelson 'flowed' (spurted?)
over the Buffaloes' artificial
turf for 99 yards on the ground,
and that doesn't include 56
yards covered after he took a
Guy Benjamin screen pass and
raced downfield for his first
collegiate touchdown.

"No longer," Guy Benjamin
says, "can opponents leave
only three or four guys for the
running game and focus on our
receivers like USC did to us last
year."

full speed, at any moment.
He can get from zero to top
end (4.5 in the4o) in two steps,
and back to zero in an instant,
only to dart off in another di
rection. He leans far forward
when he runs, and as coach
Green says, "he can cut at full
speed" with just a tip of a
shoulder.
"I wait for a defender to run
up to me and then I try to make
him have to stop," Nelson exp
lains. "If he does, I know I'll get
around him."
"I think you could put him
on broken field with three
players, and he'd always get
away," Ceresino says.
Though Nelson's abilities
snuck up on some here at Stan
ford, including a few up
perclassmen competing for his
position, coach Green says he
wasn't surprised. After all, as
an All-CIF back in Los Angeles
Nelson scampered for 1667
yards and 19 touchdowns.
Needn't be Einstein
After receiver coach Rod
Dowhower spotted Nelson in
L.A., and brought up some
films, "You didn't have to be a
genius to see he was good."
Green says now.
You didn't have to be from
Stanford to see that, either.
UCLA and both Oregon
schools, among others, saw it
too, but the recruiting efforts
of Walsh's staff paid off.
"I didn't want to wait two
years to play," Nelson exp
lains, referring to UCLA's cur
rent abundance of standout

running backs. "Coach Walsh
told me we'd be running more
than they had before and he
said I had a chance to play." He
adds, "Besides, they (Walsh's
staff) seemed to be thinking
about my education."
Who's on first?
Academics are important to
Nelson. Asked about his
priorities in that regard, he was
emphatic: "Football doesn't
come first." He didn't say,
specifically, what does, but he
is considering majoring in
marine biology or psychology.
One thing he says he will
shoot for is the honor of be
coming the first Stanford run
ner to gain 1000 yards in a
single season. Stanford has
never had one, although Ray
Handly got close in 1964 with
963 yards.
"If I go away from here with
that, I'll know I've done some
thing. I'd like to do it all four
years."
That, fellow spectators, gives
us all something to talk about.
Before you read on, listen for
a moment to the spectators'
conversations around you.
If you didn't hear anyone
talking about some new Card
halfback with lightning-quick
feet, be surprised. The word is
out, and it's moving almost as
quickly as he does: Stanford
finally has one of those
"natural" running backs
naturally fast, naturally quick,
naturally strong and naturally
fun to watch.
As an old alumnus said while
watching practice one day, "At
last Stanford has what
everyone who's been beating
us has had."
California had Chuck Mun
cie, USC had Ricky Bell, UCLA
has Theotis Brown . . . and
now Stanford has Darrin Nel
son.
Three weeks before Nelson
played his first college game in
Colorado against the CU Buf
falos, he was listed as the No. 5
halfback on coach Bill Walsh's
depth chart. Two weeks later
he had run his way into a start
ing position and two weeks
after that he was Stanford's
leading runner (149 yards in 22
carries), receiver (12 catches
for 154 yards and two TDs) and
scorer (with 12 points).
Unregistered weapon
And, notably enough, Darrin
Nelson won't even register for
his first year of college until
Monday. Know what that
means? It means this: FOUR
MORE YEARS.
That's right. At 5-foot-9 and
170 pounds, Nelson is solid
freshman. Rejoice.
After you see him run, the
adjective 'solid' may not seem
accurate. Nelson is, as 'solid'
defenseman Gordy Ceresino
says, "extremely fluid." Gordy
knows.
He has practiced against him
and he was in Boulder when
Nelson 'flowed' (spurted?)
over the Buffaloes' artificial
turf for 99 yards on the ground,
and that doesn't include 56
yards covered after he took a
Guy Benjamin screen pass and
raced downfield for his first
collegiate touchdown.

"No longer," Guy Benjamin
says, "can opponents leave
only three or four guys for the
running game and focus on our
receivers like USC did to us last
year."
A Guy's best friend
That, and Nelson's handy re
ceiving abilities, makes Benja
min's job a lot easier.
To protect against
impressive-fact overload in
your pre-game conversation,
discuss for a minute what it's

like being a surprise freshman
star from St. Piux X High School
in Los Angeles on a team with a
new coaching staff, a new sys
tem and lots of big up
perclassmen.
Nelson says it has been fun.
Already, he's soaked up a lot of
kidding about his relatively
diminutive stature. Nelson's
backfield comrade Phil Francis
began calling him "Junior" in
early pre-season meetings
after mistaking him for coach

Denny Green's son. He's rarely
been called by his right name
around teammates ever since.
The fact that Walsh's systems
were new to all Stanford's
players this year partially
closed the gap between the
experienced and the inexperi
enced players.
"I feel like I really got a break
coming in under a new sys
tem," Nelson admits. "They
taught all of us pretty carefully,
so I at least had a shot at start
ing." A good shot.
Nelson had little trouble
gaining the respect of his up
perclassmen teammates, but
as Francis explained, "Junior
and all the freshmen were
more readily accepted than in
the past."
Francis adds that a tradition
supported by past coaches cal
led the "Rookie Show Night,"
in which all the freshmen
players were put on a stage and

forced to "perform" for the
upperclassmen during pre
season training camp, was
eliminated this fall.
According to Nelson, play
ing at Stanford isn't much dif
ferent from playing high
school ball, except for one
thing: people are bigger in col
lege.
Hide and go seek
About running behind big
ger offensive linemen, he says,
"I like it because I can hide be
hind them."
But about blocking the larger
strain of defensive players he
admits: "That bothers me.
Some times I can cut them out
and sometimes I just try to get
in their way."

Academics are important to
Nelson. Asked about his
priorities in that regard, he was
emphatic: "Football doesn't
come first." He didn't say,
specifically, what does, but he
is considering majoring in
marine biology or psychology.
One thing he says he will
shoot for is the honor of be
coming the first Stanford run
ner to gain 1000 yards in a
single season. Stanford has
never had one, although Ray
Handly got close in 1964 with
963 yards.
"If I go away from here with
that, I'll know I've done some
thing. I'd like to do it all four
years."
That, fellow spectators, gives
us all something to talk about.
