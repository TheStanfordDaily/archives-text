# Cards halted by rambling Buffaloes...
## Stanford opportunities squandered 
### Bruce Anderson 
BOULDER, Colo. Any
pain felt from Stanford's open
ing season loss to nationally
ranked Colorado was mollified
by the performance of frosh
running phenom Darrin Nel
son who ran spinning and
dancing all the while as well
as any Cardinal back has in
more years than anyone re
members.
A second-half Stanford rally
fell short and the Cards failed

in a bid to give Bill Walsh a vic
tory in his debut as head coach.
But Stanford fans from
band members to gray-haired
alums were buzzing about
Nelson, not the loss, after the
27-21 defeat to the Buffaloes.
"Nobody down here (at the
Stanford rooting section)
knows who he is," Stanford
band manager Rich Johnson
said. "We're saying, 'Shit,
where did we get this guy?' "
The fleet halfback from Pius

X High School in Los Angeles
carried the ball 15 times for 99
yards and added 77 yards on
four receptions in his first col
legiate contest. Nelson dis
played steps and moves that
Fred Astaire never dreamed of
while making believers of Stan
ford fans and the Colorado de
fense.
Two-pronged attack
The Cardinal offense was
expected to speak in its usual
monotone this season: pass.
But Nelson and fullbacks Billy
Anderson and John Finley pro
vided the Stanford attack with a
weapon that will complement
the explosive aerial game di
rected by Guy Benjamin.
It appeared early in the game
that Nelson and the rest of the

Stanford running corps might
not get a chance to show its
mettle. The Cardinals started
the game with a Benjamin
blitzkrieg, passing on the first
five downs.
"Our approach was to force
them to account for the for
ward pass," Walsh said. "We
based our running attack on
the approach they used to stop
the pass."
Two of the opening passes
found wide receiver Bill Kellar,
first for 12 yards and later for
17. Kellar's second reception
set up a 51-yard field goal at
tempt. A bad snap, however,
forced holder Steve Dils to at
tempt a pass. The pass was in
complete and Stanford failed
to get on the scoreboard first.

The botched field goal at
tempt was just the first of sev
eral Stanford failures to
capitalize on scoring oppor
tunities in the first half.
A pass dropped by Kellar on
fourth down and a Gary Lynn
fumble stymied the only other
Stanford drives into Buffalo
territory during the first stanza.
Colorado, on the other
hand, mixed a well-executed
option ground attack with a
surprisingly accurate passing
game to score a touchdown
and two field goals and take a
13-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime.

ford defense off balance
throughout the game. The
6-foot-2 junior showed an even
more magical touch directing
the passing game as he hit 16 of
25 aerials for 232 yards. It was
the fifth most passing yardage
ever amassed by a Buffalo
quarterback in a single game.
One of Knapple's favorite
targets was tight end Bob
Niziolek who grabbed four
passes, the first a three-yard
play-action pass from Knapple
which found the 6-foot-7
sophomore alone in the back
of the end zone for the first
score of the game.
Balanced trade
In the second half the Cards
and the Buffs traded
touchdowns. Finley capped a
66-yard Stanford drive with a
one-yard plunge over the left
side and Colorado fullback
James Mayberry_answered with
a seven-yard scoring ramble.
On Stanford's next posses
sion, Benjamin sent Anderson
on the run and pinpointed
short passes in the flat to his
backs.
Then the talented Stanford
quarterback slung a 25-yard
strike to Mitch Pleis. One play
later, Benjamin hit Kellar with a
TD pass on the right edge of
the end zone.
The Buffaloes took the Stan
ford kickoff intent on scoring.
But tailback Mike Kozlowski
fumbled a short Knapple pass
and defensive end Dean Wil
son curled around the loose

ball to give the Cards a chance
to capture the lead.
Battle plans
Mixing its plays well, the
Stanford offense picked its way
through the Colorado defense
until the Cards had second and
six from the Buff 10 yard line.
Stanford called timeout and
Benjamin conferred with
Walsh.
- Anticipating a blitz, Walsh
called a pass play where three
receivers flood the same side
and the blitz leaves one re
ceiver open. Colorado blitzed
and fullback Finley was unco
vered but Benjamin instead
threw for Nelson and
linebacker Brian Cabral inter
cepted the pass and the
game.
Colorado roared down the
field and Mayberry took it in

standing up from 17 yards out
to give the Buffaloes a 27-14
lead with 4:20 remaining in the
game.
On the second play of the
ensuing drive, Benjamin
flicked a screen pass to Nelson
on the left side. After spinning
by one defender, Nelson
showed his 9.6 speed and
raced to the end zone with a
56-yard touchdown.
"I had a lot of confidence on
my ability to score on that
play," Nelson said. "I knew if
James (Lofton) got in front of
his man I could break one way
or the other and score."
Last chance
The Stanford defense shut
down the Buffaloes and the
Cardinals got the ball for a last
time with 2:13 remaining. The
Cards, however, were unable
to gain a first down as Nelson
fumbled on fourth down.
After the game, Colorado
coach Bill Mallory said, "Ben
jamin is the finest quarterback
I've ever faced as a coach."
Benjamin connected on 20
of 34 passes for 258 yards and
one touchdown.
Benjamin credited Colorado
with an effective pass rush but
said that Stanford's success
with the run eliminated much
of the pressure he faced early
in the game.
Nelson and company are
certain to aid the passing game
with their rushing exploits in
games later this season as the
freshman halfback becomes a
seasoned rookie.

ensuing drive, Benjamin
flicked a screen pass to Nelson
on the left side. After spinning
by one defender, Nelson
showed his 9.6 speed and
raced to the end zone with a
56-yard touchdown.
"I had a lot of confidence on
my ability to score on that
play," Nelson said. "I knew if
James (Lofton) got in front of
his man I could break one way
or the other and score."
Last chance
The Stanford defense shut
down the Buffaloes and the
Cardinals got the ball for a last
time with 2:13 remaining. The
Cards, however, were unable
to gain a first down as Nelson
fumbled on fourth down.
After the game, Colorado
coach Bill Mallory said, "Ben
jamin is the finest quarterback
I've ever faced as a coach."
Benjamin connected on 20
of 34 passes for 258 yards and
one touchdown.
Benjamin credited Colorado
with an effective pass rush but
said that Stanford's success
with the run eliminated much
of the pressure he faced early
in the game.
Nelson and company are
certain to aid the passing game
with their rushing exploits in
games later this season as the
freshman halfback becomes a
seasoned rookie.
BOULDER, Colo. Any
pain felt from Stanford's open
ing season loss to nationally
ranked Colorado was mollified
by the performance of frosh
running phenom Darrin Nel
son who ran spinning and
dancing all the while as well
as any Cardinal back has in
more years than anyone re
members.
A second-half Stanford rally
fell short and the Cards failed

in a bid to give Bill Walsh a vic
tory in his debut as head coach.
But Stanford fans from
band members to gray-haired
alums were buzzing about
Nelson, not the loss, after the
27-21 defeat to the Buffaloes.
"Nobody down here (at the
Stanford rooting section)
knows who he is," Stanford
band manager Rich Johnson
said. "We're saying, 'Shit,
where did we get this guy?' "
The fleet halfback from Pius

X High School in Los Angeles
carried the ball 15 times for 99
yards and added 77 yards on
four receptions in his first col
legiate contest. Nelson dis
played steps and moves that
Fred Astaire never dreamed of
while making believers of Stan
ford fans and the Colorado de
fense.
Two-pronged attack
The Cardinal offense was
expected to speak in its usual
monotone this season: pass.
But Nelson and fullbacks Billy
Anderson and John Finley pro
vided the Stanford attack with a
weapon that will complement
the explosive aerial game di
rected by Guy Benjamin.
It appeared early in the game
that Nelson and the rest of the

Stanford running corps might
not get a chance to show its
mettle. The Cardinals started
the game with a Benjamin
blitzkrieg, passing on the first
five downs.
"Our approach was to force
them to account for the for
ward pass," Walsh said. "We
based our running attack on
the approach they used to stop
the pass."
Two of the opening passes
found wide receiver Bill Kellar,
first for 12 yards and later for
17. Kellar's second reception
set up a 51-yard field goal at
tempt. A bad snap, however,
forced holder Steve Dils to at
tempt a pass. The pass was in
complete and Stanford failed
to get on the scoreboard first.

The botched field goal at
tempt was just the first of sev
eral Stanford failures to
capitalize on scoring oppor
tunities in the first half.
A pass dropped by Kellar on
fourth down and a Gary Lynn
fumble stymied the only other
Stanford drives into Buffalo
territory during the first stanza.
Colorado, on the other
hand, mixed a well-executed
option ground attack with a
surprisingly accurate passing
game to score a touchdown
and two field goals and take a
13-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime.

6-foot-2 junior showed an even
more magical touch directing
the passing game as he hit 16 of
25 aerials for 232 yards. It was
the fifth most passing yardage
ever amassed by a Buffalo
quarterback in a single game.
One of Knapple's favorite
targets was tight end Bob
Niziolek who grabbed four
passes, the first a three-yard
play-action pass from Knapple
which found the 6-foot-7
sophomore alone in the back
of the end zone for the first
score of the game.
Balanced trade
In the second half the Cards
and the Buffs traded
touchdowns. Finley capped a
66-yard Stanford drive with a
one-yard plunge over the left
side and Colorado fullback
James Mayberry_answered with
a seven-yard scoring ramble.
On Stanford's next posses
sion, Benjamin sent Anderson
on the run and pinpointed
short passes in the flat to his
backs.
Then the talented Stanford
quarterback slung a 25-yard
strike to Mitch Pleis. One play
later, Benjamin hit Kellar with a
TD pass on the right edge of
the end zone.
The Buffaloes took the Stan
ford kickoff intent on scoring.
But tailback Mike Kozlowski
fumbled a short Knapple pass
and defensive end Dean Wil
son curled around the loose

ball to give the Cards a chance
to capture the lead.

Mixing its plays well, the
Stanford offense picked its way
through the Colorado defense
until the Cards had second and

Stanford called timeout and
Benjamin conferred with
Walsh.
- Anticipating a blitz, Walsh
called a pass play where three
receivers flood the same side
and the blitz leaves one re

and fullback Finley was unco
vered but Benjamin instead
threw for Nelson and
linebacker Brian Cabral inter
cepted the pass and the
game.
Colorado roared down the
field and Mayberry took it in

standing up from 17 yards out
to give the Buffaloes a 27-14

quarterback slung a 25-yard
strike to Mitch Pleis. One play
later, Benjamin hit Kellar with a
TD pass on the right edge of
the end zone.
The Buffaloes took the Stan
ford kickoff intent on scoring.
But tailback Mike Kozlowski
fumbled a short Knapple pass
and defensive end Dean Wil
son curled around the loose

ball to give the Cards a chance
to capture the lead.
Battle plans
Mixing its plays well, the
Stanford offense picked its way
through the Colorado defense
until the Cards had second and
six from the Buff 10 yard line.
Stanford called timeout and
Benjamin conferred with
Walsh.
- Anticipating a blitz, Walsh
called a pass play where three
receivers flood the same side
and the blitz leaves one re
ceiver open. Colorado blitzed
and fullback Finley was unco
vered but Benjamin instead
threw for Nelson and
linebacker Brian Cabral inter
cepted the pass and the
game.
Colorado roared down the
field and Mayberry took it in

standing up from 17 yards out
to give the Buffaloes a 27-14
lead with 4:20 remaining in the
game.
On the second play of the
ensuing drive, Benjamin
flicked a screen pass to Nelson
on the left side. After spinning
by one defender, Nelson
showed his 9.6 speed and
raced to the end zone with a
56-yard touchdown.
"I had a lot of confidence on
my ability to score on that
play," Nelson said. "I knew if
James (Lofton) got in front of
his man I could break one way
or the other and score."
Last chance
The Stanford defense shut
down the Buffaloes and the
Cardinals got the ball for a last
time with 2:13 remaining. The
Cards, however, were unable
to gain a first down as Nelson
fumbled on fourth down.
After the game, Colorado
coach Bill Mallory said, "Ben
jamin is the finest quarterback
I've ever faced as a coach."
Benjamin connected on 20
of 34 passes for 258 yards and
one touchdown.
Benjamin credited Colorado
with an effective pass rush but
said that Stanford's success
with the run eliminated much
of the pressure he faced early
in the game.
Nelson and company are
certain to aid the passing game
with their rushing exploits in
games later this season as the
freshman halfback becomes a
seasoned rookie.
BOULDER, Colo. Any
pain felt from Stanford's open
ing season loss to nationally
ranked Colorado was mollified
by the performance of frosh
running phenom Darrin Nel
son who ran spinning and
dancing all the while as well
as any Cardinal back has in
more years than anyone re
members.
A second-half Stanford rally
fell short and the Cards failed

in a bid to give Bill Walsh a vic
tory in his debut as head coach.
But Stanford fans from
band members to gray-haired
alums were buzzing about
Nelson, not the loss, after the
27-21 defeat to the Buffaloes.
"Nobody down here (at the
Stanford rooting section)
knows who he is," Stanford
band manager Rich Johnson
said. "We're saying, 'Shit,
where did we get this guy?' "
The fleet halfback from Pius

X High School in Los Angeles
carried the ball 15 times for 99
yards and added 77 yards on
four receptions in his first col
legiate contest. Nelson dis
played steps and moves that
Fred Astaire never dreamed of
while making believers of Stan
ford fans and the Colorado de
fense.
Two-pronged attack
The Cardinal offense was
expected to speak in its usual
monotone this season: pass.
But Nelson and fullbacks Billy
Anderson and John Finley pro
vided the Stanford attack with a
weapon that will complement
the explosive aerial game di
rected by Guy Benjamin.
It appeared early in the game
that Nelson and the rest of the

Stanford running corps might
not get a chance to show its
mettle. The Cardinals started
the game with a Benjamin
blitzkrieg, passing on the first
five downs.
"Our approach was to force
them to account for the for
ward pass," Walsh said. "We
based our running attack on
the approach they used to stop
the pass."
Two of the opening passes
found wide receiver Bill Kellar,
first for 12 yards and later for
17. Kellar's second reception
set up a 51-yard field goal at
tempt. A bad snap, however,
forced holder Steve Dils to at
tempt a pass. The pass was in
complete and Stanford failed
to get on the scoreboard first.

The botched field goal at
tempt was just the first of sev
eral Stanford failures to
capitalize on scoring oppor
tunities in the first half.
A pass dropped by Kellar on
fourth down and a Gary Lynn
fumble stymied the only other
Stanford drives into Buffalo
territory during the first stanza.
Colorado, on the other
hand, mixed a well-executed
option ground attack with a
surprisingly accurate passing
game to score a touchdown
and two field goals and take a
13-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime.

ford defense off balance
throughout the game. The
6-foot-2 junior showed an even
more magical touch directing
the passing game as he hit 16 of
25 aerials for 232 yards. It was
the fifth most passing yardage
ever amassed by a Buffalo
quarterback in a single game.
One of Knapple's favorite
targets was tight end Bob
Niziolek who grabbed four
passes, the first a three-yard
play-action pass from Knapple
which found the 6-foot-7
sophomore alone in the back
of the end zone for the first
score of the game.
Balanced trade
In the second half the Cards
and the Buffs traded
touchdowns. Finley capped a
66-yard Stanford drive with a
one-yard plunge over the left
side and Colorado fullback
James Mayberry_answered with
a seven-yard scoring ramble.
On Stanford's next posses
sion, Benjamin sent Anderson
on the run and pinpointed
short passes in the flat to his
backs.
