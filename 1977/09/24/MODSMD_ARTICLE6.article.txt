# Cards halted by rambling Buffaloes...
## Stanford opportunities squandered 
### Bruce Anderson 
BOULDER, Colo. Any
pain felt from Stanford's open
ing season loss to nationally
ranked Colorado was mollified
by the performance of frosh
running phenom Darrin Nel
son who ran spinning and
dancing all the while as well
as any Cardinal back has in
more years than anyone re
members.
A second-half Stanford rally
fell short and the Cards failed

in a bid to give Bill Walsh a vic
tory in his debut as head coach.
But Stanford fans from
band members to gray-haired
alums were buzzing about
Nelson, not the loss, after the
27-21 defeat to the Buffaloes.
"Nobody down here (at the
Stanford rooting section)
knows who he is," Stanford
band manager Rich Johnson
said. "We're saying, 'Shit,
where did we get this guy?' "
The fleet halfback from Pius

X High School in Los Angeles
carried the ball 15 times for 99
yards and added 77 yards on
four receptions in his first col
legiate contest. Nelson dis
played steps and moves that
Fred Astaire never dreamed of
while making believers of Stan
ford fans and the Colorado de
fense.
Two-pronged attack
The Cardinal offense was
expected to speak in its usual
monotone this season: pass.
But Nelson and fullbacks Billy
Anderson and John Finley pro
vided the Stanford attack with a
weapon that will complement
the explosive aerial game di
rected by Guy Benjamin.
It appeared early in the game
that Nelson and the rest of the

Stanford running corps might
not get a chance to show its
mettle. The Cardinals started
the game with a Benjamin
blitzkrieg, passing on the first
five downs.
"Our approach was to force
them to account for the for
ward pass," Walsh said. "We
based our running attack on
the approach they used to stop
the pass."
Two of the opening passes
found wide receiver Bill Kellar,
first for 12 yards and later for
17. Kellar's second reception
set up a 51-yard field goal at
tempt. A bad snap, however,
forced holder Steve Dils to at
tempt a pass. The pass was in
complete and Stanford failed
to get on the scoreboard first.

The botched field goal at
tempt was just the first of sev
eral Stanford failures to
capitalize on scoring oppor
tunities in the first half.
A pass dropped by Kellar on
fourth down and a Gary Lynn
fumble stymied the only other
Stanford drives into Buffalo
territory during the first stanza.
Colorado, on the other
hand, mixed a well-executed
option ground attack with a
surprisingly accurate passing
game to score a touchdown
and two field goals and take a
13-0 advantage into the locker
room at halftime.
