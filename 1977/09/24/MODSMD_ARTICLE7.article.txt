# Comeback win
## ...then surf the Wave 
### Bruce Anderson 
NEW ORLEANS, La "Get
ting behind against teams we
think we should beat is a Stan
ford tradition," Guy Benjamin
said. "It's a tradition we're hop
ing we can break."
The Stanford quarterback's
observation came after the
Cardinals scored twice in the
fourth quarter to edge Tulane
in the Louisiana Superdome,
21-17.
Benjamin aerials first found
frosh sensation Darrin Nelson
and later speedster James Lof
ton in the end zone to over
come a 17-6 Green Wave ad
vantage and give Bill Walsh his
first victory as head football
coach at Stanford. The fourth
quarter surge evened the
Cards' record at 1-1.
"We're almost fortunate to
win," Walsh said after the
game. "I say almost because
we did come back strong in the
second half."
The Cards, flatter than
three-day-old beer in the first
half, showed tremendous
poise in the second half as both
the Stanford offense and de
fense gelled.
Good Naber policy
Stanford's only scoring in
the first three quarters came on
47- and 46-yard field goals by
sidewinder Ken Naber, a
freshman from Cincinnati mak
ing his first appearance for the
Cards.
The Cards opened the fourth
quarter with Benjamin throw

ing a 44-yard bomb to the
double-teamed Lofton. The
pass was incomplete but pass
interference was called against
the Green Wave giving Stan
ford first and goal from the
one-yardline.
Two John Finley plunges into
the line left the Cards without a
score. Then on third down an
exchange between Benjamin
and Nelson went awry and Ben
jamin fell on the loose ball at
the five.
"The crowd was really loud
then," Nelson said. "I misin
terpreted Guy. It was sup
posed to be a toss and I
thought it was a handoff."
Tidal wave
Benjamin threw incomplete
on fourth down in the face of a
swarming Green Wave rush.
Stanford, 11 points down and
with time running out, had
failed to score from the one.
With the Green Wave's back
to the goal line, Tulane quar
terback Roch Hontas faked a
running play to the left side
and bootlegged the ball to the
right, running for a 30-yard
gain. Hontas trotted to the
sideline to replace the jersey
safety Ralph Phillips had torn
from his back.
Tommy Hightower replaced
Hontas at the helm of the
Green Wave offense. On High
tower's first play, he and
fullback Bill Kramer crossed
signals on the handoff and
Stanford's Ray Cardinalli was
on top of the loose ball at the

Tulane 33.
"That was the key play," said
Tulane coach Larry Smith of the
fumble. "When the jersey was
torn off and the officials sent
him out, we called the safest
play we have. I didn't want to
call a time out because I knew it
was going to be tight at the end
and I wanted to save it."
Benjamin wasted little time
getting six points for the Cards
hitting Nelson with a 13-yard
scoring strike. The senior sig
nal caller then got the Cards
two more points as he found
tight end Mitch Pleisfree in the
end zone on the conversion at
tempt.
Energy crisis
Tulane, with a little gas
drained out of \\4 upset
machinery by the fumble and
ensuing Stanford score, failed
to pick a first down in three
plays and punted to the Cards.
After a six-yard gain on a
Benjamin-to-Vince Mulroy
hookup, Stanford was
penalized for offsides and
holding and faced second and
24 instead of second and
four.
Benjamin threw a screen
pass to Nelson on the left side,
the same play Nelson turned
into a 56-yard touchdown
against Colorado. The nimble
halfback from Los Angeles al
most broke it again, stopped
only after scampering 23 yards
with the ball. Finley picked up
the first down on the next play

with a two-yard carry.
Lofton gained 10 yards on an
end around and then Benjamin
connected with Mulrov for 11
yards.
Six points
One play later, Benjamin
fired a 16-yard strike to Lofton
for the winning touchdown.
Benjamin connected on 19 of
26 passes for 199 yards with two
interceptions.
Benjamin, who hitonl4of 17
in the second half, was slow to
get the air attack going in the
first half.
"Guy really hasn't had a
great game yet," Walsh said.
"He's played well, but not up
to his own expectations or
ours.
Benjamin did not throw a
pass until the second quarter

as the Cards tried to establish
their ground attack early. And
after he threw the first one, it's
a good bet he wished he had
waited longer to start his aerial
bombardment.
Sorry sight
The pass for Lofton was way
short of its intended target and
Steve Hubbell pirated the un
derthrown pass for the Green
Wave. It was probably the
worst looking Benjamin pass in
four years at Stanford.
"I threw better in Pop
Warner," Benjamin said of the
pass. He termed the throw
"just a plain poor pass/' but
the errant throw may have
been partially caused by mois
ture on the ball.
Stanford center Dan
McCann said the Tulane nose
guard chewed snuff during the
contest and prepared the ball
for Benjamin by spitting on it.
While Walsh wouldn't go as
far as to blame the moist balls
on well-placed Copenhagen,
he did say that in the first half

the balls were wet from perspi
ration of players on both
teams.
After Benjamin and Walsh
spoke with the officials at
halftime about getting a new
set of footballs and keeping
them dry, the problem repor
tedly was alleviated.
The defense also looked to
halftime to patch its holes.
Marv Christian ran virtually un
checked against the Cards in
the first half, amassing 121
yards on 17 carries and scoring
one touchdown on the ground
and another on a five-yard pass
from Hontas.
"Our players were talking
shutout," said linebacker
Gordy Ceresino. "But their
teams had more desire in the
first half.
"At halftime I said that talk
was cheap and it was time for
us to start speaking with our
play instead of our words."
Ceresino spoke loudest of
all, finishing the game with 23
tackles.

worst looking Benjamin pass in

halftime to patch its holes.
Marv Christian ran virtually un
checked against the Cards in

shutout," said linebacker
Gordy Ceresino. "But their

NEW ORLEANS, La "Get
ting behind against teams we
think we should beat is a Stan
ford tradition," Guy Benjamin
said. "It's a tradition we're hop
ing we can break."
The Stanford quarterback's
observation came after the
Cardinals scored twice in the
fourth quarter to edge Tulane
in the Louisiana Superdome,
21-17.
Benjamin aerials first found
frosh sensation Darrin Nelson
and later speedster James Lof
ton in the end zone to over
come a 17-6 Green Wave ad
vantage and give Bill Walsh his
first victory as head football
coach at Stanford. The fourth
quarter surge evened the
Cards' record at 1-1.
"We're almost fortunate to
win," Walsh said after the
game. "I say almost because
we did come back strong in the
second half."
The Cards, flatter than
three-day-old beer in the first
half, showed tremendous
poise in the second half as both
the Stanford offense and de
fense gelled.
Good Naber policy
Stanford's only scoring in
the first three quarters came on
47- and 46-yard field goals by
sidewinder Ken Naber, a
freshman from Cincinnati mak
ing his first appearance for the
Cards.
The Cards opened the fourth
quarter with Benjamin throw

ing a 44-yard bomb to the
double-teamed Lofton. The
pass was incomplete but pass
interference was called against
the Green Wave giving Stan
ford first and goal from the
one-yardline.
Two John Finley plunges into
the line left the Cards without a
score. Then on third down an
exchange between Benjamin
and Nelson went awry and Ben
jamin fell on the loose ball at
the five.
"The crowd was really loud
then," Nelson said. "I misin
terpreted Guy. It was sup
posed to be a toss and I
thought it was a handoff."
Tidal wave
Benjamin threw incomplete
on fourth down in the face of a
swarming Green Wave rush.
Stanford, 11 points down and
with time running out, had
failed to score from the one.
With the Green Wave's back
to the goal line, Tulane quar
terback Roch Hontas faked a
running play to the left side
and bootlegged the ball to the
right, running for a 30-yard
gain. Hontas trotted to the
sideline to replace the jersey
safety Ralph Phillips had torn
from his back.
Tommy Hightower replaced
Hontas at the helm of the
Green Wave offense. On High
tower's first play, he and
fullback Bill Kramer crossed
signals on the handoff and
Stanford's Ray Cardinalli was
on top of the loose ball at the

Tulane 33.
"That was the key play," said
Tulane coach Larry Smith of the
fumble. "When the jersey was
torn off and the officials sent
him out, we called the safest
play we have. I didn't want to
call a time out because I knew it
was going to be tight at the end
and I wanted to save it."
Benjamin wasted little time
getting six points for the Cards
hitting Nelson with a 13-yard
scoring strike. The senior sig
nal caller then got the Cards
two more points as he found
tight end Mitch Pleisfree in the
end zone on the conversion at
tempt.
Energy crisis
Tulane, with a little gas
drained out of \\4 upset
machinery by the fumble and
ensuing Stanford score, failed
to pick a first down in three
plays and punted to the Cards.
After a six-yard gain on a
Benjamin-to-Vince Mulroy
hookup, Stanford was
penalized for offsides and
holding and faced second and
24 instead of second and

come a 17-6 Green Wave ad
vantage and give Bill Walsh his
first victory as head football
coach at Stanford. The fourth
quarter surge evened the
Cards' record at 1-1.
"We're almost fortunate to
win," Walsh said after the
game. "I say almost because
we did come back strong in the
second half."
The Cards, flatter than
three-day-old beer in the first
half, showed tremendous
poise in the second half as both
the Stanford offense and de
fense gelled.
Good Naber policy
Stanford's only scoring in
the first three quarters came on
47- and 46-yard field goals by
sidewinder Ken Naber, a
freshman from Cincinnati mak
ing his first appearance for the
Cards.
The Cards opened the fourth
quarter with Benjamin throw

ing a 44-yard bomb to the
double-teamed Lofton. The
pass was incomplete but pass
interference was called against
the Green Wave giving Stan
ford first and goal from the
one-yardline.
Two John Finley plunges into
the line left the Cards without a
score. Then on third down an
exchange between Benjamin
and Nelson went awry and Ben
jamin fell on the loose ball at
the five.
"The crowd was really loud
then," Nelson said. "I misin
terpreted Guy. It was sup
posed to be a toss and I
thought it was a handoff."
Tidal wave
Benjamin threw incomplete
on fourth down in the face of a
swarming Green Wave rush.
Stanford, 11 points down and
with time running out, had
failed to score from the one.
With the Green Wave's back
to the goal line, Tulane quar
terback Roch Hontas faked a
running play to the left side
and bootlegged the ball to the
right, running for a 30-yard
gain. Hontas trotted to the
sideline to replace the jersey
safety Ralph Phillips had torn
from his back.
Tommy Hightower replaced
Hontas at the helm of the
Green Wave offense. On High
tower's first play, he and
fullback Bill Kramer crossed
signals on the handoff and
Stanford's Ray Cardinalli was
on top of the loose ball at the

Tulane 33.
"That was the key play," said
Tulane coach Larry Smith of the
fumble. "When the jersey was
torn off and the officials sent
him out, we called the safest
play we have. I didn't want to
call a time out because I knew it
was going to be tight at the end
and I wanted to save it."
Benjamin wasted little time
getting six points for the Cards
hitting Nelson with a 13-yard
scoring strike. The senior sig
nal caller then got the Cards
two more points as he found
tight end Mitch Pleisfree in the
end zone on the conversion at
tempt.
Energy crisis
Tulane, with a little gas
drained out of \\4 upset
machinery by the fumble and
ensuing Stanford score, failed
to pick a first down in three
plays and punted to the Cards.
After a six-yard gain on a
Benjamin-to-Vince Mulroy
hookup, Stanford was
penalized for offsides and
holding and faced second and
24 instead of second and
four.
Benjamin threw a screen
pass to Nelson on the left side,
the same play Nelson turned
into a 56-yard touchdown
against Colorado. The nimble
halfback from Los Angeles al
most broke it again, stopped
only after scampering 23 yards
with the ball. Finley picked up
the first down on the next play

with a two-yard carry.
Lofton gained 10 yards on an
end around and then Benjamin
connected with Mulrov for 11
yards.
Six points
One play later, Benjamin
fired a 16-yard strike to Lofton
for the winning touchdown.
Benjamin connected on 19 of
26 passes for 199 yards with two
interceptions.
Benjamin, who hitonl4of 17
in the second half, was slow to
get the air attack going in the
first half.
"Guy really hasn't had a
great game yet," Walsh said.
"He's played well, but not up
to his own expectations or
ours.
Benjamin did not throw a
pass until the second quarter

as the Cards tried to establish
their ground attack early. And
after he threw the first one, it's
a good bet he wished he had
waited longer to start his aerial
bombardment.
Sorry sight
The pass for Lofton was way
short of its intended target and
Steve Hubbell pirated the un
derthrown pass for the Green
Wave. It was probably the
worst looking Benjamin pass in
four years at Stanford.
"I threw better in Pop
Warner," Benjamin said of the
pass. He termed the throw
"just a plain poor pass/' but
the errant throw may have
been partially caused by mois
ture on the ball.
Stanford center Dan
McCann said the Tulane nose
guard chewed snuff during the
contest and prepared the ball
for Benjamin by spitting on it.
While Walsh wouldn't go as
far as to blame the moist balls
on well-placed Copenhagen,
he did say that in the first half

the balls were wet from perspi
ration of players on both
teams.
After Benjamin and Walsh
spoke with the officials at
halftime about getting a new
set of footballs and keeping
them dry, the problem repor
tedly was alleviated.
The defense also looked to
halftime to patch its holes.
Marv Christian ran virtually un
checked against the Cards in
the first half, amassing 121
yards on 17 carries and scoring
one touchdown on the ground
and another on a five-yard pass
from Hontas.
"Our players were talking
shutout," said linebacker
Gordy Ceresino. "But their
teams had more desire in the
first half.
"At halftime I said that talk
was cheap and it was time for
us to start speaking with our
play instead of our words."
Ceresino spoke loudest of
all, finishing the game with 23
tackles.
