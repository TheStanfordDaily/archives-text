NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE
ECONOMICS
The Economics Department has taken action to bring its A.B. degree requirements into contormance
with the new policies governing undergraduate degrees at Stanford. The new University-wide guidelines
appear on pages 11-12 of Courses and Degrees, 1977-78.
The old Economics requirements will continue to apply to all students who declared Economics as a
major at Stanford before July 1,1977, or all students who had more than 90 units of college credit earned
by the end of Summer Quarter, 1977. The old Economics requirements appear on pages 286-287 of
Courses and Degrees, 1977-78.
The new Economics requirements apply to all students declaring Economics as a major after July 1,
1977, and who have 90 or fewer units of coNege credit as of the end of Summer Quarter, 1977.
The now requirements simply regularize the better programs of study followed by Economics majors in
the past. The new requirements set minimum standards as follows:
1. Basic Economics Courses —15 units Economics 1, 51 and 52. Students taking the equivalent of
Economics 1 before entering college may substitute any other Economics course for Economics 1.
Economics 51 and 52 should be completed by the end of the junior year, or earlier if possible.
2. Upper Division Economics Courses —30 units. These 30 units in 100-level Economics courses must
indude at least two courses from among Economics 111, 118, 141, 145, 148, 157 and 165.
3. Quantitative Courses —10 units: All courses taken to satisfy this requirement must be approved in
writing by the student s major advisor. Advisors will automatically approve courses from among the
following: Economics 90, 91, 170, 171, 172, 180, 181; any mathematics courses numbered 5 or
above; any Operations Research or Statistics courses. With advisor's approval, other quantitatively
oriented courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
4. Courses Satisfying Breadth Requirements —10 units: Courses in fields of study which are com
plementary to the students' course work in Economics, beyond the introductory level, or Economics
courses at the 100 level as listed in (2) above, and courses in quantitative methods as listed in (3)
above All courses taken to meet this requirement must have the written approval of the student's
Economics Department advisor.
No courses receiving Economics Department credit under headings 1 and 2 above may be taken
Pass-No credit. No more than 10 units of course work for Economics Department credit under headings 3
and 4 above may be taken Pass-No credit.
No course may be counted more than once in satisfying the requirements. Students should consult with
their major advisors to develop a coherent program of study satisfying their career and educational
objectives. Students should also investigate the Honors Programs offered in Economics.
