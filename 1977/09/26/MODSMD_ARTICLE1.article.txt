Nearly 1000 freshman lined the Inner Quad yesterday
to sign up for freshman seminars and freshman English
courses.
Registration for both types of classes has traditionally
been conducted in August by mail, but Ombudsman
John Goheen said on-campus registration was tried this
year as "an experiment."
Students faced waits of up to two hours before being
able to sign up for seminars or freshman English, accord
ing to Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant Katch
adourian.
However, a student waiting outside Building 20 said
she had waited 2Vi hours to get that far in a line which
wound 300 yards from Building t to Building 40.
Katchadourian said signups were "going about as well

as anyone thought they would." A bottleneck arose, he
said, because too few signup tables were available for
students who wanted to take freshman seminars which
met the writing requirement.
The switch from summer registration to registration
on campus was made because many students preregis
tered for seminars but then opted not to take them,
Goheen said. "There was an awful turnover," he
explained.
During previous preregistrations, choices of seminars
and writing requirement classes were "being made more
blindly," Katcnadourian said. He added he hoped stu
dents would be finding out more about these courses this
year before signing up.
