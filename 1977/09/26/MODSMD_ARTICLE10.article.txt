# Summer accomplishments
## Changes coming in the COP office 
### 
Westly, et al.

In the past few years, student gov
ernment at Stanford has been some
thing less than ideal. Not only have
the students not received all of the
services that they could have, but the
reputation of a inadequate ASSU has
damaged the students' credibility in
having any serious input on major
University decisions.
We intend to change this. For star
ters, we made a campaign promise to
keep the Council of President's Of
fice open 40 hours a week. Fall quar
ter, however, we plan to keep the
office open 50 hours every week in
an attempt to meet with as many stu
dents as we can and to be as respon
sive to student sentiment as possi
ble. We urge you to come to our of
fice on the second floor of Tresidder
Union. Bring any problems, ideas
or demands you may have.
To facilitate all of the projects that
we are working on we will be hiring
three students as staff workers. If you
are interested in any particular pro
jects or the ASSU in general, please
call (497-4331) for an interview. We

promise it will be a more rewarding
experience than hashing ever was.
In a future article we will print a
complete list of all the issues that the
four of us are working on; of equal
importance, we plan to print a list of
the issues that we are not working
on. The rationale for this is twofold;
first, the students who are interested
in projects that are already underway
can come to the office and im
mediately get involved, and second,
students who have strong feelings
about issues that we are unable to
undertake ourselves, will be encour
aged to come to the office where we
will give them as much help with staf
fing, resources, or general assistance
that we can provide.
The following is a brief list of the
projects each of us have been work
ing on over the summer.
Glenn Jordan has been working to
develop a report on minority admis
sions at the University. Glenn has
also been working on graduate stu
dent issues, although I believe he
spends the bulk of his time simply

trying to graduate.
If you went to the ASSU Orienta
tion night, you saw just one example
of the types of services that the ASSU
can provide. If you enjoyed the even
ing, you can thank Greg Larson, for
he did a major part of the organizing
as well as the dirty work.
Anne Henkels has been working
all summer on the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) with
representatives from the faculty and
the Board of Trustees. If you're in
terested in going abroad to study,
you will be glad to know that Anne
has helped to bring into being the
ASSU Task Force on Overseas
Studies, which will review some of
the major problems with overseas
campuses and look into why they are
being shut down.
Anne also helped lay the
groundwork for an ASSU recycling
center, which we urge you to vote a
fee assessment for on the fall ballot.
I have been working on the de
velopment of an ASSU Voters Pam
phlet. I am painfully aware of how

difficult it is to intelligently choose
the best candidates for office when
you have 80 people banging on your
door over the course of two even
ings. Hopefully, the elections pam
phlet will enable every student to
choose candidates who will be more
responsibly thoughtful.
Finally, we would like to extend
our thanks to the graduate students
for helping elect us. More impor
tantly, however, we would like to
urge the graduate students to be
come involved in the ASSU. The time
has come for the ASSU to bring its
resources to bear on issues that will
benefit graduates as well as under
graduates. If you are a concerned
graduate student, please bring us
your ideas, so together we can im
prove the entire University commun
ity.
