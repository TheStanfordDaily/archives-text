Now that Vietnam is in the United
Nations, the first chore of Trinh and
the rest of his delegation should be
to undertake a thorough study of the
U.N. Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, which condemns the
tyrannies of Hanoi's "policy of le
niency."
(This editorial previously appeared in
the Los Angeles Times on Sept. 23,
1977.)

The rulers of Vietnam have plenty
of reason to celebrate the admission
of their once-divided, war-ravaged
country into the United Nations.
The action reflects the realities of
the Communist triumph over the
American-supported regimes of the
south. It removes a major obstacle to
Vietnam's place in the community of
nations, and enhances its standing as
an independent sovereign state.
Vietnam's admission as the 149 th
U.N. member also opens the door
wider for the rehabilitation of the
country. Vietnam deserves aid, not
as an endorsement of Hanoi's au
thoritarian rule but to ease the suffer
ings that the fighting caused its
people, both in the north and in the
south.
The aid, though, should be chan
neled through international organi
zations like the United Nations, not
through "reparations" still de
manded by Hanoi, though it must be
said that those demands are muted
now. America can, and should, join
the rehabilitation efforts; it need
not, and should not, accept the con
cepts of war guilt implied in repara
tions. The war had many villains, and
many, many victims.
Even as they rejoice over their
entry into the United Nations, the
rulers in Hanoi — and all other U.N.
members — should take note of an
event that occurred 3000 miles away
on the day of Vietnam's admission:
the arrival in the United States of the
vanguard of thousands of homeless
Southeast Asians who will settle in
this country under a new admission
policy. The majority of the new arri

vals will be Vietnamese refugees —
some of the tens of thousands who
have fled their homeland to escape
the tyranny that Hanoi has imposed
on the country in the postwar era.
Their flight mocks the contentions
of Vietnam's Foreign Minister
Nguyen Duy Trinh in his maiden
U.N. speech. He said Hanoi had
applied "a policy of leniency" against
those of his countrymen who had
opposed the Vietnamese Com-
