# Campus navigation
## 'You can't get there from here' 
### 
Dave Ansley

To the Class of '81 —
Fear not, classroom 420-040 really
exists somewhere on this campus, as
do CubAud and DinkAud. You may
have to dodge a few construction
sites to get to them, but they can be
found. Just follow the hordes 8 a.m.
Wednesday morning.
If somehow you miss a turn and
end up in Redwood City, join the
club.
I remember one Saturday after
noon early in my freshman year
when I set off with a couple of fellow
Rinconadans to find SLAC. After 20
minutes of cycling, we found oursel
ves stuck in a cul-de-sac somewhere
between Florence Moore and Lake
Lag. The local frat man who came to
our rescue wouldn't believe us. For
tunately, he did direct us back to
Rinc.
(I realize this sounds like some Old
Fart reminiscing and passing out un
wanted advice, but bear with me —
I've been waiting for years to write
this.)
"At Stanford, the shortest distance

between any two points is a line
bisected by a barricade."
Believe it or not, there is a master
plan to explain all the broken con
crete.
On somebody's wall is a map de
picting Campus Drive as circling the
entire University. Parking would be
allowed only in huge lots on either
side of Campus Drive; the center of
campus would be closed to all but
Good Humor vendors and fire
trucks.
How will visiting anarchists get
from their cars to the lecture halls?
No one knows, but they're already
closing streets as if they did know.
In the meantime, the best answer
to offer lost drivers: "Sorry, you can't
get there from here."
The driving directions from the
Communication Dept. (just a ran
dom example) to Campus Drive
won't help your car's EPA rating:
"Left at the stop sign, then right at
the stop sign, then left at the stop
sign, then right at the stop sign, then
left, then right at the stop sign, one

block and you're there!" It's easier to
walk.
Navigation is no less traumatic if
you follow the Stanford map. Look
closely at that cartographer's night
mare. Where's north? In the vicinity
of your right knee of course.
Legend has it that the top of Stan
ford's official map points at the
hometown of the Aussie surveyor
who first mapped out the campus —
Amerigo Vespucci Stanford. He was
a distant cousin.
The official excuse is that the walls
of the original Quad were built in line
with the magnetic north pole in 1889,
which has, most obnoxiously,
moved since then.
So — to be certain that you don't
wander into the next county search
ing for Bio 1, just keep that obscene
tower in sight. You can't go far
wrong.

How will visiting anarchists get
from their cars to the lecture halls?
No one knows, but they're already
closing streets as if they did know.
In the meantime, the best answer
to offer lost drivers: "Sorry, you can't
get there from here."
The driving directions from the
Communication Dept. (just a ran
dom example) to Campus Drive
won't help your car's EPA rating:
"Left at the stop sign, then right at
the stop sign, then left at the stop
sign, then right at the stop sign, then
left, then right at the stop sign, one

block and you're there!" It's easier to
walk.
Navigation is no less traumatic if
you follow the Stanford map. Look
closely at that cartographer's night
mare. Where's north? In the vicinity
of your right knee of course.
Legend has it that the top of Stan
ford's official map points at the
hometown of the Aussie surveyor
who first mapped out the campus —
Amerigo Vespucci Stanford. He was
a distant cousin.
The official excuse is that the walls
of the original Quad were built in line
with the magnetic north pole in 1889,
which has, most obnoxiously,
moved since then.
So — to be certain that you don't
wander into the next county search
ing for Bio 1, just keep that obscene
tower in sight. You can't go far
wrong.

To the Class of '81 —
Fear not, classroom 420-040 really
exists somewhere on this campus, as
do CubAud and DinkAud. You may
have to dodge a few construction
sites to get to them, but they can be
found. Just follow the hordes 8 a.m.
Wednesday morning.
If somehow you miss a turn and
end up in Redwood City, join the
club.
I remember one Saturday after
noon early in my freshman year
when I set off with a couple of fellow
Rinconadans to find SLAC. After 20
minutes of cycling, we found oursel
ves stuck in a cul-de-sac somewhere
between Florence Moore and Lake
Lag. The local frat man who came to
our rescue wouldn't believe us. For
tunately, he did direct us back to
Rinc.
(I realize this sounds like some Old
Fart reminiscing and passing out un
wanted advice, but bear with me —
I've been waiting for years to write
this.)
"At Stanford, the shortest distance

between any two points is a line
bisected by a barricade."
Believe it or not, there is a master
plan to explain all the broken con
crete.
On somebody's wall is a map de
picting Campus Drive as circling the
entire University. Parking would be
allowed only in huge lots on either
side of Campus Drive; the center of
campus would be closed to all but
Good Humor vendors and fire
trucks.
