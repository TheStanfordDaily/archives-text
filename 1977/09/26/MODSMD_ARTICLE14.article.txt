Parking tax
As an observer on the Stanford
scene since 1959, nothing has impre
ssed me more than the insensitivity
of the Stanford administration to the
needs of the community. I think that
the present "newly instituted tax on
parking" is just another more
graphic representation of that insen
sitivity.
Parking here in 1959 was bad
enough, but tolerable. Not wishing
to see "progress" slowed, I have not,
until now, felt the need to say any
thing about the effects of the deci
sion of some very well-insulated ad
ministrators or committee with re
spect to this issue.
As a concerned effort was insti
tuted to "eliminate" the "undesira
ble" automobile from our commun
ity, more and more of the people in
the community have been alienated
and demoralized to the point that the

efficiency of the people who do the
work here has been seriously af
fected.
Parking far from work and walking
in is good for one until the rains
come. Then we will see more tardi
ness or sick-time used as a result of
the exposure — or time required to
dry one's rain equipment, etc. — all
detracting from the work at hand.
The final blow comes when I went
to the police station to pay my "park
ing tax" only to find a waiting line
which required 20 minutes of my
time and many others. This time
could have been used to much better
advantage than standing in line only
to find out that after registering the
same vehicles for the last five years
that I must now provide proof of
ownership before the parking per
mits would be issued. This, of
course, requires another trip to the
police station and more time lost.
There was no effort on the part of
the person at the window to look up

past registrations or in any way to
attempt to establish ownership. This
insensitivity clearly reminds me of
our government bureaucracy in
Washington, D.C. and the type of
ridiculous time-wasting that goes on
when dealing with our government
agencies. Must this happen at Stan
ford?
What other employer in this area
requires a fee to park? Does the Uni
versity want happy, productive
people working here or disgruntled,
unhappy and unproductive people?
Can the University afford their preci
ous transportation fund?
I hope the University planners
(with all their brain power) can figure
out some better means of establish
ing good relations with their staff
than the newly instituted "tax" and
all that it stands for.

Parking far from work and walking
in is good for one until the rains
come. Then we will see more tardi
ness or sick-time used as a result of
the exposure — or time required to
dry one's rain equipment, etc. — all
detracting from the work at hand.
The final blow comes when I went
to the police station to pay my "park
ing tax" only to find a waiting line
which required 20 minutes of my
time and many others. This time
could have been used to much better
advantage than standing in line only
to find out that after registering the
same vehicles for the last five years
that I must now provide proof of
ownership before the parking per
mits would be issued. This, of
course, requires another trip to the
police station and more time lost.
There was no effort on the part of
the person at the window to look up

past registrations or in any way to
attempt to establish ownership. This
insensitivity clearly reminds me of
our government bureaucracy in
Washington, D.C. and the type of
ridiculous time-wasting that goes on
when dealing with our government
agencies. Must this happen at Stan
ford?
What other employer in this area
requires a fee to park? Does the Uni
versity want happy, productive
people working here or disgruntled,
unhappy and unproductive people?
Can the University afford their preci
ous transportation fund?
I hope the University planners
(with all their brain power) can figure
out some better means of establish
ing good relations with their staff
than the newly instituted "tax" and
all that it stands for.
