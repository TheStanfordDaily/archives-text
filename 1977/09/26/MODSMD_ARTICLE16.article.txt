# Swiss ponder legalizing euthanasia

Zurich,- Switzerland (AP) —
Voters in Switzerland's most
populous state yesterday ap
proved a measure that could
legalize mercy-killing on re
quest in this country. It was be
lieved to be the world's first
plebiscite on euthanasia.
The 203,148-144,822 vote
pledged the Zurich state gov
ernment to initiate federal
legislation permitting doctors
to perform euthanasia if re
quested by patients "suffering
from an incurable, painful and
definitely fatal disease."
In a nationwide referendum,
meanwhile, Swiss voters ap
proved a government-backed
curb on their plebiscite rights.
The government had argued
that a recent rash of referen
dums was overtaxing the elec
torate and straining the coun
try's system of "direct democ
racy" to the breaking point.
Last April, the Swiss
Academy of Medical Sciences
issued precedent-setting di
rectives permitting "passive
euthanasia" — cessation of
life-prolonging treatment of
terminally ill, comatose pa
tients.
But the Academy came out
against "active" mercy-killing
on the ground that tull guaran
tees against abuses were not
possible.
