### Kurt Cobb 
A new law eliminating the
mandatory retirement age in
California may have "strong
and adverse" effects on the
University and other private
employers, President Richard
Lyman said in a Sept. 15 cable
to Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
In that cable Lyman urged
Brown to veto the law (A.B.
586), saying the bill "comes to
you (Brown) almost completely
lacking the underpinning of
study, analysis, and informed
public debate demanded by

such a measure." Brown, how
ever, signed the bill into law
the following day.
In his plea to Brown, Lyman
warned that the bill will abro
gate "a host of private
employment arrangements
without regard to their cir
cumstances and history, and
without knowledge of the con
sequences."
Lyman expressed concern
over the possible effects of the
new law on the approximately
25 percent of the University fa
culty who are non-tenured

women and minority group
members. He said "their pros
pects depend on turnover,
especially from retirement in
the senior ranks."
Fitness
Lyman added that "a wave of
litigation" may result from dis
putes concerning the fitness of
older workers to continue
working.
Meanwhile the U.S. House
of Representatives passed a
measure3s9-4 last Friday which
will allow millions of Ameri
cans to work beyond age 65 to
age 70 with all legal protections
against age discrimination.
The Los Angeles Times re
ported that most experts be
lieve the new California law
will have little or no impact on
the retirement plans of the vast
majority of Californians.
The Times reported that at
Exxon, General Foods and
other large corporations only
20 percent to 30 percent of the
workers wait until they are 65
to retire.
The Times also said that
"some studies show that over
90 percent of all workers retire
by age 62 when they can do so
without losing benefits."
