# Social security tax bill eyed

### 
Washington (AP) â€”A plan tor
higher Social Security taxes to
keep the system from running
out of funds for retirees in five
years was sent to the House
Ways and Means committee
last Thursday.
The plan calls for increases
by 1979 that would affect only
higher-paid workers and their
employers. Additional payroll
deductions for all covered
employes and their employers
would begin in 1981.
The exact amounts are still to
be determined when the full
committee begins work on the
measure, probably Wednes
day or Thursday.
The Social Security sub
committee is under pressure to
get a bill to the House floor by
early October so that Congress
can complete action before ad
journing for the year.
Tentative decisions by the
subcommittee could mean a
payroll tax by 1982 as high as
$1,980 for persons earning
$ <0.000 or more.
That is more than twice as
much as anyone is paying this

year. In 1977, the tax is levied
on earnings up to only $16,500.
The amount of additional re
venue depends, among other
things, on the final decision on
whether to bring under Social
Security coverage by 1980
more than six million employes
of federal, state and local gov
ernments and of nonprofit or
ganizations.
The subcommittee voted for
this expansion, but members

have had increasing doubts
that the changeover and read
justment of the Civil Service
and other retirement systems
could be accomplished so
soon.
Another factor affecting the
prospective tax hike is a tenta
tive subcommittee decision to
increase the amount a retired
person is allowed to earn with
out having Social Security be
nefits reduced.
