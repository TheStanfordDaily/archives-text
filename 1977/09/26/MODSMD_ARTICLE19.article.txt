# Default rate drops here on student loan program
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Despite nationwide in
creases in the rate of student
loan delinquencies, the rate
here decreased three percent
last year, said Asst. Director of
Financial Aids Kenneth Kauf
man.
Even so, defaults remain a
problem here. Joseph Jedd,
manager of student accounts,
explained that "for every $100
that we should have collected,
$8 has not been collected."
Because of increasing stu
dent defaults under the Feder
ally Insured Student Loan
Program (FISLP), the U.S. De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare is planning to hire
a private collection agency to
handle the delinquent loans.
According to Jedd, this will
not affect the University be
cause the money for FISLP
loans comes from federally in
sured banks.
The banks are required by
the government "to exercise
due diligence in collecting the
loans," said Ron Livermore,
manager of the student loan
center at Bank of America.
The usual procedure for col
lecting loans is to notify stu
dents through a series of form
letters of their payment due
dates, and later of consequ
ences of not paying back the
loan.
Students are allowed nine
months after leaving school
before their first payment date.
If no payments have been re
ceived 90 days later, the bank
may file a claim to be reim
bursed by the government.
In an effort to combat the

problem of delinquent student
loans here, the collections de
partment increased its staff to
six employes last year.
When time comes for a stu
dent to begin repaying his or
her loan, the department
sends him or her a series of
notices. If there is no reply,
several form letters will tollow.
"As long as these people
cooperate, we are always very

compassionate," commented
Jedd. However, if there is no
answer to the letters, the case
will be turned over to a collec
tion agency.
The Financial Aids Office is
also expanding its program to
deal with the delinquency rate
on student loans. This year it
began meeting with freshmen
holding NDSL loans to discuss
credit and financial aid.
