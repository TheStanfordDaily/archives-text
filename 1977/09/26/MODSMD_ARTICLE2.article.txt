# Stanford settles Iran claim
## 
### Mike Charlson 
After nearly nine months of
negotiations and waiting, the Uni
versity has settled its claim for reim
bursement of $484,190 by National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT), ac
cording to Earl Cilley, director of
sponsored projects.
As part of the settlement, the Uni
versity reduced its bill to NIRT by
$90,000 and agreed to "tie up some
loose ends" on reports submitted to
the agency under a 1974 contract to
develop a domestic telecommunica
tions satellite system and to develop
programming recommendations for
educational television in Iran.
In return, NIRT has paid the
$394,190 balance.
The settlement came after months
of communication and waiting for
NIRT officials to respond or act. Fi
nally, Cilley and then Acting Vice
President for Business and Finance
Kenneth Creighton flew last month
to Teheran where direct negotiation
produced a settlement described as
"positive."
Problem recognition
"(The terms of the agreement) re
flect a reasonable recognition of the
problems encountered by both Stan
ford and NIRT," said Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy, who served as vice provost
for research through most of the
nine months.
The $978,000 contract originally

provided for three years of work by
the University, beginning Sept. 1,
1974; however, NIRT executed a
termination clause of the contract
last fall citing general dissatisfaction
with work being performed.
The University then had 90 days to
complete work and issue the pro
duct, a set of final reports.
Work was done primarily by Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan and Communication Prof.
Edwin Parker, as well as graduate
students in both departments.
Before final reports were issued,
Massy ordered a group of faculty

from the Engineering and Communi
cation Departments to review the re
ports.
Very satisfied
Last March 10, a Daily article
quoted members of that group as
saying they had been very satisfied
that work done was within the spirit
and letter of the contract.
"There is a written contract and
what our report says is that the work
fulfills the contract," Adjunct Electri
cal Engineering Prof. H. Taylor How
ard said. "We were unanimous in our
opinion."
Communication Prof. Lyle Nelson,
also a member of the review panel,
agreed with Howard's assessment at
that time, as did Cilley.
Now Massy says some of the re
ports were of unequal quality, how
ever. "In at least one case (the re
port) was not what it might have
been," Massy said.
He said quality would have been
better had investigators not beeij so
pressed for time. Contract termina
tion was a surprise to everyone here,
he has said.
Massy attributed the change in the
University's defense of its work to a
misunderstanding of Iran's position.
"There is still no doubt in my mind
that we legally fulfilled the letter of
the contract," Massy said. "It was a
best efforts contract.
"I feel we did fulfill it in the spirit of
the contract as we understood it.
However, the Iranians' expectations
had been different than ours," he
said.
Performance contract
NIRT's interpretation of the work
was more along the lines of a per
formance contract, with a definite
product in mind, Massy said.
"We gave it our best effort," he
said. "It was an honest difference."
Massy went on to say he was "con
fident" the University's research
reputation was not tarnished by the
incident.
He said the follow-up work on the
contract should prevent damage to
the University's reputation.
Parker and Nelson will work on de
fining the research better and de
termining ways to implement prog
ram work, according to Nelson. Final
reports must be completed by June,
but Nelson said he felt the small
amount of work to be done would
not take that long.
Problems with the contract were
discovered last fall when, after NIRT
announced termination, the Univer
sity Comptroller's Office discovered
the agency had been delinquent in
paying for the work.
In addition, misunderstandings
arose as to provisions of the contract
because of vague phrasology in the
work statement, Massy has said.
Payment guarantee?
University officials admitted last
January that management had
negotiated for a "Standby Letter of
Credit," a piece of paper designed to
guarantee payment, which was never

received by the University.
Moreover, not until after the prob
lem with payment was discovered,
after termination, was it realized that
the letter was "apparently never
sent" by NIRT.
Massy also said University officials
were inexperienced with handling
overseas contracts. He and Cilley ag
reed the University "learned a great
deal from this experience, which has
been unique."
Repeatedly last year, Cilley told the
Daily payment was expected "any
day" or "within a few weeks," yet
months later, no progress had been
reported. Cilley said this was be
cause he misunderstood NIRT's
sense of time.
"I think it's fair to say the Iranians
have a very different sense of time
than we do," Cilley said, "They don't
put the same premium on time, and
it's a cultural thing. This wasn't the
foremost thing on their list of
priorities.
"From their point of view, this
probably was cleared up expediti
ously whereas from ours, it took a lot
longer than we had expected."

ram work, according to Nelson. Final
reports must be completed by June,
but Nelson said he felt the small
amount of work to be done would
not take that long.
Problems with the contract were
discovered last fall when, after NIRT
announced termination, the Univer
sity Comptroller's Office discovered
the agency had been delinquent in
paying for the work.
In addition, misunderstandings
arose as to provisions of the contract
because of vague phrasology in the
work statement, Massy has said.
Payment guarantee?
University officials admitted last
January that management had
negotiated for a "Standby Letter of
Credit," a piece of paper designed to
guarantee payment, which was never

received by the University.
Moreover, not until after the prob
lem with payment was discovered,
after termination, was it realized that
the letter was "apparently never
sent" by NIRT.
Massy also said University officials
were inexperienced with handling
overseas contracts. He and Cilley ag
reed the University "learned a great
deal from this experience, which has
been unique."
Repeatedly last year, Cilley told the
Daily payment was expected "any
day" or "within a few weeks," yet
months later, no progress had been
reported. Cilley said this was be
cause he misunderstood NIRT's
sense of time.
"I think it's fair to say the Iranians
have a very different sense of time
than we do," Cilley said, "They don't
put the same premium on time, and
it's a cultural thing. This wasn't the
foremost thing on their list of
priorities.
"From their point of view, this
probably was cleared up expediti
ously whereas from ours, it took a lot
longer than we had expected."
After nearly nine months of
negotiations and waiting, the Uni
versity has settled its claim for reim
bursement of $484,190 by National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT), ac
cording to Earl Cilley, director of
sponsored projects.
As part of the settlement, the Uni
versity reduced its bill to NIRT by
$90,000 and agreed to "tie up some
loose ends" on reports submitted to
the agency under a 1974 contract to
develop a domestic telecommunica
tions satellite system and to develop
programming recommendations for
educational television in Iran.
In return, NIRT has paid the
$394,190 balance.
The settlement came after months
of communication and waiting for
NIRT officials to respond or act. Fi
nally, Cilley and then Acting Vice
President for Business and Finance
Kenneth Creighton flew last month
to Teheran where direct negotiation
produced a settlement described as
"positive."
Problem recognition
"(The terms of the agreement) re
flect a reasonable recognition of the
problems encountered by both Stan
ford and NIRT," said Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy, who served as vice provost
for research through most of the
nine months.
The $978,000 contract originally

provided for three years of work by
the University, beginning Sept. 1,
1974; however, NIRT executed a
termination clause of the contract
last fall citing general dissatisfaction
with work being performed.
The University then had 90 days to
complete work and issue the pro
duct, a set of final reports.
Work was done primarily by Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan and Communication Prof.
Edwin Parker, as well as graduate
students in both departments.
Before final reports were issued,
Massy ordered a group of faculty

from the Engineering and Communi
cation Departments to review the re
ports.
Very satisfied
Last March 10, a Daily article
quoted members of that group as
saying they had been very satisfied
that work done was within the spirit
and letter of the contract.
"There is a written contract and
what our report says is that the work
fulfills the contract," Adjunct Electri
cal Engineering Prof. H. Taylor How
ard said. "We were unanimous in our
opinion."
Communication Prof. Lyle Nelson,
also a member of the review panel,
agreed with Howard's assessment at
that time, as did Cilley.
Now Massy says some of the re
ports were of unequal quality, how
ever. "In at least one case (the re
port) was not what it might have
been," Massy said.
He said quality would have been
better had investigators not beeij so
pressed for time. Contract termina
tion was a surprise to everyone here,
he has said.
Massy attributed the change in the
University's defense of its work to a
misunderstanding of Iran's position.
"There is still no doubt in my mind
that we legally fulfilled the letter of
the contract," Massy said. "It was a
best efforts contract.
"I feel we did fulfill it in the spirit of
the contract as we understood it.
However, the Iranians' expectations
had been different than ours," he
said.
Performance contract
NIRT's interpretation of the work
was more along the lines of a per
formance contract, with a definite
product in mind, Massy said.
"We gave it our best effort," he
said. "It was an honest difference."
Massy went on to say he was "con
fident" the University's research
reputation was not tarnished by the
incident.
He said the follow-up work on the
contract should prevent damage to
the University's reputation.
Parker and Nelson will work on de
fining the research better and de
termining ways to implement prog
ram work, according to Nelson. Final
reports must be completed by June,

what our report says is that the work
fulfills the contract," Adjunct Electri
cal Engineering Prof. H. Taylor How
ard said. "We were unanimous in our
opinion."
Communication Prof. Lyle Nelson,
also a member of the review panel,
agreed with Howard's assessment at
that time, as did Cilley.
Now Massy says some of the re
ports were of unequal quality, how
ever. "In at least one case (the re
port) was not what it might have
been," Massy said.
He said quality would have been
better had investigators not beeij so
pressed for time. Contract termina
tion was a surprise to everyone here,
he has said.
Massy attributed the change in the
University's defense of its work to a
misunderstanding of Iran's position.
"There is still no doubt in my mind
that we legally fulfilled the letter of
the contract," Massy said. "It was a
best efforts contract.
"I feel we did fulfill it in the spirit of
the contract as we understood it.
However, the Iranians' expectations
had been different than ours," he
said.
Performance contract
NIRT's interpretation of the work
was more along the lines of a per
formance contract, with a definite
product in mind, Massy said.
"We gave it our best effort," he
said. "It was an honest difference."
Massy went on to say he was "con
fident" the University's research
reputation was not tarnished by the
incident.
He said the follow-up work on the
contract should prevent damage to
the University's reputation.
Parker and Nelson will work on de
fining the research better and de
termining ways to implement prog
ram work, according to Nelson. Final
reports must be completed by June,
but Nelson said he felt the small
amount of work to be done would
not take that long.
Problems with the contract were
discovered last fall when, after NIRT
announced termination, the Univer
sity Comptroller's Office discovered
the agency had been delinquent in
paying for the work.
In addition, misunderstandings
arose as to provisions of the contract
because of vague phrasology in the
work statement, Massy has said.
Payment guarantee?
University officials admitted last
January that management had
negotiated for a "Standby Letter of
Credit," a piece of paper designed to
guarantee payment, which was never

received by the University.
Moreover, not until after the prob
lem with payment was discovered,
after termination, was it realized that
the letter was "apparently never
sent" by NIRT.
Massy also said University officials
were inexperienced with handling
overseas contracts. He and Cilley ag
reed the University "learned a great
deal from this experience, which has
been unique."
Repeatedly last year, Cilley told the
Daily payment was expected "any
day" or "within a few weeks," yet
months later, no progress had been
reported. Cilley said this was be
cause he misunderstood NIRT's
sense of time.
"I think it's fair to say the Iranians
have a very different sense of time
than we do," Cilley said, "They don't
put the same premium on time, and
it's a cultural thing. This wasn't the
foremost thing on their list of
priorities.
"From their point of view, this
probably was cleared up expediti
ously whereas from ours, it took a lot
longer than we had expected."
After nearly nine months of
negotiations and waiting, the Uni
versity has settled its claim for reim
bursement of $484,190 by National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT), ac
cording to Earl Cilley, director of
sponsored projects.
As part of the settlement, the Uni
versity reduced its bill to NIRT by
$90,000 and agreed to "tie up some
loose ends" on reports submitted to
the agency under a 1974 contract to
develop a domestic telecommunica
tions satellite system and to develop
programming recommendations for
educational television in Iran.
In return, NIRT has paid the
$394,190 balance.
The settlement came after months
of communication and waiting for
NIRT officials to respond or act. Fi
nally, Cilley and then Acting Vice
President for Business and Finance
Kenneth Creighton flew last month
to Teheran where direct negotiation
produced a settlement described as
"positive."
Problem recognition
"(The terms of the agreement) re
flect a reasonable recognition of the
problems encountered by both Stan
ford and NIRT," said Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy, who served as vice provost
for research through most of the
nine months.
The $978,000 contract originally

provided for three years of work by
the University, beginning Sept. 1,
1974; however, NIRT executed a
termination clause of the contract
last fall citing general dissatisfaction
with work being performed.
The University then had 90 days to
complete work and issue the pro
duct, a set of final reports.
Work was done primarily by Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan and Communication Prof.
Edwin Parker, as well as graduate
students in both departments.
Before final reports were issued,
Massy ordered a group of faculty

from the Engineering and Communi
cation Departments to review the re
ports.
Very satisfied
Last March 10, a Daily article
quoted members of that group as
saying they had been very satisfied
that work done was within the spirit
and letter of the contract.
"There is a written contract and
what our report says is that the work
fulfills the contract," Adjunct Electri
cal Engineering Prof. H. Taylor How
ard said. "We were unanimous in our
