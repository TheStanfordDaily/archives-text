# Stanford settles Iran claim

### Mike Charlson 
After nearly nine months of
negotiations and waiting, the Uni
versity has settled its claim for reim
bursement of $484,190 by National
Iranian Radio-Television (NIRT), ac
cording to Earl Cilley, director of
sponsored projects.
As part of the settlement, the Uni
versity reduced its bill to NIRT by
$90,000 and agreed to "tie up some
loose ends" on reports submitted to
the agency under a 1974 contract to
develop a domestic telecommunica
tions satellite system and to develop
programming recommendations for
educational television in Iran.
In return, NIRT has paid the
$394,190 balance.
The settlement came after months
of communication and waiting for
NIRT officials to respond or act. Fi
nally, Cilley and then Acting Vice
President for Business and Finance
Kenneth Creighton flew last month
to Teheran where direct negotiation
produced a settlement described as
"positive."
Problem recognition
"(The terms of the agreement) re
flect a reasonable recognition of the
problems encountered by both Stan
ford and NIRT," said Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy, who served as vice provost
for research through most of the
nine months.
The $978,000 contract originally

provided for three years of work by
the University, beginning Sept. 1,
1974; however, NIRT executed a
termination clause of the contract
last fall citing general dissatisfaction
with work being performed.
The University then had 90 days to
complete work and issue the pro
duct, a set of final reports.
Work was done primarily by Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan and Communication Prof.
Edwin Parker, as well as graduate
students in both departments.
Before final reports were issued,
Massy ordered a group of faculty

from the Engineering and Communi
cation Departments to review the re
ports.
Very satisfied
Last March 10, a Daily article
quoted members of that group as
saying they had been very satisfied
that work done was within the spirit
and letter of the contract.
"There is a written contract and
what our report says is that the work
fulfills the contract," Adjunct Electri
cal Engineering Prof. H. Taylor How
ard said. "We were unanimous in our
opinion."
