# The
						way Stanford spent your summer vacation:
## 
### 
It was a summer of events/Car
ter killed the B-1 — at least for
now. Hundreds of thousands of
acres of timberland were re
duced to cinders as fires roared
through the West, aided by the
same severe drought which
threatened the crops in the U.S.'
largest agricultural state and left
millicns in the grip of forced con
servation programs. Bert Lance
lost in his bid to counter negative
reports of his activities as he was
added to the list of politicians
who fell in the '70s.
At the University, there were
events as well which may have
some important repercussions
this fall.
Franklin blasts schools
The summer began as members of the
Class of 1977 received their diplomas amid
the pomp of commencement:
Stanford Daily, June 21 —America's school
system is crippled by racial discrimination

and poor financing, according to John Hope
Franklin, 1977 commencement speaker.
In his June 12 address, the University of
Chicago historian said the "long, night
marish fight" to achieve educational equal
ity has yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is mediocre or
worse."
He blamed this on public reluctance to
break socioeconomic barriers and failure to
correct uneven distribution of funds.
"Racial and ethnic discrimination in the
United States deserves your attention at
least as much as apartheid in South Africa,"
Franklin said. "I would not equate the two
evils, but I would not find the distant one
more deserving than the nearer one."
His South Africa remarks prompted
applause, especially from graduates who
wore armbands and carried anti-apartheid
placards on their caps as a demonstration of
support for 294 students arrested at an Old
Union sit-in last May 9.
Later, in his farewell to the class, President
Richard Lyman said social institutions are in
bad repute and can be saved only if people
try at least modest reform attempts and if
they "trust each other just a little."
He urged graduates to "come to grips with
the problem . . . and for this, only two ap
proaches are really possible.
"We can seek out heroes to replace the
managers, and in effect give them an open
mandate to save us from our institutions and
ourselves," Lyman said.
"Or we can use our institutions to im
prove, curb, or reform themselves and each
other."
Administrative
musical chairs
Many had speculated that students return
ing this fall would see an entirely new set of
top administrative officers since vacancies
opened in two of the five vice presidencies
and three of the six assistants to the presi
dent last year.
Instead, University search committees re
commended persons already in the upper
echelons of the administration to fill the
openings. Consequently, musical chairs of
sorts occurred in the top administration.

'Daily' appeal
Stanford Daily, June 21 — More than six
years have passed since Palo Alto police

searched the Stanford Daily offices, and the
U.S. Supreme Court announced in June that
it needs a response from the Daily before
deciding whether it will rule on the constitu
tionality of that search.
The City of Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County have already asked the Supreme
Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling
that the search was illegal and unconstitu
tional.
The appeal stemmed from a lawsuit the
Daily filed against certain members of the
Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Office after
a raid by Palo Alto Police at the Daily offices
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won the suit in both the
federal district cou rt and in the appeals court
level.
The raid took place when four Palo Alto
police officers carrying a search warrant en
tered the Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and reporters' notes.
They were trying to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants in an April
9, 1971 riot at Stanford Hospital in which
several persons were injured.
Labor loses
And there were labor problems:
Stanford Daily, June 21 — United Stanford
Employees (USE) has been ordered to
"cease and desist" from two unfair labor
practices after the union was found guilty of
violating a section of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
In his ruling, Administrative Law Judge
Ferrold Shapiro found the union guilty of
distributing notices to newly hired employes
demanding that they join the union, and of
filing a lawsuit against three other employes
who refused to join USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal the
ruling to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) General Counsel's Office in
Washington D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a year
after the University first filed charges with
the NLRB accusing USE of:
— Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)";
— Maintaining a grievance against the Uni
versity "seeking to require employe
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union)";

— Filing suit against University employes
Charles Hall, Luep Del Real and Ed Bartal,
"seeking to compel said employes to be
come full members of (the union)"; and
— Refusing to permit University employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to res
ign from full membership in the union.
In his ruling, that USE violated labor law by
distributing notices demanding that new
workers join the union, Shapiro said the
practice "constitutes an implied threat of
reprisal calculated to interfere with the
employe's statutory right to refrain from any
and all union activities."
Not so many frat rats
Stanford Daily, June 21 — Nine of the 13
fraternities here did not meet their Univer
sity pledge quotas during spring rush, ac
cording to Tom Hornbeak, assistant row di
rector.
As a result, fraternities will probably step
up their efforts to rush transfer students in

the fall, said Peter McCook, vice president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Oct. 7 is the final deadline for meeting the
quota.
Fraud charges
Stanford Daily, June 28 — Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
associate professor of surgery here, met
with top administrators in June to discuss
the latest in a series of allegations about his
work, according to John Schwartz, assistant
vice president for medical affairs.
The University learned earlier in June that
Lucas may have made conflicting statements
about whether he has submitted certain arti
cles to journals for publication, Schwartz
said.
Lucas reported to his sponsoring agency,
the National Institute of Health (NIH) that he
had submitted seven articles to scientific
journals for publication, said James Scriver,
an NIH investigator in Washington, D.C.
