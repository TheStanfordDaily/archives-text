# The 						way Stanford spent your summer vacation:
## 
### 
It was a summer of events/Car
ter killed the B-1 — at least for
now. Hundreds of thousands of
acres of timberland were re
duced to cinders as fires roared
through the West, aided by the
same severe drought which
threatened the crops in the U.S.'
largest agricultural state and left
millicns in the grip of forced con
servation programs. Bert Lance
lost in his bid to counter negative
reports of his activities as he was
added to the list of politicians
who fell in the '70s.
At the University, there were
events as well which may have
some important repercussions
this fall.
Franklin blasts schools
The summer began as members of the
Class of 1977 received their diplomas amid
the pomp of commencement:
Stanford Daily, June 21 —America's school
system is crippled by racial discrimination

and poor financing, according to John Hope
Franklin, 1977 commencement speaker.
In his June 12 address, the University of
Chicago historian said the "long, night
marish fight" to achieve educational equal
ity has yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is mediocre or
worse."
He blamed this on public reluctance to
break socioeconomic barriers and failure to
correct uneven distribution of funds.
"Racial and ethnic discrimination in the
United States deserves your attention at
least as much as apartheid in South Africa,"
Franklin said. "I would not equate the two
evils, but I would not find the distant one
more deserving than the nearer one."
His South Africa remarks prompted
applause, especially from graduates who
wore armbands and carried anti-apartheid
placards on their caps as a demonstration of
support for 294 students arrested at an Old
Union sit-in last May 9.
Later, in his farewell to the class, President
Richard Lyman said social institutions are in
bad repute and can be saved only if people
try at least modest reform attempts and if
they "trust each other just a little."
He urged graduates to "come to grips with
the problem . . . and for this, only two ap
proaches are really possible.
"We can seek out heroes to replace the
managers, and in effect give them an open
mandate to save us from our institutions and
ourselves," Lyman said.
"Or we can use our institutions to im
prove, curb, or reform themselves and each
other."
Administrative
musical chairs
Many had speculated that students return
ing this fall would see an entirely new set of
top administrative officers since vacancies
opened in two of the five vice presidencies
and three of the six assistants to the presi
dent last year.
Instead, University search committees re
commended persons already in the upper
echelons of the administration to fill the
openings. Consequently, musical chairs of
sorts occurred in the top administration.
To sort out who's now who, see page 6.
'Daily' appeal
Stanford Daily, June 21 — More than six
years have passed since Palo Alto police

searched the Stanford Daily offices, and the
U.S. Supreme Court announced in June that
it needs a response from the Daily before
deciding whether it will rule on the constitu
tionality of that search.
The City of Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County have already asked the Supreme
Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling
that the search was illegal and unconstitu
tional.
The appeal stemmed from a lawsuit the
Daily filed against certain members of the
Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Office after
a raid by Palo Alto Police at the Daily offices
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won the suit in both the
federal district cou rt and in the appeals court
level.
The raid took place when four Palo Alto
police officers carrying a search warrant en
tered the Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and reporters' notes.
They were trying to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants in an April
9, 1971 riot at Stanford Hospital in which
several persons were injured.
Labor loses
And there were labor problems:
Stanford Daily, June 21 — United Stanford
Employees (USE) has been ordered to
"cease and desist" from two unfair labor
practices after the union was found guilty of
violating a section of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
In his ruling, Administrative Law Judge
Ferrold Shapiro found the union guilty of
distributing notices to newly hired employes
demanding that they join the union, and of
filing a lawsuit against three other employes
who refused to join USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal the
ruling to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) General Counsel's Office in
Washington D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a year
after the University first filed charges with
the NLRB accusing USE of:
— Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)";
— Maintaining a grievance against the Uni
versity "seeking to require employe
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union)";

— Filing suit against University employes
Charles Hall, Luep Del Real and Ed Bartal,
"seeking to compel said employes to be
come full members of (the union)"; and
— Refusing to permit University employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to res
ign from full membership in the union.
In his ruling, that USE violated labor law by
distributing notices demanding that new
workers join the union, Shapiro said the
practice "constitutes an implied threat of
reprisal calculated to interfere with the
employe's statutory right to refrain from any
and all union activities."
Not so many frat rats
Stanford Daily, June 21 — Nine of the 13
fraternities here did not meet their Univer
sity pledge quotas during spring rush, ac
cording to Tom Hornbeak, assistant row di
rector.
As a result, fraternities will probably step
up their efforts to rush transfer students in

the fall, said Peter McCook, vice president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Oct. 7 is the final deadline for meeting the
quota.
Fraud charges
Stanford Daily, June 28 — Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
associate professor of surgery here, met
with top administrators in June to discuss
the latest in a series of allegations about his
work, according to John Schwartz, assistant
vice president for medical affairs.
The University learned earlier in June that
Lucas may have made conflicting statements
about whether he has submitted certain arti
cles to journals for publication, Schwartz
said.
Lucas reported to his sponsoring agency,
the National Institute of Health (NIH) that he
had submitted seven articles to scientific
journals for publication, said James Scriver,
an NIH investigator in Washington, D.C.

cation next month.
But Schriver said he later received reports
that Lucas stated he had not submitted the
articles. The reports are based on Lucas' tes
timony during court interrogatories earlier
this year, Scriver said.
Lucas was not available for comment.
Fewer transfers
Stanford Daily, June 28 — "A jam-up in the
pipeline" is causing Stanford to admit about
half as many transfers for this fall than are
usually admitted, according to Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions.
Fewer students are stopping out, Harga
don said, and those that did stop out are
returning to complete their degrees,
thereby causing a "jam-up."
Also, about 100 more persons accepted
places in the Class of 1981 than had been
expected, he said.
Sit-in trials
Trials for 294 persons arrested at Old
Union last May 9 are still in progress and are
expected to continue through Oct. 3, ac
cording to Municipal Court Judge Edward
Scoyen.
Some 235 of the defendants entered not
guilty pleas and requested jury trials.
The remaining demonstrators, who en
tered guilty or no contest pleas, have been
placed on probation for six months and
fined $65.
A complete status report is coming later
this week.
Water rationing
Stanford Daily, July 8 — Northern Califor
nia's second straight winter of drought has
resulted in mandatory water rationing which
went into effect in Palo Alto July 1.

With allotments to be made on a sliding
scale based on last year's consumption for
the same month, and with fines for over
consumption, Palo Alto joins most other
Peninsula cities and water agencies which
have already started rationing programs of
their own.
Ecological eviction
Stanford Daily, July 15 — A campus recycl
ing center which Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis said has been "a headache for
the whole year" recently received an evic
tion notice from the University.
The recycling operation on Pampas Lane
caused traffic problems and had garbage in
public view, he said.
But Enid Pearson, conservation director of
the Peninsula Conservation Center which
runs the recycling operation, said the opera
tion has been "very successful."
Mavis said that complaints about the re
cycling center had come from nearby credit
union, day care and food service operations.
Commons goes wet
Approval of an application to sell beer on
campus broke a long dry spell at eating es
tablishments on campus this past summer.
For the first time in the University's history,
beer and wine may be purchased at Encina
Commons.
The application, originally filed in July
1975, was approved by the California Al
coholic Beverages Control Commission last
April, and the cool brew began to flow in late
June after facility alterations.
Commons Manager Norma Young said
customers should expect to show identifica
tion at least once in the serving line. Formal
identification cards with a photo are re
quired, she said.

More summer red hots
Stanford Daily, July 22 — Enrollment for
this year's summer session was 3287, up 21
from last year, and that's "a promising sign
of stability," according to Michael Oman,
director of the summer session.
Summer enrollment had declined the
previous five years, Oman noted. This year's
increase was "not a reversal of the trends
we've had," he cautioned.
More labor woes
Stanford Daily, July 29 — Several computer
operators here chose to be suspended for
three days rather than accept positions as
lead operators. As a result, the University
ran some shifts without lead operators.
The refusals followed a University deci
sion to change the classifications of various
computer operators at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP).
Three United Stanford Employees (USE)
members were suspended for a total of four
days for refusing to accept lead operator
posts, according to Jim Berk, former USE
president.
Water, water nowhere
Stanford Daily, Aug. 2 — California's cur
rent drought has killed over $50,000 worth of
campus vegetation, although the recent
heat wave has not had any particular nega
tive effects here, according to Herb Fong,
grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The primary victims of the drought have
been large eucalyptus trees, Fong said, with
over 100 perishing in the last two years. He
placed the value at more than $500 each.

Crowds assembled outside the court of Municipal Court Judge Edward Scoyen after one of the
opening days of the hearings during July. Oct. 3 is scheduled to be the last day for hearings on
charges of criminal trespass and failure to disperse stemming from a May 9 sit-in at Old Union.
Some 294 persons were arrested during the protest against University proxy votes on issues
dealing witn South African investment.
It was a summer of events/Car

Ecological eviction
Stanford Daily, July 15 — A campus recycl
ing center which Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis said has been "a headache for
the whole year" recently received an evic
tion notice from the University.
The recycling operation on Pampas Lane
caused traffic problems and had garbage in
public view, he said.
But Enid Pearson, conservation director of
the Peninsula Conservation Center which
runs the recycling operation, said the opera
tion has been "very successful."
Mavis said that complaints about the re
cycling center had come from nearby credit
union, day care and food service operations.
Commons goes wet
Approval of an application to sell beer on
campus broke a long dry spell at eating es
tablishments on campus this past summer.
For the first time in the University's history,
beer and wine may be purchased at Encina
Commons.
The application, originally filed in July
1975, was approved by the California Al
coholic Beverages Control Commission last
April, and the cool brew began to flow in late
June after facility alterations.
Commons Manager Norma Young said
customers should expect to show identifica
tion at least once in the serving line. Formal
identification cards with a photo are re
quired, she said.

More summer red hots
Stanford Daily, July 22 — Enrollment for
this year's summer session was 3287, up 21
from last year, and that's "a promising sign
of stability," according to Michael Oman,
director of the summer session.
Summer enrollment had declined the
previous five years, Oman noted. This year's
increase was "not a reversal of the trends
we've had," he cautioned.
More labor woes
Stanford Daily, July 29 — Several computer
operators here chose to be suspended for
three days rather than accept positions as
lead operators. As a result, the University
ran some shifts without lead operators.
The refusals followed a University deci
sion to change the classifications of various
computer operators at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP).
Three United Stanford Employees (USE)
members were suspended for a total of four
days for refusing to accept lead operator
posts, according to Jim Berk, former USE
president.
Water, water nowhere
Stanford Daily, Aug. 2 — California's cur
rent drought has killed over $50,000 worth of
campus vegetation, although the recent
heat wave has not had any particular nega
tive effects here, according to Herb Fong,
grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The primary victims of the drought have
been large eucalyptus trees, Fong said, with
over 100 perishing in the last two years. He
placed the value at more than $500 each.

Some 294 persons were arrested during the protest against University proxy votes on issues

It was a summer of events/Car
ter killed the B-1 — at least for
now. Hundreds of thousands of
acres of timberland were re

through the West, aided by the

threatened the crops in the U.S.'
largest agricultural state and left
millicns in the grip of forced con

lost in his bid to counter negative
reports of his activities as he was
added to the list of politicians
who fell in the '70s.
At the University, there were
events as well which may have
some important repercussions
this fall.
Franklin blasts schools
The summer began as members of the
Class of 1977 received their diplomas amid
the pomp of commencement:
Stanford Daily, June 21 —America's school
system is crippled by racial discrimination

and poor financing, according to John Hope
Franklin, 1977 commencement speaker.
In his June 12 address, the University of
Chicago historian said the "long, night
marish fight" to achieve educational equal
ity has yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is mediocre or
worse."
He blamed this on public reluctance to
break socioeconomic barriers and failure to
correct uneven distribution of funds.
"Racial and ethnic discrimination in the
United States deserves your attention at
least as much as apartheid in South Africa,"
Franklin said. "I would not equate the two
evils, but I would not find the distant one
more deserving than the nearer one."
His South Africa remarks prompted
applause, especially from graduates who
wore armbands and carried anti-apartheid
placards on their caps as a demonstration of
support for 294 students arrested at an Old
Union sit-in last May 9.
Later, in his farewell to the class, President
Richard Lyman said social institutions are in
bad repute and can be saved only if people
try at least modest reform attempts and if
they "trust each other just a little."
He urged graduates to "come to grips with
the problem . . . and for this, only two ap
proaches are really possible.
"We can seek out heroes to replace the
managers, and in effect give them an open
mandate to save us from our institutions and
ourselves," Lyman said.
"Or we can use our institutions to im
prove, curb, or reform themselves and each
other."
Administrative
musical chairs
Many had speculated that students return
ing this fall would see an entirely new set of
top administrative officers since vacancies
opened in two of the five vice presidencies
and three of the six assistants to the presi
dent last year.
Instead, University search committees re
commended persons already in the upper
echelons of the administration to fill the
openings. Consequently, musical chairs of
sorts occurred in the top administration.
To sort out who's now who, see page 6.
'Daily' appeal
Stanford Daily, June 21 — More than six
years have passed since Palo Alto police

searched the Stanford Daily offices, and the
U.S. Supreme Court announced in June that
it needs a response from the Daily before
deciding whether it will rule on the constitu
tionality of that search.
The City of Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County have already asked the Supreme
Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling
that the search was illegal and unconstitu
tional.
The appeal stemmed from a lawsuit the
Daily filed against certain members of the
Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Office after
a raid by Palo Alto Police at the Daily offices
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won the suit in both the
federal district cou rt and in the appeals court
level.
The raid took place when four Palo Alto
police officers carrying a search warrant en
tered the Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and reporters' notes.
They were trying to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants in an April
9, 1971 riot at Stanford Hospital in which
several persons were injured.
Labor loses
And there were labor problems:
Stanford Daily, June 21 — United Stanford
Employees (USE) has been ordered to
"cease and desist" from two unfair labor
practices after the union was found guilty of
violating a section of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
In his ruling, Administrative Law Judge
Ferrold Shapiro found the union guilty of
distributing notices to newly hired employes
demanding that they join the union, and of
filing a lawsuit against three other employes
who refused to join USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal the
ruling to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) General Counsel's Office in
Washington D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a year
after the University first filed charges with
the NLRB accusing USE of:
— Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)";
— Maintaining a grievance against the Uni
versity "seeking to require employe
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union)";

— Filing suit against University employes
Charles Hall, Luep Del Real and Ed Bartal,
"seeking to compel said employes to be
come full members of (the union)"; and
— Refusing to permit University employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to res
ign from full membership in the union.
In his ruling, that USE violated labor law by
distributing notices demanding that new
workers join the union, Shapiro said the
practice "constitutes an implied threat of
reprisal calculated to interfere with the
employe's statutory right to refrain from any
and all union activities."
Not so many frat rats
Stanford Daily, June 21 — Nine of the 13
fraternities here did not meet their Univer
sity pledge quotas during spring rush, ac
cording to Tom Hornbeak, assistant row di
rector.
As a result, fraternities will probably step
up their efforts to rush transfer students in

the fall, said Peter McCook, vice president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Oct. 7 is the final deadline for meeting the
quota.
Fraud charges
Stanford Daily, June 28 — Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
associate professor of surgery here, met
with top administrators in June to discuss
the latest in a series of allegations about his
work, according to John Schwartz, assistant
vice president for medical affairs.
The University learned earlier in June that
Lucas may have made conflicting statements
about whether he has submitted certain arti
cles to journals for publication, Schwartz
said.
Lucas reported to his sponsoring agency,
the National Institute of Health (NIH) that he
had submitted seven articles to scientific
journals for publication, said James Scriver,
an NIH investigator in Washington, D.C.

But Schriver said he later received reports
that Lucas stated he had not submitted the
articles. The reports are based on Lucas' tes
timony during court interrogatories earlier
this year, Scriver said.
Lucas was not available for comment.
Fewer transfers
Stanford Daily, June 28 — "A jam-up in the
pipeline" is causing Stanford to admit about
half as many transfers for this fall than are
usually admitted, according to Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions.
Fewer students are stopping out, Harga
don said, and those that did stop out are
returning to complete their degrees,
thereby causing a "jam-up."
Also, about 100 more persons accepted
places in the Class of 1981 than had been
expected, he said.
Sit-in trials
Trials for 294 persons arrested at Old
Union last May 9 are still in progress and are
expected to continue through Oct. 3, ac
cording to Municipal Court Judge Edward
Scoyen.
Some 235 of the defendants entered not
guilty pleas and requested jury trials.
The remaining demonstrators, who en
tered guilty or no contest pleas, have been
placed on probation for six months and
fined $65.
A complete status report is coming later
this week.
Water rationing
Stanford Daily, July 8 — Northern Califor
nia's second straight winter of drought has
resulted in mandatory water rationing which
went into effect in Palo Alto July 1.

With allotments to be made on a sliding
scale based on last year's consumption for
the same month, and with fines for over
consumption, Palo Alto joins most other
Peninsula cities and water agencies which
have already started rationing programs of

Not so many frat rats
Stanford Daily, June 21 — Nine of the 13
fraternities here did not meet their Univer
sity pledge quotas during spring rush, ac
cording to Tom Hornbeak, assistant row di
rector.
As a result, fraternities will probably step
up their efforts to rush transfer students in

the fall, said Peter McCook, vice president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Oct. 7 is the final deadline for meeting the
quota.
Fraud charges
Stanford Daily, June 28 — Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
associate professor of surgery here, met
with top administrators in June to discuss
the latest in a series of allegations about his
work, according to John Schwartz, assistant
vice president for medical affairs.
The University learned earlier in June that
Lucas may have made conflicting statements
about whether he has submitted certain arti
cles to journals for publication, Schwartz
said.
Lucas reported to his sponsoring agency,
the National Institute of Health (NIH) that he
had submitted seven articles to scientific
journals for publication, said James Scriver,
an NIH investigator in Washington, D.C.

Fewer transfers
Stanford Daily, June 28 — "A jam-up in the
pipeline" is causing Stanford to admit about
half as many transfers for this fall than are
usually admitted, according to Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions.
Fewer students are stopping out, Harga
don said, and those that did stop out are
returning to complete their degrees,
thereby causing a "jam-up."
Also, about 100 more persons accepted
places in the Class of 1981 than had been
expected, he said.
Sit-in trials
Trials for 294 persons arrested at Old
Union last May 9 are still in progress and are
expected to continue through Oct. 3, ac
cording to Municipal Court Judge Edward
Scoyen.
Some 235 of the defendants entered not
guilty pleas and requested jury trials.
The remaining demonstrators, who en
tered guilty or no contest pleas, have been
placed on probation for six months and
fined $65.
A complete status report is coming later
this week.
Water rationing
Stanford Daily, July 8 — Northern Califor
nia's second straight winter of drought has
resulted in mandatory water rationing which
went into effect in Palo Alto July 1.

With allotments to be made on a sliding
scale based on last year's consumption for
the same month, and with fines for over
consumption, Palo Alto joins most other
Peninsula cities and water agencies which
have already started rationing programs of
their own.
Ecological eviction
Stanford Daily, July 15 — A campus recycl
ing center which Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis said has been "a headache for
the whole year" recently received an evic
tion notice from the University.
The recycling operation on Pampas Lane
caused traffic problems and had garbage in
public view, he said.
But Enid Pearson, conservation director of
the Peninsula Conservation Center which
runs the recycling operation, said the opera
tion has been "very successful."
Mavis said that complaints about the re
cycling center had come from nearby credit
union, day care and food service operations.
Commons goes wet
Approval of an application to sell beer on
campus broke a long dry spell at eating es
tablishments on campus this past summer.
For the first time in the University's history,
beer and wine may be purchased at Encina
Commons.
The application, originally filed in July
1975, was approved by the California Al
coholic Beverages Control Commission last
April, and the cool brew began to flow in late
June after facility alterations.
Commons Manager Norma Young said
customers should expect to show identifica
tion at least once in the serving line. Formal
identification cards with a photo are re
quired, she said.

More summer red hots
Stanford Daily, July 22 — Enrollment for
this year's summer session was 3287, up 21
from last year, and that's "a promising sign
of stability," according to Michael Oman,
director of the summer session.
Summer enrollment had declined the
previous five years, Oman noted. This year's
increase was "not a reversal of the trends
we've had," he cautioned.
More labor woes
Stanford Daily, July 29 — Several computer
operators here chose to be suspended for
three days rather than accept positions as
lead operators. As a result, the University
ran some shifts without lead operators.
The refusals followed a University deci
sion to change the classifications of various
computer operators at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP).
Three United Stanford Employees (USE)
members were suspended for a total of four
days for refusing to accept lead operator
posts, according to Jim Berk, former USE
president.
Water, water nowhere
Stanford Daily, Aug. 2 — California's cur
rent drought has killed over $50,000 worth of
campus vegetation, although the recent
heat wave has not had any particular nega
tive effects here, according to Herb Fong,
grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The primary victims of the drought have
been large eucalyptus trees, Fong said, with
over 100 perishing in the last two years. He
placed the value at more than $500 each.

Crowds assembled outside the court of Municipal Court Judge Edward Scoyen after one of the

charges of criminal trespass and failure to disperse stemming from a May 9 sit-in at Old Union.
Some 294 persons were arrested during the protest against University proxy votes on issues
dealing witn South African investment.
It was a summer of events/Car
ter killed the B-1 — at least for
now. Hundreds of thousands of
acres of timberland were re
duced to cinders as fires roared
through the West, aided by the
same severe drought which
threatened the crops in the U.S.'
largest agricultural state and left
millicns in the grip of forced con
servation programs. Bert Lance
lost in his bid to counter negative
reports of his activities as he was
added to the list of politicians
who fell in the '70s.
At the University, there were
events as well which may have
some important repercussions
this fall.
Franklin blasts schools
The summer began as members of the
Class of 1977 received their diplomas amid
the pomp of commencement:
Stanford Daily, June 21 —America's school
system is crippled by racial discrimination

and poor financing, according to John Hope
Franklin, 1977 commencement speaker.
In his June 12 address, the University of
Chicago historian said the "long, night
marish fight" to achieve educational equal
ity has yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is mediocre or
worse."
He blamed this on public reluctance to
break socioeconomic barriers and failure to
correct uneven distribution of funds.
"Racial and ethnic discrimination in the
United States deserves your attention at
least as much as apartheid in South Africa,"
Franklin said. "I would not equate the two
evils, but I would not find the distant one
more deserving than the nearer one."
His South Africa remarks prompted
applause, especially from graduates who
wore armbands and carried anti-apartheid
placards on their caps as a demonstration of
support for 294 students arrested at an Old
Union sit-in last May 9.
Later, in his farewell to the class, President
Richard Lyman said social institutions are in
bad repute and can be saved only if people
try at least modest reform attempts and if
they "trust each other just a little."
He urged graduates to "come to grips with
the problem . . . and for this, only two ap
proaches are really possible.
"We can seek out heroes to replace the
managers, and in effect give them an open
mandate to save us from our institutions and
ourselves," Lyman said.
"Or we can use our institutions to im
prove, curb, or reform themselves and each
other."
Administrative
musical chairs
Many had speculated that students return
ing this fall would see an entirely new set of
top administrative officers since vacancies
opened in two of the five vice presidencies
and three of the six assistants to the presi
dent last year.
Instead, University search committees re
commended persons already in the upper
echelons of the administration to fill the
openings. Consequently, musical chairs of
sorts occurred in the top administration.
To sort out who's now who, see page 6.
'Daily' appeal
Stanford Daily, June 21 — More than six
years have passed since Palo Alto police

searched the Stanford Daily offices, and the
U.S. Supreme Court announced in June that
it needs a response from the Daily before
deciding whether it will rule on the constitu
tionality of that search.
The City of Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County have already asked the Supreme
Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling
that the search was illegal and unconstitu
tional.
The appeal stemmed from a lawsuit the
Daily filed against certain members of the
Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Office after
a raid by Palo Alto Police at the Daily offices
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won the suit in both the
federal district cou rt and in the appeals court
level.
The raid took place when four Palo Alto
police officers carrying a search warrant en
tered the Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and reporters' notes.
They were trying to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants in an April
9, 1971 riot at Stanford Hospital in which
several persons were injured.
Labor loses
And there were labor problems:
Stanford Daily, June 21 — United Stanford
Employees (USE) has been ordered to
"cease and desist" from two unfair labor
practices after the union was found guilty of
violating a section of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
In his ruling, Administrative Law Judge
Ferrold Shapiro found the union guilty of
distributing notices to newly hired employes
demanding that they join the union, and of
filing a lawsuit against three other employes
who refused to join USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal the
ruling to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) General Counsel's Office in
Washington D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a year
after the University first filed charges with
the NLRB accusing USE of:
— Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)";
— Maintaining a grievance against the Uni
versity "seeking to require employe
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union)";

— Filing suit against University employes
Charles Hall, Luep Del Real and Ed Bartal,
"seeking to compel said employes to be
come full members of (the union)"; and
— Refusing to permit University employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to res
ign from full membership in the union.
In his ruling, that USE violated labor law by
distributing notices demanding that new
workers join the union, Shapiro said the
practice "constitutes an implied threat of
reprisal calculated to interfere with the
employe's statutory right to refrain from any
and all union activities."

Administrative
musical chairs
Many had speculated that students return
ing this fall would see an entirely new set of
top administrative officers since vacancies
opened in two of the five vice presidencies
and three of the six assistants to the presi
dent last year.
Instead, University search committees re
commended persons already in the upper
echelons of the administration to fill the
openings. Consequently, musical chairs of
sorts occurred in the top administration.

'Daily' appeal
Stanford Daily, June 21 — More than six
years have passed since Palo Alto police

searched the Stanford Daily offices, and the
U.S. Supreme Court announced in June that
it needs a response from the Daily before
deciding whether it will rule on the constitu
tionality of that search.
The City of Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County have already asked the Supreme
Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling
that the search was illegal and unconstitu
tional.
The appeal stemmed from a lawsuit the
Daily filed against certain members of the
Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Office after
a raid by Palo Alto Police at the Daily offices
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won the suit in both the
federal district cou rt and in the appeals court
level.
The raid took place when four Palo Alto
police officers carrying a search warrant en
tered the Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and reporters' notes.
They were trying to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants in an April
9, 1971 riot at Stanford Hospital in which
several persons were injured.
Labor loses
And there were labor problems:
Stanford Daily, June 21 — United Stanford
Employees (USE) has been ordered to
"cease and desist" from two unfair labor
practices after the union was found guilty of
violating a section of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
In his ruling, Administrative Law Judge
Ferrold Shapiro found the union guilty of
distributing notices to newly hired employes
demanding that they join the union, and of
filing a lawsuit against three other employes
who refused to join USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal the
ruling to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) General Counsel's Office in
Washington D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a year
after the University first filed charges with
the NLRB accusing USE of:
— Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)";
— Maintaining a grievance against the Uni
versity "seeking to require employe
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union)";

— Filing suit against University employes
Charles Hall, Luep Del Real and Ed Bartal,
"seeking to compel said employes to be
come full members of (the union)"; and
— Refusing to permit University employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to res
ign from full membership in the union.
In his ruling, that USE violated labor law by
distributing notices demanding that new
workers join the union, Shapiro said the
practice "constitutes an implied threat of
reprisal calculated to interfere with the
employe's statutory right to refrain from any
and all union activities."
Not so many frat rats
Stanford Daily, June 21 — Nine of the 13
fraternities here did not meet their Univer
sity pledge quotas during spring rush, ac
cording to Tom Hornbeak, assistant row di
rector.
As a result, fraternities will probably step
up their efforts to rush transfer students in

the fall, said Peter McCook, vice president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Oct. 7 is the final deadline for meeting the
quota.
Fraud charges
Stanford Daily, June 28 — Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
associate professor of surgery here, met
with top administrators in June to discuss
the latest in a series of allegations about his
work, according to John Schwartz, assistant
vice president for medical affairs.
The University learned earlier in June that
Lucas may have made conflicting statements
about whether he has submitted certain arti
cles to journals for publication, Schwartz
said.
Lucas reported to his sponsoring agency,
the National Institute of Health (NIH) that he
had submitted seven articles to scientific
journals for publication, said James Scriver,
an NIH investigator in Washington, D.C.

But Schriver said he later received reports
that Lucas stated he had not submitted the
articles. The reports are based on Lucas' tes
timony during court interrogatories earlier
this year, Scriver said.
Lucas was not available for comment.
Fewer transfers
Stanford Daily, June 28 — "A jam-up in the
pipeline" is causing Stanford to admit about
half as many transfers for this fall than are
usually admitted, according to Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions.
Fewer students are stopping out, Harga
don said, and those that did stop out are
returning to complete their degrees,
thereby causing a "jam-up."
Also, about 100 more persons accepted
places in the Class of 1981 than had been
expected, he said.
Sit-in trials
Trials for 294 persons arrested at Old
Union last May 9 are still in progress and are
expected to continue through Oct. 3, ac
cording to Municipal Court Judge Edward
Scoyen.
Some 235 of the defendants entered not
guilty pleas and requested jury trials.
The remaining demonstrators, who en
tered guilty or no contest pleas, have been
placed on probation for six months and
fined $65.
A complete status report is coming later
this week.
Water rationing
Stanford Daily, July 8 — Northern Califor
nia's second straight winter of drought has
resulted in mandatory water rationing which
went into effect in Palo Alto July 1.

With allotments to be made on a sliding
scale based on last year's consumption for
the same month, and with fines for over
consumption, Palo Alto joins most other
Peninsula cities and water agencies which
have already started rationing programs of
their own.
Ecological eviction
Stanford Daily, July 15 — A campus recycl
ing center which Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis said has been "a headache for
the whole year" recently received an evic
tion notice from the University.
The recycling operation on Pampas Lane
caused traffic problems and had garbage in
public view, he said.
But Enid Pearson, conservation director of
the Peninsula Conservation Center which
runs the recycling operation, said the opera
tion has been "very successful."
Mavis said that complaints about the re
cycling center had come from nearby credit
union, day care and food service operations.
Commons goes wet
Approval of an application to sell beer on
campus broke a long dry spell at eating es
tablishments on campus this past summer.
For the first time in the University's history,
beer and wine may be purchased at Encina
Commons.
The application, originally filed in July
1975, was approved by the California Al
coholic Beverages Control Commission last
April, and the cool brew began to flow in late
June after facility alterations.
Commons Manager Norma Young said
customers should expect to show identifica
tion at least once in the serving line. Formal
identification cards with a photo are re
quired, she said.

More summer red hots
Stanford Daily, July 22 — Enrollment for
this year's summer session was 3287, up 21
from last year, and that's "a promising sign
of stability," according to Michael Oman,
director of the summer session.
Summer enrollment had declined the
previous five years, Oman noted. This year's
increase was "not a reversal of the trends
we've had," he cautioned.
More labor woes
Stanford Daily, July 29 — Several computer
operators here chose to be suspended for
three days rather than accept positions as
lead operators. As a result, the University
ran some shifts without lead operators.
The refusals followed a University deci
sion to change the classifications of various
computer operators at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP).
Three United Stanford Employees (USE)
members were suspended for a total of four
days for refusing to accept lead operator
posts, according to Jim Berk, former USE
president.
Water, water nowhere
Stanford Daily, Aug. 2 — California's cur
rent drought has killed over $50,000 worth of
campus vegetation, although the recent
heat wave has not had any particular nega
tive effects here, according to Herb Fong,
grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The primary victims of the drought have
been large eucalyptus trees, Fong said, with
over 100 perishing in the last two years. He
placed the value at more than $500 each.

Crowds assembled outside the court of Municipal Court Judge Edward Scoyen after one of the
opening days of the hearings during July. Oct. 3 is scheduled to be the last day for hearings on
charges of criminal trespass and failure to disperse stemming from a May 9 sit-in at Old Union.
Some 294 persons were arrested during the protest against University proxy votes on issues
dealing witn South African investment.
It was a summer of events/Car
ter killed the B-1 — at least for
now. Hundreds of thousands of
acres of timberland were re
duced to cinders as fires roared
through the West, aided by the
same severe drought which
threatened the crops in the U.S.'
largest agricultural state and left
millicns in the grip of forced con
servation programs. Bert Lance
lost in his bid to counter negative
reports of his activities as he was
added to the list of politicians
who fell in the '70s.
At the University, there were
events as well which may have
some important repercussions
this fall.
Franklin blasts schools
The summer began as members of the
Class of 1977 received their diplomas amid
the pomp of commencement:
Stanford Daily, June 21 —America's school
system is crippled by racial discrimination

and poor financing, according to John Hope
Franklin, 1977 commencement speaker.
In his June 12 address, the University of
Chicago historian said the "long, night
marish fight" to achieve educational equal
ity has yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is mediocre or
worse."
He blamed this on public reluctance to
break socioeconomic barriers and failure to
correct uneven distribution of funds.
"Racial and ethnic discrimination in the
United States deserves your attention at
least as much as apartheid in South Africa,"
Franklin said. "I would not equate the two
evils, but I would not find the distant one
more deserving than the nearer one."
His South Africa remarks prompted
applause, especially from graduates who
wore armbands and carried anti-apartheid
placards on their caps as a demonstration of
support for 294 students arrested at an Old
Union sit-in last May 9.
Later, in his farewell to the class, President
Richard Lyman said social institutions are in
bad repute and can be saved only if people
try at least modest reform attempts and if
they "trust each other just a little."
He urged graduates to "come to grips with
the problem . . . and for this, only two ap
proaches are really possible.
"We can seek out heroes to replace the
managers, and in effect give them an open
mandate to save us from our institutions and
ourselves," Lyman said.
"Or we can use our institutions to im
prove, curb, or reform themselves and each
other."

ran some shifts without lead operators.
The refusals followed a University deci
sion to change the classifications of various
computer operators at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP).
Three United Stanford Employees (USE)
members were suspended for a total of four
days for refusing to accept lead operator
posts, according to Jim Berk, former USE
president.
Water, water nowhere
Stanford Daily, Aug. 2 — California's cur
rent drought has killed over $50,000 worth of
campus vegetation, although the recent
heat wave has not had any particular nega
tive effects here, according to Herb Fong,
grounds supervisor for Plant Services.
The primary victims of the drought have
been large eucalyptus trees, Fong said, with
over 100 perishing in the last two years. He
placed the value at more than $500 each.

Crowds assembled outside the court of Municipal Court Judge Edward Scoyen after one of the
opening days of the hearings during July. Oct. 3 is scheduled to be the last day for hearings on
charges of criminal trespass and failure to disperse stemming from a May 9 sit-in at Old Union.
Some 294 persons were arrested during the protest against University proxy votes on issues
dealing witn South African investment.
It was a summer of events/Car
ter killed the B-1 — at least for
now. Hundreds of thousands of
acres of timberland were re
duced to cinders as fires roared
through the West, aided by the
same severe drought which
threatened the crops in the U.S.'
largest agricultural state and left
millicns in the grip of forced con
servation programs. Bert Lance
lost in his bid to counter negative
reports of his activities as he was
added to the list of politicians
who fell in the '70s.
At the University, there were
events as well which may have
some important repercussions
this fall.
Franklin blasts schools
The summer began as members of the
Class of 1977 received their diplomas amid
the pomp of commencement:
Stanford Daily, June 21 —America's school
system is crippled by racial discrimination

and poor financing, according to John Hope
Franklin, 1977 commencement speaker.
In his June 12 address, the University of
Chicago historian said the "long, night
marish fight" to achieve educational equal
ity has yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is mediocre or
worse."
He blamed this on public reluctance to
break socioeconomic barriers and failure to
correct uneven distribution of funds.
"Racial and ethnic discrimination in the
United States deserves your attention at
least as much as apartheid in South Africa,"
Franklin said. "I would not equate the two
evils, but I would not find the distant one
more deserving than the nearer one."
His South Africa remarks prompted
applause, especially from graduates who
wore armbands and carried anti-apartheid
placards on their caps as a demonstration of
support for 294 students arrested at an Old
Union sit-in last May 9.
Later, in his farewell to the class, President
Richard Lyman said social institutions are in
bad repute and can be saved only if people
try at least modest reform attempts and if
they "trust each other just a little."
He urged graduates to "come to grips with
the problem . . . and for this, only two ap
proaches are really possible.
"We can seek out heroes to replace the
managers, and in effect give them an open
mandate to save us from our institutions and
ourselves," Lyman said.
"Or we can use our institutions to im
prove, curb, or reform themselves and each
other."
Administrative
musical chairs
Many had speculated that students return
ing this fall would see an entirely new set of
top administrative officers since vacancies
opened in two of the five vice presidencies
and three of the six assistants to the presi
dent last year.
Instead, University search committees re
commended persons already in the upper
echelons of the administration to fill the
openings. Consequently, musical chairs of
sorts occurred in the top administration.
To sort out who's now who, see page 6.
'Daily' appeal
Stanford Daily, June 21 — More than six
years have passed since Palo Alto police

searched the Stanford Daily offices, and the
U.S. Supreme Court announced in June that
it needs a response from the Daily before
deciding whether it will rule on the constitu
tionality of that search.
The City of Palo Alto and Santa Clara
County have already asked the Supreme
Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling
that the search was illegal and unconstitu
tional.
The appeal stemmed from a lawsuit the
Daily filed against certain members of the
Palo Alto Police Department and the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Office after
a raid by Palo Alto Police at the Daily offices
April 12, 1971.
The Daily has won the suit in both the
federal district cou rt and in the appeals court
level.
The raid took place when four Palo Alto
police officers carrying a search warrant en
tered the Daily office and looked through
desks, darkroom files and reporters' notes.
They were trying to find photographic evi
dence to use against participants in an April
9, 1971 riot at Stanford Hospital in which
several persons were injured.
Labor loses
And there were labor problems:
Stanford Daily, June 21 — United Stanford
Employees (USE) has been ordered to
"cease and desist" from two unfair labor
practices after the union was found guilty of
violating a section of the National Labor Re
lations Act.
In his ruling, Administrative Law Judge
Ferrold Shapiro found the union guilty of
distributing notices to newly hired employes
demanding that they join the union, and of
filing a lawsuit against three other employes
who refused to join USE.
USE has announced that it will appeal the
ruling to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) General Counsel's Office in
Washington D.C.
Shapiro's decision came more than a year
after the University first filed charges with
the NLRB accusing USE of:
— Distributing notices to newly hired
workers "demanding or requiring
them to join and become full members
of (the union)";
— Maintaining a grievance against the Uni
versity "seeking to require employe
Charles Hall to become a full member of
(the union)";

— Filing suit against University employes
Charles Hall, Luep Del Real and Ed Bartal,
"seeking to compel said employes to be
come full members of (the union)"; and
— Refusing to permit University employes
Jimmy Cabading and Richard Haff to res
ign from full membership in the union.
In his ruling, that USE violated labor law by
distributing notices demanding that new
workers join the union, Shapiro said the
practice "constitutes an implied threat of
reprisal calculated to interfere with the
employe's statutory right to refrain from any
and all union activities."
Not so many frat rats
Stanford Daily, June 21 — Nine of the 13
fraternities here did not meet their Univer
sity pledge quotas during spring rush, ac
cording to Tom Hornbeak, assistant row di
rector.
As a result, fraternities will probably step
up their efforts to rush transfer students in

the fall, said Peter McCook, vice president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Oct. 7 is the final deadline for meeting the
quota.
Fraud charges
Stanford Daily, June 28 — Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
associate professor of surgery here, met
with top administrators in June to discuss
the latest in a series of allegations about his
work, according to John Schwartz, assistant
vice president for medical affairs.
The University learned earlier in June that
Lucas may have made conflicting statements
about whether he has submitted certain arti
cles to journals for publication, Schwartz
said.
Lucas reported to his sponsoring agency,
the National Institute of Health (NIH) that he
had submitted seven articles to scientific
journals for publication, said James Scriver,
an NIH investigator in Washington, D.C.

cation next month.
But Schriver said he later received reports
that Lucas stated he had not submitted the
articles. The reports are based on Lucas' tes
timony during court interrogatories earlier
this year, Scriver said.
Lucas was not available for comment.
Fewer transfers
Stanford Daily, June 28 — "A jam-up in the
pipeline" is causing Stanford to admit about
half as many transfers for this fall than are
usually admitted, according to Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions.
Fewer students are stopping out, Harga
don said, and those that did stop out are
returning to complete their degrees,
thereby causing a "jam-up."
Also, about 100 more persons accepted
places in the Class of 1981 than had been
expected, he said.
Sit-in trials
Trials for 294 persons arrested at Old
Union last May 9 are still in progress and are
expected to continue through Oct. 3, ac
cording to Municipal Court Judge Edward
Scoyen.
Some 235 of the defendants entered not
guilty pleas and requested jury trials.
The remaining demonstrators, who en
tered guilty or no contest pleas, have been
placed on probation for six months and
fined $65.
A complete status report is coming later
this week.
Water rationing
Stanford Daily, July 8 — Northern Califor
nia's second straight winter of drought has
resulted in mandatory water rationing which
went into effect in Palo Alto July 1.

With allotments to be made on a sliding
scale based on last year's consumption for
the same month, and with fines for over
consumption, Palo Alto joins most other
Peninsula cities and water agencies which
have already started rationing programs of
their own.
Ecological eviction
Stanford Daily, July 15 — A campus recycl
ing center which Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis said has been "a headache for
the whole year" recently received an evic
tion notice from the University.
The recycling operation on Pampas Lane
caused traffic problems and had garbage in
public view, he said.
But Enid Pearson, conservation director of
the Peninsula Conservation Center which
runs the recycling operation, said the opera
tion has been "very successful."
Mavis said that complaints about the re
cycling center had come from nearby credit
union, day care and food service operations.
Commons goes wet
Approval of an application to sell beer on
campus broke a long dry spell at eating es
tablishments on campus this past summer.
For the first time in the University's history,
beer and wine may be purchased at Encina
Commons.
The application, originally filed in July
1975, was approved by the California Al
coholic Beverages Control Commission last
April, and the cool brew began to flow in late
June after facility alterations.
Commons Manager Norma Young said
customers should expect to show identifica
tion at least once in the serving line. Formal
identification cards with a photo are re
quired, she said.

More summer red hots
Stanford Daily, July 22 — Enrollment for
this year's summer session was 3287, up 21
from last year, and that's "a promising sign
of stability," according to Michael Oman,
director of the summer session.
Summer enrollment had declined the
previous five years, Oman noted. This year's
increase was "not a reversal of the trends
we've had," he cautioned.
More labor woes
Stanford Daily, July 29 — Several computer
operators here chose to be suspended for
three days rather than accept positions as
lead operators. As a result, the University
ran some shifts without lead operators.
The refusals followed a University deci
sion to change the classifications of various
computer operators at the Stanford Linear
