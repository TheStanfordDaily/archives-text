vice president and counsel for medical affairs, to
be University counsel to coordinate the ser

Familiar faces hold some unfamiliar jobs in the
top administration here this fall following a
major reshuffling of personnel this summer.
The resignation or retirement of two vice pres
idents and two assistants to the president re
sulted in a chain reaction of job vacancies as top
jobs were filled by persons already within the
University.
Former Vice Provost for Research William
Massy has assumed the duties of vice president
for business and finance, replacing Robert Au
gsberger who resigned.
|oel Smith now acts as vice president for de
velopment, moving up from his job as special
assistant to the vice president for development.
He replaced Kenneth Cuthbertson who said last
spring he was calling it quits after successful
completion of the $300 million Campaign for
Stanford.
No new person
Massy's promotion left a vacancy in the vice
provost for research's office. The post has not
been filled though duties of the vice provost are
being performed by Gerald Lieberman, as
sociate dean of humanities and sciences. His
letterhead no.w bears the title acting vice pro
vost for research.
Smith's old job will be eliminated, he said,
and the duties he performed in that position will
be spread out among his staff.
The retirement of Secretary to the University
Fred Glover left the first of three vacancies to
appear this year on the staff of President Richard
l ym.'n. Renamed assistant to the president for
trustee affairs, the position was filled by Robert

Hamrdla, former director of the Academic In
formation Center.
AIC promotion
At the AIC, Elizabeth Meyer was promoted to
director from assistant director, and Anne
Coxon took Meyer's old job, a promotion from
her previous position as preprofessional secret

Former Legal Adviser to the President James
Siena announced his resignation late last spring
to take an appointment to a top post at the
Pentagon, resulting in the second presidential
staff vacancy.
After Siena's departure, President Lyman de
cided to consolidate administrative legal ser
vices and appointed John Schwartz, associate
vice president and counsel for medical affairs, to
be University counsel to coordinate the ser
vices.
No replacement
No replacement for the medical school post
will be named because the duties of the medical
center legal staff will remain under Schwartz'
control. Specific duties will be spread out
among members of his staff at the medical
center, according to Robert Beyers, director of
the University News Service.
Later, the naming of Stone to replace Thomas
Newell as director of the alumni association left
a third opening in Lyman's staff.
Earlier this month it was announced that Jean
Holmes Fetter would assume Stone's duties.
She has been associate director of both the
Center for Teaching and Learning and the Lilly
Program for Faculty Renewal.
