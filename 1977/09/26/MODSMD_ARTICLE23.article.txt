# Lyman stresses faculty teaching

"More and better attention
is being paid to teaching per
formance" in evaluating fa
culty members, according to
President Richard Lyman.
Lyman challenged the
"myth" which holds that "fa
culty members in a university
become so wrapped up in their
research that they regard stu
dents and teaching respon
sibilities as a necessary evil for
receiving their paychecks."
He told new transfer stu
dents last week that "it is no
more coincidence that many of
the most distinguished re
search scholars . . . are also
among the most popular,
stimulating, responsive and re
spected teachers of under
graduates.
"The presence on all sides of
an active, lively quest for new
knowledge and fresh interpre
tations is one of the positive
reasons for choosing a major
university."
Increasing possibilities
Lyman also noted that "in re
cent years at Stanford, the pos
sibilities for undergraduates to
participate directly in research
being carried on by faculty
have increased markedly."
He cited the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies and the Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO) as
two places to seek research
opportunities.
â€¢ While realizing that "Stan
ford cannot have the intimate
community atmosphere of a
Reed or a Swarthmore/' Lyman
stated that what the University
"does have is a range of intel
lectual activities greater than
any small college can attain."
In a speech to incoming
freshmen last week, Lyman
said, "Once you're in, it's easy
to stay at Stanford, easy to
avoid such obvious pitfalls as
flunking out.
"What's difficult is to be sure
thatyou are making the most of
it as much of the time as is hu
manly possible."
"Human beings get into ruts
very readily; as a species we
crave security and simplicity;

we like to have things recog
nizable and familiar."
Different experiences
Explaining that no two indi
viduals have the same experi
ence here, Lyman said, "there
is no one model of the 'fully
effective student,' nor of the
'fully effective member of the
University.' "
. Lyman suggested to
freshmen that "you might do
well, every now and again,
when the excitement has worn
off, to look afresh at what you
are doing and how you are
doing it."
In a speech to new graduate
students yesterday, Lyman
cautioned students that "it can
be disconcerting ... to dis
cover that being Iree to con
centrate on what interests you
can have its drawbacks, in
that you are not as free as you
once were to scatter your
energies and to go on taking
meals from the widely diver
sified academic smorgasbord.
Lyman stressed that it will be
up to each student to "make
postgraduate work and re
search liberating rather than
confining, a pathway to deeper
understanding and greater
possibilities for your leading a
useful and satisfying life, not a
corridor to obscurity."
