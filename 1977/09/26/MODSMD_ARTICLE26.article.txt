# Fulbright, Rhodes
## Meeting on study grants slated 
### Jon Hornsby 
Students interested in 1978-
79 overseas scholarships will
be assembling Wednesday at 7
p.m. for a meeting at the
Bechtel International Center.
On hand will be campus Ful
bright adviser Lee Ziegler and
overseas opportunities adviser
Jeanette Philips to describe
awards available and to distri
bute applications.
Also present will be former

scholars from all programs to
discuss their past experiences
informally over refreshments.
Deadlines for Fulbright-Hays
applications is Oct. 14 and the
preliminary deadline for
Rhodes and Marshall applica
tions is Oct. 7.
According to Ziegler, Ful
bright scholarships are availa
ble to graduating seniors and
graduate students working to
ward advanced degrees. Scho
lars spend nine to 12 months in
a foreign country studying
fields ranging from pure sci
ence to creative and perform
ing arts.
Oxford study
Rhodes scholars spend two
or more years of graduate work
at the University of Oxford in
England.
Applicants must be under 24
years old. Marshall scholars
may attend any university in
the United Kingdom and must
be under 26 years old.
For the upcoming year, 525
Fulbright and other grants will
be awarded nationally. Last Ap
ril, 13 students from the Uni
versity won grants.
According to Philips, 30 Mar

shall scholarships are awarded
annually to students in the U.S.
The Rhodes program makes 32
awards.
Philips said she feels the
University has many outstand
ing students who could obtain
such scholarships, but are not
applying.
She noted, "In recent years,
compared to other universities
of the same caliber, Stanford
has not produced as many
scholars as it could. Last year we
had only one Rhodes Scholar
— Dan Barker, who will study
economics at Oxford — and we
had no Marshall Scholars."
Philips remarked that the se
lection process for these scho
larships is "more difficult and
subjective" depending highly
upon interviews and letters of
recommendation.
Validity and feasibility
For Fulbright grants, the
major stress is placed on the
validity and feasibility of the
proposed study plans, Zeigler
said. The student decides
whether he or she would like
to study at a university or inde
pendently, Zeigler said. Fie
may decide to concentrate

work in libraries, around urban
communities, or may under
take a project which involves
travel and contact with the na
tives of the country.
Ziegler also pointed out that
each country has priority fields
and age preferences, so it usu
ally works out that grad stu
dents do not compete with
seniors.
Screening of applicants for
all scholarships begins with a
faculty team interview. Appli
cations are then sent to various
committees around the coun
try. Final choices of Fulbright
scholars are made in April
Rhodes Scholars are informed
of their selection after inter
views usually in January.
The following list of 1977
Fulbright scholarship reci
pients includes their fields and
countries of study:
Sandra Ballil, Old Norse. Iceland; Keith Cal
houn. international relations. Germany. Martha
Corcoran, religious studies, Germany. Donald

mer, biomedical engineering, Denmark, Stephen
Greene early modern English history, England

Students interested in 1978-
79 overseas scholarships will
be assembling Wednesday at 7
p.m. for a meeting at the
Bechtel International Center.
On hand will be campus Ful
bright adviser Lee Ziegler and
overseas opportunities adviser
Jeanette Philips to describe
awards available and to distri
bute applications.
Also present will be former

scholars from all programs to
discuss their past experiences
informally over refreshments.
Deadlines for Fulbright-Hays
applications is Oct. 14 and the
preliminary deadline for
Rhodes and Marshall applica
tions is Oct. 7.
According to Ziegler, Ful
bright scholarships are availa
ble to graduating seniors and
graduate students working to
ward advanced degrees. Scho
lars spend nine to 12 months in
a foreign country studying
fields ranging from pure sci
ence to creative and perform
ing arts.
Oxford study
Rhodes scholars spend two
or more years of graduate work
at the University of Oxford in
England.
Applicants must be under 24
years old. Marshall scholars
may attend any university in
the United Kingdom and must
be under 26 years old.
For the upcoming year, 525
Fulbright and other grants will
be awarded nationally. Last Ap
ril, 13 students from the Uni
versity won grants.
According to Philips, 30 Mar

shall scholarships are awarded
annually to students in the U.S.
The Rhodes program makes 32
awards.
Philips said she feels the
University has many outstand
ing students who could obtain
such scholarships, but are not
applying.
She noted, "In recent years,
compared to other universities
of the same caliber, Stanford
has not produced as many
scholars as it could. Last year we
had only one Rhodes Scholar
— Dan Barker, who will study
economics at Oxford — and we
had no Marshall Scholars."
Philips remarked that the se
lection process for these scho
larships is "more difficult and
subjective" depending highly
upon interviews and letters of
recommendation.
Validity and feasibility
For Fulbright grants, the
major stress is placed on the
validity and feasibility of the
proposed study plans, Zeigler
said. The student decides
whether he or she would like
to study at a university or inde
pendently, Zeigler said. Fie
may decide to concentrate

work in libraries, around urban
communities, or may under
take a project which involves
travel and contact with the na
tives of the country.
Ziegler also pointed out that
each country has priority fields
and age preferences, so it usu
ally works out that grad stu
dents do not compete with
seniors.
Screening of applicants for
all scholarships begins with a
faculty team interview. Appli
cations are then sent to various
committees around the coun
try. Final choices of Fulbright
scholars are made in April
Rhodes Scholars are informed
of their selection after inter
views usually in January.
