## The 						University's position on a possible police strike 
### 
The Stanford Police Officers Association has voted to
start a strike against the University Monday, Sept. 26.
While the University would like to see differences re
solved without a strike, the Department of Public Safety
has made all necessary arrangements to insure the safety of
the campus in the event of a walkout.
SPOA includes 18 deputized officers and 18 community
service officers.
Eight deputized supervisory personnel in the department
are not part of the bargaining unit and will remain on the
job. Santa Clara County sheriff's patrols of the campus will
be increased. Supervisors and employees in other depart
ments have been urged to make sure their areas are properly
locked and secured after normal working hours.

Background on negotiations
Negotiations for a new contract between SPOA and the
University began in early June. On Aug. 19, with the
assistance of a federal mediator, SPOA's bargaining team
presented the University with an offer which they said
would resolve all outstanding issues.
The University agreed to this proposal, which included
across-the-board increases of more than 20% for both depu
tized officers and community service officers over a three
year period. This would bring the maximum pay for depu
tized officers to $21,312 by the fall of 1979. The maxi
mum for community service officers would reach $13,764!
Wages are not an issue in this dispute.
On Aug. 19 the University also agreed to SPOA pro
posals on several noneconomic items. The SPOA bargaining
team unanimously recommended approval of the contract
to SPOA members. Unfortunately, ratification failed by a
narrow margin in a vote of the members five days later.
Since then SPOA has resurrected many of its original
demands and engaged in an on-going publicity campaign
both within and beyond the University community.
In this campaign SPOA has charged the University has
been unresponsive to the association's concerns in several
areas, including retirement, disability plans, and various
"safety" issues. These accusations simply do not reflect an
accurate portrayal of the University's position.
Where the University stands
With regard to retirement, for example, the University
proposed, and the SPOA bargaining team agreed to a joint
committee to study alternatives to the current plan. Pro
posed changes in social security and legal restrictions im
posed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

1974 (ERISA) make any change quite complex.
On disability benefits, SPOA already enjoys a more
generous disability program than other University em
ployees. The plan is financed completely by the University,
unlike most public police departments which require sub
stantial employee contributions. Nevertheless, the Universi
ty has proposed additional improvement of the program.*
SPOA has falsely charged that the University has no
concern for numerous safety-related items. In fact the Uni
versity has agreed with the SPOA's concern for more effec
tive maintenance of police vehicles and proposed ways in
which this can be achieved.
The University has not agree# with SPOA's position that
safety requires deputized officers to be armed with larger
guns and soft-headed bullets. SPOA officers have character
ized these bullets as safer because the soft head produces an
expansion effect on impact and is supposedly less likely to
ricochet.
While the University has agreed that changes in weap
onry and related equipment should be topics of mutual
discussion, it has been firm in saying that any final decision
must rest with the director of public safety. The University
has proposed a joint committee with SPOA to discuss all
safety-related concerns.
SPOA has demanded that community service officers no
longer be responsible for house checks of vacationing cam
pus residents, saying that making such checks after dark
constituted a safety problem. .
The University has pointed out that these checks typical
ly occur only during the summer vacation period and are
structured to insure maximum safety. The University
agreed to limit the checks whenever possible to daylight
hours. But it feels quite strongly that house checks pro
vided by community service officers are an important ser
vice and should not be prohibited by contract.
What happens next ?
SPOA has received strike sanction from the Central
Labor Council of Santa Clara County. During meetings with
a federal mediator last week, SPOA proposed that 10 out
standing issues be submitted to binding arbitration. Since
these covered virtually everything (except wages) that had
been subject to negotiation over the summer, the University
could not agree to such a proposal.
The University regrets that SPOA's members failed to
ratify a contract unanimously recommended by SPOA's
bargaining team. The University remains willing to continue
discussions with SPOA if the association requests this.
