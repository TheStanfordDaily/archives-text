Committee makes gloomy forecast
Washington — The congressional Joint
Economic Committee issued a gloomy forecast
yesterday that foresees little improvement in
unemployment or inflation next year and lays a
big share of the blame on the Federal Reserve
Board.
Congress and the Carter administration
must share the burden, the report said, be
cause they are not being very "adventure
some" in devisinga taxing and spending policy
to get the economy back on its feet.
The committee scoffed at the idea that the
government can't successfully fight inflation
and unemployment at the same time. As
examples of workable solutions, the panel
suggested less reliance on taxes to pay for un
employment compensation and Social Sec
urity and proposed that revenues from Presi
dent )immy Carter's energy taxes be used to
help states cut their sales taxes.
In its mid-year review of the economy, the
committee said that despite optimistic as
sumptions about consumer and government
spending, "a fairly sluggish performance" is
expected because of weakness in business in
vestment and the nation's deteriorating inter
national trade position.
Israel OKs U.S. peace talk plan
Jerusalem — Israel approved a four-point
U.S. compromise proposal yesterday to re
convene the Geneva Middle East peace con
ference, the government announced.
The proposal calls for a single all-Arab dele
gation at the opening of resumed talks, fol
lowed by working-group talks between Israel
and individual countries and the inclusion of
Palestinians — but not known members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) —
among the Jordanian representatives, the an
nouncement said.
It was approved at a meeting of Prime Minis
ter Menahem Begin and his cabinet.
If accepted by the Arabs, the formula could
break a long deadlock over the question of
who will represent the Palestinians in negotia
tions. But early Arab reaction was negative.
Canal negotiators testify today
Washington — The Carter administration
planned to take its fight for the Panama Canal
treaty to Congress today as the committee that
must ratify it begins hearings on relinquishing
control of the waterway.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and treaty
negotiators Ellsworth Bunker and Sol Linowitz
were scheduled to testify today before the Se
nate Foreign Relations Committee, which has
direct jurisdiction over treaties.
Defense Secretary Harold Brown and Gen.
George Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, were to discuss the treaty with the House
International Relations Committee.
The treaty has been signed formally by Pres
ident Carter and Panamanian leader OmarTor
rijos but cannot become legally binding until it
receives Senate ratification.
Monetary Fund asks faster growth
Washington — In a policy shift that could
mean more jobs for workers around the world,
the International Monetary Fund is urging its
member nations to speed up economic growth
wherever possible to erase the threat of a re
newed recession.
The week-long annual joint meeting of the
IMF and the World Bank will open here Mon
day. President Jimmy Carter will deliver a wel
coming address to the delegates, mostly fi
nance ministers and central bankers from the
IMF's 131 member nations.
Frugal L.A. seeks Olympics
Colorado Springs, Colo. — The city of Los
Angeles, stressing its spartan bid to the end,
was named over New York Sunday to be the
American host for the 1984 Summer Olympic
Games.
The U.S. Olympic Committee, meeting only
briefly in secret after hearing the final presen
tations from each city, voted 55-39 to accept
the proposal of Los Angeles, which last staged
the Olympic Games in the United States in
1932. The USOC decision virtually assures the
California city that it will stage the Games.
The International Olympic Committee will
make the final selection next May in Athens,
but no other cities in the world have expressed
an interest in hosting the Games, although
they still have another month in which to do
so.
Maddox suffers heart attack
Atlanta — Lester Maddox, the former Geor
gia governor who gained national attention as
a segregationist restaurant owner, was listed in
critical condition last night after suffering a
heart attack, hospital officials said.
Maddox suffered chest pains about 9 p.m.
and was brought by ambulance to a Smyrna,
Ga., hospital north of Atlanta, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
Maddox's doctor was with him in the hospi
tal's intensive care unit, she said.
Maddox, 61, preceded President Carter as
Georgia governor in the late 19605. He also
served as Carter's lieutenant governor from
1971 to 1974, and the two often feuded pub
licly.
Maddox ran unsuccessfully for another term
as governor in 1974 and was the American In
dependent Party's presidential candidate in
1976.
Since then he has returned to the restaurant

business, and he also has embarked recently
on a nightclub career in a two-man act with a
young black man.
Israel to expel 25 blacks
Tel Aviv — Twenty-five black Americans who
Israel claims intended to settle here illegally as
members of a "black Hebrew" sect will be
expelled from the country today, Israeli offi
cials said.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said the
three men, six women and 16 children have
been held in a police lockup near Ben-Curion
Airport since Friday, when they tore up their
U.S. passports and return-flight tickets as au
thorities tried to deport them.
The U.S. Embassy here said the group has
denied the Israeli charge and said they are
Presbyterians who came to Israel to visit Christ
ian holy places. They were part of a tour group
that flew here from New York last Wednesday,
the embassy said.
Pope, at 80, says he feels fragile
Vatican City — Pope Paul VI, on the eve of his
80th birthday, told 50,000 faithful in St. Peter's
Square yesterday he feels "the fragility of
being human."
The Pope, who looked in good health and
spoke firmly at Mass and his traditional noon
blessing, today becomes the fifth pontiff of
this century to reign as an octogenarian. Of the
century's seven popes, all but two continued
in their reigns after reaching age 80.
"In our soul we are divided with two senti
ments: one is relative to our age . . . which
preannounces that our end in the order of
temporal life is approaching," Pope Paul said
in the emotional address.

Colorado Springs, Colo. — The city of Los
Angeles, stressing its spartan bid to the end,
was named over New York Sunday to be the
American host for the 1984 Summer Olympic
Games.
The U.S. Olympic Committee, meeting only
briefly in secret after hearing the final presen
tations from each city, voted 55-39 to accept
the proposal of Los Angeles, which last staged
the Olympic Games in the United States in
1932. The USOC decision virtually assures the
California city that it will stage the Games.
The International Olympic Committee will
make the final selection next May in Athens,
but no other cities in the world have expressed
an interest in hosting the Games, although
they still have another month in which to do
so.
Maddox suffers heart attack
Atlanta — Lester Maddox, the former Geor
gia governor who gained national attention as
a segregationist restaurant owner, was listed in
critical condition last night after suffering a
heart attack, hospital officials said.
Maddox suffered chest pains about 9 p.m.
and was brought by ambulance to a Smyrna,
Ga., hospital north of Atlanta, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
Maddox's doctor was with him in the hospi
tal's intensive care unit, she said.
Maddox, 61, preceded President Carter as
Georgia governor in the late 19605. He also
served as Carter's lieutenant governor from
1971 to 1974, and the two often feuded pub
licly.
Maddox ran unsuccessfully for another term
as governor in 1974 and was the American In
dependent Party's presidential candidate in
1976.
Since then he has returned to the restaurant

business, and he also has embarked recently
on a nightclub career in a two-man act with a
young black man.
Israel to expel 25 blacks
Tel Aviv — Twenty-five black Americans who
Israel claims intended to settle here illegally as
members of a "black Hebrew" sect will be
expelled from the country today, Israeli offi
cials said.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said the
three men, six women and 16 children have
been held in a police lockup near Ben-Curion
Airport since Friday, when they tore up their
U.S. passports and return-flight tickets as au
thorities tried to deport them.
The U.S. Embassy here said the group has
denied the Israeli charge and said they are
Presbyterians who came to Israel to visit Christ
ian holy places. They were part of a tour group
that flew here from New York last Wednesday,
the embassy said.
Pope, at 80, says he feels fragile
Vatican City — Pope Paul VI, on the eve of his
80th birthday, told 50,000 faithful in St. Peter's
Square yesterday he feels "the fragility of
being human."
The Pope, who looked in good health and
spoke firmly at Mass and his traditional noon
blessing, today becomes the fifth pontiff of
this century to reign as an octogenarian. Of the
century's seven popes, all but two continued
in their reigns after reaching age 80.
"In our soul we are divided with two senti
ments: one is relative to our age . . . which
preannounces that our end in the order of
temporal life is approaching," Pope Paul said
in the emotional address.

Committee makes gloomy forecast
Washington — The congressional Joint
Economic Committee issued a gloomy forecast
yesterday that foresees little improvement in
unemployment or inflation next year and lays a
big share of the blame on the Federal Reserve
Board.
Congress and the Carter administration
must share the burden, the report said, be
cause they are not being very "adventure
some" in devisinga taxing and spending policy
to get the economy back on its feet.
The committee scoffed at the idea that the
government can't successfully fight inflation
and unemployment at the same time. As
examples of workable solutions, the panel
suggested less reliance on taxes to pay for un
employment compensation and Social Sec
urity and proposed that revenues from Presi
dent )immy Carter's energy taxes be used to
help states cut their sales taxes.
In its mid-year review of the economy, the
committee said that despite optimistic as
sumptions about consumer and government
spending, "a fairly sluggish performance" is
expected because of weakness in business in
vestment and the nation's deteriorating inter
national trade position.
Israel OKs U.S. peace talk plan
Jerusalem — Israel approved a four-point
U.S. compromise proposal yesterday to re
convene the Geneva Middle East peace con

The proposal calls for a single all-Arab dele

lowed by working-group talks between Israel
and individual countries and the inclusion of
Palestinians — but not known members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) —
among the Jordanian representatives, the an
nouncement said.
It was approved at a meeting of Prime Minis
ter Menahem Begin and his cabinet.
If accepted by the Arabs, the formula could
break a long deadlock over the question of
who will represent the Palestinians in negotia
tions. But early Arab reaction was negative.
Canal negotiators testify today

Committee makes gloomy forecast
Washington — The congressional Joint
Economic Committee issued a gloomy forecast
yesterday that foresees little improvement in
unemployment or inflation next year and lays a
big share of the blame on the Federal Reserve
Board.
Congress and the Carter administration
must share the burden, the report said, be
cause they are not being very "adventure
some" in devisinga taxing and spending policy
to get the economy back on its feet.
The committee scoffed at the idea that the
government can't successfully fight inflation
and unemployment at the same time. As
examples of workable solutions, the panel
suggested less reliance on taxes to pay for un
employment compensation and Social Sec
urity and proposed that revenues from Presi
dent )immy Carter's energy taxes be used to
help states cut their sales taxes.
In its mid-year review of the economy, the
committee said that despite optimistic as
sumptions about consumer and government
spending, "a fairly sluggish performance" is
expected because of weakness in business in
vestment and the nation's deteriorating inter
national trade position.
Israel OKs U.S. peace talk plan
Jerusalem — Israel approved a four-point
U.S. compromise proposal yesterday to re
convene the Geneva Middle East peace con
ference, the government announced.
The proposal calls for a single all-Arab dele
gation at the opening of resumed talks, fol
lowed by working-group talks between Israel
and individual countries and the inclusion of
Palestinians — but not known members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) —
among the Jordanian representatives, the an
nouncement said.
It was approved at a meeting of Prime Minis
ter Menahem Begin and his cabinet.
If accepted by the Arabs, the formula could
break a long deadlock over the question of
who will represent the Palestinians in negotia
tions. But early Arab reaction was negative.
Canal negotiators testify today
Washington — The Carter administration
planned to take its fight for the Panama Canal
treaty to Congress today as the committee that
must ratify it begins hearings on relinquishing
control of the waterway.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and treaty
negotiators Ellsworth Bunker and Sol Linowitz
were scheduled to testify today before the Se
nate Foreign Relations Committee, which has
direct jurisdiction over treaties.
Defense Secretary Harold Brown and Gen.
George Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, were to discuss the treaty with the House
International Relations Committee.
The treaty has been signed formally by Pres
ident Carter and Panamanian leader OmarTor
rijos but cannot become legally binding until it
receives Senate ratification.
Monetary Fund asks faster growth
Washington — In a policy shift that could
mean more jobs for workers around the world,
the International Monetary Fund is urging its
member nations to speed up economic growth
wherever possible to erase the threat of a re
newed recession.
The week-long annual joint meeting of the
IMF and the World Bank will open here Mon
day. President Jimmy Carter will deliver a wel
coming address to the delegates, mostly fi
nance ministers and central bankers from the
IMF's 131 member nations.
Frugal L.A. seeks Olympics
Colorado Springs, Colo. — The city of Los
Angeles, stressing its spartan bid to the end,
was named over New York Sunday to be the
American host for the 1984 Summer Olympic
Games.
The U.S. Olympic Committee, meeting only
briefly in secret after hearing the final presen
tations from each city, voted 55-39 to accept
the proposal of Los Angeles, which last staged
the Olympic Games in the United States in
1932. The USOC decision virtually assures the
California city that it will stage the Games.
The International Olympic Committee will
make the final selection next May in Athens,
but no other cities in the world have expressed
an interest in hosting the Games, although
they still have another month in which to do
so.
Maddox suffers heart attack
Atlanta — Lester Maddox, the former Geor
gia governor who gained national attention as
a segregationist restaurant owner, was listed in
critical condition last night after suffering a
heart attack, hospital officials said.
Maddox suffered chest pains about 9 p.m.
and was brought by ambulance to a Smyrna,
Ga., hospital north of Atlanta, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
Maddox's doctor was with him in the hospi
tal's intensive care unit, she said.
Maddox, 61, preceded President Carter as
Georgia governor in the late 19605. He also
served as Carter's lieutenant governor from
1971 to 1974, and the two often feuded pub
licly.
Maddox ran unsuccessfully for another term
as governor in 1974 and was the American In
dependent Party's presidential candidate in
1976.
Since then he has returned to the restaurant

business, and he also has embarked recently
on a nightclub career in a two-man act with a
young black man.
Israel to expel 25 blacks
Tel Aviv — Twenty-five black Americans who
Israel claims intended to settle here illegally as
members of a "black Hebrew" sect will be
expelled from the country today, Israeli offi
cials said.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said the
three men, six women and 16 children have
been held in a police lockup near Ben-Curion
Airport since Friday, when they tore up their
U.S. passports and return-flight tickets as au
thorities tried to deport them.
The U.S. Embassy here said the group has
denied the Israeli charge and said they are
Presbyterians who came to Israel to visit Christ
ian holy places. They were part of a tour group
that flew here from New York last Wednesday,
the embassy said.
Pope, at 80, says he feels fragile
Vatican City — Pope Paul VI, on the eve of his
80th birthday, told 50,000 faithful in St. Peter's
Square yesterday he feels "the fragility of
being human."
The Pope, who looked in good health and
spoke firmly at Mass and his traditional noon
blessing, today becomes the fifth pontiff of
this century to reign as an octogenarian. Of the
century's seven popes, all but two continued
in their reigns after reaching age 80.
"In our soul we are divided with two senti
