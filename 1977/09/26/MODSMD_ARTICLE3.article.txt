eral law.
The files, spanning a period from

thorized persons is a violation of
both University policy and a 1974
federal statute known.as the Buckley
Amendment, according to Robert
Houghton, assistant registrar.
University privacy regulations,
adopted in 1972, state "Information
about individuals should be assigned
an appropriate life span and stored
with all practicable security, consis
tent with the level of sensitivity of the
material."
The ad hoc presidential committee
which drafted these regulations gave
as an example for the above regula
tion, "sensitive information . ..such
as making an offer of employment
. . . should not be kept beyond its
time of usefulness."
One file, containing correspon
dence relating to job applicants such
as complete resumes and final dis
position of applications, related to a
position that was filled more than
five years ago.
File contents
The files, some marked "inactive,"
contain such information as:
—the accounts of two suicides,
one attempted suicide and the acci
dental death of an employe;
—student drug violations and ar

administrator's statement to the
Overseas Studies Office that if offi
cial drug policy was enforced 20
people could be sent home;

—reversal of an admissions deci
sion for a foreign student — the ap
plication was originally judged "sim
ply as too weak for admission";
—the proceedings of Overseas
Student Judicial Council actions and
a summary of overseas proceedings
at one campus for a four-year period.
(According to a University commit
tee's factfinding on privacy proce
dures, students' disciplinary records
are maintained only by the Presi
dent's Office, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office, and furthermore all such
files are maintained in locked files.
The maintenance of such records in
the Overseas Studies Office has ap
parently never been disclosed.);
—detailed medical records, in
cluding psychiatric reports and med
ical histories;
—itemized salary data of Stanford
faculty and staff, and comparative
salary data of a foreign university;
—discussions relating to the
methods of payment for overseas
campus foreign staff in order to help
them receive tax breaks from their
governments;
—notification to an overseas

center that two students had partici
pated in political activities here but
were no longer involved in protests;
—correspondence dealing with
students' financial problems;
—apparently unsubstantiated al
legations of racism, and threatened
legal action;
—a faculty member advising the
Overseas Studies Office that a cam
pus administrator not be involved in
relocation of a campus because of his
incompetency in this area;
