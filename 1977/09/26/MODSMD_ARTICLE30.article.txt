## Stanford overpowers Illini Benjamin deals Cards 37-24 victory 
### Bruce Anderson 
It was a classic matchup.
One team from the Big 10. The other
from the Pac-8.
One coach, a defensive mastermind.
The other, a brilliant offensive
strategist.
One team featuring a Midwestern
run - right - at - 'em attack. The other
team living by the pass.
"If you have the ability tothrow it (the
ball) and can do it successfully, then
yes, it's a good weapon," said Illinois
coach Gary Moeller before the 1977
season. "However, I don't think you're
going to find a successful team that
throws the ball all the time because
that's not the way you win football
games.
"The key to winning in the Big 10 is to
have a tough defense."
It may work fine in the Big 10 but
tough defense took a beating West
Coast style Saturday as Stanford scored
on five of six first-half possessions on
the way to a 37-24 romp over Illinois in
the Cardinal home opener.
Offense well oiled
A second-half team in its first two
games this season, the Cardinal offen
sive machinery got in gear early against

the Fighting I Mini and had rolled up 248
yards and a 24-7 advantage by halftime.
"In the first game we ran well. In the
second game we passed well. Today,"
said halfback Darrin Nelson, "we
started getting it all together."
Nelson had it together. The much
heralded freshman sensation ran for 89
yards, caught five passes for another 42
yards and scored Stanford's first
touchdown before coming out of the
game early in the third quarter with leg
cramps caused by a salt deficiency.
The coaches, wanting to rest Nelson,
held him out of the rest of the game
although he was ready to come back in
at any time.
Cult Hero?
While Nelson immediately won an
enthusiastic following in the student
rooting section with his repertoire of
incredible moves, his performance was
overshadowed by that of a more sea
soned member of the Card backfield.
Before the game Stanford coach Bill
Walsh had said quarterback Guy Ben
jamin was due for "a truly outstanding
performance very soon." Benjamin
made his coach a sage prognosticator.
The 6-foot-4 quarterback completed
30 of 41 parses for 272 yards, three

touchdowns and no interceptions.
"We can pass against anybody if we
have the protection," Benjamin said. "I
had a lot of time today."
"I don't think he's done better,"
Walsh said of Benjamin. "If he has had
any better games in the past, he's got a
great career behind him, too."
Coaching contrast
Saturday's game matched two first
year coaches: Illinois' Moeller, who
was termed a "defensive genius" by
Stanford's Walsh, and Walsh, an ar
chitect of one of the National Football
League's most potent offenses while an
assistant at Cincinnati.
Moeller engineered the defense at
Michigan for Bo Schembechler. Under
Moeller, the Wolverines' defense led
the nation in fewest points allowed per
game during the 1974 and 1976 seasons.
The last time Illinois played Stanford
was the 1974 Cardinal home opener and
the lllini beat their hosts 41-7.
This time out the opportunistic Car
dinals capitalized on three fumble re
coveries, an interception and the
strong right leg of freshman Ken Naber
to jump to a 31-7 lead by early in the.
third quarter.

Ralph Phillips pounces on an Il
linois fumble; Guy Benjamin
lofts a pass toward tight end
Marty Smith; linebacker Gordy
Ceresino narrows in on an lllini
ball carrier; Ken Naber drills the
ball through the uprights, and
the Stanford yell leaders spur the
crowd of 50,500.


Naber, a soccer-style kicker from
Cincinnati, drilled field goals from 43,
36 and 38 yards out in the first half. The
sidewinder has not missed on five field
goal attempts this season.
Trailing 7-6 in the second quarter,
Benjamin gave to Nelson on a trap over
center with third-and-goal from the 5,
and the 5-foot-9, 170-pound halfback
found daylight and the goal line to put
Stanford ahead to stay.
Benjamin then found a leaping James
Lofton in the end zone on the point
after conversion attempt.
But the Stanford offense had barely
cleared the field when Illinois coughed

the ball up on the lllini 27.
Stanford converted the turnover into
three points on the third Naber field
goal.
Early Christmas
Stanford, which played free of tur
novers for the first time this season, was
the beneficiary of another lllini gift as
cornerback John Pigott intercepted a
Steger aerial at the Stanford 32.
It took Benjamin less than a minute to
drive the Cards downfield and find
fullback Billy Anderson speeding to the
right side of the end zone with a six
yard touchdown pass.
Taking up where they left off before
intermission, the bumbling lllini fum

bled a Brad Fox punt and Mark Hill re
covered on the Illinois 38.
With third-and-nine from the 25, Ben
jamin took a few steps to the right and
fired to Lofton who was streaking down
the right sideline. Lofton grabbed the
ball in midstride on the two and took it
into the end zone.
Effective reserve
Ahead 31-7, the Card defense
seemed to relax and substitute quar
terback Mike McCray began to move
the lllini offense. McCray ran from the
option for 64 yards and completed
seven of 10 passes.
McCray led the lllini to two
touchdowns and a field goal in the sec

ond half, the final touchdown coming
with 29 seconds left in the game and
Stanford's second-team defense, num
bering six freshmen, on the field.
By game's end the lllini had accumu
lated more total yardage than the Car
dinals, 434 yards to 416.
"Our defense played with a lot of en
thusiasm and effort but there were a
few mechanical breakdowns," Walsh
said. "We have to improve in a lot of
areas."
The lllini's Moeller, who preaches by
the Book of Defense, must have felt
Walsh's sentiments about his own de
fense and uttered a silent, "Amen."

found daylight and the goal line to put
Stanford ahead to stay.
Benjamin then found a leaping James
Lofton in the end zone on the point
after conversion attempt.
But the Stanford offense had barely
cleared the field when Illinois coughed

the ball up on the lllini 27.
Stanford converted the turnover into
three points on the third Naber field
goal.
Early Christmas
Stanford, which played free of tur
novers for the first time this season, was
the beneficiary of another lllini gift as
cornerback John Pigott intercepted a
Steger aerial at the Stanford 32.
It took Benjamin less than a minute to
drive the Cards downfield and find
fullback Billy Anderson speeding to the
right side of the end zone with a six
yard touchdown pass.
Taking up where they left off before
intermission, the bumbling lllini fum

bled a Brad Fox punt and Mark Hill re
covered on the Illinois 38.
With third-and-nine from the 25, Ben
jamin took a few steps to the right and
fired to Lofton who was streaking down
the right sideline. Lofton grabbed the
ball in midstride on the two and took it
into the end zone.
Effective reserve
Ahead 31-7, the Card defense
seemed to relax and substitute quar
terback Mike McCray began to move
the lllini offense. McCray ran from the
option for 64 yards and completed
seven of 10 passes.
McCray led the lllini to two
touchdowns and a field goal in the sec

ond half, the final touchdown coming
with 29 seconds left in the game and
Stanford's second-team defense, num
bering six freshmen, on the field.
By game's end the lllini had accumu
lated more total yardage than the Car
dinals, 434 yards to 416.
"Our defense played with a lot of en
thusiasm and effort but there were a
few mechanical breakdowns," Walsh
said. "We have to improve in a lot of
areas."
The lllini's Moeller, who preaches by
the Book of Defense, must have felt
Walsh's sentiments about his own de
fense and uttered a silent, "Amen."

Freshman Darrin Nelson plunges ahead for a gain. Nelson gained 89
yards in Saturday's 37-24 victory over Illinois.
It was a classic matchup.
One team from the Big 10. The other
from the Pac-8.
One coach, a defensive mastermind.
The other, a brilliant offensive
strategist.
One team featuring a Midwestern
run - right - at - 'em attack. The other
team living by the pass.
"If you have the ability tothrow it (the
ball) and can do it successfully, then
yes, it's a good weapon," said Illinois
coach Gary Moeller before the 1977
season. "However, I don't think you're
going to find a successful team that
throws the ball all the time because
that's not the way you win football
games.
"The key to winning in the Big 10 is to
have a tough defense."
It may work fine in the Big 10 but
tough defense took a beating West
Coast style Saturday as Stanford scored
on five of six first-half possessions on
the way to a 37-24 romp over Illinois in
the Cardinal home opener.
Offense well oiled
A second-half team in its first two
games this season, the Cardinal offen
sive machinery got in gear early against

the Fighting I Mini and had rolled up 248
yards and a 24-7 advantage by halftime.
"In the first game we ran well. In the
second game we passed well. Today,"
said halfback Darrin Nelson, "we
started getting it all together."
Nelson had it together. The much
heralded freshman sensation ran for 89
yards, caught five passes for another 42
yards and scored Stanford's first
touchdown before coming out of the
game early in the third quarter with leg
cramps caused by a salt deficiency.
The coaches, wanting to rest Nelson,
held him out of the rest of the game
although he was ready to come back in
at any time.
Cult Hero?
While Nelson immediately won an
enthusiastic following in the student
rooting section with his repertoire of
incredible moves, his performance was
overshadowed by that of a more sea
soned member of the Card backfield.
Before the game Stanford coach Bill
Walsh had said quarterback Guy Ben
jamin was due for "a truly outstanding
performance very soon." Benjamin
made his coach a sage prognosticator.
The 6-foot-4 quarterback completed
30 of 41 parses for 272 yards, three

touchdowns and no interceptions.
"We can pass against anybody if we
have the protection," Benjamin said. "I
had a lot of time today."
"I don't think he's done better,"
Walsh said of Benjamin. "If he has had
any better games in the past, he's got a
great career behind him, too."
Coaching contrast
Saturday's game matched two first
year coaches: Illinois' Moeller, who
was termed a "defensive genius" by
Stanford's Walsh, and Walsh, an ar
chitect of one of the National Football
League's most potent offenses while an
assistant at Cincinnati.
Moeller engineered the defense at
Michigan for Bo Schembechler. Under
Moeller, the Wolverines' defense led
the nation in fewest points allowed per
game during the 1974 and 1976 seasons.
The last time Illinois played Stanford
was the 1974 Cardinal home opener and
the lllini beat their hosts 41-7.
This time out the opportunistic Car
dinals capitalized on three fumble re
coveries, an interception and the
strong right leg of freshman Ken Naber
to jump to a 31-7 lead by early in the.
third quarter.

jamin was due for "a truly outstanding
performance very soon." Benjamin
made his coach a sage prognosticator.
The 6-foot-4 quarterback completed
30 of 41 parses for 272 yards, three

touchdowns and no interceptions.
"We can pass against anybody if we
have the protection," Benjamin said. "I
had a lot of time today."
"I don't think he's done better,"
Walsh said of Benjamin. "If he has had
any better games in the past, he's got a
great career behind him, too."
Coaching contrast
Saturday's game matched two first
year coaches: Illinois' Moeller, who
was termed a "defensive genius" by
Stanford's Walsh, and Walsh, an ar
chitect of one of the National Football
League's most potent offenses while an
assistant at Cincinnati.
Moeller engineered the defense at
Michigan for Bo Schembechler. Under
Moeller, the Wolverines' defense led
the nation in fewest points allowed per
game during the 1974 and 1976 seasons.
The last time Illinois played Stanford
was the 1974 Cardinal home opener and
the lllini beat their hosts 41-7.
This time out the opportunistic Car
dinals capitalized on three fumble re
coveries, an interception and the
strong right leg of freshman Ken Naber
to jump to a 31-7 lead by early in the.
third quarter.

Marty Smith; linebacker Gordy
Ceresino narrows in on an lllini
ball carrier; Ken Naber drills the
ball through the uprights, and
the Stanford yell leaders spur the
crowd of 50,500.


Naber, a soccer-style kicker from
Cincinnati, drilled field goals from 43,
36 and 38 yards out in the first half. The
sidewinder has not missed on five field
goal attempts this season.
Trailing 7-6 in the second quarter,
Benjamin gave to Nelson on a trap over
center with third-and-goal from the 5,
and the 5-foot-9, 170-pound halfback
found daylight and the goal line to put
Stanford ahead to stay.
Benjamin then found a leaping James
Lofton in the end zone on the point
after conversion attempt.
But the Stanford offense had barely
cleared the field when Illinois coughed

the ball up on the lllini 27.
Stanford converted the turnover into
three points on the third Naber field
goal.
Early Christmas
Stanford, which played free of tur
novers for the first time this season, was
the beneficiary of another lllini gift as
cornerback John Pigott intercepted a
Steger aerial at the Stanford 32.
It took Benjamin less than a minute to
drive the Cards downfield and find
fullback Billy Anderson speeding to the
right side of the end zone with a six
yard touchdown pass.
Taking up where they left off before
intermission, the bumbling lllini fum

bled a Brad Fox punt and Mark Hill re
covered on the Illinois 38.
With third-and-nine from the 25, Ben
jamin took a few steps to the right and
fired to Lofton who was streaking down
the right sideline. Lofton grabbed the
ball in midstride on the two and took it
into the end zone.
Effective reserve
Ahead 31-7, the Card defense
seemed to relax and substitute quar
terback Mike McCray began to move
the lllini offense. McCray ran from the
option for 64 yards and completed
seven of 10 passes.
McCray led the lllini to two
touchdowns and a field goal in the sec

ond half, the final touchdown coming
with 29 seconds left in the game and
Stanford's second-team defense, num
bering six freshmen, on the field.
By game's end the lllini had accumu
lated more total yardage than the Car
dinals, 434 yards to 416.
"Our defense played with a lot of en
thusiasm and effort but there were a
few mechanical breakdowns," Walsh
said. "We have to improve in a lot of
areas."
The lllini's Moeller, who preaches by
the Book of Defense, must have felt
Walsh's sentiments about his own de
fense and uttered a silent, "Amen."

Freshman Darrin Nelson plunges ahead for a gain. Nelson gained 89
yards in Saturday's 37-24 victory over Illinois.
It was a classic matchup.
One team from the Big 10. The other
from the Pac-8.
One coach, a defensive mastermind.
The other, a brilliant offensive
strategist.
One team featuring a Midwestern
run - right - at - 'em attack. The other
team living by the pass.
"If you have the ability tothrow it (the
ball) and can do it successfully, then
yes, it's a good weapon," said Illinois
coach Gary Moeller before the 1977
season. "However, I don't think you're
going to find a successful team that
throws the ball all the time because
that's not the way you win football
games.
"The key to winning in the Big 10 is to
have a tough defense."
It may work fine in the Big 10 but
tough defense took a beating West
Coast style Saturday as Stanford scored
on five of six first-half possessions on
the way to a 37-24 romp over Illinois in
the Cardinal home opener.
Offense well oiled
A second-half team in its first two
games this season, the Cardinal offen
sive machinery got in gear early against

the Fighting I Mini and had rolled up 248
yards and a 24-7 advantage by halftime.
"In the first game we ran well. In the
second game we passed well. Today,"
said halfback Darrin Nelson, "we
started getting it all together."
Nelson had it together. The much
heralded freshman sensation ran for 89
yards, caught five passes for another 42
yards and scored Stanford's first
touchdown before coming out of the
game early in the third quarter with leg
cramps caused by a salt deficiency.
The coaches, wanting to rest Nelson,
held him out of the rest of the game
although he was ready to come back in
at any time.
Cult Hero?
While Nelson immediately won an
enthusiastic following in the student
rooting section with his repertoire of
incredible moves, his performance was
overshadowed by that of a more sea
soned member of the Card backfield.
