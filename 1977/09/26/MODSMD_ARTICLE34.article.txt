# Watson here to host Pro-Am
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Tom Watson, the leading
money-winner of the 1977 pro
fessional golf tour and winner
of the Masters, British Open
and three other tournaments
this year, arrives at the Stan
ford Golf Course today for the
third annual Tom Watson
Pro-Am Golf Tournament.
A 1971 Stanford graduate,
Watson sponsors the tourna

ment as a benefit for the men's
golf team.
Joining the Kansas City, Mo.
native for the tournament are
20 touring pros.
Watson and his wife, Linda,
organize the tournament with
the help of Friends of Stanford
Golf. The tournament has net
ted more than $35,000 during
its first two years, with the
money going for scholarships

and non-budgeted expenses
and team travel.
"The program at Stanford is
designed to be fun," Watson
said. "The main thing is to have
a good time, and that means
competing on a national level.
As Watson discussed the
change he would like to see the
Stanford golf program un
dergo, one cannot help but
think of the metamorphosis of
the gray-eyed, tousle-haired
Midwesterner into the tour's
top golfer.
After three tour wins in 1975,
Watson went winless in 1976.
He developed a reputation
as a choke; always close until
the final 18 holes.
"You're Tom Watson, and
your reputation is that of a
young guy who goes out for
the last 18 holes of a tourna
ment in a deep-sea diving hel
met with a harikiri sword
strapped to your waist," wrote
Dan Jenkins in Sports Illus
trated.
But after Watson's brilliant
finishes in the Masters and the
British Open, where he

emerged the victor following
head-to-head battles with Jack
Nicklaus, the same writer was
talking of "the steel and nerve
of Tom Watson."
Late in 1976 Watson went to
see golf great Byron Nelson
about his game and Nelson did
two things for Watson's swing.
First, he slowed down Wat
son's swing. Second, he had
him relax his right side during
his swing.
"I now have a golf swing I'm
confident in," Watson said. "I
know how to use the ball."
Watson graduated with a
bachelor's degree in psychol
ogy. Asked if the psychology
studies at Stanford had helped
out on the fairways, Watson
said, "I wish I had more of an
ability to handle emotions."
He added, however, "Now I'm
able to handle certain situa
tions better than before; that
comes with maturity.
"I try to win the battleagainst
myself, that's the most impor
tant battle. For most golfers the
self is the biggest opponent
you have."

Watson seems to have him
self well in tow. And having
whipped that opponent, he
has gained fame and fortune.
Having achieved so much,
Watson now seeks one more
thing.
"I nope to gain the respect of
my peers," Watson said. "In an
individual sport your tourna
ment record and the recogni
tion of peers are all you can
attain."
Not to worry Tom. No
sooner said than done.
