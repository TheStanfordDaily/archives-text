# Poloists crunch UCSB in opener

Utilizing an effective fast break, the Stanford polo team
defeated U.C. Santa Barbara Saturday, 11-7, in the Cardinals' first
game of the fall season.
Senior Rick Johannsen and junior Doug Burke led the team
with three goals apiece.
First-year coach Dante Dettamanti said after the game that he
was pleased with the team's performance.
"We made some errors," he said, "but it was only our first
game. We need to get used to the referees' calls."
Dettamanti complimented the way in which the Cards ran the
offense.
"The counterattack (fast break) ran well. It's our bread and
butter, really. Our front cover play was also good. I changed the
offense in the front court and they ran it very well. There was a
good balance between the one-on-one driving and the use of
screens."
Dettamanti was particularly pleased with the performance of
freshman goalie John Gansel who recorded more than a dozen
saves.
"Gansel is one of the top goalies in the country," Dettamanti
said. "He is doing an excellent job replacing (graduated All-
American) Chris Dorst."
Halfway through the game, Burke was hit in the head and was
forced to leave the game.
"He got his bell rung," Dettamanti explained, "and couldn't
remember a thing. He remembered the warm-up but nothing
about the game or the goals he scored."
With Burke out during the second half, the coach substituted
primarily with three players, seniors Brian Roux and Brian Avery
and junior Dave Egan. Dettamanti said that he wanted to give
these players as much experience as possible. He described
Avery as "a coach's dream. He does exactly what I want him to
do."

ever, he scored three goals.
