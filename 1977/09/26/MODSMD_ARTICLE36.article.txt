# Scotchers split in Nor-Cal Tourney
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and JV
women's field hockey teams
fared well Friday and Saturday
in the Nor-Cal Preseason
Tournament at San Jose, the
season's first test for both
teams.
First-year coach Barbara
Longstreth emphasized that
the tournament games were
unofficial league games and
did not count on the teams' re
cords.
The varsity scotchers de

feated the Chico JV team 5-0
and tied the California varsity
2-2 on Friday. The following
day, Stanford only managed a
1-1 tie with the San Jose State
JVs but followed that with a 4-0
victory over the UC-Davis var
sity team.
Longstreth said the Stanford
team, which has had two
weeks of pre-season practice,
looked much better in the sec
ond half of the Davis game than
it had at any time this season.
The JV team, aided by several
of the varsity players, com
pleted the tournament with a
4-0 record. On Friday, the
scotchers were victorious over
Sacramento St. varsity, 2-1, and
UC-Davis JV 2-0. The next day,
varsity teams from Chico State
and University of Pacific fell
victim to Stanford, 1-0 and 2-0,
respectively.
Longstreth, hired in July —
well after the season's
schedule was made-up — said
the team's schedule is not as
complete as shewould likeand
she does not feel the team is
being challenged as it should
be.
