Each of us has a special reason for making Stanford his or her home
for four years. For some, it is the hope of becoming, as one eastern
school puts it, "a member of the family of educated men and women."
For others, it is the promise of financial success after graduation. Still
others choose Stanford because "Dad went there," or perhaps be
cause he didn't.
Students who join the staff of the Stanford Daily also have a variety of
reasons and ambitions. A school newspaper may be the most familiar
looking place on campus for freshmen who worked on their high
school paper. For those interested in journalism or writing as a career,
the Daily is, as a professor in the Communication Department has said,
"the most realistic communications lab around." Daily alumni have
gone on to interesting and occasionally lucrative careers with such
newsgathering organizations as the Wall Street Journal, the Los
Angeles Times, the Washington Post, the Associated Press, United
Press International, the Boston Globe and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
to name just a few.
After a few days (sometimes a few hours) on the staff, the friendship
and camaraderie of the place can become important reasons to work
for the Daily. Dorm life is fine, but there is something uniquely reward
ing about working with other people in a collective enterprise, espe
cially one which is published five days a week. The lure of the Daily as a
place to hang out in your spare time is contagious.
Finally, for those who commit a little time to the Daily and are willing
to learn some of the tricks of the trade, becoming an editor will mean
helping to make decisions for the independent Stanford Daily Publish
ing Corporation, an organization with an annual budget of more than
$300,000.
In addition, as a former editor put it, working for the Daily can give a
student "a feeling that he knows what's happening here and can
influence events." As much as administrators and student leaders may
critize the Daily, they listen.
So what can you do? Obviously, the answer is to join us, and
persevere. Bring your ideas as to what you'd like to see in the Daily,
push to see them executed, learn what journalism is all
about. Due to graduation in the spring, each fall creates a gap in the
talent on hand at the Daily. We need you to fill the gap.
For your own special reason. See you here. New staff meetings will
be held Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoons this week.
