# Police walk-out narrowly averted

### Randy Keith 
A strike by police here was nar
rowly averted late last night when
members of the Stanford Police Of
ficers Association (SPOA) voted to
accept a new three-year contract.
The 36 police and Community Ser
vice officers had been working since
July 31 without a contract and had
unanimously voted last week to walk
off the job this morning unless a new
contract was signed.
The vote followed four hours of
negotiations last night after the
SPOA requested a meeting with Uni
versity negotiators and federal
mediator Clarence Washington.
According to Priscilla Wheeler, the
terms of the new contract are as fol
lows:
—a 20 percent wage increase over
the life of the three-year contract.
This would raise the maximum for

community service officers to
$13,764 and deputized patrol officers
to $21,312 by Aug. 1, 1979.
—the retirement program would
remain the same for the present but a
committee would be formed to study
possible changes.
Weaponry choices
—community service officers
would have house checks limited to
the daylight hours.
—vehicle maintenance will be im
proved.
—weaponry choices would be dis
cussed by a committee of officers
and recommendations passed on to
the chief. The final choice of guns
and bullets would stay with the chief
in consultation with University ad
ministrators.
—the proposal also included
higher uniform allowances, and in
crease in sick leave, better vacation
provisions and larger shift pre
miums. A four-month trial of four
day, 10 hour work weeks for de
putized officers would be started.
—the disability plan would be im
proved by allowing benefits to be
paid after 20 days rather than 45 as for
other University personnel.
Wheeler said that all of the terms
would apply retroactively to Aug. 1.
Herman Williams, one of theSPOA
negotiators, said although the con
tract was ratified by a large margin,
"It's not good for the department
because morale has dropped from
zero to minus 20."
Williams added that the contract
was accepted on the advice of the
federal mediator.
Wheeler said the University was
"pleased that this was resolved short
of a strike."
