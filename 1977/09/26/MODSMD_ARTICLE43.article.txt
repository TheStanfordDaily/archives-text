# Lambert: 'We stunk'
## Spikers down SFS 
### 
Art Lambert does not mince
his words.
"We stunk and I'm happy to
win," said the Stanford wo
men's volleyball coach after his
team came back to defeat San
Francisco State 15-8, 11-15,
11-15, 15-5, 15-9 Friday in the
Cardinals' season opener in
Roble Gym.
Lambert started a squad of
five returnees from last sea
son's 9-3 team and freshman
Chris Anderson.
After breezing through the
first game 15-8, Stanford drop
ped back-to-back games 11-15,
11-15 as the Cards repeatedly
made serving errors and let
balls fall untouched inbounds,
thinkingthey were headingout
of bounds or that they were
going to be handled by a
teammate.
Leading 3-2 in the fourth
game, Stanford ran off five
points, relinquished a point to
San Francisco State, then tal
lied five more points and finally
captured the game 15-5.
The deciding game began

with a long string of service ex
changes, neither team able to
score. The Gators finally
scored first and eventually
moved to a 7-3 advantage.
But Stanford ticked off three
quick tallies to draw within one
and the Gator coach called
time out before the game slip
ped out of San Francisco
hands. Too late.
Shots began falling in for the
Cards and they jumped to a
commanding 13-7 lead.
Finally Stanford wrapped up
the game and the match, 15-9.
But Lambert was not pleased
with his charges' play.
"We did not serve well. We
did not set well. Our blocking
was poor. Our passing was
passable," Lambert said.
"We've got our work cut out
for us next Friday," Lambert
said.
Friday the UCLA Bruins in
vade the Farm with a troupe of
southern California's finest.
The Cardinals will then have a
chance to find out what sort of
season it's going to be.
