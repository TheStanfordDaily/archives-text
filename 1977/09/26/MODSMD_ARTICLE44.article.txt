### Bill Burger 
Stanford's soccer team lost
its third straight game Saturday
morning to Fullerton State, 4-1.
Fullerton led 1-0 after the
first half in which coach Nelson
Lodge said the booters missed
two easy chances to score.
Stanford scored first in the
second half to even the score
but from that point it was all
Fullerton as the visitors scored
what Lodge termed "three
nonchalant goals."
Lodge said the team's defen
sive mistakes were typical of
those committed all season by
the team. The team, largely
made up of freshmen and
sophomores, is relatively inex
perienced and Lodge feels a
more experienced team would
be winning the contests this
year's squad is losing. "If we
just had the poise we'd be 4-0,"
said Lodge.
One of these year's starters

who is doing a fine job for the
team is freshman Danny
McNevin, who Lodge coached
as a seventh grader in Fremont,
and who Lodge said he feels
could become one of Stan
ford's better players with a lit
tle more experience.
Greg Delgado, a sophomore
center, and John Heck, who
scored Stanford's lone goal
against Fullerton, have also
played well this year according
to Lodge.
Stanford's next game is
against California on Wednes
day at 2 p.m. on Stanford's
Harry Maloney soccer field.
The game is somewhat of a
tradition between the two
schools with the winner taking
home the series' own version
of the "Axe." Stanford won last
year's meeting with a 4-3 over
time victory over the Cal
squad.
