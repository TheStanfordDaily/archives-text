# Greg Kihn: he performs for love, not money
## 
### Laura Ost 
It's yearly check-in time, and
Rock 'n' Roll comes home after
a summer of reverberating
nerves and high blood pres
sure. Elvis Presley died.
Crosby, Stills and Nash re
leased a reunion album. Bruce
Springsteen finally fought his
way out of a two-year CBS
stranglehold. Bill Graham sued
Led Zeppelin after a Day on the
Green fracas.
Amid these spectaculars, an
upstart record company across
the Bay ticks steadily forward,
and recently unleashed a Real
Big Man.
Beserkeley Records is a
rambling, unmarked house in a
residential area of Berkeley;
the front door is the back
steps. The office is a thinly dis-

'We're not gonna kill any chickens'

blood. He doesn't wear
sequined platforms or safety
pins in his ears. His band plays
only the four classic rock in
struments: lead and rhythm
guitars, bass and drums.
The volume is moderate, the
tunes are well-paced.
"I'm very much into
economy of expression as far
as the music goes," says Kihn,
winding down from a daily
practice session with a smoke.
"We're not gonna kill any chic
kens . . . I'm not down on the
New Wave, I'm not up on it.
We're a band. We could have
been in any era. We could have
been in the Buddy Holly era
. . . could be now, could be in
the 60s . . . it's just good
songs."
Kihn's music seems to meld

guised kitchen: a bottle of milk
and a nibbled chocolate cake
sit on the table.
The Rubinoos?
Plastering the walls are clip
pings and publicity shots of the
label's five artists: Earthquake,
the Rubinoos, Jonathan
Richman and the Modern Lov
ers, Son of Pete and the Greg
Kihn Band.
Beserkeley is the "Home of
the Hits," or, as they say with a
grin, the "Home of the Hit,"
since only one single has ever
made the charts ("Roadrun
ner" by Richman).
But don't let the lack of hits
deceive you. Behind the wheel
of a rusty Renault chugging up
to the homestead is a guy who
could change all that: a small,
intense man in his mid-20s who
looks you straight in the eye.
You won't find his name in Rol
ling Stone or see him on the
Midnight Special yet because
he still plays small clubs and
gives interviews to just us Daily
folk.
But you will hear his music,
like "Real Big Man," on prog
ressive rock stations KSAN and
KYA-FM, and Bay Area Music
magazine says his time has
come. His name is Greg Kihn.
No safety pins
A Kihn concert won't sever
your synapses or curdle your

three eras of rock into a unique
breed. There are flashes of the
50s: Greg wears a tie onstage,
his writing is devoid of sex and
simply arranged, and he
pumps his own sound into
Buddy Holly's "Love's Mad a
Fool of You."
Reminiscent of the 60s:
Kihn's music is melodic and
sensible as opposed to impro
vised jam sessions, there is an
intended similarity to the Byrds
(Greg's 12-string is quite possi
bly the same played by Roger
McGuinn), and Greg seems to
reach for individualism over
big bucks. But he tempers trad
itions with a contemporary out
look. . . he doesn't write sexist
lyrics, he has a deep apprecia
tion for cultures other than
Americana, particularly the
Japanese, and he is as sincere
in reworking 70s poet Bruce
Springsteen's "For You" as he
was with the Holly tune.
Progressing in a VW
Greg's first recorded song
was "All the Right Reasons,"
released on Beserkeley's
Chartbusters LP. Typically, this
album offered a collection of
the label's greatest hits before
there were any hits. But don't
let the 'ack of hits deceive you.
No shooting star but progres
sing like a healthy heartbeat,
Greg is still trying to make it for

all the Right Reasons.
"No one's got a star attitude
yet," claims Kihn. "We're still
gonna drive up in the Volkswa
gen even after we can afford
the limo. We're trying to make
it. . . but I'd like to make it on
our own terms . . . Your aver
age rock star musician is a real
asshole. I mean, we're in a bus
iness that's just populated by
weirdos, it's all weird. That's
why we're rebels. I mean, I re
fuse to sell out."
Not selling out means, for
one, not signing with an estab

lished record company. If he
did, such an octopus-like or
ganization could push Greg
into the forefront, probably
make him lots of money, and
undoubtedly pinion his
creativity and independence.
All in the family
Kihn and the other Beser
keley bands virtually sprouted
with the label, their symbiotic
growth aided by real family
ties: Robbie Dunbar of Ear
thquake and Tommy of the
Rubinoos are brothers, Larry
Lynch and Steve Wright. Kihn's

drummer and bassist respec
tively, are brothers-in-law.
There are no contracts, only
understandings. There's very
little money either. In fact, Be
serkeley was at one point down
to bones when rescue came
from movie director Sam Pec
kinpah: he had used a few
bars of an Earthquake tune in
"The Getaway" and a royalty
check appeared unexpectedly
in the mail.
"We started out owing tons
of money. Now we're pretty
much at zero. You know, we're
breaking even." Greg be
comes more animated when
talk turns to music itself. "Prac
ticing is like a way of life. In
fact, I'm totally naked if we
don't play for, like, three days.
I go nuts."
Samrai inspiration
The Greg Kihn Band practices
about three hours a day; the
rest of Greg's time isn't spent
on chemical overload. He
writes (nearly all his music is
original), finding inspiration in
books, the late show, and
Samurai flicks. The Samurai
were Japanese warriors, and
Kihn's second album is heavily
based on movies like "The
Sword of Doom" and"The
Blind Swordsman."
Otherwise he reads Yokio
Mishima, listens to Tom Petty
and the Heartbreakers, and
heads a Beserkeley Softball
team which has gone unde
feated against local radio sta
tions and magazines. As a kid
in Baltimore, Kihn grew into a
baseball fanatic while parking
cars at the Orioles' stadium,
and now plays third base like
his major league hero.
"Brooks Robinson was (also)
my musical idol," Greg jokes.
"His Tastee Cake commer
cial. .
Therein lies a glimmer of
Stanford-Band-playfulness that
punctuates Kihn's musical es
capades, such as last year's
Eastern tour.
Insane tour
"We did insane things,
things no one else would ever
do ... in Boston . . . they paid
us and we decided they
needed it (the money) more
than we did and we gave it
back. The guy was so taken he
almost went to tears.

Greg filled out the Robin
Hood image in our nation's
capital. "I was at a Washington
station doing an interview. And
you gotta figure we were doing
about two, three interviews a
day and it was getting boring.
We wanted action. We wanted
reaction. You know what I
mean? I was telling 'em that we
were appearing in leather
jockstraps just to taunt 'em into
reaction.
So this guy says, "Well, if
you're not making any money
how do you pay your taxes?"
And I said, "I don't pay my
taxes. . All the phones lit up
'cause these IRS guys at noon,
off to lunch, had heard it. And
they were all on the case im
mediately, calling the station.
So I immediately had to ease
'em out, and I told 'em I was
paying 'em off in baseball cards
and rare comics and stuff like
that and nobody believed me
and they started calling Hol
lywood. It was real weird.
Anyway, we barely got out
alive."
Radical silk tie
The most outrageous touch
may have been the addition of
a tie to Kihn's levis and vest at

7 was paying 'em off in baseball cards'

tire. "I'd done about 20 shows
and all my t-shirts were dirty. I
just was sick of t-shirts ... I
decided, I want to do the most
radical thing a guy like me
could do, it would be wear a
tie. And look like the cover of
Meat the Beatles . . . I went out
to a Goodwill and I got a used
white shirt and a silk tie and I
wore it that night ... I felt like
Spencer Tracy in "Inherit the
Wind.' "
But don't let the pranks de
ceive you: Greg is serious
about his music. He started out
as a folksinger, played around
Europe and Los Angeles, and
eventually graduated to
strumming on Berkeley street
corners with Earthquake
guitarist Robbie Dunbar.
He worked at Rather Ripped
Records, which specializes in
imports (and rather rollicking
radio ads), and formed an ab
breviated band with Lynch and
Wright for occasional club

gigs. Dunbar would rush over
between sets from wherever
Earthquake was playing to lay
down a few riffs, until lead
guitarist Dave Carpender filled
out Kihn's band as it has been
for two and a half years.
Local haunts
In that time the band's musi
cianship has solidified to
match obvious enjoyment in
their work. They've played ac
ross the country and in such
local haunts as the Keystone,
the Boarding House and Win
terland, once as the opening
act for Black Sabbath, which
Greg calls a "positively
paleozoic era" baptism of fire.
They're meticulously adapt
ing the exact sound Greg
wants: Wright plays the Vox
base used by Paul Revere and
the Raiders ("it sounds as
though it's being played
through garbage cans") and
Kihn is reasonably sure his 1964
blond Rickenbacher belonged
to the Byrds.
But he makes even bor
rowed sounds his own, like
Springsteen's "For You."
Springsteen's 'Rocky'?
"I edited it severely. I left out
works like "I don't want you to

lick my sores. . Remember
how the Byrds edited "Mr.
Tambourine Man?" But it was
OK, no foul was called. Well,
that's basically what I was
shooting for here: a "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" treatment . . .
(Springsteen) dug it."
A heartfelt punch in his
voice. Greg may be a "Rocky"
of the music business except,
as he says,"I don't want to
wind up saying I could have
been a contender." Right now
he'd like to get a few singles
into AM radio to loosen it up,
"to bump off the old guys that
have been there for the last ten
years."
Those old guys, on their
tranquilizers and stabilizers,
may soon hear Greg's thump
ing beside them.
