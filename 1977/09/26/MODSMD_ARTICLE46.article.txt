# Volunteer army called successful

Santa Monica (AP) â€” The
country's all-volunteer military
force is proving successful, but
outdated personnel and re
tirement policies cost tax
payers up to $10 billion too
much each year, the Rand
Corp. said yesterday.
In a 400-page study released
yesterday, the Santa Monica
based "think tank" recom
mended major changes in
military pay and pension
policies and a shift to recruiting
career soldiers rather than
one-term enlistees to slow
down burgeoning costs.
Dr. Richard V.L. Cooper, the
senior Rand analyst who wrote

the study, also urged that more
civilians be removed from de
fense payrolls and hired in
stead on a contract basis, that
machines such as computers
be substituted for personnel
whenever possible and that
more women be recruited into
the military.
Pay raises given enlistees in
recent years have had little to
do with skyrocketing military
manpower costs, Cooper con
tends. He said the mushroom
ing from $22 billion in 1964 to
more than $50 billion in 1976
can be blamed largely on
higher expenses for civilian de
fense employes and for the
military retirement system.
