The racy English restoration

rected by third year graduate
student John Rouse.
Following "The Country
Wife" will be the February

This spring, Drama Prof.
Martin Esslin directs two
Feydeau farces, "The Purging"
and "Don't Co Walking
Around Naked."
Esslin, the latest department
addition, is one of the world's

most influential dramatic cri
tics.
His book, "The Theatre of
the Absurd," introduced this
movement and its playwrights
like Beckett and lonesco. Esslin
has also written books on
Brecht, Pinterand theory of the
stage. Before accepting the
Stanford professorship, Esslin
headed the British Broadcast
ing Company's radio drama
department.
The Drama Department's
addition of Esslin continues its
push to integrate theatrical art
with practice. Chairman
Charles Lyons said, "We as
sume that performance and
theoretical study are not two
activities which should be put
together but that they are part
of a single of asthetic experi
ment and exploration."
