# Students prompt decision
## UMass cashes in South Africa stock 
### Jim Tranquada 
The University of Massachusetts
(UMass) has divested itself of stoc
kholdings in 19 companies that oper
ate in South Africa.
The UMass Board of Trustees
voted on Sept. 14 to sell within 90
days stock valued at $680,000, ac
cording to Bernard Davidow, news
editor of the UMass-Amherst Daily
Collegian.
University investments in multina
tional corporations who operate in
South Africa have served as a focal
point for students across the country

demanding that university invest
ment policy reflect social and moral
concerns.
Over 700 California students were
arrested last spring in various non
violent actions in an effort to bring
about a change in university invest
ment policies.
A sit-in protesting South African
investments in Old Union May 9 led
to the arrest of 294 people, the
largest mass arrest in the University's
history.
UMass President Robert Wood
said he approved of the board's ac

tion and the manner in which the
students presented their case, ac
cording to Davidow.
Five months ago the board of
Trustees of Hampshire College,
Massachusetts announced they
would convert the college's entire
$200,000 stock portfolio into cash, to
be reinvested after the drafting of a
new investment policy.
The trustees' decision was precipi
tated by a four day occupation of
administrative offices by students.
On Sept. 16, the Board of Regents

or the University of California (UC)
rejected, by an 11 to six vote, a similar
proposal to sell $555 million in South
African-related stockholdings.
Report
Here, work continues on a report
commissioned by the trustees on the
possible economic effects on the
University of divestment.
It is uncertain whether the report
will be finished by the projected Oct.
1 deadline originally set by President
Richard Lyman.
