# Nielsen picks apart the pix
## Summer cinema: nobody broke the rules 
### John Nielsen 
You've heard by now that
"Star Wars" is a) wildly exciting
and stunningly visual, b) stun
ningly exciting and wildly vis
ual, c) the kind of movie no
body makes anymore. You've
also heard about Jaqueline Bis
set's wet t-shirt in "The Deep,"
as well as Robert DeNiro's
saxophone in "New York, New
York." By now most of the
major studio summer offerings
have moved onto satellite cir
cuits (drive-ins, triple features,
Memorial Auditorium), and
some have been banished en
tirely.
And so it goes. As usual, the
season saw a few multi
million-dollar failures, a few'
mutli-million dollar successes,

and several billion low-budget
pieces of guano.
As in the past, there has ari
sen a box-office successor to
an all-time box office king,
and, as expected, nobody has
heard of the best movie in the
bunch ("Black and White in
Color" — I haven't seen it).
In short, except for break
throughs in the comic-book
spin-off business, and except
for increasing belief among
film-showers that five little
theaters with 75 cent popcorn
are more profitable than 25
cent-a-box-one-room-palaces,
very little has changed at the
movies.
Technical brouhaha
Substantively there were
very few big-time exceptions to
the big-time rules this summer.
Despite the technical
brouhaha, and despite an oc
casional discovery that "what
we have here is a movie for the

seventies," nearly everything
can be seen as an extention of a
few fundamental principles of
money-making in film. They
are the same ones that were
cited as the reasons behind the
success of previous multi
million dollar successes at the
same time they were being
blamed for the failure of
equally expensive disasters.
Still, they are adhered to with
great zeal these days. As a re
sult this summer's movies were
not very good.
. First and foremost among
film edicts this season was the
Texas Chain Saw rule. In short
it holds that when choosing be
tween ten unrelated grotes
queries and one meaningful
incident, a smart producer will

always go for the former. It is a
very old rule — the "Texas
Chain Saw Massacre" is merely
the best (and not the first)
example to date — it is becom
ing more powerful with age.
Feeding frenzies
We had two fine examples of
big-budget TCS this summer:
"The Deep ' and"The Exoricst
II: The Heretic." "The Deep"
had giant eel attacks, outboard
motor fights and life-or-death
outdoor elevator struggles, as
well as 20-shark feeding fren
zies, quasi-rape-voodoo rituals
and mail truck-Moped encoun
ters (also assorted bombings,
harpoonings and neck
breakings).
There were camera angles
capturing the glory of each in
cident. Unable to think of a
single beast with the attention
span of a Great White Shark,
the producers of "The Deep"
decided to run literally every

thing that came to mind, in the
hopes that those unimpressed
by the blood-covered chicken
claw would be moved by the
sight of an eel eating Bruce
Cosset's face.
So too with the second
"Exorcist." Like "The Deep" it
had a particularly virile ances
tor, and like "The Deep" the
producers seemed unable to
settle on any particular mode
of gore. There were killer lo
custs and beds of nails entering
sets of feet. There was an ex
tremely explicit attempted Phil
lipino faith-killing attempt
(Linda Blair tried to pull out the
heart of her psychiatrist), and
some auto-eroticism that left a
taxi-driver embedded in his
windshield.

For those who wonder
whether or not gratuitous vio
lence redounds to the financial
favor of the medium, the re
sults were inconclusive. "Exor
cist II" was hooted off the sc
reen in most places, but that
may have been as much a result
of worthless acting screenplay,
acting, plot, and casting as it
was due to the Chain Saw
theory.
Similarly, if "The Deep"
cleaned up, it may not have
been entirely a result of the ac
tion. There was Jaqueline Bis
set, for instance — though she
didn't exactly distinguish her
self with her acting skill, I think
"The Deep" might have met a
Heretic fate if it had starred,
say, Shelly Winters. And the
Deep did have excellent un
derwater photography, even
though it did little more than
enable us to see each injury
with crystal clarity.

Besides, there was no mis
taking the effect of adherance
to the rule on the quality of the
pictures. As they were, both
showed great ignorance of a
few things realized long ago by
Alfred Hitchcock — that audi
ences do have saturation
points, that there is such a
thing as too much violence. Ex
citement unrelieved relieves
itself — these movies are cases
in point.
P.R. is all
Rule two involves publicity.
It holds, in effect, that publicity
is everything, particularly if the
movie in question stinks. It
may not seem important in
view of the fate of the Burton-
Blair-Fletcher thing, but there
were also examples equally
persuasive to the contrary.
Consider, for instance, the
success of "The Other Side of
Midnight." This movie grossed
upwards of $35 million even
though everyone who saw it
hated it. It wasn't successful
because of the reviews, either
— aside from "Tentacles"
and "Food of the Cods" it got
more "worst film of all-time"
ratings than most anything in
recent years. Add to that the
phenomenal lousiness of the
book, and it's easier to get a
feel for the effectiveness of a
full-page ad or two in the New
York Times.
Certainly rule two is among
the most time-honored
around. Rarely, though do we
get such a good example of
what attention to it can do.
Blood and guts
We also had war movies this
summer. They have rules of
their own: though upon
examination they seem not at
all unique. First, money
minded war movies avoid
meaningful dialogue and in
clude bombs, guns, death and
dying at every turn. Next, they
lean heavily on newsreels and
too-well-known-already inci
dents (mentioning nothing
about McArthur's early days,
when he was apparantly shuf
fled out to Pacific obscurity by
Roosevelt, and concentrating
on the West Point retirement
speech, the Senate resignation
speech, and so on).

They use impressive subti
tles to establish characters —
not caring if the characters
cannot do it themselves. If the
actors are capable, as was the
case in "Bridge," war movie
rules require a flashing back
and forth between big name
stars so rapidly as to prevent
the audience from concentrat
ing on any one performance.
This is too harsh, though —
McArthur and Bridge are pass
able movies. Still, since they
were flawed to the extent that
they followed established for
mulas, it seems reasonable to
number the faults. It doesn't

mean that Gregory Peck was
bad as The General (he imper
sonated the newsreels quite
well) or that the camera work in
"Bridge" was ineffective (it was
awesome, in a "Lawrence of
Arabia" sense). It does mean
that the studios blew big
chances by adhering to the
above standards.
The most distressing role fol
lowed this summer had to do
with "playing it safe" with a po
tential winner. This principle
insists that audiences no
longer care about dramatic ta
lent so long as they can watch
characters that look like they
belong in a Sears catalogue, or
in an episode of "Lassie." It

leads to deliberately anesthetic
performances, on the grounds
that a box-office successor, by
its nature, ought not be more
than that.
Nobody's ugly
Such was the case with "Star
Wars," a movie that could have
been much better than it was.
It was an entertaining movie to
be sure, but that phrase almost
always has a dark side. In this
case it meant that most of the
principle characters had clean
teeth and clear skin and
Mabeline eyes and no minds. It
meant that they spoke wittily,
and with perfect diction, and
that as they spoke, they dif
fused the entire thing.
Again, that's too bad. Carrie
Fischer is capable of good act
ing, and Alec Cuiness actually
provides some, but the other
heroes are monstrously mis

cast. Somebody in outer space
must be ugly — that's even true
in the comics.
The only exception to the
big-time rules this summerwas
"New York, New York." "New
York, New York" had quality
performances, and its director
had things on his mind besides
homage. For those who can ig
nore Martin Scorsese's brand
of cinematic plagiarism (he has
imitation Billie Holidays, imita
tion Tommy Dorseys, imitation
Judy Garlands, and an imita
tion New York), and withstand
occasional lapses in the impro
vised script ("You want the
kid?... I want the kid . . . You
want the kid?... I want the kid
. . . YOU CAN'T HAVE THE
LOUSY KID!") it might well be
the best of the bunch. Unfor
tunately, that's not much of a
compliment.
