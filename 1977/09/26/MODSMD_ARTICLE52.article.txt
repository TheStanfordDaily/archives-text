# Lance must still face questions

### 
Calhoun, Ga.(AP) — Former Budget
Director Bert Lance returned as a pri
vate citizen amid hometown cheers
last Thursday, still facing large debts,
government investigations and an
uncertain future.
But there was no uncertainty in
Calhoun's welcome as 1,500 relatives
and neighbors greeted Lance and his
wife Laßelle with hearty applause,
red roses and a high school band
playing "You'll Never Walk Alone."
Meanwhile, in Washington, Se
nate sources said the Justice De
partment had requested and re
ceived the transcript and exhibits of
the Senate hearings into Lance's
complicated financial dealings. A
source close to the investigation con
firmed the report.
Department sources have said in
vestigators intend to review every
aspect of the allegations against
Lance, and this apparently was part
of that effort.
Return to D.C.
Lance met with his attorney, Clark
Clifford, before leaving Washington.
He did not go to the Office of Man
agement and Budget's offices, but an
OMB aide said Lance would return to
the capital today to host a reception
for the budget and White House
staffs.
Four federal agencies are still in
vestigating Lance's banking and per
sonal financial affairs prior to his ap
pointment to head OMB .
The head of Georgia's Banking
Department, Jack Dunn, said several
questions about Lance's banking
practices would have to be resolved
before Lance could take on another
bank job.
'Not clear'
"It's not a clear yes or no on Bert,"
Dunn said.
However the NBG is a nationally
chartered bank and Dunn's office
does not have jurisdiction over it.
Deputy Asst. Atty. Gen. Peter Flah
erty said that despite Lance's resigna
tion, the investigation will continue
"as expeditiously as possible."
Lance said the trips were in the
bank's best interest.
The Internal Revenue Service is try
ing to decide if Lance owes back
taxes on the trips, while the Federal
Election Commission is checking for
possible campaign law violations.
