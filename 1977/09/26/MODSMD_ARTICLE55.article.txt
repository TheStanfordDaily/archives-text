# NAACP official blasts Bakke

Sacramento (AP) — A federal judge's ruling ordering
admission of a white medical school appliant to the
University of California at Davis was blasted yesterday by
one critic.
Virna Canson, regional director of the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Colored People, said
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Macßride showed "a
lack of sensitivity to the basic issues" by his ruling.
On Friday, Macßride ordered Rita Clancy, a 22-
year-old Russian immigrant, be allowed to enter the UC
program, where UC officials had placed her at the top of
the waiting list.
Macßride said there was a "good likelihood" she
would have been admitted if the program had not re
served 16 of its 100 slots for disadvantaged minorities.
The admissions program at the UC Davis campus is
already the target of a celebrated case filed by Allan
Bakke, another white student rejected by the medical

school in 1973 and 1974.
That case is pending now before the U.S. Supreme
Court. The court will hear arguments Oct. 12.
In the Clancy case, Carson said neither Clancy nor the
University of California were the "real parties in interest.
This great debate turns on the responsibilities of the
university to fashion effective remedies to end its his
toric discrimination against blacks and other minorities
and seek to cure the damage already done."
Canson also criticzed the press for what she termed its
"deafening silence" about the fact that the NAACP had
filed a petition to intervene in the Clancy case.
And she also complained that UC attorneys failed to
tell the NAACP about the Friday hearing where Macßride
set Oct. 13 for a preliminary hearing in the case.
In the meantime, he ordered UC to let Clancy begin
taking classes today.
