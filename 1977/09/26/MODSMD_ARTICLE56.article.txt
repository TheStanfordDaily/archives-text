# Congress working on abortion bill

### 
Washington (AP) — Pressure is
building in Congress to decide under
what circumstances poor women
may get federal money for abortions.
Without action by Friday, two major
departments will be without money
to function.
Currently, the government pays
for abortions for poor women whose
lives are in danger. And the Senate
and House are deadlocked on
whether to keep it that way or in
clude exceptions.
The Departments of Labor and
Health, Education and Welfare are
awaiting approval of a $60.2 billion
appropriations bill that will finance
their operations for fiscal year 1978,
which begins Oct. 1.
Without approval soon, some
148,800 employes in those depart
ments may not get paid, officials said
Saturday. Recipients of Social Sec
urity, unemployment or welfare be
nefits should not be affected, al
though workmen's compensation
benefits could be cut off.

The Senate and House have been
deadlocked for months on the bill
because it includes federal Medicaid
money that would be used to pay for
the abortions of poor women.
The question is whether the gov
ernment should pay for such abor
tions only when the mother's life is in
danger, as the House insists, or also
in cases of rape, incest and where the
operation is medically necessary, as
the Senate believes.
The Senate twice has voted and re
jected the House's version to limit
abortions for poor women to life
and-death emergencies. But the
House has never voted on the more
liberal Senate language, and propo
nents believe the House would ap
prove it if it came to a vote.
Now, both the Senate and some
House members want the House to
vote on the Senate's language.
On Friday, 70 House members
with diverse views on abortion wrote
to Rep. Daniel ). Flood (D-Pa.),
chairman of the Labor-NEW approp
riations subcommittee, appealing for
a House vote on the Senate abortion
language or on other compromise
language.
Noting that funds run out Friday,
the 70 members told Flood "it is of
the utmost urgency that the impasse
between the House and Senate con
ferees be broken."
Congressional sources say Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.
Va.) has told House members that he
thinks some senators on the dead
locked House-Senate HEW-labor
conference committee might modify
their position — but not until after
the House at least votes on the Se
nate's language.
Charles Miller, deputy assistant
secretary for financial management
for HEW, said Saturday that unless
the issue is resolved by Oct. 12, some
132,500 employes will receive a
paycheck Oct. 18 that contains only
one week's pay instead of the normal
two.
He said that the first week of the
upcoming pay period is included in
the budget for the current fiscal year,
but the second week begins with the
new fiscal year.
Miller said that the payroll is taken
to the Treasury Department on Oct.
13 and that Treasury will not pay
employes for the second week un
less Congress has resolved the issue.
