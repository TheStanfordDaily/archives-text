# Profs involved in CIA drug research

The CIA spent nearly $400,000 here between
1953 and 1961 on seven drug-related MK
ULTRA subprojects undertaken by former
Neurology Division Executive Henry Newman
and at least two other Stanford Medical School
professors, according to CIA documents re
leased to the University over the weekend.
Newman and at least one other professor,
whose identity was concealed by the CIA,
signed forms acknowledging they were work
ing on CIA projects and receiving funds from
CIA cover organizations, the documents said.
Although the names of the professors were
blackened out on the copies of the documents
received by the University, Newman's name
could be determined from information left on
memos and letters.
Newman died during five-year subproject 56
and "left the ship without a rudder," New
man's successor on the project wrote. It is not
clear whether Newman's successor, who con
tinued the studies on how alcohol affects hu
mans, knew he was working for the CIA.
A third person, described as an assistant clin
ical professor of medicine in the neurology
division, signed a document acknowledging
he worked for the agency.
The MK-ULTRA research here was part of a
nationwide project in which the CIA studied
the effects of drugs, including LSD, on animal
and human subjects. Most of the research here
experimented with animals, but there were
some human volunteers.
The CIA experimented with involuntary
human subjects at other campuses and institu

tions, according to recent testimony before
the Senate Intelligence Committee and a Se
nate Human Resources subcommittee.
University President Richard Lyman re
quested the documents when he learned Stan
ford was one of 80 institutions involved in
MK-ULTRA.
He said he was unaware of any CIA research
here "until the story began to break."
The CIA spent approximately $389,916 on
MK-ULTRA subprojects 2, 56, 70, 71, 72, 85 and
86. Four percent of the project money was paid
to the cover foundation, which also had its
name deleted from the documents.
"The (deleted) will function as cutout and
cover for this grant. The cover title of the pro
ject is (deleted) and is presumably being sup
ported by a research grant from the Founda
tion," several documents stated.
The largest amount of money allotted to the
Stanford projects, about $147,255, was spent
on Newman's research to determine how to
increase and decrease the speed with which
alcohol affects the human body.
In Newman's proposal to continue his re
search project 56, he stated human volunteers
were being used as subjects.
About $114,373 was spent over a 4'/j year
period on subproject 70 on what the CIA calls
the "K" problem or the "knockout" or "un
consciousness producing" problem.
In a memo, the CIA wrote, "There exists
within the Agency a continuing requirement
for highly potent, quick-acting substances that
will render an individual helpless and im
mobile, preferably in an unconscious state."
The purpose of the research was to investi

gate "the mechanisms in which certain drugs
induce anesthesia or narcosis." The resear
chers studied the toxic substance expelled
when ticks bite and create a "tick paralysis."
The researchers were assigned to determine
the effectiveness of the toxic substance as a
sedative agent.
In subproject 2, the CIA spent about $12,549
to study the effects when two or more drugs
are combined. The results from the four-year
project could be used to abolish conscious
ness, a proposal for the project stated.
Another proposal stated the objective of the
project as "to study methods for the administ
ration of drugs without the knowledge of the
patient."
The proposal said the researchers would
survey "methods which have been used by
criminals for surreptitious administration of
drugs."
Subprojects 85 and 86 were both intended to
discover methods for identifying overseas CIA
employes as "bona fide agents" and for de
termining whether informants were telling the
truth.
The CIA allotted about $44,774 to the two
one-year projects. The researchers were in
structed to design miniature polygraphs which
could be concealed easily and to determine
improved methods of emotional stress which
could arise when a person lies.
The proposal implied that persons imper
sonating CIA agents could go undetected un
less there were physiological factors to deter
mine the identity of an agent. The projects
included a study of blood groups as a method
of identity.
