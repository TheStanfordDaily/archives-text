## Opening Day 
### 
Opening day viewpoints by Daily editors
have become almost a requirement over the
years. At various times, the first viewpoint is
used as a defense of the past, an explanation
of the future, or a place to set editorial policy
for the rest of the volume.
And likewise, nearly every editor has lived
to see her or his plans and hopes dimmed,
ambition dulled by the task of managing a
paper with essentially volunteer co-workers,
and enthusiasm crushed by getting too close
to the day-to-day details, so that whatever
overall journalistic judgment one began the
job with gets lost somewhere in the forest of
the Daily offices.
Every editor offers essentially the same
promises — improved news coverage, brigh
ter features, better public relations, editorials
which are thought provoking and yet pleasing
— the list goes on.
So this viewpoint is really no different from

those of most of my predecessors. I think we
will have better news coverage, more in
teresting features, more informative enter
tainment pages and a more pleasing graphics
approach.
But despite promises, plans and internal
changes, each editor faces the same task —
producing a newspaper, managing about 50
fellow students, keeping tnem interested but
not overworked, soothing egos (and some
times — even more difficult — crushing
them), and coaxing an oft-times reluctant staff
to take on two full-time jobs — Stanford and
the Daily.
The news should be there: South Africa,
Bakke, and a host of other issues and events in
which Stanford is deeply involved. We'll be
there. I hope you'll be with us every morning.
