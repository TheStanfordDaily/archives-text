# Why's SWOPSI so special?

### 
Coleman, Supton

For many students a SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues) workshop is diffe
rent from every other class they've
had at Stanford. Often there is no
"teacher," no 15-page paper to be
turned in for the course grade or no
formal classroom. What is there in
stead?
First, students have an important
role in deciding what goes on in a
SWOPSI workshop. While expected
to know a lot about the course mate
rial, the leader is not set up as "the
expert." The leader is expected to
organize the class and to arrange for
students to have access to valuable
resource material — guest speakers,
books, films, trips — that will help
them understand thfe political or so
cial issue under study.
As they gain knowledge of the is
sue, students are expected to share
in the conduct of the workshop.
They may lead discussions, present
guest speakers, or introduce new
material to the class. It is the class
participants who decide what the
workshop's end product will be. The
leader may suggest possible projects
but the final decision is made by the
class as a group.
Second, SWOPSI tries to fight the
individualized, competitive perspec
tive that most students have toward
their Stanford educations by en
couraging group work and projects
that involve the whole class.
Third, SWOPSI students are ex
pected to experience the issue they
study in a direct way, either by con
ducting field research or by working
in a clinical placement.
Fourth, a major difference bet-

ween SWOPSI and other Stanford
courses is that SWOPSI workshops
deal with political and social issues,
often controversial issues.
This year, the SWOPSI staff will
continue the program's tradition of
student and community participa
tion in the planning and leading of
workshops. In so doing, SWOPSI
encourages students to explore and
articulate their political and personal
values, and to meet their own educa
tional needs.
We hope to generate workshops
which will encourage the develop
ment of alternative institutions and
innovative lifestyles such as food
co-ops, alternative newspapers,
solar heating, and alternatives within
the legal and medical professions.
We also hope to hold workshops
which will provide links between cul
ture and politics— to explore con
tinuities between art and political
expression.
Workshops analyzing the feminist
movement and other campus issues
such as Tenure and Women, Women
and the Economy, Recombinant
DNA Research, Corporate Responsi
bility, and Admissions Policies are
also in the planning stage. Other
workshop ideas include Poems and
Songs of Protest, Theater and Poli
tics, Technology and the Quality of
Work, and Political Prisoners.
All of the above ideas need your
input and energy in order to become
realities this year. If you are con
cerned about an issue, you might
want to lead a workshop. If you have
an idea for a course you would like to
take, the SWOPSI staff can help find
someone qualified to lead a work-

shop on your topic. Please call us at
497-4305 or stop by SWOPSI, 590-A
Old Union.

Workshops analyzing the feminist
movement and other campus issues
such as Tenure and Women, Women
and the Economy, Recombinant
DNA Research, Corporate Responsi
bility, and Admissions Policies are
also in the planning stage. Other
workshop ideas include Poems and
Songs of Protest, Theater and Poli
tics, Technology and the Quality of
Work, and Political Prisoners.
All of the above ideas need your
input and energy in order to become
realities this year. If you are con
cerned about an issue, you might
want to lead a workshop. If you have
an idea for a course you would like to
take, the SWOPSI staff can help find
someone qualified to lead a work-

For many students a SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues) workshop is diffe
rent from every other class they've
had at Stanford. Often there is no
"teacher," no 15-page paper to be
turned in for the course grade or no
formal classroom. What is there in
stead?
First, students have an important
role in deciding what goes on in a
SWOPSI workshop. While expected
to know a lot about the course mate
rial, the leader is not set up as "the
expert." The leader is expected to
organize the class and to arrange for
students to have access to valuable
resource material — guest speakers,
books, films, trips — that will help
them understand thfe political or so
cial issue under study.
As they gain knowledge of the is
sue, students are expected to share
in the conduct of the workshop.
They may lead discussions, present
guest speakers, or introduce new
material to the class. It is the class
participants who decide what the
workshop's end product will be. The
leader may suggest possible projects
but the final decision is made by the
class as a group.
Second, SWOPSI tries to fight the
individualized, competitive perspec
tive that most students have toward
their Stanford educations by en
couraging group work and projects
that involve the whole class.
Third, SWOPSI students are ex
pected to experience the issue they
study in a direct way, either by con
ducting field research or by working
in a clinical placement.
Fourth, a major difference bet-

ween SWOPSI and other Stanford
courses is that SWOPSI workshops
deal with political and social issues,
often controversial issues.
This year, the SWOPSI staff will
continue the program's tradition of
student and community participa
tion in the planning and leading of
workshops. In so doing, SWOPSI
encourages students to explore and
articulate their political and personal
values, and to meet their own educa
tional needs.
We hope to generate workshops
which will encourage the develop
ment of alternative institutions and
innovative lifestyles such as food
co-ops, alternative newspapers,
solar heating, and alternatives within
the legal and medical professions.
We also hope to hold workshops
which will provide links between cul
ture and politics— to explore con
tinuities between art and political
expression.
