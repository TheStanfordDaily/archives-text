# Officials dismayed over released files
## 
### Jacob Young 
University administrators expres
sed dismay Monday after learning
that confidential files, which the
Daily reported on yesterday, were
found recently in a desk which the
University sold to the Daily.
The Overseas Studies files, found
some two weeks ago, relate to such
topics as student drug use and fa
culty salaries. Among the files are
student medical files and a trans
cript.
Mark Mancall, director of overseas
studies, said he "honestly can't say"
how the strict University procedures
for handling confidential files were
bypassed.
Mancall said the transfer of the
files was "very ,very strange." When
told the files were in a desk which
had been sold to the Daily, he
then questioned whether the
Daily had legally come into posses
sion of the desk.
Invoice
(On file at the Daily is a University
invoice covering purchase of the
desk. The invoice was issued to Daily
Business Manager Robert A. Feren by
the surplus section of the Procure
ment Services Department.)
After being told of the invoice,
Mancall, overseas studies director
since 1973, then said, "I'd like to see
these documents."
Provost William Miller, when

asked about the breakdown in sec
urity measures, said he did not know
what had happened, but was "going
to try to figure it out. It's obviously
something we want to avoid in the
future."
Miller had no comment concern
ing the fact that the files had been left
in the desk.
Mancall said most files of this sort
"go regularly to the University arc
hives" for storage, and that the
Overseas Studies Office is supposed
to operate within University
guidelines for such sensitive re
cords.
Storing files
Peggy Coesfeld, a library specialist
in the University Archives, said trans
feral of such files "depends upon the
departments as to who stores them."
Coesfeld said the archives
"doesn't have material in the files
from Overseas Studies," and would
have "carbons only."
The files, which spanned a period
from 1962 to 1972, contained both
originals and copies of correspon
dence from the Overseas Studies
Program when it was under the direc
tion of then-Political Science Prof.
Robert A. Walker. Walker, now an
emeritus professor, was unavailable
for comment.
