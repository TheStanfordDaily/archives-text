# Economy stagnant, policy paralyzed
##

The New York Times

A decade ago, if unemployment
were frozen at a high rate and the
economy appeared headed for a
slowdown, a Democratic President
surely would have called for major
economic stimulus — a tax cut, a
spending increase or both. But not
now.

Despite the unsatisfactory perfor
mance of the economy, policy is
paralyzed because economists here
and elsewhere in the industrialized
world have lost their faith in rapid
economic growth. They fear that fas
ter growth would generate more in
flation and, ultimately, sink us into
another recession.
Their fear does not flow from any
sophisticated economic theory. In
deed, it reflects the bankruptcy of
modern theory, which for too long
has congealed around either the ac
tivist budgetary manipulation cham
pioned by the late Lord Keynes or the
passive money supply controls fa
vored by Prof. Milton Friedman.
The resulting intellectual vacuum
has pushed economic policy to the
right, by default. Liberals who for
years dominated economic discus
sion in the United States have left the

stage to conservatives like Alan
Greenspan, former President Ford's
chief economic adviser, who pre
scribes a tough inflation cure: a long
period of high unemployment and
slow growth.
This Republican idea seems to suit
a Democratic White House, too. Mr.
Greenspan cheered President Car
ter's decision last spring to abandon
the $50 tax rebate — though it could
have helped to'cushion the economy
in the current slowdown.
We sympathize with the uncer
tainty of most economists these days
and, to a degree, we applaud their
new humility. Faster growth may in
deed not be manageable now in a
nation that believes, rationally or ir
rationally, that it would generate
higher inflation. But we worry about
the profession's apparent satisfac
tion with slow growth as the cure for

inflation. This may work but it may
not.
After two years of high un
employment and wasted industrial
capacity, the United States still suf
fers from an inflation rate of six per
cent. The rate has not budged since
early 1975. Would a few more years
of high joblessness and wasted lives
bring the rate down? Probably not.
What options are left then? Some
are obvious — though they involve
tough political choices. Economists
long ago warned against the inflatio
nary pressures of the nation's mis
guided regulatory efforts in trucking,
airlines, agricultures, discount retail
ing, importing and wage setting. An
ticompetitive governmental policies
in these sectors should no longer be
tolerated.
