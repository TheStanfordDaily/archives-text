# Tan right — stop the summer sizzles

Honolulu — As the signs of
summer begin to fade, one tre
asure you probably want to
keep is your summer tan, care
fully nurtured on the beach at
Waikiki, the shores of
Acapulco or perhaps in your
backyard in Pittsville, Missouri.
Tans have been a status sym
bol since the early 1900s as a
sign that the bearer had
enough money to travel to
tropical places. Yet, too much

sun can lead to skin cancer,
premature aging of the skin,
and possible allergic reactions,
according to a Honolulu der
matologist.
"There is no question that
too much sun causes degener
ation of the elastic tissue and
fibers in the skin. That loosens
the skin which then wrinkles,"
said Dr. Francis Dann of Hon
olulu's Fronk Clinic.
"Sometimes overexposed
skin gets a leathery feel to it.

The skin thickens and actually
looks like tanned cow hide,"
he added.
The sun, drugs, and you
Another skin problem is
caused by the sun's effect on
phototoxic drugs. Persons who
ingest tetracycline for acne
problems or cortisone for ar
thritis for example, may break
out in a rash because the drugs
become bound to the skin and
are activated by sunlight, said
Dann.
The total number of hours
spent in the sun increases the
chance that you may get skin
cancer, said Dann. Even per
sons who have never been
sunburned can develop
keratoses, premalignant le
sions that look like raised,
pigmented rough spots on the
cheeks or nose, said Dann.
Men with short hair often de
velop keratoses on the tops of
their ears, Dann added.
Keratoses are rare on the
continental U.S. and usuallyaf
fect persons in their 50s or 60s,
said Dann, although they are
found in young persons in
Hawaii.
Persons with darker skin are
less susceptible to skin cancer,
said Dann. "Their cells make
more pigment which block out
the ultraviolent rays of the

sun," said Dann.
He pointed out that black
persons very rarely peel and
their skin shows less aging
from sun exposure than white
persons.
Questionable
The benefit of sun for the
body is debatable, said Dann.

"There is nothing the sun
directly does that helps the
body. Much of the benefit of
the sun is the feeling of well
being and relaxation it gives
people. You can get "enough"
sunlight just by getting in and
out of a car in Hawaii."
To prevent a sunburn, the

most effective product to use is
Para Amino Benzoic Acid, or
PABA, which blocks 80 per cent
of the sun's burning rays said
Dann. Esters of PABA, a more
refined form of PABA, are
known to block out 98 per cent
of the burning rays although
the esters can cause allergic
reactions in some people, said
Dann. He said the best pro
ducts contain five per cent
or more of the clear chemical.

"A (PABA) sunscreen should
be applied to all areas of the
body and the lower lip," said
Dann. "The lower lip prot
rudes and picks up a lot of sun.
There are many cases of lip
cancer caused not only from
tar and nicotine from cigarettes
but by exposure to the sun."
Women can even use the
sunscreen under their
makeup, Dann added.
If it's too late, and you've al
ready got a beauty of a sun
burn, Dann recommends a
half-hour bath, twice a day in a
cool tub of tea. The tannic acid
released by a couple of tea
bags soothes the skin, he said.
"When it comes to skin, the
saying 'If it feels good, do it'
really applies," said Dann.
Baby and calamine lotions are
also excellent he said.
No benzocaine
"But never use products that
advertise that they take away
sunburn pain. They contain
benzocaine. That is an
anesthetic that numbs the skin.
Half the people who use it get
allergic to it," warned Dann.
He said while the first use
may not provoke a rash, a sec
ond or prolonged application
of benzocaine can cause a "se
vere eruption" similar to that
of poison ivy rash.
Cosmetologist Eileen
Campbell of Honolulu said
summer tans last up to eight
weeks at most before they start
to fade.

"If you begin to peel, don't
put any makeup base on your
face. It only accentuates the
peeling," she said. "And never
scrub or peel the skin off your
face. Treat your skin gently, it is
damaged."
To preserve both skin and
tan, Campbell recommends
using a moisturizer twice a day,
and once an hour when out in
the sun.
She also recommended pro
ducts with PABA. "Don't go to
the tennis courts, the golf
course, the beach or the ski re
sorts without it," she said.

The summer "glow" can be
created by use of warm or
golden-toned transparent
makeup bases long after the
real tan is gone, said Campbell.
Use dark rich-colored
lipsticks, "the light shiny ones
just drain the color out of your
face," she said.
And while nothing beats
daily, suntanning to keep a
natural tan, Campbell said one
should sunbathe only in the
early morning hours and no
more than an hour and a half
each day.
