# Change for a quarter.

Junior Anita Lee wants to make it
perfectly clear that a Stanford edu
cation costs a lot. She paid for her
$2,249 tuition yesterday with 225
rolls of quarters plus one dollar in
change. She wrapped and wrote
her student identification number
on each roll. Three persons helped
carry the cash to the cashier.
