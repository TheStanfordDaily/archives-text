# $56 million given to school last year
## 
### 
Gifts to the University hit a
record $56.1 million during the
fiscal year just completed, ac
cording to Joel Smith, vice
president for development.
Aided by the wrap up of the
five-year, $300 million Cam
paign for Stanford last April,
gift receipts smashed the pre
vious record by $9.6 million.
The previous record of $46.5
million was set in 1972-73.
Smith said his goal now is to
maintain the campaign level
for gifts though he conceded it
would be "remarkable" if the
$56 million mark were hit again
this year.
"We intend to be very am
bitious fundraisers," he said,
adding he doesn't expect to be
very far below this year's level.
"We're doing our best to see
we don't" go below $50 mill
ion, Smith said.
Dramatic increase
Gifts to the University have
increased dramatically over the
past 10 years, according to fi
gures supplied by the Univer
sity News Service.

In the four years im
mediately preceding 1976-77,
gifts received averaged about
$44 million and, in the six year
period preceding that, about
$29 million.
Smith said this is in large part
due to what he termed the
"synergistic effect" which
exists between fundraisirigand
a university's reputation.
World class
"In the past 20 years, Stan
ford has consolidated its posi
tion as a truly world class uni
versity," Smith said. "We have
attained eminence. That helps
make successful fundraising
possible. Good fundraising
creates the possibility of attain
ing excellence which aids
fundraising further," he said.
Smith also said major build
ing projects planned for the
near future are funded; there
fore, "it's probable that physi
cal facilities will be less con
spicuous in Stanford fundrais
ing in the next 10 years than it
has been in the last 10."
