# Colombia tells growers to reduce coffee prices
## 
### 
London (AP) — Columbia,
the world's second largest cof
fee grower, urged producing
nations yesterday to lower
prices to levehs the man-in
the-street can afford in order to
stop the flight of coffee drin
kers to cheaper beverages.
But in Brazil, the world's No.
1 coffee producer, a govern
ment official said his country's
policy would be to continue
"supporting coffee prices."
"The current situation of in
ternational markets is one of
real scarcity, so prices will
naturally go up again soon,"
said the official, an expert with
the Brazilian Coffee Institute.
In a surprise move at the an
nual meeting of the Council of
the International Coffee Or
ganization (ICO) here, Colom
bia's Arturo Gomez- Jarmillo
warned of "declining con
sumption which we cannot ig
nore.
"Even though it is premature
to express any opinion on this,

the latest figures show that in
the main consuming centers a
probable loss in consumption
of 10 to 15 per cent could be
expected," said Gomez, gen
eral manager of the Colombian
coffee grower's association.
A 10 per cent reduction on a
world scale probably would
mean a loss of more than $1
billion for producers.
At the earlier meeting,
Gomez urged the ICO council
to take action on lowering
prices before the current high
prices cause more consumers
to cut down on coffee and turn
to cheaper alternatives.
He noted that his country
proposed a price ceiling last
year, when wholesale prices
first exceeded $2 a pound "and
we clearly saw that the situa
tion posed a threat to our
long-term interests."
The big coffee countries, in
cluding Brazil, the world's No.
1 producer, ignored the warn
ing. "If we did not receive any

response then, we now sin
cerely hope to have better
luck," Gomez said.
Wholesale prices for a
pound of green, unroasted
beans in the United States and
Western Europe climbed from
60 cents in July 1975 to about
$3.35 in April 1977. Retail prices
went from $1.27 to around $4 a
pound.
Retail prices have dropped
to an average of about $3.50 in
the United States.
Last week, Colombia low
ered its export registration
price by five cents a pound and
Colombian green coffee ex
port prices dropped to $1.81 a
pound delivered in New York.
Though rated among the
world's best, it is the cheapest
coffee on the market.
The ICO council is not ex
pected to act definitively on
price ceilings during its current
meeting, which ends Friday.

Wholesale prices for a

pound.
Retail prices have dropped
to an average of about $3.50 in
the United States.

London (AP) — Columbia,
the world's second largest cof
fee grower, urged producing
nations yesterday to lower
prices to levehs the man-in
the-street can afford in order to
stop the flight of coffee drin
kers to cheaper beverages.
But in Brazil, the world's No.
1 coffee producer, a govern
ment official said his country's
policy would be to continue
"supporting coffee prices."
"The current situation of in
ternational markets is one of
real scarcity, so prices will
naturally go up again soon,"
said the official, an expert with
the Brazilian Coffee Institute.
In a surprise move at the an
nual meeting of the Council of
the International Coffee Or
ganization (ICO) here, Colom
bia's Arturo Gomez- Jarmillo
warned of "declining con
sumption which we cannot ig
nore.
"Even though it is premature
to express any opinion on this,

the latest figures show that in
the main consuming centers a
probable loss in consumption
of 10 to 15 per cent could be
expected," said Gomez, gen
eral manager of the Colombian
coffee grower's association.
A 10 per cent reduction on a
world scale probably would
mean a loss of more than $1
billion for producers.
At the earlier meeting,
Gomez urged the ICO council
to take action on lowering
prices before the current high
prices cause more consumers
to cut down on coffee and turn
to cheaper alternatives.
He noted that his country
proposed a price ceiling last
year, when wholesale prices
first exceeded $2 a pound "and
we clearly saw that the situa
tion posed a threat to our
long-term interests."
The big coffee countries, in
cluding Brazil, the world's No.
1 producer, ignored the warn
ing. "If we did not receive any
