### Ali Webb 
Cowell Student Health Center is expanding its
service by offering comprehensive medical and
psychological care for spouses and children of
regularly enrolled Stanford students.
Cowell's standard services will now be availa
ble to family members on a fee-for-service basis
at a 15 percent.discount.
Two offices and examining rooms, specially
designed for pediatrics, will have three pediatri
cians on duty at Cowell five days a week as a part
of this service.
James McClenahan, director of Cowell, said
he hopes the new program will "encourage
Stanford students and their families to consoli
date their health care under one roof."
The need for health service for the 2000 to
3000 married students here became clear in a
survey done by Cowell two years ago at Escon
dido Village.
Survey results showed students and their
spouses preferred a fee-for-service basis of
payment rather than the prepaid health package

that all students are enrolled in.
"The goal for this year's program is to break
even financially," McClenahan said. The prog
ram last year was unable to break even due to
enlargement of the Cowell staff, he said.
The program's development coincided with
the addition of Kathy North to the nursing staff.
Because of her background, North has coordi
nated the addition of pediatric facilities at Cow
ell.
About 60 to 80 percent of the families served
by Cowell have been those of foreign students,
according to North. She said to help accomo
date these families, child medical history forms
have been translated into Spanish and Japanese.
No obstetric care is available at Cowell; how
ever, gynecological care is, according to a Cow
ell publication.
In order for spouses and children to be
treated, patients must present a valid spouse
identification card, issued by the University. The
cards are available at registration each quarter.
