# Mopeds regulated
## 
### Doug Hyde 
Mopeds will be required to
have bicycle licenses despite
state law which classifies them
as motor vehicles, according to
investigator Donald Lillie of the
Public Safety Department.
The California Vehicle Code
defines a moped as a two- or
three-wheeled vehicle with a
motor of two horsepower or
less which cannot top 30 mph
on level ground.
Lillie said the state classifica
tion came as a result of lobby
ing by moped manufacturers
and importers for a clarifica
tion of the motorized bicycles'
status.
Approximately 38 states have
set up some type of moped
regulation, said Lillie.
New regulations make the
distinction that mopeds are
motor vehicles, exempt from
motor vehicle registration.
However, as a motor vehicle,
mopeds must be operated by a
licensed driver. The license
need not be endorsed for class
four motorcycle operation.
Also, mopeds will be re

stricted to areas used by motor
vehicles, says Lillie. Mopeds
should not be ridden in the
Quad area, in White Plaza, or
on special bike routes unless
the motor is turned off, added
Lillie.
This would not apply to
street lanes reserved specifi
cally for bicycles.

Motorized bicycles, called mopeds, are on the rise in popularity here
and elsewhere. Clarification of regulations on mopeds has recently
occurred, according to Stanford Police.
