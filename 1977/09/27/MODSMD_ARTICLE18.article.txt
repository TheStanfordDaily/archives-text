# End of rail service to SF considered
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Passenger train service to
San Francisco may be
abolished within the year if
Southern Pacific (SP) gets its
way.
SP has asked the state's Pub
lic Utilities Commission (PUC)
to allow it to abandon its pas
senger schedule on the Penin
sula. The commuter trains are
now serving most cities bet
ween San Francisco and San
Jose.
SP has cited decreasing
numbers of passengers and in
creased costs as the reasons for
the request.
"At our peak in 1954, we car
ried 16,500 commuters each
way per weekday," said An
drew Anderson, a spokesman
for the railroad.
"We've also had a heavy in
crease in cost in recent years.
We operated for many years at
a loss — not a large one — less
than a million dollars per year
— but last June we were losing
$10 million per year."
Most peninsula
municipalities have voiced
their opposition to the plan.
Dan McCorquodale, a Santa
Clara County supervisor and
chairman of the county's
transportation commission,

predicted "drastic effects" if
the PUC grants SP's request.
"A lot of transportation lines
feed into the Southern Pacific
and we take SP into account
when we're planning and pro
viding service," McCor
quodale said.
"The county is approving
$100,000 to provide a better in
terface between county transit
and SP stations. Any change
would be detrimental to that
big ridership," he added. Bet
ween 3500 and 4000 Santa Clara
commuters use the SP service
each day, McCorquodale esti
mated.
"Between 3000 and 4000
more autos on 101 would be
just chaotic during rush
hours," he said.
Anderson admitted that the
railroad's main concern is that
its debt-ridden passenger runs
are hurting the company's
competition in the lucrative
freight-carrying business.
"Trucks and other railroads
don't have to carry that loss,"
he said.
The PUC is holding hearings
on the matter; arguments will
continue through next month
at least. Anderson doesn't ex
pect a decision before next
spring.
