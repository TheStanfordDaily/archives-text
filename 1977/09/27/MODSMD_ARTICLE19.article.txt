# McAfee and Barrish lead independent film series
## 
### 
Betty McAfee and Jerry Bar
rish are the first two speakers
in the Palo Alto Independent
Filmmaker Series lectures on
goals, methods and means of
making movies.
McAfee, who will speak Oct.
1, works exclusively with
Super-Bflim, "a medium rather
than a film format" which she
blows up to 16mm for distribu
tion.
A Berkeley school teacher,
McAfee says she works in
"streams of filmmaking" which
include teaching workshops,
working on a Super-8
magazine and developing her
Open Window Films company.
Her films include "Women
in China" which follows the
growth of women's rights in
Asia. McAfee watches herders
in Mongolia, female doctors
performing Caesarean sec
tions, and childcare mothers
trying to work and support a
communal nursery.

Another film, "Kelly," shows
a cerebral palsy victim's prog
ress through the preschool
years.
Exploring her personal ex
periences is vital to McAfee's
filmmaking direction. She de
monstrates this with
"Tidepools," a Super-8 look at
the world of hermit crabs, star
fish, urchins and anemones in
the rocky shores of California.
Barrish writes, directs, lights
and edits his films. Since earn
ing his Master of Fine Arts from
San Francisco Art Institute in
1975, he has created a giant re
pertoire both alone and as
cinematographer or technician
for other Bay Area filmmakers.
Founder of a filmmaker
cooperative which packages
and distributes independent
films, Barrish also does free
lance news items for the local
CBS television station.
His films include "That's
Why I'm a Painter" which

examines the work and life of
quadriplegic artist Jim
Rudolph.
"Cockfighting" is a
documentary on that activity,
taking an unorthodox ap
proach by following the life
and staying in the corner of
chickens not their human
trainers.
"The Circle" is an original
Barrish film in which a man
tries to replace a wife and
daughter killed in a car acci
dent. His quest takes him to
unusual relationships with
older and younger women
whom he uses to make up for
his dead family.
Barrish will show his first
film, "I Will Be," based on
Harry Chapin's "The Sniper."
He also presents the in
progress "Dan's Motel" which
shows two men, one in hiding,
the other his link to the out
side.
