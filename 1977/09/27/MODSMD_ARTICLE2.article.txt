# Police say contract only choice

"It looked like they could have
beat us," said Art Nebgen, a spokes
person for the Stanford Police Offic
ers Association (SOPA). Nebgen was
referring to the University, which
narrowly averted a strike late Sunday
by public safety officers as the mem
bers of SOPA ratified a new three
year contract 22-7.
Nebgen said members decided to
accept the contract even though they
were deeply disappointed with its
terms because the University ceased
making concessions and because
SOPA members "couldn't afford to
go on strike."
Nebgen also conceded that pat
rolmen feared losing their jobs. He
said he believed the University might
have fired the striking officers and
replaced them.
University negotiatorPriscilla Whee
ler, however, said the University
never contemplated such action and
that it would be illegal forthe Univer
sity to fire the officers since they
would be participating in a lawful
strike.
Supervisory personnel
Instead, the University had made
arrangements to use supervisory
personnel and had asked for extra
help from the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office in the event of a
strike, she said.
Part of the cause for the associa
tion's reluctance to strike was uncer
tainty over walkout support by Un
ited Stanford Employees (USE) and
building trade unions currently
working on University construction
projects. i
Support for the strike by other un
ions could have included union
members' refusal to cross SPOA's
picket line, bringing many University
services and projects to a halt.
But it was far from certain that an
SPOA strike would have received

such backing.
Nebgen added that SPOA antici
pated "having to be out three
months" and that if the strike had
little effect on other University ser
vices and construction the associa
tion would be unsuccessful in gain
ing new concessions.
Nebgen said that because of the
circumstances surrounding the set
tlement, morale on the force is very
low and he expects a large amount of
attrition in the coming year.
No contract
The police had been working
without a contract since the old
three-year contract expired July 31.
The dispute centered on disability,
retirement and safety issues, rather
than wages.
The SPOA did not challenge the
University's offer of a 20 per cent pay
increase over the life of the proposed
three-year contract. The police offic
ers did say that they would prefer a
two-year contract to avoid coinciding
with USE's contract negotiations.
The officers were asking for disa
bility payments for job-related in
juries starting from the first day of the
injury. The current University policy
is that disability payments start after
45 days but negotiators agreed to re
duce that to 20 days.
According to SPOA negotiator
Herman Williams, the officers asked
for a reduction in the retirement age
from 65 to 55 years after 20 years on
the job. This is "on par with other
departments" in the Bay Area, he ad
ded.
Paying the difference
> Williams added that the police of
ficers were willing to pay the differ
ence in cost. But Wheeler said that it
would be very difficult under the
present Social Security laws to set up
a separate retirement program for
the police.
To set up a program separate from

Social Security might be extremely
difficult unless the entire University
were put on the new separate plan;
then there would be a two-year wait
ing period before implementation,
according to Wheeler. Bills currently
pending in Congress may make this
change more practical in the future,
she added.
She said that a joint committee had
been proposed by the University to
study other retirement plans.
Williams also said that there are a
variety of safety problems which the
officers wanted settled in any new
contract.
"We have vehicles that are unsafe
for police officers to drive anything
over2o miles per hour," due to steer
ing and other problems, Williams
claimed.
Wheeler said she was aware there
might be maintenance problems but
said the University "recognized that
the safety of vehicles was important
and we represented to them at the
table that we were going to find ways
to have our police vehicles serviced
outside the University while we were
also upgrading the skills of our
mechanics at Plant Services."
Bullets
Williams also said the officers
asked for soft-headed bullets, claim
ing that they are currently issued
target (low power) bullets.
Wheeler denied that the police
carry target bullets and said they are
issued the highest velocity bullet for
the type of pistol they carry.
"We think that certainly the offic
ers should present what they con
sider the best form of weaponry,"
she said. But, "the final decision re
ally has to be left with the chief, who
consults with other University offi
cials."
A committee will be formed by the
officers which will meet regularly
with Chief Marvin Herrington to dis

cuss such issues, Wheeler said.
According to Williams, officers
have not used their guns in the line of
duty in at least the last year.
Williams also said the police offic
ers are asking that community ser
vice officers (CSO) not be required
to check faculty homes while the
families are away.
He said that since the CSOs are not
deputized as police officers they
should not engage in hazardous
work.
The University has agreed to limit
the checks to daylight hours
"whenever possible," according to
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance.
Both Nebgen and Williams agreed
that the contract which was accepted
on Sunday was little changed from
the one which SPOA failed to ratify in
August. After that vote both the Uni
versity and the association engaged
in a vigorous literature campaign to
sway public opinion.

were put on the new separate plan;
then there would be a two-year wait
ing period before implementation,
according to Wheeler. Bills currently
pending in Congress may make this
change more practical in the future,
she added.
She said that a joint committee had
been proposed by the University to
study other retirement plans.
Williams also said that there are a
variety of safety problems which the
officers wanted settled in any new
contract.
"We have vehicles that are unsafe
for police officers to drive anything
over2o miles per hour," due to steer
ing and other problems, Williams
claimed.
Wheeler said she was aware there
might be maintenance problems but
said the University "recognized that
the safety of vehicles was important
and we represented to them at the
table that we were going to find ways
to have our police vehicles serviced
outside the University while we were
also upgrading the skills of our
mechanics at Plant Services."
Bullets
Williams also said the officers
asked for soft-headed bullets, claim
ing that they are currently issued
target (low power) bullets.
Wheeler denied that the police
carry target bullets and said they are
issued the highest velocity bullet for
the type of pistol they carry.
"We think that certainly the offic
ers should present what they con
sider the best form of weaponry,"
she said. But, "the final decision re
ally has to be left with the chief, who
consults with other University offi
cials."
A committee will be formed by the
officers which will meet regularly
with Chief Marvin Herrington to dis

cuss such issues, Wheeler said.
According to Williams, officers
have not used their guns in the line of
duty in at least the last year.
Williams also said the police offic
ers are asking that community ser
vice officers (CSO) not be required
to check faculty homes while the
families are away.
He said that since the CSOs are not
deputized as police officers they
should not engage in hazardous
work.
The University has agreed to limit
the checks to daylight hours
"whenever possible," according to
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance.
Both Nebgen and Williams agreed
that the contract which was accepted
on Sunday was little changed from
the one which SPOA failed to ratify in
August. After that vote both the Uni
versity and the association engaged
in a vigorous literature campaign to
sway public opinion.
"It looked like they could have
beat us," said Art Nebgen, a spokes
person for the Stanford Police Offic
ers Association (SOPA). Nebgen was
referring to the University, which
narrowly averted a strike late Sunday
by public safety officers as the mem
bers of SOPA ratified a new three
year contract 22-7.
Nebgen said members decided to
accept the contract even though they
were deeply disappointed with its
terms because the University ceased
making concessions and because
SOPA members "couldn't afford to
go on strike."
Nebgen also conceded that pat
rolmen feared losing their jobs. He
said he believed the University might
have fired the striking officers and
replaced them.
University negotiatorPriscilla Whee
ler, however, said the University
never contemplated such action and
that it would be illegal forthe Univer
sity to fire the officers since they
would be participating in a lawful
strike.
Supervisory personnel
Instead, the University had made
arrangements to use supervisory
personnel and had asked for extra
help from the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office in the event of a
strike, she said.
Part of the cause for the associa
tion's reluctance to strike was uncer
tainty over walkout support by Un
ited Stanford Employees (USE) and
building trade unions currently
working on University construction
projects. i
Support for the strike by other un
ions could have included union
members' refusal to cross SPOA's
picket line, bringing many University
services and projects to a halt.
But it was far from certain that an
SPOA strike would have received

such backing.
Nebgen added that SPOA antici
pated "having to be out three
months" and that if the strike had
little effect on other University ser
vices and construction the associa
tion would be unsuccessful in gain
ing new concessions.
Nebgen said that because of the
circumstances surrounding the set
tlement, morale on the force is very
low and he expects a large amount of
attrition in the coming year.
No contract
The police had been working
without a contract since the old
three-year contract expired July 31.
The dispute centered on disability,
retirement and safety issues, rather
than wages.
The SPOA did not challenge the
University's offer of a 20 per cent pay
increase over the life of the proposed
three-year contract. The police offic
ers did say that they would prefer a
two-year contract to avoid coinciding
with USE's contract negotiations.
The officers were asking for disa
bility payments for job-related in
juries starting from the first day of the
injury. The current University policy
is that disability payments start after
45 days but negotiators agreed to re
duce that to 20 days.
According to SPOA negotiator
Herman Williams, the officers asked
for a reduction in the retirement age
from 65 to 55 years after 20 years on
the job. This is "on par with other
departments" in the Bay Area, he ad
ded.
Paying the difference
> Williams added that the police of
ficers were willing to pay the differ
ence in cost. But Wheeler said that it
would be very difficult under the
present Social Security laws to set up
a separate retirement program for
the police.
To set up a program separate from

Social Security might be extremely
difficult unless the entire University
were put on the new separate plan;
then there would be a two-year wait
ing period before implementation,
according to Wheeler. Bills currently

personnel and had asked for extra
help from the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office in the event of a
strike, she said.
Part of the cause for the associa
tion's reluctance to strike was uncer
tainty over walkout support by Un
ited Stanford Employees (USE) and
building trade unions currently
working on University construction
projects. i
Support for the strike by other un
ions could have included union
members' refusal to cross SPOA's
picket line, bringing many University
services and projects to a halt.
But it was far from certain that an
SPOA strike would have received

such backing.
Nebgen added that SPOA antici
pated "having to be out three
months" and that if the strike had
little effect on other University ser
vices and construction the associa
tion would be unsuccessful in gain
ing new concessions.
Nebgen said that because of the
circumstances surrounding the set
tlement, morale on the force is very
low and he expects a large amount of
attrition in the coming year.
No contract
The police had been working
without a contract since the old
three-year contract expired July 31.
The dispute centered on disability,
retirement and safety issues, rather
than wages.
The SPOA did not challenge the
University's offer of a 20 per cent pay
increase over the life of the proposed
three-year contract. The police offic
ers did say that they would prefer a
two-year contract to avoid coinciding
with USE's contract negotiations.
The officers were asking for disa
bility payments for job-related in
juries starting from the first day of the
injury. The current University policy
is that disability payments start after
45 days but negotiators agreed to re
duce that to 20 days.
According to SPOA negotiator
Herman Williams, the officers asked
for a reduction in the retirement age
from 65 to 55 years after 20 years on
the job. This is "on par with other
departments" in the Bay Area, he ad
ded.
Paying the difference
> Williams added that the police of
ficers were willing to pay the differ
ence in cost. But Wheeler said that it
would be very difficult under the
present Social Security laws to set up
a separate retirement program for
the police.
To set up a program separate from

Social Security might be extremely
difficult unless the entire University
were put on the new separate plan;
then there would be a two-year wait
ing period before implementation,
according to Wheeler. Bills currently
pending in Congress may make this
change more practical in the future,
she added.
She said that a joint committee had
been proposed by the University to
study other retirement plans.
Williams also said that there are a
variety of safety problems which the
officers wanted settled in any new
contract.
"We have vehicles that are unsafe
for police officers to drive anything
over2o miles per hour," due to steer
ing and other problems, Williams
claimed.
Wheeler said she was aware there
might be maintenance problems but
said the University "recognized that
the safety of vehicles was important
and we represented to them at the
table that we were going to find ways
to have our police vehicles serviced
outside the University while we were
also upgrading the skills of our
mechanics at Plant Services."
Bullets
Williams also said the officers
asked for soft-headed bullets, claim
ing that they are currently issued
target (low power) bullets.
Wheeler denied that the police
carry target bullets and said they are
issued the highest velocity bullet for
the type of pistol they carry.
"We think that certainly the offic
ers should present what they con
sider the best form of weaponry,"
she said. But, "the final decision re
ally has to be left with the chief, who
consults with other University offi
cials."
A committee will be formed by the
officers which will meet regularly
with Chief Marvin Herrington to dis

cuss such issues, Wheeler said.
According to Williams, officers
have not used their guns in the line of
duty in at least the last year.
Williams also said the police offic
ers are asking that community ser
vice officers (CSO) not be required
to check faculty homes while the
families are away.
He said that since the CSOs are not
deputized as police officers they
should not engage in hazardous
work.
The University has agreed to limit
the checks to daylight hours
"whenever possible," according to
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance.
Both Nebgen and Williams agreed
that the contract which was accepted
on Sunday was little changed from
the one which SPOA failed to ratify in
August. After that vote both the Uni
versity and the association engaged
in a vigorous literature campaign to
sway public opinion.
"It looked like they could have
beat us," said Art Nebgen, a spokes
person for the Stanford Police Offic
ers Association (SOPA). Nebgen was
referring to the University, which
narrowly averted a strike late Sunday
by public safety officers as the mem
bers of SOPA ratified a new three
year contract 22-7.
Nebgen said members decided to
accept the contract even though they
were deeply disappointed with its
terms because the University ceased
making concessions and because
SOPA members "couldn't afford to
go on strike."
Nebgen also conceded that pat
rolmen feared losing their jobs. He
said he believed the University might
have fired the striking officers and
replaced them.
University negotiatorPriscilla Whee
ler, however, said the University
never contemplated such action and
that it would be illegal forthe Univer
sity to fire the officers since they
would be participating in a lawful
strike.
Supervisory personnel
Instead, the University had made
arrangements to use supervisory
personnel and had asked for extra
help from the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office in the event of a
strike, she said.

tion's reluctance to strike was uncer
