### 
Duck's Breath Mystery
Theatre, a screwball comedy
troupe with a sizable Stanford
following, gave its final local
performance of the year last
Saturday at Palo Alto's New
Varsity Theater.
Next month the five
member team, which has ap
peared regularly in the New
Varsity's live entertainment
series and on campus will em
bark on a national tour.
"Gonad the Barbarian" and
"A Cliff Note's Hamlet," two of
the group's most popular
sketches, may even reach the
airwaves. Duck's Breath is
scheduled to appear on a late
night NBC-TV comedy special,
"The Great American Laugh-
Off," tentatively slated for late
October.
The show, taped last month
in San Francisco, features a
number of television newcom
ers and was produced by

George Schlatter of "Laugh-
In."
The group's "multi-level
parodies" combine the cereb
ral with the silly, satire with
slapstick.
"Props are the element that
lets our audience use their im
agination . . . and gets them
involved," he says.
Duck's Breath members are
Martell, Merle Kessler, Dan
Coffeey, Bill Allard and Jim
Turner. All five are drama
graduates of the University of
lowa, classic actors and crazy.
They created their brand of
humor (somewhere between
Firesign Theater and Monty
Python) in front of lowa City
audiences. They packed up
their routines and moved to
San Francisco two years ago,
and Duck's Breath has now ap
peared in more than a hundred
theaters, clubes and coffee
houses.
