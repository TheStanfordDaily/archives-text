Line drawings, electron microscopy
and color photographs will be rep
resented in the Coffee House Gallery's
October displays.
Sperm with a hundred tails and the
breathing pores of the onion plant are
some of the subjects of Neal Burstein's
"Biology: Tall and Small" collection,
which is being shown from now
through Oct. 15.
Using extreme close-up photography
and scanning electron microscopy,
Burstein's collection presents rare
events in the realm of biology.
He sees "on the side of the tomato
caterpillar smiling children, in a dead
tree trunk the reclining nude."
Burstein, a Ph.D. candidate, is a na
tive of Colorado, where he first de
veloped interest in electron micros
copy at the University of Colorado.
He says that his early scientific work
with lizards and frogs brought publica
tion in professional journals, along with
"a fascination for the unsuspected pat
terns revealed by nature."
Beginning Oct. 2, a collection of
color and black-and-white photo
graphs by Orah Moore will be added to
the gallery walls. A reception in honor
of the opening of the show will be held

that day from 5 to 7 p.m. Her show is
titled "Relationships: Size and Form."
Moore, a Mountain View resident, is
a full-time freelance photographer. She
has studied with Ruth Bernhard and
Robbie Robertson in San Francisco and
has taken classes at the New England
School of Photography and the Ansel
Adams Yosemite Workshop. Her spe
cialty is "creative outdoor portrait
photography."
Black and white line drawings by
Cosette Buser will be on display at the
gallery Oct. 16 through Nov. 15.
Born in Switzerland, she has since
"moved through a series of landscapes
ranging from the Swiss mountains to
New York concrete to West Coast desert
and hills."
While in New York she continued the
work in graphic arts that she began in
Switzerland, at the same time working
as a package designer.
Cosette says of her work, "My images
are little pieces of one big mosaic, my
life — sometimes bursting with colors,
at other times clear black-and-white,
but always born in the unconscious."
The gallery is open from noon to
midnight, seven days a week.
