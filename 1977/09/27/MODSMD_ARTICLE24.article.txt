Canal treaty approval sought
Washington — The Carter administration
launched an offensive yesterday to obtain con
gressional approval of the Panama Canal treaties,
saying the pacts protect U.S. security interests
while showing the United States is not "an im
perialistic exploiter."
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance repeatedly told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the
United States will have the right to protect the
canal's neutrality and keep it open even after
Panama takes control of the canal in the year 2000.
Ambassador Sol Linowitz, who helped negotiate
the treaties, also said the United States will retain
permanent priority access to the canal, having
been granted in effect "the right to go to the head
of the line."
Vance views Palestinian issue
United Nations, N.Y. — Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, pleased that Israel has dropped its opposi
tion to a unified Arab delegation at new Middle
East peace talks, said yesterday "there are differ
ences between us" on the Palestinian issue.
Vance disassociated the Carter administration
from conditions that the Israeli cabinet on Sunday
attached to its approval of a single Arab delegation
at a reconvened Geneva peace conference.
"They do not accurately reflect our views,"
Vance said, but he added he was "extremely
pleased" that Israel dropped its opposition to hav
ing a unified Arab delegation at Geneva.
The principal condition that Israel insists on
pursuing is that only Palestinians who are not
known members of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) could be seated at Geneva. Israel
considers the PLO a terrorist organization commit
ted to the dismantling of the Jewish state as out
lined in the PLO charter.
Carter's energy plan attacked
Washington — The Senate dealt major new
blows to President Jimmy Carter's energy program
yesterday, prompting a counterattack from the
President against the oil industry and an appeal to
senators to stop dismantling his plan.
Accusing big oil of trying to "jeopardize our
energy future," Carter urged the Senate to reject
"narrow special interest attacks on all segments"
of his national energy program.
The President spoke in the White House press
room after the Senate Finance Committee, reject
ing the heart of his energy plan, defeated his
proposal to force conservation by taxing U.S.
crude oil.
But even as Carter was speaking, the full Senate
rejected in a new test vote his plan to keep federal
controls on natural gas prices.
The 53-39 vote, following action to halt a filibus
ter of an industry-supported deregulation mea
sure, was the second time a majority of the Senate

has gone on record against Carter's gas-pricing
plan.
Last week, the Senate voted by a six-vote margin
to continue debating the industry proposal to lift
price controls from natural gas as an alternative to
Carter's proposal.
Pope celebrates 80th birthday
Vatican City — Pope Paul VI marked his 80th
birthday yesterday with a regular day of work while
world leaders lauded his drive for world peace. He
appeared in good health despite his stated belief
that death is approaching.
President Carter's message of congratulations
cited the Pope's "tireless efforts to promote
human rights" and "deep appreciation for the
moral leadership."
"It's a normal workday for him," said the Vatican
press director, the Rt. Rev. Romeo Panciroli.
The only public function of the day was to inau
gurate a 12-ton bronze door for St. Peter's Basilica,
a birthday gift from an Italian sculptor.
On the eve of his birthday, the Pope told some
50,000 well-wishers at St. Peter's Square that pas
sing years bring him closer to the end of his "tem
poral life . . . This obliges us to great humility . . .
We feel the fragility of being human."
Court upholds Davis admittance
San Francisco — Rita Clancy, described as "very
nervous," attended her first class at the University
of California at Davis medical school yesterday
while a federal appeals court refused to overturn a
judge's order admitting her to the class.
A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Court of
Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, refused a request by the
university that Clancy be barred from school until
the U.S. Supreme Court decides the case of Allan
Bakke, another white applicant who challenged a
program reserving some classroom admissions to
minority students.
Meanwhile, at the Davis campus, there were no
protests or disruptions as the 22-year-old Clancy, a
Russian immigrant, showed up for the start of clas
ses.
She had been on a waiting list for admission to
the school, but a federal judge in Sacramento or
dered her admitted last Friday, saying she proba
bly would have won entrance but for the minority
admissions program.
U.S. trade deficit hits $2.7 billion
Washington — The United States had more trou
ble finding foreign buyers for its products in Au
gust as the country's monthly trade deficit grew to
$2.7 billion, the second largest on record, the gov
ernment said yesterday.
Commerce Department officials said exports
declined mainly because other countries are hav
ing worse economic problems than the United
States and cannot afford to buy U.S. goods.

American businesses exported $9.6 billion in
products last month, a 5.6 per cent drop from July
and the smallest amount in 16 months.
However, the United States had to rely less on
imports, which declined two per cent to $12.2 bill
ion last month. Oil imports, which have caused
most of the trade imbalance this year, declined
nine per cent to $3.3 billion.
Carter seeks expanded trade
Washington — President ]immy Carter pledged
yesterday he will do whatever is necessary to
achieve strong non-inflationary growth of the U.S.
economy nextyearand said he is firmly committed
to expanded world trade free of barriers.
He told the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank here that a strong
world economy depends on how individual na
tions manage their domestic economies.
Carter did not join in the widespread criticism at
the meeting of West German and Japanese
economic policies, but stressed instead that the
United States "is putting its economic house in
order, which will benefit the rest of the world as
well.
Power cut back in New York
New York — Three Consolidated Edison Co.
generating plants were knocked out in a storm
yesterday, and power to the metropolitan area was
cut back by a maximum eight per cent in a success
ful effort to avert a rerun of last July's crippling
blackout.
Parts of Westchester County and The Bronx
were blacked out for about an hour to conserve
power for the rest of the system, and a Con Edison
spokesman said the system was "back to normal"
by late afternoon, shortly before the evening rush
hour period began.
The spokesman said the system was saved by
immediate use of alternate generators, including
gas turbines.
When a blackout darkened the entire city the
night of July 13, the gas turbines were not staffed,
and the spokesman said that situation contributed
to the gravity of the blackout.
Since then, he said, the turbines have been staf
fed round-the-clock and were available for instant
use in yesterday's battle to "preserve the system."
