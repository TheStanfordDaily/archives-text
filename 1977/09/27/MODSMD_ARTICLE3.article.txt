# CIA project leaders named
## 
### Randy Keith 
A doctor who participated in top
secret CIA sponsored MK-ULTRA
mind and behaviour control projects
revealed last night the name of the
medical foundation which acted as a
secret cover for the projects here.
The name of a second doctor here
who may also have been involved
was also revealed.
Dr. Marion Smith, an adjunct pro
fessor of neurology said that when
she worked as a research associate
for Dr. Henry Newman she con

ducted experiments sponsored by
the Geschickter Fund for Medical
Research.
'Control mechanisms'
The experiments dealt with the
"control mechanisms" which de
termine the rate at which alcohol is
metabolized by the body, she said.
The Daily reported yesterday that
documents released by the CIA to
the University last Friday showed that
Newman was in charge of such ex
periments from 1956-59, when he
was the Neurology Division Execu

tive in the medical school here.
The documents labeled "sub
project 56," also showed that New
man had signed a form acknowledg
ing that he was working for the CIA
and that he knew the Geschickter
Fund was a CIA cover.
Source 'never clear'
Smith said that she was never told
that the money to support the al
cohol research was coming from the
CIA. "I was told at the time that the
work was government sponsored
but the source was never very clear
to me," she said.
The Geschickter Fund, which is
based in Washington, has been used
in at least two other instances to fun
nel money for MK-ULTRA research to
universities.
The CIA documents detailing
Newman and Smith's research show
that the experiments were designed
to:
—determine the effectiveness of
food in delaying the absorbtion of
alcohol in the stomach. •
—determine the effectiveness of
certain drugs in delaying the absorb
tion of alcohol from the stomach.
—study how the removal of al
cohol from the bloodstream could
be speeded up.
—develop a "simple and reliable"
test of tolerance to alcohol for use in
selection of personnel and predic
tion of behavior.
The document goes on to say
"wouldn't it not be profitable to de
velop a simple and reliable test of
tolerance to alcohol which would be
of value in the selection of personnel
whose mission and job might entail
the necessity of consuming large
quantities of alcohol?"
Human subjects planned
Human subjects also were slated
for the experiments according to two
of the documents. "Funds will also
be required for reimbursement of
the subjects for this rather unpleas
ant and ardous research, and their
retention in the hospital under ob
servation during the period that they
are intoxicated," one of the docu
ments said.
Smith said that she was not aware
of any clinical experiments with
human subjects and said she knew of
only experiments on dogs, rats and
mice.

She did say Newman was using
human subjects to do work on al
cohol and sleep. The experiments
dealt with "Whether alcohol really
helped you sleep better, but as I re
call it didn't really help much," she
said.
Smith said that she had only seen
Newman conducting these experi
ments once and"he was just doing
sleep EEC's."
When Newman died in 1959, Dr.
William Hofmann became the head
of the neurology division. Hofmann
is now an associate professor here
but is currently on sabbatical in Ger
many.
One year longer
According to Dr. David Prince,
current Chairman of the Department
of Neurology, Hofmann said that the
research Smith and Newman had
been doing was continued for only
one year after Newman's death.
Hofmann was contacted yesterday
by Prince.
According to Prince, Hofmann did
say that a Dr. Wallace Chan, who was
appointed an assistant clinical pro
fessor of medicine (neurology) in
1957, had looked for someone to re
place Newman but was unable to
find anyone.
Smith said that Chan had "more or
less served as a liaison between
Newman and the foundation (the
Geschickter Fund)."
OSS background
According to Prince there is a pos
sibility that Chan was working for the
CIA because of the way in which he
acted as a liaison for the funding of
Newman's project and because his
title and Office of Strategic Services
(OSS) background.
Prince said that Hofmann told him
Chan had been employed by the OSS
during World War II as an agent.
"From the documents I reviewed
this morning, it is fairly obvious that
he was the CIA operative involved in
these projects within the Medical
Center," said Prince.
Documents released by the CIA
show that in at least one case the
ptyson conducting experiments
here was a former OSS agent and that
his title was assistant clinical profes
sor of medicine (neurology).
