# Guidelines result from NIRT woes
## 
### Mike Charlson News Analysis 
With payment of nearly $395,000
and "polishing up" of final reports,
the case of the contract between the
University and National Iranian
Radio Television (NIRT) is presuma
bly closed.
The $978,000 contract, which took
effect Sept. 1, 1974, called for the
University to develop a domestic
telecommunications satellite system
and to develop programming re
commendations for educational
television in Iran.
Originally intended to run three
years, the contract was suddenly
terminated last fall by NIRT, with the
agency citing "general dissatisfac
tion" as the reason for the termina
tion.
At that time, it was discovered
NIRT had not been paying the full
amount owed the University. The
total amount due was $484,190, butin
a settlement reached over the dis
puted debt, NIRT's bill was reduced
by about $90,000.
But beyond the superficial, the
impact of the NIRT contract will likely
be felt for years.
Guidelines
As a result of problems encoun
tered with the contract, the Spon
sored Projects Office has issued a set
of guidelines for research contracts
and agreements between the Uni
versity and foreign organizations or
governments.
The guidelines, issued last July, are
designed to prevent the same prob
lems with work statement misun
derstandings, payment irregularities
and general beauraucratic difficul
ties encountered throughout the life
of the contract.
Under the guidelines, contracts
involving foreign governments will
be undertaken on a cost
reimbursement, best efforts basis,
according to the guidelines. The laws
of California and the United States
will be the applicable laws in the ag
reements.

More directly applicable to the
NIRT problems are policies on handl
ing arbitration of disagreements, alt
erations of the contracts after initial
signing, composition of work state
ments and management of financial
aspects.
The guidelines list arbitration in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitra
tion of the International Chamber of
Commerce, Paris, France as a possi
ble mechanism for resolving disag
reements. The rules also provide for
selection of impartial arbitrators.
Contract alterations
In the future, alterations of con
tracts must be made in writing and
signed by authorized officers from
the University and the sponsoring
agency. Misunderstanding appa
rently occurred with certain aspects
of the work done on the NIRT con
tract because some changes in the
work was changed verbally by the in
vestigators.
Vagueness in the work statement
was also blamed for disagreements
involving what work should have
been done. Therefore, the
guidelines suggest statements be
written in such a way that general
objectives of research efforts are
clearly understood.
The University will also require
payment in advance in the form of an
irrevocable letter of credit drawn on
an American bank for research for
foreign clients. The NIRT contract
