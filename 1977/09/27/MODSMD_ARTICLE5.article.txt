# In Israeli-Lebanon conflict
## U.S. mediated ceasefire begins 
### 
Beirut (AP) â€” Israeli armor rum
bled back southward across the
Lebanese-Israeli border and the artil
lery barrages that pounded embat
tled south Lebanon for weeks died
down yesterday as a U.S.-mediated
ceasefire took effect. But the future
of the truce remained uncertain.
Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) issued a state
ment late yesterday saying Israel was
"continuing to spread its circle of ag
gression" and was shelling southern
Lebanon.
But the charge could not be ver
ified immediately because reporters
left the battle area in midafternoon.
Earlier, Associated Press corres
pondent Alex Efty reported from the
Palestinian-held Lebanese border vil
lage of Khiam, a key target of the
Israeli-Lebanese Christian offensive,
that the big guns fell silent after the
ceasefire went into effect at 10 a.m.
But he said there was no sign of

guerrilla preparations to pull out in
accordance with announced provi
sions of the agreement for mutual
Israeli-Palestinian pullbacks.
At the nearby village of Mari, four
Israeli tanks were observed crossing
back into Israel. But Efty reported
that two other Israeli tanks remained
in position between Khiam and Mar
joyoun, one mile to the north, which
was held by Israeli-backed Christ
ians.
A PLO spokesman here said earlier
yesterday that final details of the
ceasefire agreement were still being
worked out. A small radical guerrilla
group, Dr. George Habash's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
vowed not to abide by it.
Reporters
In Israel, officials ..aid the ceasefire
had taken effect and invited repor
ters at the border town of Metulla to
watch as tanks and armored person
nel carriers that provided support for
the Christians in Lebanon returned

to Israel.
The truce took hold after a night of
heavy Israeli shelling of Khiam and
other guerrilla strongholds along the
18-mile border battlefront, and after
a salvo of Communist-made
Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon
fell on two northern Israeli towns,
wounding eight persons.
Later yesterday residents of Israeli
border settlements, who in recent
days spent much time in under
ground shelters, were out gathering
leafy branches for Sukkot holiday
celebrations, which began at sun
down.
The ceasefire, worked out with the
aid of U.S. diplomats in Beirut, calls
for withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanese territory and a pullback
from the border by the guerrillas,
who are to be replaced by a 1470-man
buffer unit from the Lebanese army.
The army was recently rebuilt after
having disintegrated during Leba
non's 1975-76 civil war.
