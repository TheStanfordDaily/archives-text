For most of Stanford, the Daily is a once-a
day shot of news,opinions and general before
and between class reading. But for a small
group of students here, the Daily expands
until life is centered in the Storke Building.
At the heart of the Daily, and most obvious
on the front page, are news editors Jim Tran
quada and Mike Charlson.
Both experienced reporters, last year they
made up the investigative team known as
Charl-Quada, which brought you the NIRT
contract stories and lots of South Africa news.
A new position at the Daily this year is that of
associate editor in investigative news, held by
former Summer Daily editor Randy Keith.
Along with Kurt Cobb, who looked into ac
tions of the Kuomintang here last year, this
new office should help the Daily look beneath
the surface at Stanford. Randy will also be in
charge of staff recruitment and training.
This year's sports department is being
headed by Bruce Anderson, a two-year vete
ran of the department who just finished his
second summer at the Hollister Evening Free
Lance as a general assignment reporter. Back
ing Bruce up will be Bill Burger, a news repor
ter who made the move to sports coverage last
year.
The opinions department is being coordi
nated by Dan Fiduccia, who just returned
from a four month sojourn in Italy at the

Center For Classical Studies in Rome. Dan will
be working in opinions with assistant editors
Randy David and Bruce Charonnat.
Features will be under the direction of Lori
Matsukawa, who returned just late Monday
from a summer job with the Honolulu Adver
tiser.
Rob Ericson and Lex Passaris, better known
here as the God-like Duo, will be this vol
ume's photo editors.
Entertainment will be managed by summer
entertainment ed Karen Wada, aided by John
Nielson, gonzo reviewer extraordinaire.
Copy editors will be former managing
editor Jack Vaughn and Dave Ansley, a repor
ter who's been away for a while working on
the Kitsap County Herald in Washington.
Stephen Crolius, former news and enter
tainment editor, will be editing the newly re
vived "Thursday," which premiers this week.
Stephen and Bruce Charonnat coordinated
the highly successful Orientation Issue, so
watch for good things there.
The list of other staff and reporters, review
ers and hangers-on could fill the entire page.
But we aren't too full. There's still plenty of
room for you, your talents and your ideas at
the Daily.
