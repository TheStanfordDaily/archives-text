# Bakke case more than reverse discrimination?
##

The Washington Post

There is, in the first place, the
Bakke case itself — a set of conflict
ing "facts" and competing principles
that the Supreme Court has agreed
to adjudicate. It concerns whether
Allan Bakke, a white would-be medi
cal student at the University of
California at Davis was unconstitu
tionally denied a chance to compete
for one of the places at that school
"solely" because of his race.
Mr. Bakke's charge is that Davis
maintains a rigid racial quota for cer
tain non-white students who are not
required to meet the general stan
dard for admission. Then, there is
the intense controversy concerning
political, legal, moral and cultural
values that has sprung up around the
Bakke case. Because the second of
these — the public debate — has
broken loose from the rather
homely, humdrum and inconclusive
record of the case, the two need to
be discussed separately.
That is a way of saying, among
other things, that we do not believe
the future of affirmative-action and
other programs designed to remedy
the effects of old and pervasive racial
wrongs must hang in the balance of
the Bakke case.
The point is worth insisting on.
There is a difference between the
kind of thinly disguised, uncompli
cated one-note racial quota program
Mr. Bakke alleged existed at Davis
and the kind of affirmative-action
program that is educationally and
constitutionally sound and emi
nently worth fighting to save.
Starkly put, it is the difference be
tween simply setting aside a fixed
number of places for people whose
skin is a designated color, on the one
hand, and, on the other, choosingan
entire medical school class in such a
way as to make race one factor — but
not the only factor — in the creation
of a desirable combination of stu
dents. Such a combination would re
flect the school's perceived obliga

tion to help overcome the effects of
past racial discrimination against cer
tain classes of Americans.
It would also reflect the school's
essential right to exercise discretion
in deciding how background,
character, interest, geographical dis
tribution and the rest combine to
make up a class of prospective doc

tors whose impact will be beneficial
on one another and ultimately on the
practice of medicine.
But it would not reflect a simple
throwing of the racial gear into au
tomatic, as Mr. Bakke claims Davis
has done. We believe the Court in
fact could end up ruling either for or
against Mr. Bakke in a way that would

preserve this distinction.
Actually the trouble with the Bakke
case as it was delivered to the Sup
reme Court's doorstep is a little more
complicated than it may look at first
glance. It's not just that the Davis
medical school appears to have cont
rived a program, which, in its clumsy
racialism, was a sitting duck for a
legal attack such as Mr. Bakke made.
In addition, and extremely impor
tant, the California Supreme Court,
which ruled for Mr. Bakke, appears
to have judged the Davis program by
an excessively severe standard of
what is allowed in racially sensitive
programs, one not only bound to
topple a program of this apparent
vulnerability, but also at least capa
ble of threatening some more
soundly organized affirmative-action
programs. So that would seem a cru
cial matter for certification by the
Court.
Finally, there is the fact that one
must make overlavish use of the
awkward locution "seems" in discus
sing all this because the factual re
cord concerning what really went on
and why has been put forward in very
murky form.
All this suggests to us, anyway, that
there is good and sufficient reason
for the Supreme Court to deal with
the Bakke case in a less than sweep
ing way. So far as we have been able
to judge, the university was in error
in some respects — and so was the
court that went beyond what was
needed to rectify those errors.
It follows from this that we do not
regard the Bakke case as an approp
riate vehicle for the impassioned and
often eloquent argument that is
shaping up over the merit of prog
rams designed to reverse the effects
of this country's historical in
dulgence in racial discrimination and
repression. But there are reasons be
sides the ambiguity of the available
case record for being disturbed by
the way the debate is taking form.

What is at issue should not be con
strued as something pitting the in
terests of blacks against those of
whites. Racial justice, which is at
heart what it's all about, can hardly
be considered as the exclusive con
cern of one or the other group.
Soundly based affirmative-action
programs are in the interest of white
and nonwhite Americans. And so is
the maintenance of a distinction be
tween going forward with such prog
rams and lapsing into lazy and
dangerous, if momentarily conve
nient, programs that effectively build
racial discrimination back into law.
The tension between individual
rights and group entitlements that is
raised, however imperfectly, by the
Bakke case is neither trivial nor sec-

ondary. We hope and expect the
Court can resolve it in a way that will
not do violence to the nation's com
mitment to take race into account to
redress generations of racial wrongs
or its commitment to preservation of
the individual's right to be seen by
the state as something more than a
racial statistic.
That is what the Bakke case is ab
out. That is why the administration
has been so tortured and torn in try
ing to contrive a brief that will ex
press its dedication to all the most
important values at issue. And that is
why the case doesn't lend itself, in
our judgement, to the kind of cheer
ing section polemics it is now inspir
ing in such profusion.
