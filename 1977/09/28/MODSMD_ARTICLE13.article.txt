# Midnight at the Oasis
## Happy birthday-meet you at the 'O' 
### Jon Hornsby 
In the middle of the after
noon, Oasis customers are al
ready well into their repertoire
of drinking beer, downing
cheeseburgers, playing pinball
and watching the afternoon
cartoons.
On 21st birthdays, itisalways
a special ceremony for locals
and students to come carve
their initials onto the tables
and walls of the tavern.
Although it is well known for
its charged-up post-football
game crowds, the "O" as bar
tender Pat Slattery describes it,
is mainly a place "for people to
sit down, maybe out on the
patio, and have a good conver
sation.
"We get all kinds in here,"
Slattery says, "Students,
families, a lot of old timers and
a lot of sports types. Some cus
tomers have been frequenting
the place ever since their dad
dies brought them. Their dads
still come too.
"The decor is 'Early Menlo
Park,' " says Slattery. "The
building was moved from
some old fort in the city a long
time ago. The upstairs was a
barracks. The downstairs was a
stable and you could say it's
been going downhill ever
since," he joked.
The beer garden burger
joint has been in business for
over 20 years. "Rumor has it
that even Herbert Hoover has
his initials carved in here
somewhere," said interim

manager Mark Wells. John
Kennedy is said to have fre
3uented the bar during his
ays at the business school, he
added.
Inside, the tavern is packed
with memorabilia to attest to its
history. Over the bar is a poster
advertising the 1904 Big Game.
Next to that is a picture of an
old man who is the drinking
legend of the place. "He's

been coming here for 40 years
and has been drunk for 50 of
'em," Wells remarked.
The inside lighting comes
from Budweiser lamps, glow
ing Schlitz globes and Pabst
and Busch chandeliers, as well
as red lightbulbs and small
windows.
An oar from the Stanford
crew team, a few moose
antlers, trophies from Oasis
sponsored teams and a big
lighted frog are among the
many relics tucked around the
woodwork.

Only those who are 21 years
of age or older can get in here.
Minors accompanied by their
parents are allowed entry.
Slattery said many minors try
to enter using bogus I.D.
cards. Among Slattery's favo
rite I.D.s were "one printed by
some kid with his cereal box
print kit that said he was from
lowa," and "all those Stanford
student body cards with no age

shown on them."
One memorable night was
when participants from a local
rugby tournament packed the
place and became so imbibed
that one rowdy young man
began to take off his coveralls,
said Slattery.
He came to his senses when
informed that the night was
still young and that sort of
campaign would come later.
But then, what do you expect at
a place that serves red beer on
Big Came day?
Votes are taken at the bar to

decide which television show
will be watched.
"Usually sports programs
dominate," said Slattery. "For
instance, when the choice is
between John Wayne and the
49ers, the football game usu
allywinsout. And of course the

"The main reason people go
there is the hamburgers are the
best in the world," added
another student. "They're
served medium-rare."
"I don't know why the 'O'
cards people," mused one 21-
year old. "They do serve food.

bartender has final authority."
"One thing I don't like about
the O is that they sell this dried
sea shrimp. It's disgusting,"
said one student who was a
birthday celebrant at the beer
den. "It tastes like old shoe
laces."
"I like the place," said
another "O" visitor emphati
cally. "When you go in, you get
so drunk you can't leave."

Anyone can just walk in during
the day. I guess they don'twant
those Paly High crowds in
there."
A typical sampling of barsit
ters includes a couple of tennis
players — still in their war
mups, an old man complaining
about the program on TV and a
young coupie talking quietly.
Outside, the patio is a pleas
ant retreat with trees, plants

and the sounds of El Camino
traffic pervading the atmos
phere.
"Usually at about 1:30 we
have a regular bunch of grad
students who come in to play
pinball," said Slattery.
"Among our more notable
visitors are some 49ers football
players," said Wells and a cus
tomer put in, "Yeah, even Y.A.
Tittle came in once."
Other peculiar .features of
the establishment are the
"mutilated" table tops hungon
the walls. The carved tabletops
reveal the love affairs and per
sonal thoughts of countless
"O" visitors.
As the hundreds of these
carvings will attest, the Oasis
has a charm that keeps bring

In the middle of the after
noon, Oasis customers are al
ready well into their repertoire
of drinking beer, downing
cheeseburgers, playing pinball
and watching the afternoon
cartoons.
On 21st birthdays, itisalways
a special ceremony for locals
and students to come carve
their initials onto the tables
and walls of the tavern.
Although it is well known for
its charged-up post-football
game crowds, the "O" as bar
tender Pat Slattery describes it,
is mainly a place "for people to
sit down, maybe out on the
patio, and have a good conver
sation.
"We get all kinds in here,"
Slattery says, "Students,
families, a lot of old timers and
a lot of sports types. Some cus
tomers have been frequenting
the place ever since their dad
dies brought them. Their dads
still come too.
"The decor is 'Early Menlo
Park,' " says Slattery. "The
building was moved from
some old fort in the city a long
time ago. The upstairs was a
barracks. The downstairs was a
stable and you could say it's
been going downhill ever
since," he joked.
The beer garden burger
joint has been in business for
over 20 years. "Rumor has it
that even Herbert Hoover has
his initials carved in here
somewhere," said interim

manager Mark Wells. John
Kennedy is said to have fre
3uented the bar during his
ays at the business school, he
added.
Inside, the tavern is packed
with memorabilia to attest to its
history. Over the bar is a poster
advertising the 1904 Big Game.
Next to that is a picture of an
old man who is the drinking
legend of the place. "He's

been coming here for 40 years
and has been drunk for 50 of
'em," Wells remarked.
The inside lighting comes
from Budweiser lamps, glow
ing Schlitz globes and Pabst
and Busch chandeliers, as well
as red lightbulbs and small
windows.
An oar from the Stanford
crew team, a few moose
antlers, trophies from Oasis
sponsored teams and a big
lighted frog are among the
many relics tucked around the
woodwork.

Only those who are 21 years
of age or older can get in here.
Minors accompanied by their
parents are allowed entry.
Slattery said many minors try
to enter using bogus I.D.
cards. Among Slattery's favo
rite I.D.s were "one printed by
some kid with his cereal box
print kit that said he was from
lowa," and "all those Stanford
student body cards with no age

shown on them."
One memorable night was
when participants from a local
rugby tournament packed the
place and became so imbibed
that one rowdy young man
began to take off his coveralls,
said Slattery.
He came to his senses when
informed that the night was
still young and that sort of
campaign would come later.
But then, what do you expect at
a place that serves red beer on
Big Came day?
Votes are taken at the bar to

decide which television show
will be watched.

In the middle of the after
noon, Oasis customers are al
ready well into their repertoire
of drinking beer, downing
cheeseburgers, playing pinball
and watching the afternoon
cartoons.
On 21st birthdays, itisalways
a special ceremony for locals
and students to come carve
their initials onto the tables
and walls of the tavern.
Although it is well known for
its charged-up post-football
game crowds, the "O" as bar
tender Pat Slattery describes it,
is mainly a place "for people to
sit down, maybe out on the
patio, and have a good conver
sation.
"We get all kinds in here,"
Slattery says, "Students,
families, a lot of old timers and
a lot of sports types. Some cus
tomers have been frequenting
the place ever since their dad
dies brought them. Their dads
still come too.
"The decor is 'Early Menlo
Park,' " says Slattery. "The
building was moved from
some old fort in the city a long
time ago. The upstairs was a
barracks. The downstairs was a
stable and you could say it's
been going downhill ever
since," he joked.
