# Original Big Game pigskin?
## Archives given ancient football

Withered by age and badly
misshapen, the laceless, de
flated leather shell hardly re
sembles a football.
But the misshapen leather
object, recently donated to the
University's archives, is pur
portedly the ball used at the
original Big Game in 1892 when
Stanford surprised a larger,
more experienced California
eleven, 14-10.
The old football belonged
for many years to Darwin B.
Lyon Jr., a member of the 1896
Stanford football team.
Two of Lyon's grandchil
dren, Trudi Moller and Darwin
Isensee, donated the football to
the University. They also gave
the school assorted football
gear used by their grandfather
here during the 1890s.
Lyons was a rancher in the
Red Bluff area after leaving
Stanford. How the ball came
into his possession is un
known.
Whether or not the ball was
actually used in the first Big
Came also remains a mystery.
Ralph Hansen, the Univer
sity archivist, said that the case
for the authenticity of the ball
was "all circumstantial evi
dence."
Faded ink script which reads
"Old Stanford Ball 1892" is the
only marking which decorates
the ball.

If the ball is indeed the ball
used in the first Stanford-Cal
football clash, it then ha* a fas
cinating history.
California's Golden Bears
had fielded football teams for
nearly 10 years when Stanford
opened its doors for the first
time in the fall of 1891. The
gridders from across the Bay
were anxious for collegiate
competition and challenged
the fledgling university in Palo
Alto to a Thanksgiving Day con
test.
Shortly after fall registration

things had been set in motion
to bring football to the Farm. A
self-appointed group ap
proached John Whittemore, a
transfer from Washington Uni
versity in St. Louis, to head a
Stanford eleven.
When the boys from Ber
keley issued their challenge in
the fall, Whittemore wisely
declined.
After three months of prep
aration, Whittemore had word
sent back to Cal that Stanford
was ready to meet the Bears for
the first Big Came.

More than 15,000 people
jammed into a renovated
baseball field on Haight Street
in San Francisco on March 19 to
view the birth of the cross-bay
football rivalry.
The start of the game was re
portedly delayed an hourwhen
Herbert Hoover, the Stanford
tootball manager and later the
31 st President of the United
States, forgot to bring a foot
ball.
As the story goes, the owner
of a sporting goods store who
was in the crowd rode

downtown to secure a ball
from his store.
What he returned with was a
strange cross between a foot
ball and punching bag.
Whatever it was, Stanford
carried it to three first-half
touchdowns (then worth four
points each) and a 14-0 advan
tage at intermission.
The Cardinals hung on to de
teat California, 14-10, and es
tablish forever their athletic
superiority over the Cal
Weenies.

A beaten leather ball (foreground), purported to be the football used
in the first Big Game, rests on an old pair of padded game pants next
to a modern counterpart and the ball used in the 1930 Stanford-
California clash. The ball, pants and woolen pullover jersey were
owned for many years by Darwin Lyons who played football at
Stanford in the 1890s, and Lyon's grandchildren recently donated the
items to the University's archives.
