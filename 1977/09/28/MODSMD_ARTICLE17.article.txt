# Collective bargaining urged for colleges
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” The
chairman of the state university
and colleges Board of Trustees
urged the board yesterday to
explore means of collective
bargaining that would not
threaten the system's educa
tional quality.
"In my judgment, the time
has come for us to de
monstrate that the trustees and
faculties and staff can work to
gether to formulate the proce
dures necessary to provide for
a form of collective negotia
tions appropriate for a quality
system of higher education,"
Chairman Roy Brophy said dur
ing the first day of a two-day
board meeting.
Speaking before the Com
mittee on Gifts and Public Af
fairs, Brophy said he remained
"convinced that quality educa
tion would suffer if faculty and
others throughout the system
were to function under the
customary system of collective
bargaining."
Brophy requested that state
universities Chancellor Glenn
Dumke begin "a review of
what options are available to
the Board within the system to
achieve collective negotiations
under conditions of true colle
gia'ity "
The board, he said, might
want to amend the state ad
ministrative code "to form our
own negotiation procedure,
one under which we can live
together and serve compati
bly."
He emphasized the board
would take no unilateral action
on the matter but would first
consult with the appropriate
faculty and employe groups
before acting.
