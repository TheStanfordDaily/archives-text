# Workers reject UFW bid to unionize
## 
### 
Bakersfield (AP) — Employes
of the nation's largest table
grape firm have rejected the
United Farm Workers (UFW) in
the biggest no union victory
yet in California's farm labor
elections.
The vote total at Giumarra
vineyards was 900 for no union
representation, 673 for the
Cesar Chavez-led UFW and 172
challenged ballots. Totals were
announced by the Agricultural
Labor Relations Board (ALRB)
early yesterday after ballots
were counted through the
night.
John Giumarra Jr., vice pres
ident of the firm, termed yes
terday's vote "one of the most
significant elections in agricul
tural labor relations history."

Ciumarra added that "we
have a clear overwhelming no
union choice by the farm
workers even if all the chal
lenged ballots were cast for the
UFW."
It was only the fourth no
union victory among 60 non
dairy farm labor elections held
since the elections process was
reactivated last December,
William Camp, a board
spokesman, said in Sac
ramento.
The UFW had won 42 of the
previous elections this year,
dominating the balloting in
most areas just as it did during
the first round of farm labor
voting in the fall of 1975. The
UFW won almost half the 400
elections held then with only

29 resulting in a no union
majority.
UFW organizer Jim Drake
vowed to press more than 90
unfair labor practice charges
against Ciumarra and said the
union expects to get a million
dollar settlement.
A hearing will be conducted
Oct. 17 on those charges, said
Robert Dresser, the agricul
tural labor board's regional di
rector.
The five-member ALRB even
tually will have to decide
whether to certify the vote. If it
finally goes "no union," the
UFW would not be allowed to
petition for another election at
Ciumarra for one year.
Chavez has been trying to
organize Ciumarra since 1965

and succeeded only once. The
UFW won contracts with
Giumarra and other San Joa
quin Valley table grape grow
ers in 1970 after a boycott.
However, growers refused
to renew those pacts three
years later and signed instead
with theTeamsters Union.
The violence in the summer
of 1973 helped spur the state
legislature to enact a bill two
years later which established
state-run farm union elections.
The Teamsters wound up 17
votes of a majority at the origi
nal Giumarra elections in Sep
tember, 1975. However, the
ALRB never resolved chal
lenged ballots because it was
out of business without fund
ing for 10 months in 1976.
The Teamsters quit organiz
ing field hands this year, and
the ALRB voided the 1975
Giumarra election.

However, growers refused
to renew those pacts three
years later and signed instead
with theTeamsters Union.
The violence in the summer
of 1973 helped spur the state
legislature to enact a bill two
years later which established
state-run farm union elections.
The Teamsters wound up 17
votes of a majority at the origi
nal Giumarra elections in Sep
tember, 1975. However, the
ALRB never resolved chal
lenged ballots because it was
out of business without fund
ing for 10 months in 1976.
The Teamsters quit organiz
ing field hands this year, and
the ALRB voided the 1975
Giumarra election.

the last day 01 autumn quarter registration. Those who did not register by 5 p.m. yesterday will be assessed

Bakersfield (AP) — Employes
of the nation's largest table
grape firm have rejected the
United Farm Workers (UFW) in
the biggest no union victory
yet in California's farm labor
elections.
The vote total at Giumarra
vineyards was 900 for no union
representation, 673 for the
Cesar Chavez-led UFW and 172
challenged ballots. Totals were
announced by the Agricultural
Labor Relations Board (ALRB)
early yesterday after ballots
were counted through the
night.
John Giumarra Jr., vice pres
ident of the firm, termed yes
terday's vote "one of the most
significant elections in agricul
tural labor relations history."

Ciumarra added that "we
have a clear overwhelming no
union choice by the farm
workers even if all the chal
lenged ballots were cast for the
UFW."
It was only the fourth no
union victory among 60 non
dairy farm labor elections held
since the elections process was
reactivated last December,
William Camp, a board
spokesman, said in Sac
ramento.
The UFW had won 42 of the
previous elections this year,
dominating the balloting in
most areas just as it did during
the first round of farm labor
voting in the fall of 1975. The
UFW won almost half the 400
elections held then with only

29 resulting in a no union
majority.
UFW organizer Jim Drake
vowed to press more than 90
unfair labor practice charges
against Ciumarra and said the
union expects to get a million
dollar settlement.
A hearing will be conducted
Oct. 17 on those charges, said
Robert Dresser, the agricul
tural labor board's regional di
rector.
The five-member ALRB even
tually will have to decide
whether to certify the vote. If it
finally goes "no union," the
UFW would not be allowed to
petition for another election at
Ciumarra for one year.
Chavez has been trying to
organize Ciumarra since 1965

and succeeded only once. The
UFW won contracts with
Giumarra and other San Joa
quin Valley table grape grow
ers in 1970 after a boycott.
However, growers refused
to renew those pacts three
years later and signed instead
with theTeamsters Union.
