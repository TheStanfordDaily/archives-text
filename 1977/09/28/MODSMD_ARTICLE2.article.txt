# Old Union defendants vote to plead no contest
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
Some of the remaining defendants
arrested May 10 during a sit-in at Old
Union protesting University invest
ment policy will plead no contest in
court October 3.
Citing a variety of factors, a defen
dants' meeting voted last night to
plead no contest to any one of three
charges of trespassing and failure to
disperse that they face.
The approximately 30 students at
the meeting last night were among
the 294 people arrested following the
16 hour sit-in protesting University
investments in companies that oper
ate in South Africa.
The exact number of people
whose cases remain before the court
is uncertain, according to Don
Moonshine, a member of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy, which was in
strumental in organizing the sit-in.
Many of those due in court Oct. 3
were not here during the summer,
Moonshine said.
Majority unavailable
Those at the meeting estimated the
number of people involved could be
as high as 130.
The fragmented and uncohesive

nature of the defendants' group
coupled with the necessity of a
prompt decision precluded a deci
sion of the majority, those at the
meeting said.
They cited the results of a mailing
sent out this summer to many of
those arrested in an attempt to de
termine whether or not to proceed
with an Oct. 3 trial.
Of the 11 people who responded,
eight did not want a third trial.
The small number of people pre
sent at the meeting was also cited as
an example of the general lack of in
terest and energy that would be
necessary to sustain a new trial.
Major deterrents
The inability of those who went to
trial this summer to elucidate their
reasons for sitting in and a lack of
publicity were chief among the
reasons given for pleading no con
test.
The cost, in both time and money,
of going to trial, the high probability
of conviction, and the difficulty in
coordinating and presenting a col
lective defense were also seen as
major deterrents.
Going to trial for the third time is
"like running into a brick wall," said
one of the defendants last night.

During two previous trials this
sujnmer, 11 of 15 defendants were
found guilty, placed on six months'
probation, and fined $65.
A hung jury occurred in the trial of
the other four defendants. An addi
tional trial was averted a week later
when six new defendants changed
their pleas to no contest.
All other defendants, who origi
nally pleaded guilty or no contest,
also received probation and a fine.
Reaffirm opposition
The defendants plan to approve
and present a group statement on
Monday, reaffirming their opposi
tion to University investment policy.
Instead of paying fines, an attempt
will be made to substitute 50 hours of
volunteer work at a non-profit or
ganization, an option which has
been granted previous defendants.
The Palo Alto Volunteer Bureau is
where the students will be sent for
assignment by the court, according
to one of the group's lawyers. The
defendants hope to submit an addi
tional list of volunteer organizations
to the bureau before Monday which
would enable them to continue to
organize against University invest
ment policy while performing their
required 50 hours of work.

A hung jury occurred in the trial of
the other four defendants. An addi
tional trial was averted a week later
when six new defendants changed
their pleas to no contest.
All other defendants, who origi
nally pleaded guilty or no contest,
also received probation and a fine.
Reaffirm opposition
The defendants plan to approve
and present a group statement on
Monday, reaffirming their opposi
tion to University investment policy.
Instead of paying fines, an attempt
will be made to substitute 50 hours of
volunteer work at a non-profit or
ganization, an option which has
been granted previous defendants.
The Palo Alto Volunteer Bureau is
where the students will be sent for
assignment by the court, according
to one of the group's lawyers. The
defendants hope to submit an addi
tional list of volunteer organizations
to the bureau before Monday which
would enable them to continue to
organize against University invest
ment policy while performing their
required 50 hours of work.
Some of the remaining defendants
arrested May 10 during a sit-in at Old
Union protesting University invest
ment policy will plead no contest in
court October 3.
Citing a variety of factors, a defen
dants' meeting voted last night to
plead no contest to any one of three
charges of trespassing and failure to
disperse that they face.
The approximately 30 students at
the meeting last night were among
the 294 people arrested following the
16 hour sit-in protesting University
investments in companies that oper
ate in South Africa.
The exact number of people
whose cases remain before the court
is uncertain, according to Don
Moonshine, a member of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy, which was in
strumental in organizing the sit-in.
Many of those due in court Oct. 3
were not here during the summer,
Moonshine said.
Majority unavailable
Those at the meeting estimated the
number of people involved could be
as high as 130.
The fragmented and uncohesive

nature of the defendants' group
coupled with the necessity of a
prompt decision precluded a deci
sion of the majority, those at the
meeting said.
They cited the results of a mailing
sent out this summer to many of
those arrested in an attempt to de
termine whether or not to proceed
with an Oct. 3 trial.
Of the 11 people who responded,
eight did not want a third trial.
The small number of people pre
sent at the meeting was also cited as
an example of the general lack of in
terest and energy that would be
necessary to sustain a new trial.
Major deterrents
The inability of those who went to
trial this summer to elucidate their
reasons for sitting in and a lack of
publicity were chief among the
reasons given for pleading no con
test.
The cost, in both time and money,
of going to trial, the high probability
of conviction, and the difficulty in
coordinating and presenting a col
lective defense were also seen as
major deterrents.
Going to trial for the third time is
"like running into a brick wall," said
one of the defendants last night.

During two previous trials this
sujnmer, 11 of 15 defendants were
found guilty, placed on six months'
probation, and fined $65.
