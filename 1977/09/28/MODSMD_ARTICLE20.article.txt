# Business optimism means good jobs for GSB grads
## 
### Steven Burr 
Despite economists' recent
predictions of an imminent
economic slowdown, this
year's figures on the hiring of
graduates from the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) indi
cate an expanding economy
and general optimism in the
business community.
The most positive sign of op
timism, according to Carol

Marchick, assistant dean for
placement at the school, is the
increase of jobs accorded to
graduates by small companies
such as real estate and venture
capital firms, since these are
high risk operations and re
quire a good business climate
to expand payrolls.
Some 13 per cent of the stu
dents took positions with such
businesses this year, up from

11 per cent last year.
Graduates received an aver
age of four job offers each and
the median of the salaries they
eventually accepted was
$22,000, up from $19,500 last
year, an increase of nearly 13
per cent, Marchick said.
According to Marchick,
prospects are even better for
future graduates with more
companies than ever coming
to the University to recruit
from the GSB.
Lured by the prospect of
such salaries, 4300 persons
applied for the 300 spaces the
school offered this fall, a rise of
700 applicants over last year's
figure.
The GSB has the largest ratio
of applicants to available
spaces of any business school
in the country, according to
Lawrence Lieberman, dean of
GSB admissions.
Harvard has a comparable
number of applicants but more
than twice as many spaces, he
said.
Acceptance
According to Marchick, the
MBA degree is enjoying a grea
ter amount of acceptance
nationwide than in previous
years, as indicated by a more
uniform geographical distribu
tion of median salaries. In New
York City and the Northwest in
1975, for instance, Stanford
MBA holders received median
salaries of $18,750 and $7,500
respectively. This year, on the
other hand, the figures were
much closer: $22,000 and
$21,500 respectively.
While an increasing number
of graduates did opt for smaller
companies, the majority still
went to larger firms.
Twelve companies alone at
tracted 28 per cent of the class.
McKinsey Company,
worldwide consulting firm, led
the way hiring 15 members of
the class of 310.
Twelve graduates eletted to
take government jobs and
drew a median starting salary
of $20,400.

11 per cent last year.
Graduates received an aver
age of four job offers each and
the median of the salaries they
eventually accepted was
$22,000, up from $19,500 last
year, an increase of nearly 13
per cent, Marchick said.
According to Marchick,
prospects are even better for
future graduates with more
companies than ever coming
to the University to recruit
from the GSB.
Lured by the prospect of
such salaries, 4300 persons
applied for the 300 spaces the
school offered this fall, a rise of
700 applicants over last year's
figure.
The GSB has the largest ratio
of applicants to available
spaces of any business school
in the country, according to
Lawrence Lieberman, dean of
GSB admissions.
Harvard has a comparable
number of applicants but more
than twice as many spaces, he
said.
Acceptance
According to Marchick, the
MBA degree is enjoying a grea
ter amount of acceptance
nationwide than in previous
years, as indicated by a more
uniform geographical distribu
tion of median salaries. In New
York City and the Northwest in
1975, for instance, Stanford
MBA holders received median
salaries of $18,750 and $7,500
respectively. This year, on the
other hand, the figures were
much closer: $22,000 and
$21,500 respectively.
While an increasing number
of graduates did opt for smaller
companies, the majority still
went to larger firms.
Twelve companies alone at
tracted 28 per cent of the class.
McKinsey Company,
worldwide consulting firm, led
the way hiring 15 members of
the class of 310.
Twelve graduates eletted to
take government jobs and
drew a median starting salary
of $20,400.
