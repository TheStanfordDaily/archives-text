# Aerial war launched on Mexican poppy fields

### 
San Jose Del Llano, Mexico (AP) —
Helicopter XC-GID shuddered and
bucked as pilot Carlos Aguilar Lomeli,
hunting opium-producing poppy fields,
coaxed it up a windy canyon high in the
Sierra Madre Mountains.
Foui-hundred feet above, flying bac
kup in another Bell 212, Juan Flores
watched Lomeli's machine laboring in the
thin air, its cargo hold filled with a plastic
tank containing 250 gallons of gramoxone
herbicide.
"Left, come left, Lomeli," Flores called
over the radio. "Straight ahead now.
You're lined up."
With the 40-foot spray boom barely
skimming the tops of pine trees, Lomeli
suddenly found himself over a one-acre
clearing filled with 2Vi foot high crimson
flowers.
For five seconds herbicide drained
from the helicopter. It would leave the
field, about 350 miles south of Columbus,
N.M., chemically burned in 36 hours.
War
Lomeli and Flores are agents of the
Mexican attorney general's office and

part of a 250-person, 18-helicopter task
force waging a ground and aerial war
against opium poppies.
The poppies come into season in the
spring and fall here, the periods of
maximum rainfall.
The task force, with support from the
army, covers a four state area stretching
from the southern end of Sonora and
Chihuahua, which border Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas in the north, down
through the coastal state of Sinaloa, bor
dering Sonora on the south, and parts of
Durango, east of Sinaloa.
The man who heads the task force in
the area, designated as Region Six, is Car
los Aguilar Carza.
Aguilar Carza, who is headquartered in
Culiacan, says the area is by far Mexico's
largest producers of opium, the source of
heroin.
U.S. drug enforcement officials, who
fly with the Mexican crews as observers,
say the area accounts for a major portion
of the heroin sold in the United States.
Mexico has become the main supplier of
heroin in the States.

The area to which Lomeli and Flores
were assigned recently was in southern
Chihuahua, about 50 miles north of San
Jose Del Llano, where mountain ridges
top 10,000 feet.
Looking down from Flores' helicopter
dozens of poppy fields could be seen
ranging from about one-eighth of an acre
to two acres.
"People are down there all right," said
Fiores. "They take off for cover when they
hear the sound of a helicopter.
"A few days ago, not too far from here,
somebody opened up on one of the spray
helicopters with a machine gun," he said.
"One observer was hit in the arm and
we counted 11 bullet holes in the
machine."
Many of the pilots wear body armor. All
are armed, and the observation helicop
ters sometimes carry soldiers who may
land and try to arrest the growers.
Aguilar Carza said the poppy fields are
planted by peasants at the bidding of nar
cotics traffickers. He said the peasants,
who are responsible for handing over the
opium gum the plants yield, can earn

$2000 to $3000 a year, although they face
penalties beginning with a minimum sen
tence of more than five years in jail with
out possibility of parole.
He said that when poppies are not in
season, the same peasants may grow
marijuana.
"It's a simple matter of economics," he
said. "Many of the peasants believe they
have no other means of income.
"We know that spraying the fields and
arresting people isn't going to solve the
problem. The government is moving to
find other industries that can be offered
to the growers as a substitute."
Aguilar Carza said "the peasants never
use drugs themselves, and may not be
aware of the dangers they pose to
others."
He said about 1300 persons are arrested
on narcotics charges in his region each
year, and that the jails "are crammed full
of narcotics offenders."
"We estimate we're destroying about
86 per cent of the fields," Lopez Carza
said. "The ones that aren't destroyed are
the ones we don't see."

ranging from about one-eighth of an acre
to two acres.
"People are down there all right," said
Fiores. "They take off for cover when they
hear the sound of a helicopter.
"A few days ago, not too far from here,
somebody opened up on one of the spray
helicopters with a machine gun," he said.
"One observer was hit in the arm and
we counted 11 bullet holes in the
machine."
Many of the pilots wear body armor. All
are armed, and the observation helicop
ters sometimes carry soldiers who may
land and try to arrest the growers.
Aguilar Carza said the poppy fields are
planted by peasants at the bidding of nar
cotics traffickers. He said the peasants,
who are responsible for handing over the
opium gum the plants yield, can earn

$2000 to $3000 a year, although they face
penalties beginning with a minimum sen
tence of more than five years in jail with
out possibility of parole.
He said that when poppies are not in
season, the same peasants may grow
marijuana.
"It's a simple matter of economics," he
said. "Many of the peasants believe they
have no other means of income.
"We know that spraying the fields and
arresting people isn't going to solve the
problem. The government is moving to
find other industries that can be offered
to the growers as a substitute."
Aguilar Carza said "the peasants never
use drugs themselves, and may not be
aware of the dangers they pose to
others."
He said about 1300 persons are arrested
on narcotics charges in his region each
year, and that the jails "are crammed full
of narcotics offenders."
"We estimate we're destroying about
86 per cent of the fields," Lopez Carza
said. "The ones that aren't destroyed are
the ones we don't see."
San Jose Del Llano, Mexico (AP) —
Helicopter XC-GID shuddered and
bucked as pilot Carlos Aguilar Lomeli,
hunting opium-producing poppy fields,
coaxed it up a windy canyon high in the
Sierra Madre Mountains.
Foui-hundred feet above, flying bac
kup in another Bell 212, Juan Flores
watched Lomeli's machine laboring in the
thin air, its cargo hold filled with a plastic
tank containing 250 gallons of gramoxone
herbicide.
"Left, come left, Lomeli," Flores called
over the radio. "Straight ahead now.
You're lined up."
With the 40-foot spray boom barely
skimming the tops of pine trees, Lomeli
suddenly found himself over a one-acre
clearing filled with 2Vi foot high crimson
flowers.
For five seconds herbicide drained
from the helicopter. It would leave the
field, about 350 miles south of Columbus,
N.M., chemically burned in 36 hours.
War
Lomeli and Flores are agents of the
Mexican attorney general's office and

part of a 250-person, 18-helicopter task
force waging a ground and aerial war
against opium poppies.
The poppies come into season in the
spring and fall here, the periods of
maximum rainfall.
The task force, with support from the
army, covers a four state area stretching
from the southern end of Sonora and
Chihuahua, which border Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas in the north, down
through the coastal state of Sinaloa, bor
dering Sonora on the south, and parts of
Durango, east of Sinaloa.
The man who heads the task force in
the area, designated as Region Six, is Car
los Aguilar Carza.
Aguilar Carza, who is headquartered in
Culiacan, says the area is by far Mexico's
largest producers of opium, the source of
heroin.
U.S. drug enforcement officials, who
fly with the Mexican crews as observers,
say the area accounts for a major portion
of the heroin sold in the United States.
Mexico has become the main supplier of
heroin in the States.

The area to which Lomeli and Flores
were assigned recently was in southern
Chihuahua, about 50 miles north of San
Jose Del Llano, where mountain ridges
top 10,000 feet.
Looking down from Flores' helicopter
dozens of poppy fields could be seen
ranging from about one-eighth of an acre
to two acres.
