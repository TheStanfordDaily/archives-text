# Klan marches once again
## 
### 
Montgomery, Ala. (AP) â€”
With a medley of tunes, not
just the old theme song of ra
cial strife, the hooded re
mnants of the Ku Klux Klan are
marching again. And, again,
they are encountering angry
resistance, black and white.
But the battleground is mov
ing also to the courts, says Im
perial Wizard Robert Shelton.
And, he says, in combating
school busing, "we're even of
fering our legal services to
blacks."
Some black parents indi
cated a willingness to accept
the offer, Shelton says, "but
the NAACP and other organiza
tions scared them off."
Shelton, who reigns over the
United Klans of America, says
the KKK is becoming more ag
gressive and more visible in
court and in the streets.
And, as before, its marches
have touched off racial vio
lence even though Klan lead
ers, in some instances, main
tained that their protests were

aimed at nonracial issues.
About 100 Klansmen who
paraded through downtown
Mobile last Saturday carried
signs denouncing the state's
work-release program for pris
oners, which allows convicts to
take outside jobs before they
are released.
Blacks stood by, jeering the
white-robed marchers and
drowning out their speakers
with songs and freedom
chants.
A black policeman, Donald
Pinkney, off duty and out of un
iform, was beaten by fellow of
ficers and arrested on a charge
of assaulting another police
man. Pinkney's father said his
son attended the rally merely
as a "citizen and observer,"
ready to assist any other officer
who might need help.
Other Klansmen, with the
public support of a black city
councilman, have been given a
permit to parade this Saturday
in downtown Montgomery.
The target of their protest, they

say, is the Panama Canal treaty.
Luther Oliver, one of four
blacks on the nine-member
City Council, supported the
request for a parade permit,
and even offered to sponsor it
if requested. He said he is a
strong believer in the constitu
tional right of free speech.
But Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill
Baxley says he has nothing but
scorn for the Klan and its claims
of increased strength. "They're
just a small group of misfits,
outlaws," he says. "They are
more vocal than numerous."
