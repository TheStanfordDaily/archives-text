Sacramento (AP) â€” An anes
thesiologist has had his license
revoked after he urinated into
a coffee cup and then injected
the fluid into two patients in
separate operations, a state of
ficial said yesterday.
Vern Leeper, spokesman for
the state Board of Medical
Quality Assurance, confirmed
that Dr. William Novick had his
license revoked because of the
incidents July 26 and 27 at San
Diego Community Hospital.
The first public report of the
revocation, which occurred

Sept. 14, came from the Sac
ramento Union.
Acting on the revocation, the
board found Novick was "in
competent" and "grossly im
moral." It also held he "com
mitted acts involving moral
turpitude."
Nurses present in the operat
ing room reported the
episodes to the hospital which
in turn informed the board,
which launched an intensive
investigation, Leeper said.
