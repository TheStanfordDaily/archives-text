### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The Board of Education's
new integration plan limiting mandatory busing
to 112,000 students in grades four through eight
came under sharp attack yesterday by propo
nents of more extensive measures.
"The Board has again shown its contempt for
the law and the mandate of the courts," said
Henry Dotson of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Dotson and representatives from the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center
for Law and Justice held a news conference
Monday to outline their objections to the plan,
which the board adopted by a 5-2 vote Monday.
Dotson, chairman of the metropolitan council
of Los Angeles NAACP branches, said the group
will urge Superior Court Judge Paul Egly to reject
the plan, knowp as Concept L.
"We will strenuously oppose any move to
again remand the plan to the board," Dotson
added. .
Judge Egly, under a state Supreme Court
order to supervise integration of district

schools, instructed the board to submit a re
vised plan by Oct. 3 after rejecting the original
proposal in July.
Joyce Fisk, president of the Southern Califor
nia ACLU, said the new plan is "completely un
satisfactory and leaves the school system racially
and ethnically divided. . . .
"Unfortunately, the name of the game for
most school boards is 'delay, delay, delay,' and
this board is no different from most boards in
the country which have delayed as long as pos
sible on integration."
Tomas Sanchez, legal intern at the Center for
Law and Justice, said the plan makes no provi
sion for about 70,000 Hispanic children who
speak little or no English.
All three groups expressed strong concern
over the plan's failure to integrate more than
211.000 of the district's 595,000 students. These
_ students would be left in 153 segregated
schools, defined as those with more than 70 per
cent white or minority enrollment.
