# Whatever happened to Walter?

Washington (AP) — Whatever
happened to Walter Mondale?
Eight months ago he moved
into the vice presidency, estab
lished what he called "a perfect
relationship" with President
jimmy Carter, and set off on
trips to Europe and Japan as the
president's highly visible emis
sary.
But in recent weeks, the vice
president has nearly sunk from
public view, so much so that at
least one of his staff members

worries that "in terms of
strategy, it makes sense for
Mondale to be a little more vis
ible than he's been."
While Mondale takes pains
to defer to the president, his
staff members are mindful of
his public image and the possi
bility that someday he may run
for the presidency himself.
Busy as ever
Close aides to the vice presi
dent say he is as busy as he has
ever been in the Carter ad
ministration, but his activities
— advising Carter, attending
Carter's meetings with foreign
officials, quietly lobbying the
Senate, and making out-of
town political speeches — are
not likely to attract public at
tention.
"What's happened to Walter
Mondale? I don't know how
many people are asking me
that," said James Johnson, his
executive assistant. "But the
weeks since Labor Day have
been the busiest three weeks
since he came into office."
In the international sphere,
Mondale took part last week in
meetings Carter held with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Is
mail Fahmy, Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan, and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Cromyko.
With the president, Mondale
has been urging his former col
leagues in the Senate to sup
port the Panama Canal treaty.
His much-heralded role in

setting U.S. policy towards Af
rica has lessened to some ex
tent, although he is still "keep
ing himself up to date on the
African developments,"
Johnson said.
On domestic issues, Mon
dale announced the administ
ration's proposal last week for
expanded home rule for the
District of Columbia. He is
working with Carter on the
administration's major tax revi
sion plan, expected to be an
nounced within two weeks.
He tried to shepherd the
administration's election law
reform package through Con
gress, but ran head on into Re
publican and Democratic op
position that he could not
overcome.
Working mostly on the tele
phone, he has spent a consid
erable amount of time in re
cent days fighting for the ad
ministration's proposed crude
oil tax and against deregulation
of natural gas prices, but he has
met with less than total suc
cess.
The Senate Finance Commit
tee rejected the crude oil tax
and the full Senate's moves
toward removing controls
from the price of natural gas
forced Carter last Saturday to
raise the threat of a veto.
He carries out most of his
Senate-related activities on the
telephone, but on occasion
fills his constitutional role of
presiding over the Senate.
