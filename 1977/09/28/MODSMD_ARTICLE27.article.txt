-3 named in Korean bribe case
Washington — A federal grand jury indicted
Hancho Kim, a cosmetics manufacturer, yesterday
in connection with alleged South Korean
influence-buying in Congress.
Kim was indicted on charges of conspiracy to
defraud the United States and making a false de
claration to the grand jury.
Each charge carries a maximum penalty on con
viction of five years in jail and a $10,000 fine.
A former director of the Korean Central Intelli
gence Agency (KCIA), Kim Hyung Wook, testified
before a congressional committee that he under
stood Kim took over influence-buying efforts in
Congress from Tongsun Park.
The grand jury has indicted Park on 36 counts
including bribery and trying as a foreign agent to
buy influence in Congress with cash, gifts and
favors. Park, a Washington-based rice dealer, now
is in Korea.
The indictment charged that Kim, of suburban
Lanham, Md., conspired with Kim Song Keun and
Wan Jang Doo, two former KCIA employes named
as unindicted coconspirators, "to defraud the Un
ited States and the Congress."
It said Kim got $600,000 from the KCIA to con
duct what was called "Operation White Snow" in
an effort to get more foreign aid from Congress
and create a favorable attitude there toward the
South Korean government.
Senate hears canal testimony
Washington — The nation's top military leaders
told the Senate yesterday that ratification of the
Panama Canal treaties will enhance U.S. security
while ensuring use of the canal into the distant
future.
Meanwhile, a Senate judiciary subcommittee
subpoenaed a recently discharged Army sergeant
as it opened an investigation into allegations that
the United States bugged the Panamanian delega
tion during the treaty negotiations.
Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.), the subcommittee
chairman and a vocal foe of the treaties, said the
inquiry "may shed light on whether the negotia
tions were conducted at arms length or were com
promised."
The alleged bugging already has been investi
gated by the Senate Intelligence Committee,
which concluded the alleged U.S. intelligence ac
tivities did not influence the outcome of the
negotiations.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and the two chief
U.S. negotiators said the same thing Monday
when asked about the allegations.
The former sergeant, Hor Brustmeyer of Brook

lyn, N.Y., was subpoenaed after there were pub
lished allegations that an Army sergeant had made
the alleged bugging transcript available to the
head of Panama's government.
Allen's subcommittee also issued subpoenas
calling for the CIA director, the FBI director, the
secretary of the army and other high-level officials
to produce records relating to the former
sergeant, who was honorably discharged from the
service Aug. 15.
Gas price compromise presented
Washington — Senators advocating deregula
tion of natural gas prices presented a compromise
proposal yesterday in an effort to break a stale
mate that is sending the Senate into possible
around-the-clock sessions.
Meanwhile, Sen. Russell Long (D-La.), whose
Finance Committee rejected President )immy Car
ter's tax on crude oil on Monday, stepped up ef
forts to find an oil-pricing compromise suitable to
the administration, the oil industry and consumer
groups.
Under the natural gas proposal, federal price
controls would be lifted from newly produced gas
but there would be a ceiling for two years to limit
price increases to consumers. The proposed lid
would be equal to the price of an equivalent
amount of home heating oil.
It was offered by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas)
and James Pearson (R-Kan.), who have been lead
ing the Senate battle for an industry-supported
plan to deregulate natural gas prices.
Bentsen called the move "a major concession."
But administration allies in the Senate vowed to
fight it.
Carter, who wants tocontinue federal pricecon
trols on gas, has indicated he would veto any legis
lation that lifts them. However, in several test
votes a majority of senators has gone on record
against the Carter pricing plan.
House rejects abortion proposal
Washington — The House rejected yesterday a
proposal to use federal funds for abortions in
cases of rape, incest or medical necessity, clearing
the way for a compromise with the Senate on abor
tion and passage of a $60.2 billion social legislation
bill.
By a vote of 252 to 164, House members rejected
a resolution that would have endorsed the abor
tion language already agreed to by the Senate.
The lopsided defeat was far short of the two
thirds majority needed for the House to adopt the
Senate's more liberal approach to abortion fund

ing.
The House position is that federal money should
be spent on abortions only when a woman's life is
jeopardized by a full-term pregnancy.
House and Senate conferees are now expected
to resume efforts to reach a compromise on the
volatile issue.
Senate conferees had demanded the vote by the
House and walked out of a conference after House
members refused to agree to one. The senators
maintained that their chamber had twice rejected
the House position on abortion.
U.S. secrecy report withheld
Boulder, Colo. — A study criticizing the govern
ment's tendency to suppress information will be
missing today when the Commission on Federal
Paperwork makes its final report. The document
itself has been suppressed, those who prepared it
claim.
What the commission will give Congress and
President Jimmy Carter is a longer study, substi
tuted in its place, that is far less critical of the
practices of federal agencies.
Copies of both studies were made available to
The Associated Press.
Even the difference in titles tells a story.
The original study is called "Report on Govern
ment Secrecy and its Relationship to Paperwork
and Information Policy."
The substituted version is entitled "Privacy and
Confidentiality: Issues in Information Gathering."
Congress pledges Olympic aid
Washington — The House Interstate Commerce
Committee unanimously approved a measure yes
terday pledging financial support to Los Angeles if
the city gets the bid to hold the 1984 Summer
Olympic Games.
The U.S. Olympic Committee last Sunday
selected Los Angeles as its choice for the summer
games. The International Olympic Committee will
make its choice next May.
No city outside the United States has shown an
interest in the 1984 games.
The bill, approved by the Interstate Commerce
Committee pledges "appropriate financial assis
tance" in principle. Any specific amount would
have to be approved by Congress later.
