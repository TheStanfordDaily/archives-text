# On S. Africa, foreign conduct
## Protesters support Del Monte resolutions 
### Thatcher Freund 
San Francisco — More than 100
singing, chanting demonstrators
marched outside the Fairmont Hotel
yesterday protesting Del Monte
Corp.'s investment policies, includ
ing Del Monte's presence in South
Africa.
The demonstrators constituted a
coalition of various Bay Area organi
zations including Campuses United
Against Apartheid (CUAA) and the
Southern Airican Solidarity Commit
tee.
(Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy was one
of the organizations which helped
found CUAA.)
The demonstrators, calling them
selves the Del Monte Coalition, were
advocating the adoption of three
stockholder resolutions being pre
sented at the corporation's annual
shareholder meeting, all of which
the stockholders defeated.
The first proxy requested that a re
port be published detailing Del
Monte's position in South Africa.
Historical information
Rozell Nesbitt, associate director
of the American Committee on Af
rica, spoke in favor of the resolution.
He emphasized that the proxy re
quested only for Del Monte to re
lease some historical and employe
information and to discuss Del
Monte relations with the South Afri
can government.
"The resolution we have submit
ted simply requests that the Del
Monte Corp. report to us some in

formation about its activities in South
Africa," Nesbitt said, "so as to make
it possible for us to examine from an
informed basis the Del Monte role "n
South Africa."
Management's opposition state
ment was given by R.C. Landis, Del
Monte's president and chief execu
tive officer.
"We are opposed to racism,"
Landis said. "We have voiced that
opposition and this is all we should
be expected to do."
Employes are people
Landis explained that investments
have enhanced living standards in
South Africa. And "where discrimi
nation laws do exist," he continued
later, "they are ignored.
"We consider our employes
peopie," he said.
The results of the stockholders'
balloting showed 258,108 votes for
the resolution and 8,927,735 against
— a victory margin of 97.2 per cent
for management.
A second resolution requested "a
full written report concerning any
political contributions, bribes, or
other questionable payments made
by or on behalf of the Corporation."
Consulting fees
JoAnne Kagiwada, chairperson of
the Corporate Responsibility Com
mittee cited payments for "consult
ing fees" to an individual in
Guatemala as an example of ques
tionable payments.
Some $825,000 was paid for con
sulting services rendered, she said.


More than 100 demonstrators protested outside a Del Monte Corp. stockholders
meeting in San Francisco yesterday. The protesters favored three resolutions
regarding the overseas conduct and policy of Del Monte. All three resolutions
were overwhelmingly defeated.
In addition, "$450,000 was given as
prepayment for future services to be
rendered in fiscal years 1977, 1978
and 1979."
About $250,000 was paid to this
person in other business dealings,
she said, with total payments being
in excess of $1.5 million.
Kagiwada quoted the corpora
tion's Review Committee as having
said that "the terms of these ar
rangements were not unreasonable
from the company's point of view."

peopie," he said.
The results of the stockholders'
balloting showed 258,108 votes for
the resolution and 8,927,735 against
— a victory margin of 97.2 per cent
for management.
A second resolution requested "a
full written report concerning any
political contributions, bribes, or
other questionable payments made
by or on behalf of the Corporation."
Consulting fees
JoAnne Kagiwada, chairperson of
the Corporate Responsibility Com
mittee cited payments for "consult
ing fees" to an individual in
Guatemala as an example of ques
tionable payments.
Some $825,000 was paid for con
sulting services rendered, she said.


More than 100 demonstrators protested outside a Del Monte Corp. stockholders
meeting in San Francisco yesterday. The protesters favored three resolutions
regarding the overseas conduct and policy of Del Monte. All three resolutions
were overwhelmingly defeated.
In addition, "$450,000 was given as
prepayment for future services to be
rendered in fiscal years 1977, 1978
and 1979."
About $250,000 was paid to this
person in other business dealings,
she said, with total payments being
in excess of $1.5 million.
Kagiwada quoted the corpora
tion's Review Committee as having
said that "the terms of these ar
rangements were not unreasonable
from the company's point of view."
San Francisco — More than 100
singing, chanting demonstrators
marched outside the Fairmont Hotel
yesterday protesting Del Monte
Corp.'s investment policies, includ
ing Del Monte's presence in South
Africa.
The demonstrators constituted a
coalition of various Bay Area organi
zations including Campuses United
Against Apartheid (CUAA) and the
Southern Airican Solidarity Commit
tee.
(Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy was one
of the organizations which helped
found CUAA.)
The demonstrators, calling them
selves the Del Monte Coalition, were
advocating the adoption of three
stockholder resolutions being pre
sented at the corporation's annual
shareholder meeting, all of which
the stockholders defeated.
The first proxy requested that a re
port be published detailing Del
Monte's position in South Africa.
Historical information
Rozell Nesbitt, associate director
of the American Committee on Af
rica, spoke in favor of the resolution.
He emphasized that the proxy re
quested only for Del Monte to re
lease some historical and employe
information and to discuss Del
Monte relations with the South Afri
can government.
"The resolution we have submit
ted simply requests that the Del
Monte Corp. report to us some in

formation about its activities in South
Africa," Nesbitt said, "so as to make
it possible for us to examine from an
informed basis the Del Monte role "n
South Africa."
Management's opposition state
ment was given by R.C. Landis, Del
Monte's president and chief execu
tive officer.
"We are opposed to racism,"
Landis said. "We have voiced that
opposition and this is all we should
be expected to do."
Employes are people
Landis explained that investments
have enhanced living standards in
South Africa. And "where discrimi
nation laws do exist," he continued
later, "they are ignored.
"We consider our employes
peopie," he said.
