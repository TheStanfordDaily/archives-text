# CIA agent denies role in mind control work
## 
### Randy Keith 
Dr. Wallace Chan, suspected of
being a CIA liaison agent here during
the 19505, admitted yesterday that he
has worked for the CIA but denied
that he was working for the agency at
the time top secret MK-ULTRA mind
and behavior control experiments
were conducted here.
In two conflicting statements, the
former assistant clinical professor
first told the San Francisco Chronicle
that he had indeed worked for the
CIA from 1956 to 1959, the same years
that several of the MK-ULTRA sub
projects were conducted here.
Chan then contradicted himself
yesterday when he told the Stanford
University News Service that he had
not been working for the agency du r
ing those years.
According to Dr. David Prince,
currently the chairman of the De
partment of Neurology, Chan was
employed in the department from
1957 to 1961.
Chan went on to say that while he
was here he worked with Dr. Henry
Newman on alcohol metabolism
studies and with Pharmacology Pro
fessor Dr. William Cutting on drug
studies. Both Newman and Cutting
are dead.
Speeding the metabolism
The Daily reported yesterday that
CIA documents released to the Uni
versity show that Newman was know
ingly engaged in research labeled
"subproject 56" which was designed
to find ways to speed up the
metabolism of alcohol.
The documents also reveal that
Newman had signed forms acknow
ledging that he was working for the
CIA and that he knew that the Ges
chickter Fund, which sponsored the
research, was a CIA cover organiza
tion.
Chan was then asked if he and Cut
ting were studying the
"neurophysiological and phar
macological effects of central nerv
ous system antagonists and syner
gists." Chan replied in the affirma
tive.
These words are identical to those
appearing on a May 1, 1957 internal
CIA "memorandum for the record,
subject MK-ULTRA subproject 72"

which was conducted here from 1957
to 1958.
The $41,382 subproject dealt with
an attempt by Cutting to determine
the effects of unknown drugs on the
central nervous system as compared
to the known effects of standard
drugs which affect central nervous
system activity.
'Aware of purposes'
Cutting apparently knew that he
was working for the CIA. CIA docu
ments state that he was "cleared
through top secret and is aware of
the true purposes of the program."
In the same May 1 memo, Sidney
Gottlieb, the ClA's director of tech
nical services, said although the
work was being conducted in the
pharmacology division, a faculty
member from the Department of
Medicine "will be able to monitor,
direct and actively participate in this

project" from the standpoint of
agency interests.
On that same day, May 1, 1957,
Gottlieb wrote another file memo
concerning a separate subproject,
subproject 71. In that subproject an
unidentified Stanford assistant clini
cal professor of medicine was di
rectly paid $28,800 from September
1957 to June 1961, mostly in the form
of cashier's checks for $800 per
month.
'No checks'
Although the time period corres
ponds with Chan's employment here
as an assistant clinical professor of
medicine in the neurology depart
ment, he vigorously denies having
either requested or received such
funds.
"I never got $800 checks," Chan
declared.
Gottlieb's memo on the direct
payments said subproject 71s pur
pose was to enable the agency to
"continue the utilization of (name
deleted), presently at the Depart
ment of Medicine, Neurology Divi
sion, Stanford."
This unnamed individual was to
"monitor, direct and/or actively par
ticipate in the research within sub
projects No. 56 and No. 72," accord
ing to Gottlieb's memo.
Subproject 56 was Newman's
study on alcohol metabolism and
subproject 72 was Cutting's drug
study. Chan has admitted that he had
worked with both Newman and Cut
ting on their experiments.
Gottlieb's memo on subproject 72
also said that the person working on
it would "plan, monitor and direct
research and development of a
miniaturized polygraph."
In addition, the subproject was de
signed to clinically test and evaluate
"various anti-interrogation prepara
tions in order to select one that will
fulfill the existing operational re
quirements in the area of anti
interrogation."
Chan flatly denied having done
anti-interrogation or polygraph
work.
Also included in the CIA docu
ments on the subproject was a stan
dard "memorandum of agreement,"
signed by the recipient on July 1,
1957. In it the recipient says"I sol
emnly pledge my word that I will
never divulge, publish, nor reveal
either by word, conduct, or by any
other means . . information about
the subproject.

A number of current and former
medical school professors contacted
by the Daily last night said Chan had
been a medical student here during
the 1940s but that when he was
employed by the University in the
1950s his activities were "strange."
According to Dr. Robert Alway, the
dean of the medical school for part of
the period during which Chan was
working here, Chan may have also
established other projects off cam
pus.
"He was running some sort of in
stitute up the peninsula that had a
number of people either very in
tensely interested or very wary," ac
cording to Alway.
"It seemed to me that it was a fairly
off-beat operation and we were all
curious as to what the hell was going
on. We all had the feeling that what
ever he was running was a cover for
something," Alway said.

to the known effects of standard
drugs which affect central nervous
system activity.
'Aware of purposes'
Cutting apparently knew that he
was working for the CIA. CIA docu
ments state that he was "cleared
through top secret and is aware of
the true purposes of the program."
In the same May 1 memo, Sidney
Gottlieb, the ClA's director of tech
nical services, said although the
work was being conducted in the
pharmacology division, a faculty
member from the Department of
Medicine "will be able to monitor,
direct and actively participate in this

project" from the standpoint of
agency interests.
On that same day, May 1, 1957,
Gottlieb wrote another file memo
concerning a separate subproject,
subproject 71. In that subproject an
unidentified Stanford assistant clini
cal professor of medicine was di
rectly paid $28,800 from September
1957 to June 1961, mostly in the form
of cashier's checks for $800 per
month.
'No checks'
Although the time period corres
ponds with Chan's employment here
as an assistant clinical professor of
medicine in the neurology depart
ment, he vigorously denies having
either requested or received such
funds.
"I never got $800 checks," Chan
declared.
Gottlieb's memo on the direct
payments said subproject 71s pur
pose was to enable the agency to
"continue the utilization of (name
deleted), presently at the Depart
ment of Medicine, Neurology Divi
sion, Stanford."
This unnamed individual was to
"monitor, direct and/or actively par
ticipate in the research within sub
projects No. 56 and No. 72," accord
ing to Gottlieb's memo.
Subproject 56 was Newman's
study on alcohol metabolism and
subproject 72 was Cutting's drug
study. Chan has admitted that he had
worked with both Newman and Cut
ting on their experiments.
Gottlieb's memo on subproject 72
also said that the person working on
it would "plan, monitor and direct
research and development of a
miniaturized polygraph."
In addition, the subproject was de
signed to clinically test and evaluate
"various anti-interrogation prepara
tions in order to select one that will
fulfill the existing operational re
quirements in the area of anti
interrogation."
Chan flatly denied having done
anti-interrogation or polygraph
work.
Also included in the CIA docu
ments on the subproject was a stan
dard "memorandum of agreement,"
signed by the recipient on July 1,
1957. In it the recipient says"I sol
emnly pledge my word that I will
never divulge, publish, nor reveal
either by word, conduct, or by any
other means . . information about
the subproject.

A number of current and former
medical school professors contacted
by the Daily last night said Chan had
been a medical student here during
the 1940s but that when he was
employed by the University in the
1950s his activities were "strange."
According to Dr. Robert Alway, the
dean of the medical school for part of
the period during which Chan was
working here, Chan may have also
established other projects off cam
pus.
"He was running some sort of in
stitute up the peninsula that had a
number of people either very in
tensely interested or very wary," ac
cording to Alway.
"It seemed to me that it was a fairly
off-beat operation and we were all
curious as to what the hell was going
on. We all had the feeling that what
ever he was running was a cover for
something," Alway said.
Dr. Wallace Chan, suspected of
being a CIA liaison agent here during
the 19505, admitted yesterday that he
has worked for the CIA but denied
that he was working for the agency at
the time top secret MK-ULTRA mind
and behavior control experiments
were conducted here.
In two conflicting statements, the
former assistant clinical professor
first told the San Francisco Chronicle
that he had indeed worked for the
CIA from 1956 to 1959, the same years
that several of the MK-ULTRA sub
projects were conducted here.
Chan then contradicted himself
yesterday when he told the Stanford
University News Service that he had
not been working for the agency du r
ing those years.
According to Dr. David Prince,
currently the chairman of the De
partment of Neurology, Chan was
employed in the department from
1957 to 1961.
Chan went on to say that while he
was here he worked with Dr. Henry
Newman on alcohol metabolism
studies and with Pharmacology Pro
fessor Dr. William Cutting on drug
studies. Both Newman and Cutting
are dead.
Speeding the metabolism
The Daily reported yesterday that
CIA documents released to the Uni

"subproject 56" which was designed
to find ways to speed up the
metabolism of alcohol.
The documents also reveal that
Newman had signed forms acknow
ledging that he was working for the
CIA and that he knew that the Ges
chickter Fund, which sponsored the
research, was a CIA cover organiza
tion.
Chan was then asked if he and Cut
ting were studying the
"neurophysiological and phar
macological effects of central nerv
ous system antagonists and syner
gists." Chan replied in the affirma

These words are identical to those
appearing on a May 1, 1957 internal
CIA "memorandum for the record,
subject MK-ULTRA subproject 72"

which was conducted here from 1957

"various anti-interrogation prepara
tions in order to select one that will
fulfill the existing operational re
quirements in the area of anti
interrogation."
Chan flatly denied having done
anti-interrogation or polygraph
work.
Also included in the CIA docu
ments on the subproject was a stan
dard "memorandum of agreement,"
signed by the recipient on July 1,
1957. In it the recipient says"I sol
emnly pledge my word that I will
never divulge, publish, nor reveal
either by word, conduct, or by any
other means . . information about
the subproject.

A number of current and former
medical school professors contacted
by the Daily last night said Chan had
been a medical student here during
the 1940s but that when he was
employed by the University in the
1950s his activities were "strange."
According to Dr. Robert Alway, the
dean of the medical school for part of
the period during which Chan was
working here, Chan may have also
established other projects off cam
pus.
"He was running some sort of in
stitute up the peninsula that had a
number of people either very in
tensely interested or very wary," ac
cording to Alway.
"It seemed to me that it was a fairly
off-beat operation and we were all
curious as to what the hell was going
on. We all had the feeling that what
ever he was running was a cover for
something," Alway said.
Dr. Wallace Chan, suspected of
being a CIA liaison agent here during
the 19505, admitted yesterday that he
has worked for the CIA but denied
that he was working for the agency at
the time top secret MK-ULTRA mind
and behavior control experiments
were conducted here.
In two conflicting statements, the
former assistant clinical professor
first told the San Francisco Chronicle
that he had indeed worked for the
CIA from 1956 to 1959, the same years
that several of the MK-ULTRA sub
projects were conducted here.
Chan then contradicted himself
yesterday when he told the Stanford
University News Service that he had
not been working for the agency du r
ing those years.
According to Dr. David Prince,
currently the chairman of the De
partment of Neurology, Chan was
employed in the department from
1957 to 1961.
Chan went on to say that while he
was here he worked with Dr. Henry
Newman on alcohol metabolism
studies and with Pharmacology Pro
fessor Dr. William Cutting on drug
studies. Both Newman and Cutting
are dead.
Speeding the metabolism
The Daily reported yesterday that
CIA documents released to the Uni
versity show that Newman was know
ingly engaged in research labeled
"subproject 56" which was designed
to find ways to speed up the
metabolism of alcohol.
The documents also reveal that
Newman had signed forms acknow
ledging that he was working for the
CIA and that he knew that the Ges
chickter Fund, which sponsored the
research, was a CIA cover organiza
tion.
Chan was then asked if he and Cut
ting were studying the
"neurophysiological and phar
macological effects of central nerv
ous system antagonists and syner
gists." Chan replied in the affirma
tive.
These words are identical to those
appearing on a May 1, 1957 internal
CIA "memorandum for the record,
subject MK-ULTRA subproject 72"

which was conducted here from 1957
to 1958.
The $41,382 subproject dealt with
an attempt by Cutting to determine
the effects of unknown drugs on the
central nervous system as compared
to the known effects of standard
drugs which affect central nervous
system activity.
'Aware of purposes'
Cutting apparently knew that he
was working for the CIA. CIA docu
ments state that he was "cleared
through top secret and is aware of
the true purposes of the program."
In the same May 1 memo, Sidney
Gottlieb, the ClA's director of tech
nical services, said although the
work was being conducted in the
pharmacology division, a faculty
member from the Department of
Medicine "will be able to monitor,
direct and actively participate in this

project" from the standpoint of
agency interests.
On that same day, May 1, 1957,
Gottlieb wrote another file memo
concerning a separate subproject,
subproject 71. In that subproject an
unidentified Stanford assistant clini
cal professor of medicine was di
rectly paid $28,800 from September
1957 to June 1961, mostly in the form
of cashier's checks for $800 per
month.
'No checks'
Although the time period corres
ponds with Chan's employment here
as an assistant clinical professor of
medicine in the neurology depart
ment, he vigorously denies having
either requested or received such
funds.
"I never got $800 checks," Chan
declared.
Gottlieb's memo on the direct
payments said subproject 71s pur
pose was to enable the agency to
"continue the utilization of (name
deleted), presently at the Depart
ment of Medicine, Neurology Divi
sion, Stanford."
This unnamed individual was to
"monitor, direct and/or actively par
ticipate in the research within sub
projects No. 56 and No. 72," accord
ing to Gottlieb's memo.
Subproject 56 was Newman's
study on alcohol metabolism and
subproject 72 was Cutting's drug
study. Chan has admitted that he had
worked with both Newman and Cut
ting on their experiments.
Gottlieb's memo on subproject 72
also said that the person working on
it would "plan, monitor and direct
research and development of a
miniaturized polygraph."
In addition, the subproject was de
signed to clinically test and evaluate
"various anti-interrogation prepara
tions in order to select one that will
fulfill the existing operational re
quirements in the area of anti
interrogation."
Chan flatly denied having done
anti-interrogation or polygraph
work.
