# CIA agent denies role in mind control work
## 
### Randy Keith 
Dr. Wallace Chan, suspected of
being a CIA liaison agent here during
the 19505, admitted yesterday that he
has worked for the CIA but denied
that he was working for the agency at
the time top secret MK-ULTRA mind
and behavior control experiments
were conducted here.
In two conflicting statements, the
former assistant clinical professor
first told the San Francisco Chronicle
that he had indeed worked for the
CIA from 1956 to 1959, the same years
that several of the MK-ULTRA sub
projects were conducted here.
Chan then contradicted himself
yesterday when he told the Stanford
University News Service that he had
not been working for the agency du r
ing those years.
According to Dr. David Prince,
currently the chairman of the De
partment of Neurology, Chan was
employed in the department from
1957 to 1961.
Chan went on to say that while he
was here he worked with Dr. Henry
Newman on alcohol metabolism
studies and with Pharmacology Pro
fessor Dr. William Cutting on drug
studies. Both Newman and Cutting
are dead.
Speeding the metabolism
The Daily reported yesterday that
CIA documents released to the Uni
versity show that Newman was know
ingly engaged in research labeled
"subproject 56" which was designed
to find ways to speed up the
metabolism of alcohol.
The documents also reveal that
Newman had signed forms acknow
ledging that he was working for the
CIA and that he knew that the Ges
chickter Fund, which sponsored the
research, was a CIA cover organiza
tion.
Chan was then asked if he and Cut
ting were studying the
"neurophysiological and phar
macological effects of central nerv
ous system antagonists and syner
gists." Chan replied in the affirma
tive.
These words are identical to those
appearing on a May 1, 1957 internal
CIA "memorandum for the record,
subject MK-ULTRA subproject 72"

which was conducted here from 1957
to 1958.
The $41,382 subproject dealt with
an attempt by Cutting to determine
the effects of unknown drugs on the
central nervous system as compared
to the known effects of standard
drugs which affect central nervous
system activity.
'Aware of purposes'
Cutting apparently knew that he
was working for the CIA. CIA docu
ments state that he was "cleared
through top secret and is aware of
the true purposes of the program."
In the same May 1 memo, Sidney
Gottlieb, the ClA's director of tech
nical services, said although the
work was being conducted in the
pharmacology division, a faculty
member from the Department of
Medicine "will be able to monitor,
direct and actively participate in this

project" from the standpoint of
agency interests.
On that same day, May 1, 1957,
Gottlieb wrote another file memo
concerning a separate subproject,
subproject 71. In that subproject an
unidentified Stanford assistant clini
cal professor of medicine was di
rectly paid $28,800 from September
1957 to June 1961, mostly in the form
of cashier's checks for $800 per
month.
'No checks'
Although the time period corres
ponds with Chan's employment here
as an assistant clinical professor of
medicine in the neurology depart
ment, he vigorously denies having
either requested or received such
funds.
"I never got $800 checks," Chan
declared.
