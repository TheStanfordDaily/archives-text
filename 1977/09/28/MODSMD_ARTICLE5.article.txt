## 
### 
Confidential Overseas Studies
files, found by the Daily two weeks
ago in a desk sold and delivered to
the Daily offices by the University,
were delivered to the University yes
terday following a request from Pres
ident Richard Lyman.
The 18 files, which contained in
formation relating to such topics as
student drug use and faculty salaries,
related to overseas campuses in Eng
land, Italy, France and Austria, and
spanned a time-period from 1962 to
1972.
Also contained were a number of
student medical and psychological
reports.
In a letter yesterday to Daily Editor
Jacob Young, Lyman said the files,
which the Daily earlier reported find
ing, contained information of a "sen
sitive nature" and that the University
was "taking steps to prevent further
such lapses" as the one which placed
the files in the Daily's possession.
After consultation with Daily at
torneys, Young decided to comply

with Lyman's request.
The files were received by Corbin
Smith, assistant director of Overseas
Studies, who signed a receipt for
them.
Young said he felt the action was
the best way to protect the privacy of
the individuals named in the files.
"We never had any intention of
making public any information or de
tails from the files. What we wanted
to get across was that the files were
insecurely maintained and informa
tion in them could have been used to
do serious damage to persons con
nected with Overseas Studies in the
past.
"I'm sure the University will at
tempt to correct whatever problems
caused this particular slip-up, but I
hope some of the information in the
files is destroyed before the files are
locked up," Young said.
As of yesterday, no official expla
nation of how the foul-up occurred
had been released by Overseas
Studies.
