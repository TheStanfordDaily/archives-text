# Soviets offer to suspend underground nuclear tests

### 
United Nations, N.Y. (AP) â€” The
Soviet Union, in a surprise move, of
fered yesterday to join with the Un
ited States and Britain in a suspen
sion of all underground nuclear
weapons tests for an unspecified
period.
"The prohibition of all nuclear
weapon tests would be a major step

conducive to lessening the threat of
nuclear war and deepening de
tente," Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Cromyko told the U.N.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance,
who is also in New York, withheld
comment on Gromyko's test ban
proposals. His spokesman said
Vance was occupied with a series of
meetings with other foreign minis
ters and had not read a text of
Gromyko's speech.
Negotiations on a comprehensive
test ban agreement, including explo
sions for such peaceful purposes as
river diversions, are scheduled for
Geneva next week.
Meanwhile, Gromyko was making
an unexpected return visit to the
White House last night to resume
private arms limitation talks with
President Carter.
Gromyko held two days of talks
with top administration officials last

week, including a White House ses
sion with President Jimmy Carter.
Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell,
said yesterday the president told
Croymko at their meeting last Friday
that "he would be willing to continue
the discussions if the Soviets thought
that would be worthwhile."
U.S. officials were not notified in
advance of the Soviet gesture on un
derground nuclear tests. To them it
appeared to represent serious intent
to complete a weapons test ban.
Even while taking this conciliatory
approach, Cromyko sharply
criticized the Carter administration
on several fronts.
He suggested with evident sar
casm that "those who clamor for
'human rights' could best apply their
efforts" in southern Africa.
"But for some reason or other,"
Cromyko said, "they shut their eyes
to the intolerable plight of millions of
people."
