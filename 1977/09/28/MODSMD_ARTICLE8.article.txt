## Ombudsman 
### 
One of the largest problems people en
counter when dealing with newspapers is lack
of communication. They have complaints
about coverage (or lack thereof), some ques
tion about a bias they detect in a news article
or just a question about how something came
to end up on the front page.
Largely, it's because most persons don't
understand how a newspaper works.
Many editors can't understand complaints
from the public. It seems all people do is
complain sometimes. This problem results
mostly from knowing all too well when the
paper does, or doesn't, run smoothly, a tun
nel vision of sorts.
In the interest of aiding communication be
tween the Daily and the Stanford community,
I'm adding the position of ombudsman to the
staff of the Daily. Jack Vaughn, who has three
years of experience here as a news, opinions
and copy editor, and as managing editor last
year, will fill the slot.
Vaughn, presently the Stanford correspon

dent with the New York Times, will have full
license to investigate and report on any inter
nal editorial policy of the Daily. His findings
will either be relayed in personal correspon
dence with persons making inquiry about the
Daily, or in a column which will appear at
various times on the opinions page.
His findings will be his own, based on his
journalistic experience and judgment. They
will not reflect my feelings about the news
paper in general, nor will departmental
editors or reporters be allowed to edit any
comments he might make.
As ombudsman, Vaughn will keep regular
office hours from 5t06p.m., Monday through
Friday here at the Daily office in the Storke
Building.
I strongly urge members of the community
who have questions about the Daily editorial
policy or coverage to contact him.
