At NORTH FACE,TOO, we are offering limited quantities of seconds, irregulars
and discontinued products at 20-35% off regular retail price. A "second" has minor
defects which do not impair its function. "Irregulars" contain only slight imperfec
tions. Discontinued products are often labeled as such because of fabric or color
changes.
Come in for great savings on NORTH FACE packs, tents, sleeping bags, parkas,
vests and hiking boots.
