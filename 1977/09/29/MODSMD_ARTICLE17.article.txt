## Thelonious in retrospect 
### 
Theionious Sphere Monk —
it is difficult to say which is
more unusual, his name or the
unique style he brought to jazz
during the 40s and 50s. The lat
ter is showcased in recently re
leased retrospective by Blue
Note records, entitled
"Theionious Monk: The Com
plete Genius."
The double album contains
the historic sides, long unav
ailable, which Monk recorded
for Blue Note between 1947-
1952. The appearance of these
sides consolidates Monk's pos
ition as the most modern musi
cian of the post-swing period
and, I hope, will clear up mis

conceptions about this seminal
pianist.
Monk's eccentricities have
long clouded his music. His
unusual style of dress, his ten
dency to dance while his fellow
musicians solo, his disdain for
interviewers, reporters and
fans, have combined to take
the spotlight away from his
significance as a musician.
It is more accurate to con
sider Monk as a composer. He
is one of the few jazz artists
whose ability as a composer
outweighs his musical abilities.
" 'Round Midnight," "Straight
No Chaser," "Well You
Needn't," "Epistrophy,"
"Ruby My Dear" are among the
most lasting compositions in
jazz (all of which are included
on the Blue Note Release).
Monk's style as a pianist and
composer is percussive, often
discordant and abounds with
odd twists and strange humor.
Unlike the other major figures
of the late '40s and early '50s,
Monk never gained a coterie of
imitators simply because his
style was inimitable. Any at
tempt to play "like Monk" was
destined to sound like a
parody.
No Be-bop
The Blue Note release helps
to establish Monk's proper
place in jazz history. For too
long, Monk has been consi
dered as one of the founding
fathers of the be-bop genera
tion. More recently, it has be
come clear that Monk's influ
ence on the boppers was min
imal; his influence is more
long range, affecting the
avant-garde of the '50s and '60s.
McCoy Tyner, Dollar Brand or
Cecil Taylor bear Monk's mark.
Indeed, Monk's perfor
mances on the two-record set
seem modern in comparison
with other albums recorded
during that period. Pieces such
as "Thelonious" and "Ruby,
My Dear" have aged little in 25
years.
Moreover, these sides
showcase Monk's often
maligned abilities as a pianist.
The music is more fluid, more
orchestral than his later work.
Monk's supporting musi
cians are generally sympathe
tic. Max Roach and Art Blakey
among the premiere drum
mers of any era, while Milt
lackson, Kenny Dorham and
Lucky Thompson make sig
nificant contributions,
lackson's playing, particularly
on "Willow Weep for Me," and
"Mysterioso" is straightfor
ward and swings hard.
The Blue Note reissue series
should be commended. Since
United Artists bought the Blue
Note library several years ago
(among the artists included are
Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rol
lins, McCoy Tyner, Donald
Byrd, Horace Silver, Freddie
Hubbard, Ornette Coleman),
the program of reissues has
been sporadic but of high qual
ity.

If the present Blue Note rere
leases make a reasonable pro
tit, more jazz reissues may be
on their way. Much Blue Note
material, by artists such as Bud
Powell and Ornette Coleman,
remain out of print and largely
unavailable. Indeed, the re
cent McCoy Tyner release
seems to indicate that there is
much material in the Blue Note
tiles that has never been re
leased.
Thelonious Monk, The
Complete Genius" will rekin
dle interest in that much neg
lected giant of jazz when his
tailing health has forced him
out of the spotlight. His con
tributions are too important to
be ignored by the new genera
tion of jazz fans.

Theionious Sphere Monk —
it is difficult to say which is
more unusual, his name or the
unique style he brought to jazz
during the 40s and 50s. The lat
ter is showcased in recently re
leased retrospective by Blue
Note records, entitled
"Theionious Monk: The Com
plete Genius."
The double album contains
the historic sides, long unav
ailable, which Monk recorded
for Blue Note between 1947-
1952. The appearance of these
sides consolidates Monk's pos
ition as the most modern musi
cian of the post-swing period
and, I hope, will clear up mis

conceptions about this seminal
pianist.
Monk's eccentricities have
long clouded his music. His
unusual style of dress, his ten
dency to dance while his fellow
musicians solo, his disdain for
interviewers, reporters and
fans, have combined to take
the spotlight away from his
significance as a musician.
It is more accurate to con
sider Monk as a composer. He
is one of the few jazz artists
whose ability as a composer
outweighs his musical abilities.
" 'Round Midnight," "Straight
No Chaser," "Well You
Needn't," "Epistrophy,"
"Ruby My Dear" are among the
most lasting compositions in
jazz (all of which are included
on the Blue Note Release).
Monk's style as a pianist and
composer is percussive, often
discordant and abounds with
odd twists and strange humor.
Unlike the other major figures
of the late '40s and early '50s,
Monk never gained a coterie of
imitators simply because his
style was inimitable. Any at
tempt to play "like Monk" was
destined to sound like a
parody.
No Be-bop
The Blue Note release helps
to establish Monk's proper
place in jazz history. For too
long, Monk has been consi
dered as one of the founding
fathers of the be-bop genera
tion. More recently, it has be
come clear that Monk's influ
ence on the boppers was min
imal; his influence is more
long range, affecting the
avant-garde of the '50s and '60s.
McCoy Tyner, Dollar Brand or
Cecil Taylor bear Monk's mark.
Indeed, Monk's perfor
mances on the two-record set
seem modern in comparison
with other albums recorded
during that period. Pieces such
as "Thelonious" and "Ruby,
My Dear" have aged little in 25
years.
Moreover, these sides
showcase Monk's often
maligned abilities as a pianist.
The music is more fluid, more
orchestral than his later work.
Monk's supporting musi
cians are generally sympathe
tic. Max Roach and Art Blakey
among the premiere drum
mers of any era, while Milt
lackson, Kenny Dorham and
Lucky Thompson make sig
nificant contributions,
lackson's playing, particularly
on "Willow Weep for Me," and
"Mysterioso" is straightfor
ward and swings hard.
The Blue Note reissue series
should be commended. Since
United Artists bought the Blue
Note library several years ago
(among the artists included are
Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rol
lins, McCoy Tyner, Donald
Byrd, Horace Silver, Freddie
Hubbard, Ornette Coleman),
the program of reissues has
been sporadic but of high qual
ity.

If the present Blue Note rere
leases make a reasonable pro

on their way. Much Blue Note
material, by artists such as Bud
Powell and Ornette Coleman,
remain out of print and largely
unavailable. Indeed, the re
cent McCoy Tyner release
seems to indicate that there is
much material in the Blue Note
tiles that has never been re
leased.
Thelonious Monk, The
Complete Genius" will rekin
dle interest in that much neg
lected giant of jazz when his
tailing health has forced him
out of the spotlight. His con
tributions are too important to
be ignored by the new genera
