## Thelonious in retrospect 
### 
Theionious Sphere Monk â€”
it is difficult to say which is
more unusual, his name or the
unique style he brought to jazz
during the 40s and 50s. The lat
ter is showcased in recently re
leased retrospective by Blue
Note records, entitled
"Theionious Monk: The Com
plete Genius."
The double album contains
the historic sides, long unav
ailable, which Monk recorded
for Blue Note between 1947-
1952. The appearance of these
sides consolidates Monk's pos
ition as the most modern musi
cian of the post-swing period
and, I hope, will clear up mis

conceptions about this seminal
pianist.
Monk's eccentricities have
long clouded his music. His
unusual style of dress, his ten
dency to dance while his fellow
musicians solo, his disdain for
interviewers, reporters and
fans, have combined to take
the spotlight away from his
significance as a musician.
It is more accurate to con
sider Monk as a composer. He
is one of the few jazz artists
whose ability as a composer
outweighs his musical abilities.
" 'Round Midnight," "Straight
No Chaser," "Well You
Needn't," "Epistrophy,"
"Ruby My Dear" are among the
most lasting compositions in
jazz (all of which are included
on the Blue Note Release).
Monk's style as a pianist and
composer is percussive, often
discordant and abounds with
odd twists and strange humor.
Unlike the other major figures
of the late '40s and early '50s,
Monk never gained a coterie of
imitators simply because his
style was inimitable. Any at
tempt to play "like Monk" was
destined to sound like a
parody.
No Be-bop
The Blue Note release helps
to establish Monk's proper
place in jazz history. For too
long, Monk has been consi
dered as one of the founding
fathers of the be-bop genera
tion. More recently, it has be
come clear that Monk's influ
ence on the boppers was min
imal; his influence is more
long range, affecting the
