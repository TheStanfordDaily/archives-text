Senate ponders gas bill
Washington —The Senate adjourned
last night without voting on natural gas
legislation after a 37-hour session that
resulted in a compromise that could
break a nine-day Senate impasse.
The Senate planned to begin work
this morning on a compromise offered
by Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) and Sen. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.), chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee.
At issue is a critical portion of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's energy plan allow
ing for higher natural gas prices at the
wellhead, but providing for continued
federal controls.
Jackson reportedly won over a hand
ful of senators whose votes could make
a difference.

While retaining federal controls on
natural gas, the Jackson compromise
would allow producers to charge more
for gas than called for under President
Carter's energy plan. Under the key
proposal made yesterday, it also would
permit greater quantities of gas to qual
ify for the same higher prices.
With the exception of a two-hour
breakfast break, the Senate had been in
session since 9 a.m. Tuesday.
Late Tuesday, Carter administration
officials said they would agree to a
compromise natural gas price ceiling of
$2.03 per thousand cubic feet, a 28 cent
increase over $1.75, the original price in
the energy plan.
The price is currently fixed at $1.46.
Ford may nix big cars
New York — The Ford Motor Co., to

meet federal fuel efficiency laws, may
have to discourage sales of large cars
through pricing policies and delay ac
cepting orders for the bigger vehicles,
Ford's president said yesterday.
Lee lacocca, president of the nation's
second-largest auto firm, said Ford
would have to watch its sales of 1978-
model cars daily to insure that the firm
will be in compliance with federal law.
In addition, lacocca hinted that Ford
soon may begin using foreign steel, a
severe blow to the already hard-hit U.S.
steel industry.
He said Ford, which imports virtually
no steel, soon might "look long and
hard" at foreign steel, which he said
sells for about $50 a ton less. Lower
foreign steel prices are one reason im
ported cars are so attractive to U.S.
consumers, he said.
The federal mileage law requires auto
manufacturers to meet a minimum fuel
economy standard of 18 miles per gal
lon on all 1978-model cars produced in
the U.S.
Each company's total fleet is aver
aged to determine whether it reaches
the standard. If not, there are fines of $5
for each one-tenth of a mile under 18
mpg, multiplied by the number of cars
produced. The federal standard in
creases to 27.5 mpg by 1985.
Abortion issue delays bill
Washington — Pressure mounted
yesterday for quick House-Senate ag
reement on an abortion policy before
money runs out for government social
security agencies whose funds depend
on the outcome.
House and Senate conferees planned

to try to write a compromise some
where between strict limits on federally
funded abortions, which have been
adopted by the House, and more liberal
ones endorsed by the Senate.
At stake is a $60.2 billion appropria
tions bill for the Department of Labor
and the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare for fiscal year 1978.
Current funding for those agencies
runs out tomorrow, the end of fiscal
year 1977.
A meeting among the conferees,
originally scheduled for yesterday
evening, was postponed until today.
Before the postponement was an
nounced, House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill expressed confidence that the
conferees would reach an agreement.
The current House position is that
the government should pay for abor
tions through the Medicaid program
for the poor only when a woman's life
would be jeopardized by a full-term
pregnancy.
Medicaid paid for about 300,000
abortions last year at a cost of $50 mill
ion.
The abortion issue is the last remain
ing obstacle to passage of the Labor-
HEW bill. The conferees have been
working on the bill since July.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy through today with
chance of sprinkles or few light show
ers. Clearing tonight then fair tomor
row. A little warmer tomorrow. Lows
tonight in the 50s to low 60s. Highs in
the upper 60s and 70s. Southwest wind
10 to 20 mph shifting to northwest to
night. Chance of measurable rain 30 per
cent today.

Senate ponders gas bill
Washington —The Senate adjourned
last night without voting on natural gas
legislation after a 37-hour session that
resulted in a compromise that could
break a nine-day Senate impasse.
The Senate planned to begin work
this morning on a compromise offered
by Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) and Sen. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.), chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee.
At issue is a critical portion of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's energy plan allow
ing for higher natural gas prices at the
wellhead, but providing for continued
federal controls.
Jackson reportedly won over a hand
ful of senators whose votes could make
a difference.

While retaining federal controls on
natural gas, the Jackson compromise
would allow producers to charge more
for gas than called for under President
Carter's energy plan. Under the key
proposal made yesterday, it also would
permit greater quantities of gas to qual
ify for the same higher prices.
With the exception of a two-hour
breakfast break, the Senate had been in
session since 9 a.m. Tuesday.
Late Tuesday, Carter administration
officials said they would agree to a
compromise natural gas price ceiling of
$2.03 per thousand cubic feet, a 28 cent
increase over $1.75, the original price in
the energy plan.
The price is currently fixed at $1.46.
Ford may nix big cars
New York — The Ford Motor Co., to

meet federal fuel efficiency laws, may
have to discourage sales of large cars
through pricing policies and delay ac
cepting orders for the bigger vehicles,
Ford's president said yesterday.
Lee lacocca, president of the nation's
second-largest auto firm, said Ford
would have to watch its sales of 1978-
model cars daily to insure that the firm
will be in compliance with federal law.
In addition, lacocca hinted that Ford
soon may begin using foreign steel, a
severe blow to the already hard-hit U.S.
steel industry.
He said Ford, which imports virtually
no steel, soon might "look long and
hard" at foreign steel, which he said
sells for about $50 a ton less. Lower
foreign steel prices are one reason im
ported cars are so attractive to U.S.
consumers, he said.
The federal mileage law requires auto
manufacturers to meet a minimum fuel
economy standard of 18 miles per gal
lon on all 1978-model cars produced in
the U.S.
Each company's total fleet is aver
aged to determine whether it reaches
the standard. If not, there are fines of $5
for each one-tenth of a mile under 18
mpg, multiplied by the number of cars
produced. The federal standard in
creases to 27.5 mpg by 1985.
Abortion issue delays bill
Washington — Pressure mounted
yesterday for quick House-Senate ag
reement on an abortion policy before
money runs out for government social
security agencies whose funds depend
on the outcome.
House and Senate conferees planned

to try to write a compromise some
where between strict limits on federally
funded abortions, which have been
adopted by the House, and more liberal
ones endorsed by the Senate.
At stake is a $60.2 billion appropria
tions bill for the Department of Labor
and the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare for fiscal year 1978.
Current funding for those agencies
runs out tomorrow, the end of fiscal
year 1977.
A meeting among the conferees,
originally scheduled for yesterday
evening, was postponed until today.
Before the postponement was an
nounced, House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill expressed confidence that the
conferees would reach an agreement.
The current House position is that
the government should pay for abor
tions through the Medicaid program
for the poor only when a woman's life
would be jeopardized by a full-term
pregnancy.
Medicaid paid for about 300,000
abortions last year at a cost of $50 mill
ion.
The abortion issue is the last remain
ing obstacle to passage of the Labor-
HEW bill. The conferees have been
working on the bill since July.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy through today with
chance of sprinkles or few light show
