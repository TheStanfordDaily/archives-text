## A 						'Surprise' 
### 
Once resigned to the mod
ern rhythms of its score,
Moliere himself would enjoy
"Surprise!," Kelly Hamilton's
musical version of "Tartuffe."
"Surprise!," which opened
recently at the Alcazar Theatre
in San Francisco, offers its au
dience a fast-paced, highly lit
erate script and lyric/book that
combines Moliere's satire and
schmaltz with justice done to
the original 17th century com
edy.
Moliere's dual foils, the
Roman Catholic hierarchy and
the Parisian bourgeouisie, are
represented well by Ken
Fleishour as the sly clergyman,
Tartuffe, and Ken Letner as his
well-meaning but bumbling
patron, Orgon.
Despite a weak singing
voice, Fleishour's portrayal of
the classic villain is nearly per
fect. While conning Letner

with false piety, he consoli
dates financial and sexual
powers in the salon.
As Orgon, Letner success
fully avoids being one
dimensional by limiting his
foolish expressions and retain
ing forcefulness and maturity
during romantic moments with
his wife Elmire, played beauti
fully by Dorothy Holland.
The show's only weakness is
its title song, which has little
relevance to the play. "Sur
prise!" is a difficult number to
sing well and fails to touch
Moliere's satirical theme,
which is emphasized more
than adequately in other songs
and in a script more substantial
than most popular musical
comedies.
