## Rise in academic gripes reported by ombudsman 
### Craig Dennis 
A significant increase in stu
dent "dissatisfaction with the
content of courses, teaching
and equity in grading" was
noted by University Om
budsman ]ohn Coheen in his
annual report to President
Richard Lyman.
Coheen said his office hand
led over 400 individual cases
from throughout the Stanford
community during the 1976-77
academic year, up from 350 in
1975-76 and 250 in 1974-75.
Student academic grie
vances accounted for the bulk
of the increase, rising from 103
in 1975-76 to 150 last year.
"Consequently, student
academic grievances became a
major concern of the om
budsman's office during the
past year/' Goheen said.
Most academic complaints
were solved informally by the
ombudsman's office, but for
those students who choose to

follow the formal academic
procedure established in 1972,
the course has proven "slow
and cumbersome," Goheen
said.
Grade change
Two cases took more than a
year to resolve, including one
involving undergraduate Peter
Cohen. Last May, Provost Wil
liam Miller changed a chemis
try grade Cohen received from
a B to an A-minus.
Present procedure requires
appeal first to the professor in
volved, then the department
head, the dean of under
graduate studies, the provost
and the president.
Goheen recommended that
beyond the department head
level the "final point of appeal
be a student-faculty committee
with power to review cir
cumstances surrounding the
grievance and to reach a deci
sion. The committee's action
would be a recommendation
to the president and could only
be appealed to him.
"A principal advantage in
this suggested procedure
would be the reduction of the
number of levels of appeal and
of the delay involved," said
Goheen.
On SJC model
He noted that Provost Miller,
in a letter to Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian last February,
suggested the grievance pro
cedure should be reexamined,
and suggested the Stanford
judicial Council as a model in
determining procedural de
tails.
However, Goheen said, "In
the ideal case the solution may
be achieved through direct
consultation with the profes
sor involved and, if not resol
ved at that level, through the
chairman of the department."
Department chairmen have
the authority, made explicit in
Miller's letter, to make such
decisions. Goheen said, "If
(this authority is) properly
exercised, most student grie
vances could probably be re
solved at this level."
No resolution
The report also expressed
concern that many student

academic grievances never
reach any form of resolution.
"They are not brought to the
attention of anyone concerned
with such problems, some
times out of ignorance that
means exist for their expres
sion.
"A pilot survey conducted by
this office indicated that quite
serious criticism of teaching,
course content, and inequity in
grading does not find expres
sion except among the stu
dents themselves," it said.
"Most students who bring
their academic grievances to
this office have at least prima
facie grounds for doing so.
Some cases are easily resol
ved; the simple intervention of
a third party is often effective in
convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in
convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable
grounds for complaint.
Delegations
"There are, however, in
stances where it is not a par
ticular student questioning the
legitimacy of an instructor's ac
tion, but a delegation of stu
dents complaining, for exam
ple, that a particular course or
course sequence is poorly
taught," said Coheen.
On another topic, Goheen
said the "most troublesome"
of Honor Code violations in
volve foreign students.
"They are either unaware of
the importance attributed to
this code at Stanford or regard
it as irrelevant to their con
duct," Goheen said.
His report said a concerted
effort is being made to resolve
this problem, including in
volvement by the Bechtel In
ternational Center to make
sure all foreign students un
derstand the code.
Persons who bring faculty
tenure problems to his atten
tion should be provided "with
the most complete disclosure
possible" of reasons for tenure
denial, Coheen observed.
He suggested the greatest
flexibility should be permitted
to interpret Personnel De
partment standards to meet
some of the special staff cases
which come to his attention.
