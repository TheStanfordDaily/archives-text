# Free parking gone
## 
### Ali Webb 
There's no such thing as a
free lunch. Free parking is now
almost as scarce.
Gratis "C" lot parking for
off-campus students is now a
thing of the past.
"There is no longer any park
ing on campus without the be
nefit of parking permits, ex
cept in pay lots and timed
zones," says LaVerne Hart,
administrative assistant to
Marvin Herrington, director of
Police Services.
A $15 charge is now assessed
for the "C" stickers, and off
campus students may now
purchase "A" and "B" lot stic
kers. "A" and "B" stickers are
$60 and $40 respectively and
may be purchased at the office
of public safety.
Carpools free
Persons in carpools, how
ever, are eligible for free park
ing. Depending on the number
of individuals involved in the
carpool, "A," "B" and "C"
stickers are available to faculty,

staff or non-resident students.
A two-person carpool is elig
ible for a "C" sticker, three
persons for a "B" and four for
an "A". All participating cars
will be issued a "P" sticker and
a floating permit, which is re
quired to appear on the
windshield of the car in use on
any given day.
Free parking permits are also
available to handicapped stu
dents.
"We accept applications and
medical certifications from
handicapped students. These
are then sent to Cowell for
evaluation and permit deci
sions are made according to
need," said Hart.
On-campus fees
All students in on-campus
housing are required to regis
ter their vehicles with the De
partment of Public Safety
within the first five days of the
quarter. Stickers for on
campus registration cost $15
and are assigned according to
residence.

"X" permits are also issued
by the Department of Public
Safety to construction vehicles
subject to the recommenda
tion of the construction office,
said Hart.
Last spring, the Committee
on Parking and Transportation
recommended that the Uni
versity end its policy of issuing
prime parking spaces to con
struction workers.
Among other recommenda
tions of the spring report was
one urging Santa Clara County
to raise bail for parking tickets
from $2 to $5.
"This is being considered by
Santa Clara County. We re
ceive no money from the
fines," commented Hart.
The committee also recom
mended that five visitor infor
mation stations be con
structed. A prototype station is
under construction and should
be finished in the next few
weeks, according to Oscar
Nelson, the University's Mas
ter Planner.

subject to the recommenda
tion of the construction office,
said Hart.
Last spring, the Committee
on Parking and Transportation
recommended that the Uni
versity end its policy of issuing
prime parking spaces to con
struction workers.
Among other recommenda
tions of the spring report was
one urging Santa Clara County
to raise bail for parking tickets
from $2 to $5.
"This is being considered by
Santa Clara County. We re
ceive no money from the
fines," commented Hart.
The committee also recom
mended that five visitor infor
mation stations be con
structed. A prototype station is
under construction and should
be finished in the next few
weeks, according to Oscar
Nelson, the University's Mas
ter Planner.
There's no such thing as a
free lunch. Free parking is now
almost as scarce.
Gratis "C" lot parking for
off-campus students is now a
thing of the past.
"There is no longer any park
ing on campus without the be
nefit of parking permits, ex
cept in pay lots and timed
zones," says LaVerne Hart,
administrative assistant to
Marvin Herrington, director of
Police Services.
A $15 charge is now assessed
for the "C" stickers, and off
campus students may now
purchase "A" and "B" lot stic
kers. "A" and "B" stickers are
$60 and $40 respectively and
may be purchased at the office
of public safety.
Carpools free
Persons in carpools, how
ever, are eligible for free park
ing. Depending on the number
of individuals involved in the
carpool, "A," "B" and "C"
stickers are available to faculty,

staff or non-resident students.
A two-person carpool is elig
ible for a "C" sticker, three
persons for a "B" and four for
an "A". All participating cars
will be issued a "P" sticker and
a floating permit, which is re
quired to appear on the
windshield of the car in use on
any given day.
Free parking permits are also
available to handicapped stu
dents.
"We accept applications and
medical certifications from
handicapped students. These
are then sent to Cowell for
evaluation and permit deci
sions are made according to
need," said Hart.
On-campus fees
All students in on-campus
housing are required to regis
ter their vehicles with the De
partment of Public Safety
within the first five days of the
quarter. Stickers for on
campus registration cost $15
and are assigned according to
residence.

"X" permits are also issued
by the Department of Public
Safety to construction vehicles
subject to the recommenda
tion of the construction office,
said Hart.
