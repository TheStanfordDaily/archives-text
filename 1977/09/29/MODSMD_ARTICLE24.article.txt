# Recycling center on October ASSU ballot
## 
### 
By Emily Sachar
Students will vote in mid-October on
a fee assessment that would establish a
new student-run recycling facility on
campus. The $1 per student assessment
for two consecutive quarters will pay
the Plant Services Department which is
now financing the center.
The site design is presently complete
for the recycling center which will
probably be built within six weeks. The
ASSU plans to wait until January
ever, to open the center because of lost
revenue during Christmas vacation.
The University issued an eviction
notice July 6 to Alpha Place Recycling,
the old recycling center located on
Pampas Lane behind the University
Credit Union.
"When the center (Alpha Place) came
on last year we had anticipated a much
smaller operation than we ended up
with," said Jason Mavis, director of
Plant Services.
"Due to a number of complaints by
various operations around the center,

and traffic difficulties, our only viable
choice was to ask them to leave cam
pus.
"We preferred dealing with the re
cycling center through students and
thought the project should be run
mainly by campus individuals and
should primarily serve the campus,"
Mavis said.
In early August, COP President Anne
Henkels and Bob Wenzlau (working for
Palo Alto) began drawing up a detailed
proposal to be submitted to various
University personnel for evaluation and
support.
"Actually, the issue is pretty noncon
troversial and most people seem to ap
prove it enough not to turn it down. It's
definitely one of the most worthwhile
projects ASSU has proposed in the last
five years," said Sonny Gundling, tem
porary project manager.
"We set up a time line in which to
complete the design of the project and
the site after careful negotiations,"
Gundling said.

At present, the $24,000 project is
being funded by Plant Services. An as
sessment approval would provide
enough funding to assure installation
of the project and refund Plant Ser
vices. One project manager and six
part-time employes responsible for col
lection and maintenance will be hired
in the next few weeks, according to
Gundling.
"The project will maintain itself from
the revenue gained by the recycling
materials sold and will provide the
salaries for the ASSU employes as
well," Mavis said.
The new center will be located on a
site behind Plant Services and will be
fenced and locked to avoid possible ac
cidents, according to Mavis. The center
will handle glass, aluminum and paper.
"This type of project is long overdue in
the United States. A relocated and
properly housed project as a student
program is the ideal solution to what
was too large a project previously,"
Mavis concluded.

Students will vote in mid-October on
a fee assessment that would establish a
new student-run recycling facility on
campus. The $1 per student assessment
for two consecutive quarters will pay
the Plant Services Department which is
now financing the center.
The site design is presently complete
for the recycling center which will
probably be built within six weeks. The
ASSU plans to wait until January
ever, to open the center because of lost
revenue during Christmas vacation.
The University issued an eviction
notice July 6 to Alpha Place Recycling,
the old recycling center located on
Pampas Lane behind the University
Credit Union.
"When the center (Alpha Place) came
on last year we had anticipated a much
smaller operation than we ended up
with," said Jason Mavis, director of
Plant Services.
"Due to a number of complaints by
various operations around the center,

and traffic difficulties, our only viable
choice was to ask them to leave cam
pus.
"We preferred dealing with the re
cycling center through students and
thought the project should be run
mainly by campus individuals and
should primarily serve the campus,"
Mavis said.
In early August, COP President Anne
Henkels and Bob Wenzlau (working for
Palo Alto) began drawing up a detailed
proposal to be submitted to various
University personnel for evaluation and
support.
"Actually, the issue is pretty noncon
troversial and most people seem to ap
prove it enough not to turn it down. It's
definitely one of the most worthwhile
projects ASSU has proposed in the last
five years," said Sonny Gundling, tem
porary project manager.
"We set up a time line in which to
complete the design of the project and
the site after careful negotiations,"
Gundling said.

At present, the $24,000 project is
being funded by Plant Services. An as
sessment approval would provide
enough funding to assure installation
of the project and refund Plant Ser
vices. One project manager and six
part-time employes responsible for col
lection and maintenance will be hired
in the next few weeks, according to
Gundling.
"The project will maintain itself from
the revenue gained by the recycling
materials sold and will provide the
salaries for the ASSU employes as
well," Mavis said.
The new center will be located on a
site behind Plant Services and will be
fenced and locked to avoid possible ac
cidents, according to Mavis. The center
will handle glass, aluminum and paper.
"This type of project is long overdue in
the United States. A relocated and
properly housed project as a student
program is the ideal solution to what
was too large a project previously,"
Mavis concluded.
