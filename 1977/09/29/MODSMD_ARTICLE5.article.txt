# The
						epistles of behavior modification

### 
On August 18,1977, a two-page letter from Anthony A. Lapham,
General Counsel of the United States Central Intelligence
Agency, was delivered to the Medical Center office of Clayton
Rich, Dean of the Medical School and Vice President of the Univer
sity for Medical Affairs. It was addressed to "President, Stanford
University School of Medicine." There being no president of the
medical school, Dean Rich forwarded the letter to the office of
University President Richard Lyman. When Lyman opened the
letter he read the following:
The purpose of this letter is to bring to your attention a matter of
importance to you and your University.
The Central Intelligence Agency recently has located several thousand
hitherto undiscovered documents relating to activities funded by the CIA
as a part of Project MK-ULTRA in the 1950s and 19605. That project, which
is more fully described in the enclosed copy of a statement presented by
the Director of Central Intelligence at a joint public hearing on 2 August
before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommit
tee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Committee on Human
Resources, involved the initiation and sponsorship by the Agency of
research and development designed to identify materials and methods
useful in altering human behavior patterns. Although the more highly
publicized portion of this activity concerned the testing of the effects of
various types of drugs on humans, most of the research did not involve
such testing but rather only far less controversial investigations into
aspects of human behavior and its determinants.
As explained in the Director's statement, until these documents were
found it was believed that virtually all Project MK-ULTRA records were
destroyed by the Agency in 1973. These newly-discovered documents
consist largely of financial records, however, and add only fragmentary
substantive information concerning the nature and extent of MK-ULTRA
activities. What the documents do contribute is information regarding
the identities of researchers and institutions involved in these activities
and the funding mechanisms used to conceal CIA interest. In some cases
these individuals and institutions apparently were aware of CIA sponsor
ship but in many other cases it appears the individuals or institutions, or
both, were not informed that the research was connected in any way with
CIA.
Your University is included among the institutions at which some
portion of this CIA-sponsored research appears to have been performed
or with which one or more individuals performing some aspect of this
research were affiliated. While we recognize this may be unwelcome
news, we believe we have an obligation to advise you of this fact so that
you may initiate such action as you deem necessary to protect the in
terests of your University. As noted on page 8 of the statement by the
Director, this Agency does not intend to reveal to the public the identities
of any university or other institution that knowingly or unknowingly was
involved in MK-ULTRA activities, or the names of the individual resear
chers. The decision concerning the manner in which you and your Uni
versity choose to treat this matter is, of course, yours alone. The Agency is

willing, to the extent it is able and legally free to do so, to discuss this
matter further with you or your representatives and to furnish such
further information as you may request, including copies of the relevant
documents. These documents, which I must again point out do not
provide more than a fragmentary picture of the various research projects,
are being assembled now and, depending upon your wishes, will be
either mailed or otherwise made available to you or your representatives
for inspection. In this connection, we are consulting with the Department
of justice to determine whether we are free to disclose to you the names
of the individual or individuals affiliated with your University who per
formed the research in question. Our present understanding is that we
are not at liberty to disclose this information.
The newly-discovered documents, most of which were financial
records relating to the experimental subprojects that made up the
MK-ULTRA operation, had escaped a general destruction of other
MK-ULTRA documents in 1973 because they had inadvertently
been transferred to the Agency's Retired Records Center in 1970.
They weie discovered in 1976 by an employe of the Agency who
had, in the words of CIA Director Stansfield Turner, left "no stone
unturned in his efforts to respond to FOIA (Freedom of Informa
tion Act) requests" dealing with "our holdings on behavioral
drugs."
Along with the letter, General Counsel Lapham included a copy
of statement presented by Turner, at a joint public hearing on
August 2,1977 before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
and the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the
Senate Committee on Human Resources.
"The most significant new data discovered," said Turner in his
statement, are "the names of researchers and institutions who
participated in the MK-ULTRA project ... on either a witting or
unwitting basis, and the names of the CIA officials who approved
or monitored the various subprojects."
The statement went on to summarize the relevant statistics:
"There were 149 MK-ULTRA subprojects, many of which appear to
have some connection with research into behavioral modification,
drug acquisition and testing or administering drugs surreptitiously
. . . (There were) 14 subprojects definitely involving tests on
human volunteers; 19 subprojects probably including tests on
human volunteers. While not known, some of these subprojects
may have included tests on unwitting subjects as well; (and) six
subprojects involving tests on unwitting subjects." In addition, the
statement said, there are a total of 185 non-government resear
chers and assistants identified in the recovered material and a total
of 80 institutions at which MK-ULTRA-related work was done, in
cluding 44 colleges and universities, 15 research foundations and
chemical or pharmaceutical companies, 12 hospitals and clinics
and three penal institutions.
Having said all this, Turner then notes that, "we believe the
detail on the identities of researchers and institutions involved in
ClA's sponsorship of drugs and behavioral modification is a new
element and one which poses a considerable problem. . . . The
researchers and institutions which cooperated with the CIA on a
witting basis acted in good faith and in the belief that they were
aiding their government in a legitimate and proper,purpose ... I
believe we all have a moral obligation to these researchers and
institutions to protect them from any unjustified embarrassment or
damage to their reputations which revelation of their identities
might bring." This is not to mention, he continues, his "legal
obligation under the Privacy Act not to publicly disclose the names
of the individual researchers without their consent. This is," writes
Admiral Turner, "especially true, of course, for those researchers
and institutions which were unwitting participants in ClA
sponsored activities."
Nevertheless, Turner provided the committees with "all of the
names on a classified basis," saying that "I hope that this will
facilitate your investigation while protecting the individuals and
institutions involved."
Turner concludes the statement with a denial of contemporary
complicity: "Let me emphasize that the MK-ULTRA events are 12 to
25 years in the past. I assure you that the CIA is in no way engaged
in either witting or unwitting testing of drugs today."
On August 24, President Lyman responded to the letter from the
Agency's general counsel and the accompanying statement
from Admiral Turner. That response was as follows:
Dear Mr. Lapham:
Thank you for your letter of August 18, 1977. I wish to accept your
invitation to see the documents that show the involvement of Stanford or
individuals affiliated with Stanford in Project MK-ULTRA. Please send them
directly to me.
