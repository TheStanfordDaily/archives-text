## Thursday 
### 
In spring, 1976, the Daily published its final issue
of Thursday, a weekly tabloid showcasing features
and entertainment.
Today, we bring on the new Thursday, under the
direction of Stephen Crolius. We hope it will prove
a truly superior magazine-type product which will
give a weekly break from the Daily's normal for
mat.
The ideas we hope to use in Thursday will center
around the cover story â€” in-depth investigative or
features articles which cover some topic of interest
to our readers.
Entertainment will be geared toward providing
an informative and captivating summary of the
area's prospects for diversion.
All in all, it's designed to give a lift for everyone
involved, just after the middle of the week.
So watch for it. We'll be strivingto makeitoneof
the most exciting things on campus in a long time.
