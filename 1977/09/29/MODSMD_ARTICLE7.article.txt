For your information, we intend to make known to the public the con
tents of your letter, and to report such further information as you may
supply us.
On one point we do need reassurance: Can universities now be used by
the CIA in the way in which they were apparently used in Project MK
ULTRA? Or is it now the CIA policy not to use universities and their faculties
without their knowledge and consent? I would very much appreciate an
answer.
Several days ago, I spoke with Robert Rosenzweig, university
vice president for public affairs. He told me that the CIA had
responded to Lyman's letter of August 24th with a letter of its own,
received on Sept. 12th. In this letter, the Agency informed Presi
dent Lyman that the relevant documents would be forthcoming
and outlined its current policy concerning Agency research at
universities: to whit, that from now on "the knowledge and con
sent of senior officials of the university would be required before
the university as such could be used for such research, but that
they need not notify the university of arrangements made between
the Agency and any individual affiliated with the university."

Rosenzweig also said that he had called the CIA to ask if it had
covertly funded research involving hallucinogenic drugs at the
University through either the National Institute of Health or the
Veterans Administration. He said he had spoken to Rick Cinqueg
rana in the CIA General Counsel's office who had told him that the
Agency had not done so. But, as has already been established by
information contained in the August letter from Lapham and the
statement from Turner, indeed by the fact of the letter's having
been sent in the first place, Rosenzweig admitted that Cinquegrana
had agreed that "yes, in some sense" the Central Intelligence
Agency had funded drug research at the University, if only in the
sense that someone with a University affiliation had been a par
ticipant in the drug research conducted by the Agency under the
aegis of MK-ULTRA.
