The research into alcohol metabolism conducted by Dr. Henry
Newman of the Medical School and financed indirectly by the
ClA's MK-ULTRA Project, was only a continuation of studies he had
been conducting without agency assistance, but on a limited
budget, for over 20 years, according to Dr. Marion Smith, adjunct
professor of neurology and Newman's co-worker on the
metabolism studies.
"He was an internationally-renowned alcohol expert," she said,
adding that "he worked all his life studying the clinical effects of
alcohol. His "Acute Alcoholic Intoxication, A Critical Review"
(Stanford University Press, 1941, 207 pp.) is a classic in the field."
Smith cited a long list ot articles dealing with acute alcoholic
conditions published by Newman in the 19305, 19405, and early
19505, giving as only a partial list the following items: "Alcohol
Injected Intravenously: Further Observations on the Effect of
Habituation in the Rate of Metabolism," published in the Journal of
Pharmacology in 1936; "Effect of Altitude on Alcohol Tolerance,"
published in The Quarterly Journal of Alcohol in 1949; "Effect of
Dosage on the Rate of Disappearance of Ethanol from the Blood of
Dogs," which appeared in the Journal of Physiology in 1949; and
"A Micro-Diffusion Method for Alcohol Determination," pub
lished in the Stanford Medical Bulletin in 1953.
Of the findings compiled by Dr. Newman and herself from
research financed by the CIA, Smith said, "Every single bit was
published." She mentioned specifically what she called one of
"the best ones," co-authored by herself and Newman, an article
that appeared in 1959 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, enti
tled "The Rate of Ethanol Metabolism in Fed and Fasting Animals."
There never was any interference from the CIA either in their
conduct of the research or in preventing them from publishing
their findings, according to Smith. She said the issue of not pub
lishing the findings never came up and that "everyone was pleased
when they were published." Smith also said that no practical solu
tion to the problem of how to block acute alcoholic intoxication
was ever developed as a result of their research and an
intoxication-blocking chemical agent, which the CIA wanted to
provide for its agents for use in situations where they might find
themselves involved in the ingestion of excessive doses of drink,
has not yet been developed.
Along with saying that the CIA-financed research done by New
man was only continuation of work he had already been doing for
many years, Smith also pointed out that "in those days there was
no National Institutes of Health (NIH), no National Science Found
ation (NSF)" to provide the kinds of funds for basic research.
This theme was echoed by Dr. Glenn Campbell, Director of the
Hoover Institution, and a member of the Board of Directors of the
NSF, who said that although the Foundation was established
around 1950, "its budget remained small until the 60s" when fed
eral funds for basic research at universities, provided through the
NSF and the NIH, were dramatically increased during the Kennedy
and Johnson Administrations.

There never was any interference from the CIA either in their
conduct of the research or in preventing them from publishing
their findings, according to Smith. She said the issue of not pub
lishing the findings never came up and that "everyone was pleased
when they were published." Smith also said that no practical solu
tion to the problem of how to block acute alcoholic intoxication
was ever developed as a result of their research and an
intoxication-blocking chemical agent, which the CIA wanted to
provide for its agents for use in situations where they might find
themselves involved in the ingestion of excessive doses of drink,
has not yet been developed.
Along with saying that the CIA-financed research done by New
man was only continuation of work he had already been doing for
many years, Smith also pointed out that "in those days there was
no National Institutes of Health (NIH), no National Science Found
ation (NSF)" to provide the kinds of funds for basic research.
This theme was echoed by Dr. Glenn Campbell, Director of the
Hoover Institution, and a member of the Board of Directors of the
NSF, who said that although the Foundation was established
around 1950, "its budget remained small until the 60s" when fed
eral funds for basic research at universities, provided through the
NSF and the NIH, were dramatically increased during the Kennedy
and Johnson Administrations.

The research into alcohol metabolism conducted by Dr. Henry
Newman of the Medical School and financed indirectly by the
ClA's MK-ULTRA Project, was only a continuation of studies he had
been conducting without agency assistance, but on a limited
budget, for over 20 years, according to Dr. Marion Smith, adjunct
professor of neurology and Newman's co-worker on the
metabolism studies.
"He was an internationally-renowned alcohol expert," she said,
adding that "he worked all his life studying the clinical effects of
alcohol. His "Acute Alcoholic Intoxication, A Critical Review"
(Stanford University Press, 1941, 207 pp.) is a classic in the field."
Smith cited a long list ot articles dealing with acute alcoholic
conditions published by Newman in the 19305, 19405, and early
19505, giving as only a partial list the following items: "Alcohol
Injected Intravenously: Further Observations on the Effect of
Habituation in the Rate of Metabolism," published in the Journal of
Pharmacology in 1936; "Effect of Altitude on Alcohol Tolerance,"
published in The Quarterly Journal of Alcohol in 1949; "Effect of
Dosage on the Rate of Disappearance of Ethanol from the Blood of
Dogs," which appeared in the Journal of Physiology in 1949; and
"A Micro-Diffusion Method for Alcohol Determination," pub
lished in the Stanford Medical Bulletin in 1953.
Of the findings compiled by Dr. Newman and herself from
research financed by the CIA, Smith said, "Every single bit was
published." She mentioned specifically what she called one of
"the best ones," co-authored by herself and Newman, an article
that appeared in 1959 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, enti
tled "The Rate of Ethanol Metabolism in Fed and Fasting Animals."
There never was any interference from the CIA either in their
conduct of the research or in preventing them from publishing
their findings, according to Smith. She said the issue of not pub
lishing the findings never came up and that "everyone was pleased
when they were published." Smith also said that no practical solu
