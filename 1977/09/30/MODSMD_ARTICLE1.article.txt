# Lyman eyes retirement legislation

President Richard Lyman urged an
examination of the impacts here of
recent California legislation remov
ing the mandatory retirement age,
and the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
presented its annual report in a brief
meeting of the Faculty Senate last
night.
Lyman said the recent legislation,
which removes the possibility of hav
ing a mandatory retirement age, will
probably have a considerable impact
on the University.
If a teacher reaches the age of 65,
does not want to retire and de
monstrates sufficient competence to
continue working, the employer
cannot force retirement on the basis
of age alone. This has a great poten
tial impact on the faculty and tenure,
Lyman said. He added that he
thought the legislation was written
with "indecent haste," and without
enough consideration of the effect
on affirmative action programs.
Lyman also added it was important
to continue to assure a flow of young
talent into the University.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Er
nest Chilton presented the C-AAA
annual report and reported on the
findings of the subcommittee on
evaluation and improvement of
teaching (S-EIT).
He said that under pressure from
the ASSU last year the committee set
to work under the guidelines from
the Senate.
S-EIT now has a tentative evalua
tion scheme ready to be released to
instructors and students at the end of
autumn quarter. These evaluations
will be analyzed with feedback from
students and professors and another
draft will be sent out at the end of
winter quarter.
Course Guide Manager David
Parker, a member of C-AAA and S-EIT,
added that there are still questions
about the tentative evaluation plan.
It is not clear who will have access to
the evaluations: professors, depart
ments, or students.
Parker added that the whole ques
tion of the universal course evalua
tion is "very touchy." He feels that
one form may not necessarily apply
to all classes, that it is important to
have quantitative questions which
can be scored as well as open ended
essay questions and comments from
the students.
