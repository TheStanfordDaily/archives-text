# Senate law reform bill threatens freedom
## 
### 
The Los Angeles Times

New legfslation to reform and
codify federal criminal law is now be
fore the Senate judiciary Committee,
and may be sent this month to the full
Senate for consideration.
The measure, Senate Bill 1437,
should be defeated.
It is an improvement, as we noted
three months ago, over Senate Bill 1
that failed in the 94th Congress, but
that is not the standard that should
apply. Marked throughout by an au
thoritarian tone, S 1 was riddled with
repressive provisions.
Increase power
Yet S 1437 has been drafted in a
way suggesting that its supporters
believe that the misuse of govern
ment authority creates the need to
increase the power of government.
That judgment stands history on i&
head.
Basic to a democratic society is an
unfettered flow of information. Sev
eral, sections of the reform measure
would diminish the ability of the
press to serve this function.
One would make it a crime for a
reporter or a news organization to
refuse to disclose confidential news
sources to police or courts. Protec
tion of the confidentiality of sources
of information is vital to the gather
ing of news. It is particularly signific
ant in the exposure of corruption in
government.
Seme of the more onerous sec
tions of the bill that applied to the

press were modified in the final pre
paration of the measure. A news or
ganization could not be prosecuted
for contempt for violating a court gag
order, if the order proved to be in
valid and the organization tried to
have it overturned or stayed before
violating it.
This section originally would have
made possible the conviction and
jailing of news reporters for con
tempt, even though the court order
was later declared invalid, unless the
court found the order "clearly in
valid."
But overshadowing this, modest
improvement in the bill is a fact of far
greater significance. If S 1437 is ap
proved, the power of the courts to
issue gag orders will be imbedded in
the federal statutes. If the history of
gag orders is any guide, judges
would seize and exploit this power to
the fullest.
Only when a Supreme Court deci
sion last July 1 in a Nebraska murder
case made it difficult to issue such
orders did the rising flood of restric
tive orders subside.
Another provision limiting public
knowledge about the criminal
justice system would require the de
struction of criminal-conviction re
cords under certain circumstances.
This statute and similar laws in sev
eral states have far-reaching implica
tions. They could prevent the public
irom even learning if a candidate for

public office had a criminal record.
Section 1002, dealing with criminal
conspiracy, would make it an offense
if an individual "agrees with one or
more persons to engage in conduct,
the performance of which would
constitute a crime or crimes."
All that would be required to con
stitute a crime would be an expres
sion of agreement to commit an of
fense like an illegal protest demonst
ration, even though the person
never took part in the assembly.
Section 1003 would create a new
and elastic federal crime of criminal
solicitation, saying that "a person is
guilty of an offense if, with intent
that another person engage in con
duct constituting a crime, and, in
fact, under circumstances strongly
indicative of that intent, he com
mands, entreats, induces or other
wise endeavors to persuade such
person to engage in such conduct."
The language is so broad that a
person could be subjected to crimi
nal prosecution for engaging in a dis
cussion of political action that later
might result in the commission of a
federal offense.
Section 1323, on tampering with a
witness or informant, would extend
this crime to include "any other act
with intent to improperly influence,
or obstruct or impair" the administ
ration of any law or the conduct of a
legislative inquiry.
The right of persons to organize
any effective opposition to an official
proceeding would depend on a pro
secutor's definition of "improperly"
and "impair," and the words would
mean wlv:t a prosecutor decided
they meant.
Another new offense
Section 1861 would create another
new federal offense. Under this sec
tion, it would be unlawful to fail to
obey a public-safety order given in
response to a fire, flood, riot "or
other condition that creates a risk of
serious injury to a person or serious
damage to property."
This seems like a sensible mea
sure, but the power to issue such an
order would be vested in "any fed
eral employe," and, moreover,
would extend anywhere in the Un
ited States.
The law could cover a picket line, a
parade or any public gathering that
any petty government official de
cided was a threat to public safety.
The dangers of such autocratic
power so broadly conferred are ob
vious.

If the nation has learned anything
from the disclosures of offenses
committed against constitutional rights
by the FBI and other powerful federal
agencies, it is this: Their authority
must be carefully defined and cauti
ously circumscribed. Yet S 1437
would greatly expand that authority.
A significant example is Section
1343, which says that a citizen is
guilty of a crime if, "in a government
matter," he makes "a material oral
statement that is false" to "a law
enforcement officer" or to an official
"assigned investigative responsibil
ity."
The possibilities are enormous for
harassment of investigative targets
by federal agents. A person could be
subjected to criminal prosecution on
the word alone of any federal
employe engaged in law enforce
ment, and the outcome would likely
turn on the citizen's word against the
official's word.
S 1437 would reaffirm the govern
ment's authority to impose "use"
immunity on witnesses testifying be
fore grand juries and other official
bodies. This forces a witness to sur
render his right to refuse to testify
under the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.
The evidence he gives may not be
used against him in a criminal pro
secution, but if other evidence is av
ailable the witness may still be prose
cuted for an offense about which he
has testified. This provision is simply
a way for prosecutors to set aside the
Fifth Amendment, and to nullify a
person's right to remain silent.
S 1437 directly threatens and po
tentially threatens many areas of
American freedom. It has too many
provisions that, in a time of political
passion like the years of the Vietnam
war, could be used to close off
legitimate political dissent.
Its vague definitions would be
come a constant temptation to gov
ernment officials to expand the pow
ers conferred on them in 51437 even
beyond the intention of the drafters
of the legislation.
Finally, this bill, like its predeces
sor, reaches a fundamentally wrong
conclusion about the source of this
nation's strength. Running through
this legislation is the pervasive feel
ing that the government, in order to
insure our security, must have the
authority to closely monitor the polit
ical freedom of American citizens.

sion of agreement to commit an of
fense like an illegal protest demonst
ration, even though the person
never took part in the assembly.
Section 1003 would create a new
and elastic federal crime of criminal
solicitation, saying that "a person is
guilty of an offense if, with intent
that another person engage in con
duct constituting a crime, and, in
fact, under circumstances strongly
indicative of that intent, he com
mands, entreats, induces or other
wise endeavors to persuade such
person to engage in such conduct."
The language is so broad that a
person could be subjected to crimi
nal prosecution for engaging in a dis
cussion of political action that later
might result in the commission of a
federal offense.
Section 1323, on tampering with a
witness or informant, would extend
this crime to include "any other act
with intent to improperly influence,
or obstruct or impair" the administ
ration of any law or the conduct of a
legislative inquiry.
The right of persons to organize
any effective opposition to an official
proceeding would depend on a pro
secutor's definition of "improperly"
and "impair," and the words would
mean wlv:t a prosecutor decided
they meant.
Another new offense
Section 1861 would create another
new federal offense. Under this sec
tion, it would be unlawful to fail to
obey a public-safety order given in
response to a fire, flood, riot "or
other condition that creates a risk of
serious injury to a person or serious
damage to property."
This seems like a sensible mea
sure, but the power to issue such an
order would be vested in "any fed
eral employe," and, moreover,
would extend anywhere in the Un
ited States.
The law could cover a picket line, a
parade or any public gathering that
any petty government official de
cided was a threat to public safety.
The dangers of such autocratic
power so broadly conferred are ob
vious.

If the nation has learned anything
from the disclosures of offenses
committed against constitutional rights
by the FBI and other powerful federal
agencies, it is this: Their authority
must be carefully defined and cauti
ously circumscribed. Yet S 1437
would greatly expand that authority.
A significant example is Section
1343, which says that a citizen is
guilty of a crime if, "in a government
matter," he makes "a material oral
statement that is false" to "a law
enforcement officer" or to an official
"assigned investigative responsibil
ity."
The possibilities are enormous for
harassment of investigative targets
by federal agents. A person could be
subjected to criminal prosecution on
the word alone of any federal
employe engaged in law enforce
ment, and the outcome would likely
turn on the citizen's word against the
official's word.
S 1437 would reaffirm the govern
ment's authority to impose "use"
immunity on witnesses testifying be
fore grand juries and other official
bodies. This forces a witness to sur
render his right to refuse to testify
under the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.
The evidence he gives may not be
used against him in a criminal pro
secution, but if other evidence is av
ailable the witness may still be prose
cuted for an offense about which he
has testified. This provision is simply
a way for prosecutors to set aside the
Fifth Amendment, and to nullify a
person's right to remain silent.
S 1437 directly threatens and po
tentially threatens many areas of
American freedom. It has too many
provisions that, in a time of political
passion like the years of the Vietnam
war, could be used to close off
legitimate political dissent.
Its vague definitions would be
come a constant temptation to gov
ernment officials to expand the pow
ers conferred on them in 51437 even
beyond the intention of the drafters
of the legislation.
Finally, this bill, like its predeces
sor, reaches a fundamentally wrong
conclusion about the source of this
nation's strength. Running through
this legislation is the pervasive feel
ing that the government, in order to
insure our security, must have the
authority to closely monitor the polit
ical freedom of American citizens.

New legfslation to reform and
codify federal criminal law is now be
fore the Senate judiciary Committee,
and may be sent this month to the full
Senate for consideration.
The measure, Senate Bill 1437,
should be defeated.
It is an improvement, as we noted
three months ago, over Senate Bill 1
that failed in the 94th Congress, but
that is not the standard that should
apply. Marked throughout by an au
thoritarian tone, S 1 was riddled with
repressive provisions.
Increase power
Yet S 1437 has been drafted in a
way suggesting that its supporters
believe that the misuse of govern
ment authority creates the need to
increase the power of government.
That judgment stands history on i&
head.
Basic to a democratic society is an
unfettered flow of information. Sev
eral, sections of the reform measure
would diminish the ability of the
press to serve this function.
One would make it a crime for a
reporter or a news organization to
refuse to disclose confidential news
sources to police or courts. Protec
tion of the confidentiality of sources
of information is vital to the gather
ing of news. It is particularly signific
ant in the exposure of corruption in
government.
Seme of the more onerous sec
tions of the bill that applied to the

press were modified in the final pre
paration of the measure. A news or
ganization could not be prosecuted
for contempt for violating a court gag
order, if the order proved to be in
valid and the organization tried to
have it overturned or stayed before
violating it.
This section originally would have
made possible the conviction and
jailing of news reporters for con
tempt, even though the court order
was later declared invalid, unless the
court found the order "clearly in
valid."
But overshadowing this, modest
improvement in the bill is a fact of far
greater significance. If S 1437 is ap
proved, the power of the courts to
issue gag orders will be imbedded in
the federal statutes. If the history of
gag orders is any guide, judges
would seize and exploit this power to
the fullest.
Only when a Supreme Court deci
sion last July 1 in a Nebraska murder
case made it difficult to issue such
orders did the rising flood of restric
tive orders subside.
Another provision limiting public
knowledge about the criminal
justice system would require the de
struction of criminal-conviction re
cords under certain circumstances.
This statute and similar laws in sev
eral states have far-reaching implica
tions. They could prevent the public
irom even learning if a candidate for

public office had a criminal record.
Section 1002, dealing with criminal
conspiracy, would make it an offense
if an individual "agrees with one or
more persons to engage in conduct,
the performance of which would
constitute a crime or crimes."
All that would be required to con
stitute a crime would be an expres
sion of agreement to commit an of

bodies. This forces a witness to sur
render his right to refuse to testify
under the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.
The evidence he gives may not be
used against him in a criminal pro
secution, but if other evidence is av

a way for prosecutors to set aside the
Fifth Amendment, and to nullify a
person's right to remain silent.
S 1437 directly threatens and po

American freedom. It has too many
provisions that, in a time of political

Its vague definitions would be

New legfslation to reform and
codify federal criminal law is now be
fore the Senate judiciary Committee,
and may be sent this month to the full
Senate for consideration.
The measure, Senate Bill 1437,
should be defeated.
It is an improvement, as we noted
three months ago, over Senate Bill 1
that failed in the 94th Congress, but
that is not the standard that should
apply. Marked throughout by an au
thoritarian tone, S 1 was riddled with
repressive provisions.
Increase power
Yet S 1437 has been drafted in a
way suggesting that its supporters
believe that the misuse of govern
ment authority creates the need to
increase the power of government.
That judgment stands history on i&
head.
Basic to a democratic society is an
unfettered flow of information. Sev
eral, sections of the reform measure
would diminish the ability of the
press to serve this function.
One would make it a crime for a
reporter or a news organization to
refuse to disclose confidential news
sources to police or courts. Protec
tion of the confidentiality of sources
of information is vital to the gather
ing of news. It is particularly signific
ant in the exposure of corruption in
government.
Seme of the more onerous sec
tions of the bill that applied to the

press were modified in the final pre
paration of the measure. A news or
ganization could not be prosecuted
for contempt for violating a court gag
order, if the order proved to be in
valid and the organization tried to
have it overturned or stayed before
violating it.
This section originally would have
made possible the conviction and
jailing of news reporters for con
tempt, even though the court order
was later declared invalid, unless the
court found the order "clearly in
valid."
But overshadowing this, modest
improvement in the bill is a fact of far
greater significance. If S 1437 is ap
proved, the power of the courts to
issue gag orders will be imbedded in
the federal statutes. If the history of
gag orders is any guide, judges
would seize and exploit this power to
the fullest.
Only when a Supreme Court deci
sion last July 1 in a Nebraska murder
case made it difficult to issue such
orders did the rising flood of restric
tive orders subside.
Another provision limiting public
knowledge about the criminal
justice system would require the de
struction of criminal-conviction re
cords under certain circumstances.
This statute and similar laws in sev
eral states have far-reaching implica
tions. They could prevent the public
irom even learning if a candidate for

public office had a criminal record.
Section 1002, dealing with criminal
conspiracy, would make it an offense
if an individual "agrees with one or
more persons to engage in conduct,
the performance of which would
constitute a crime or crimes."
All that would be required to con
stitute a crime would be an expres
sion of agreement to commit an of
fense like an illegal protest demonst
ration, even though the person
never took part in the assembly.
Section 1003 would create a new
and elastic federal crime of criminal
solicitation, saying that "a person is
guilty of an offense if, with intent
that another person engage in con
duct constituting a crime, and, in
fact, under circumstances strongly
indicative of that intent, he com
mands, entreats, induces or other
wise endeavors to persuade such
person to engage in such conduct."
The language is so broad that a
person could be subjected to crimi
nal prosecution for engaging in a dis
cussion of political action that later
might result in the commission of a
federal offense.
Section 1323, on tampering with a
witness or informant, would extend
this crime to include "any other act
with intent to improperly influence,
or obstruct or impair" the administ
ration of any law or the conduct of a
legislative inquiry.
The right of persons to organize
any effective opposition to an official
proceeding would depend on a pro
secutor's definition of "improperly"
and "impair," and the words would
mean wlv:t a prosecutor decided
they meant.
Another new offense
Section 1861 would create another
new federal offense. Under this sec
tion, it would be unlawful to fail to
obey a public-safety order given in
response to a fire, flood, riot "or
other condition that creates a risk of
serious injury to a person or serious
damage to property."
This seems like a sensible mea
sure, but the power to issue such an
order would be vested in "any fed
eral employe," and, moreover,
would extend anywhere in the Un
ited States.
The law could cover a picket line, a
parade or any public gathering that
any petty government official de
cided was a threat to public safety.
The dangers of such autocratic
power so broadly conferred are ob
vious.

If the nation has learned anything
from the disclosures of offenses
committed against constitutional rights
by the FBI and other powerful federal
agencies, it is this: Their authority
must be carefully defined and cauti
ously circumscribed. Yet S 1437
would greatly expand that authority.
A significant example is Section
1343, which says that a citizen is
guilty of a crime if, "in a government
matter," he makes "a material oral
statement that is false" to "a law
enforcement officer" or to an official
"assigned investigative responsibil
ity."
The possibilities are enormous for
harassment of investigative targets
by federal agents. A person could be
subjected to criminal prosecution on
the word alone of any federal
employe engaged in law enforce
ment, and the outcome would likely
turn on the citizen's word against the
official's word.
S 1437 would reaffirm the govern
ment's authority to impose "use"
immunity on witnesses testifying be
fore grand juries and other official
bodies. This forces a witness to sur
render his right to refuse to testify
under the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.

used against him in a criminal pro
