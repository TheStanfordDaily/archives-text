# Serious problems with nuclear power
##

The past several months have seen
nationwide protest against nuclear
power plants including a large de
monstration at the Diablo Canyon
Plant near San Luis Obispo (about
250 miles south of here). The Diablo
plant contains 86 tons, of nuclear
material and will produce 2200
megawatts of power when operating
at full capacity.
This plant, which PG&E hopes to
bring on-line this autumn, is located
2Vj miles from an active earthquake
fault discovered in 1969. This poses a
major safety question for this particu
lar plant, but there are many addi
tional serious problems with nuclear
power in general.
First, a large nuclear reactor con
tains an immense amount of radioac

tive material which, if released,
could cause tens of thousands of
deaths and cause billions of dollars
worth of damage. A substantial re
lease is physically possible and
would create unprecedented cajas
trophe.
Nuclear power plants are very
large, complex, high technology
machines that must work perfectly
for long time periods. They must be
maintained and controlled by human
beings, who are fallible.
Accidents have occurred and will
continue to occur just as oil spills
have continued in the growing oil
transport business. And even if the
reactors could be run completely
"fail-safe," this doesn't avoid possi
ble sabotage or terrorist attack.
Second, the hundreds of tons of

toxic radioactive waste produced by
nuclear power plants must be iso
lated from the environment for hun
dreds of years. Some of the wastes
take 250,000 years to decay to a safe
level. There is still no known way to
safely transport and then contain
these wastes for the time required.
Third, nuclear power plants are
costly . . . much more costly than
conservation. Nuclear power is very
capital-intensive, providing jobs for
only a handful of people in the heavy
construction and nuclear power in
dustries. Other energy alternatives
would be better for our economy.
Must we let nuclear plants con
tinue to proliferate? The fact is that
the use of nuclear power is not
necessary. If we concentrate on re
ducing our personal and industrial

energy consumption, we can happily
survive with more acceptable energy
sources. Some of the most effective
conservation measures do not alter
our lifestyles at all; others require
minimal effort.
Sweden maintains a living stan
dard comparable to the U.S., using
only 60 per cent the energy. In con
trast, even the most hopeful propo
nents of nuclear power only see it
supplying 60 per cent of our electri
cal energy demand by the year 2000.
Two Lawrence-Berkeley Laborat
ory researchers who studied energy
conservation measures have con
cluded that a few simple changes in
home cooking, water heating, and
cooling appliances could save sub
stantial amounts of power.
For example, new building insula
tion standards and improvements in
the efficiency of air conditioners in
California could save 2200 megawatts
of peak power generation annually
within 10 years. This is equivalent to
two very large nuclear plants operat
ing at full capacity.
Solar water heaters could econom
ically replace electric water heaters
(which now comprise half the water
heaters in the country) in every state
in the U.S.,according to a recent gov
ernment report.
The health, ecological, and
economic dangers associated with
nuclear power are too great for it to
be implemented as our "last resort"
power source when we do have via
ble alternatives.
Nuclear power will be advocated
by the utilities and nuclear power in
dustries until the public takes it upon
itself to say: "We will not have nuc
lear power! We will conserve what
we have first!"

lated from the environment for hun
dreds of years. Some of the wastes
take 250,000 years to decay to a safe
level. There is still no known way to
safely transport and then contain
these wastes for the time required.
Third, nuclear power plants are
costly . . . much more costly than
conservation. Nuclear power is very
capital-intensive, providing jobs for
only a handful of people in the heavy
construction and nuclear power in
dustries. Other energy alternatives
would be better for our economy.
Must we let nuclear plants con
tinue to proliferate? The fact is that
the use of nuclear power is not
necessary. If we concentrate on re
ducing our personal and industrial

energy consumption, we can happily
survive with more acceptable energy
sources. Some of the most effective
conservation measures do not alter
our lifestyles at all; others require
minimal effort.
Sweden maintains a living stan
dard comparable to the U.S., using
only 60 per cent the energy. In con
trast, even the most hopeful propo
nents of nuclear power only see it
supplying 60 per cent of our electri
cal energy demand by the year 2000.
Two Lawrence-Berkeley Laborat
ory researchers who studied energy
conservation measures have con
cluded that a few simple changes in
home cooking, water heating, and
cooling appliances could save sub
stantial amounts of power.
For example, new building insula
tion standards and improvements in
the efficiency of air conditioners in
California could save 2200 megawatts
of peak power generation annually
within 10 years. This is equivalent to
two very large nuclear plants operat
ing at full capacity.
Solar water heaters could econom
ically replace electric water heaters
(which now comprise half the water
heaters in the country) in every state
in the U.S.,according to a recent gov
ernment report.
The health, ecological, and
economic dangers associated with
nuclear power are too great for it to
be implemented as our "last resort"
power source when we do have via
ble alternatives.
Nuclear power will be advocated
by the utilities and nuclear power in
dustries until the public takes it upon
itself to say: "We will not have nuc
lear power! We will conserve what
we have first!"

The past several months have seen
nationwide protest against nuclear
power plants including a large de
monstration at the Diablo Canyon
Plant near San Luis Obispo (about
250 miles south of here). The Diablo
plant contains 86 tons, of nuclear
material and will produce 2200
megawatts of power when operating
at full capacity.
This plant, which PG&E hopes to
bring on-line this autumn, is located
2Vj miles from an active earthquake
fault discovered in 1969. This poses a
major safety question for this particu
lar plant, but there are many addi
tional serious problems with nuclear
power in general.
First, a large nuclear reactor con
tains an immense amount of radioac

tive material which, if released,
could cause tens of thousands of
deaths and cause billions of dollars
worth of damage. A substantial re
lease is physically possible and
would create unprecedented cajas
trophe.
Nuclear power plants are very
large, complex, high technology
machines that must work perfectly
for long time periods. They must be
maintained and controlled by human
beings, who are fallible.
Accidents have occurred and will
continue to occur just as oil spills
have continued in the growing oil
transport business. And even if the
reactors could be run completely
"fail-safe," this doesn't avoid possi
ble sabotage or terrorist attack.
Second, the hundreds of tons of

toxic radioactive waste produced by
nuclear power plants must be iso
lated from the environment for hun
dreds of years. Some of the wastes
take 250,000 years to decay to a safe
level. There is still no known way to
safely transport and then contain
