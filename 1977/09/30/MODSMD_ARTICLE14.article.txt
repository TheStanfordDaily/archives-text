# Elvin Bishop and Chuck Berry
## 
### 
ASSU Special Events will present Elvin Bishop
and Chuck Berry at the first outdoor concert of
the year in Frost Amphitheatre Sunday.
Bishop, a long-time Bay Area favorite, will
rock the campus with his own wild and wolly
guitar sounds. More a performer than a record
ing artist, Bishop is famous for concerts which
bring down the house.
Chuck Berry, one of the premier figures in
rock and roll, is still riding high from a long
string of hits in the'sos and early '60s, including
"Roll Over Beethoven," "Johnny B. Goode,"
and others.
Many rock greats of later generations owe
much to Berry's pioneering, including The Bea
tles, The Rolling Stones and others.
Tickets are $5.50 for Stanford students, $6.50
general admission, and $7.50 the day of the
show, and are available at Tresidder, BASS and
TEL-ETIX. The show begins at 1 p.m., and will
also feature Stoneground.
