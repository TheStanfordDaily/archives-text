# Oswald special: a warning
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
If you happen to see ABC's "Trial of Lee Har
vey Oswald" tonight and Sunday, remind your
self it only is an entertainment show, a morbid
one, but definitely not a news show.
And frequently remind yourself, for each
show only does it once, that Oswald never was
tried for the 196.3 assassination of President John
F. Kennedy, having been shot dead by a guy
named Jack Ruby.
Tell yourself it's only a "docudrama," a hybrid
program form in which fact often is blurred with
fiction, surmise and speculation, a form that
rapidly is becoming a blight on television.
"Trial" is the worst of the lot. It so thoroughly
mixes history with hypothesis on such an impor
tant subject that ABC should have its corporate
head candled for ever airing the thing.
• This $2.5 million exercise tries to hook you
immediately. Its first scene is of Oswald — excel
lently played by John Pleshette — in an isolation
cage, awaiting the verdict of his 43-day "trial."
ABC, to hype the program, refused to show
Sunday's "verdict" in advance to reviewers.
Don't get any idea "Trial" unfolds in
chronological order, sets a clear line between

recreated reality and courtroom invention. It
bobs and weA'es, mixes it all up, during its
two-night, four-hour trip.
The assassination in Dallas, complete with
crowd cries of "I think it (gunfire) came from the
grassy knoll," is effectively, chillingly recreated,
as is the killing of officer J.D. Tippitt and Os
wald's capture.
But there's nothing real in the scenes of Ben
Gazarra as an ambitious, ambiguous pro
secutor, or where Lome Greene, Ponderosa
tonsils akimbo, heads the defense team for Os
wald.
The show seems weighted on the side of con
spiracy, any conspiracy. So Greene logs much
time chasing reports of assassination involve
ment by the Mafia, the CIA, the FBI, Russia and
anti-Castro Cubans.
Gazarra should do likewise. But in one scene
— and no evidence even suggests it ever hap
pened — President Johnson phones him and in
effect orders him not to go conspiracy-chasing.
CBS News exhaustively studied such suspi
cions and, in a 1975 documentary, said it could
find no proof of any conspiracy, no evidence
that Oswald didn't act alone in killing Kennedy.
