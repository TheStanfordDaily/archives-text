# Ford, Reagan heads GOP confab agenda

San Diego (AP) — California
Republicans have a familiar
agenda for their fall conven
tion beginning today — Gerald
Ford, Ronald Reagan and a dis
pute over the Panama Canal.
The former president and his
chief rival for the presidential
nomination in 1976 have
turned the routine fall conven
tion of the state party into a
full-scale political ex
travaganza.
Also on the agenda are GOP
national chairman Bill Brock,
U.S. Sens. S.I. Hayakawa of
California and Paul Laxalt of
Nevada and all five contenders
for the 1978 Republican nomi-*
nation for governor.
But the dispute over Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's Panama
Canal treaty could spark the
most interest. And a Republi
can whose face may be seen
often is President Theodore
Roosevelt, appearing on
thousands of "Save Our
Canal" buttons and posters.
Some conservatives — angry
at Ford for endorsing the treaty
to give Panama control of the
canal — say they will boycott
the Ford dinner tomorrow.
"There will obviously be
some anti-Ford lobbying going
on, but it's not going to be vit
riolic. We're not going to dis
rupt anything," said James
Lacey, state chairman of Young
Americans for Freedom.

Others are circulating peti
tions on the canal addressed to
Hayakawa, who has said he still
has not made a final decision
on whether to vote to ratify the
treaty.
Some Young Americans for
Freedom also plan to flood the
convention with 4000
brochures and 1000 or more
buttons condemning San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
convention host and a candi
date for governor, as a dis
guised liberal.
Wilson and Fresno Assemb
lyman Ken Maddy are waging
an especially tough battle for
dominance of the moderate
wing of the party.
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed
Davis and state Sen. John
Briggs of Anaheim are con
tending for conservative sup
port, and Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger is trying to build a
conservative-moderate coali
tion.
Normally the state COP's fall
convention is a low-keyed
event that attracts only a
couple hundred of the most
dedicated party members for
work sessions on party affairs.
But the lineup of national
and state GOP stars and a po
tentially explosive battle over
the Panama Canal have at
tracted an advance registration
of nearly 3000 delegates and al
ternates.
