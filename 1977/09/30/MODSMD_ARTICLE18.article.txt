# Bill to curb drugs at prison vetoed
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — A bill
placing strict curbs on the
drugging of prisoners has been
vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown,
who says present state restric
tions are strong enough.
The measure, AB 16 by As
semblyman Richard Alatorre
(D-Los Angeles) would have
required an independent
psychiatrist outside the prison
system to certify in many cases
that an inmate needed to be
given strong tranquilizers.
Brown said yesterday that
the bill was "unnecessarily re
strictive." He also cited regula
tions by his Department of
Corrections, which runs the
prison system, restricting the
use of tranquilizers on in
mates.

However, a consultant to
Alatorre's Select Committee
on Corrections, which drafted
the bill, claimed the regula
tions were not enforced at
many prisons.
The consultant, Daniel Cas
tro, contended the real reason
for the veto was that the De
partment of Corrections, al
ready plagued by publicized
morale problems, faced a staff
revolt if the bill was signed.
"The department was worry
ing that the staff might quit,"
Castro said.
Department spokesman
Walter Barkdull said the de
partment supported the bill,
but said many employes, par
ticularly doctors in the state's
medical prison at Vacaville,

opposed it. He said he wasn't
aware that anyone had
threatened to quit, however.
The bill stemmed from hear
ings of Alatorre's committee at
which some witnesses said that
prisoners who weren't men
tally ill were being drugged to
control their behavior or dis
cipline them.
However, a state
commissioned task force
which visited the prisons later
said it found no evidence that
tranquilizers were being used
for any purpose but medical
treatment. Brown cited the
task force report in his veto
message.
Barkdull also denied that
state prisons "engage in the
practice of medicating people
for administrative control."
