# Despite diet, hygiene
## Hormones may cause acne 
### Jill Liscom 
If you have been scrubbing
your face diligently and
painstakingly avoiding eating
chocolate to clear up acne,
your efforts may have been
useless.
According to Dr. Robert
Roth, a Modesto dermatologist
and clinical assistant professor
of dermatology here, hygiene
and a selective diet are not the
important factors in treating
acne.
Roth says he believes acne
may be caused by oversecre

tion of oil resulting from hor
monal stimulation of the oil
glands. A bacteria found in hair
follicles may break down this
oil to produce fatty acids.
Roth explained that
whiteheads are clumps of fatty
acids and shed skin cells. Blac
kheads, which are open to the
air, may be caused by the fatty
acids oxidizing when exposed
to air.
Whiteheads and blackheads
are basically non
inflammatory, said Roth. If the
hair follicle ruptures, spilling
its contents into surrounding
tissue, it can cause more ad
vanced stages of acne, such as
pimples, cysts, or other in
flammations.
Roth also warned against
squeezing or pinching
whiteheads and blackheads.
"Although infection is not very
likely, the pressure can cause
the hair follicle to rupture," he
remarked.
Roth currently feels acne can
be treated by removing the
clumps of fats and bacteria
from the skin through the use
of vitamin A, called "retin A,"
or killing the bacteria with an
antibiotic.
"Retin A is the only agent
applied to the skin which does
prevent blackhead and
whitehead formation," com
mented Roth.
Roth said he is doing clinical
studies by following the prog
ress of his patients over a sev
eral month period to deter

mine if antibiotics could be
more effective if applied di
rectly to the skin rather than
taken orally.
Research is also being done
by Dr. Marvin Karasek, as
sociate professor of
biochemistry in dermatology,
to study the metabolism of
sebaceous glands, which are
associated with acne.
Karasek said that from his
study, which began about a
year ago, he has determined
that cells from sebaceous
glands can be isolated and
maintained in a cell culture.
"These cells respond to a
variety of hormones,"
explained Karasek, "and acne
occurs when there is an hor
monal imbalance."
Karasek pointed out that it is
difficult to find a specific cause
for acne because researchers
are "limited in experimenta
tion.
"There is no effective animal
model that has the disease,"
said Karasek. "This has been a
major problem in trying to de
termine a cause."
Karasek's present research
involves studying sebaceous
glands obtained from human
and animal skin in order to un
derstand how these glands
normally function. Ultimately,
he plans to compare the glands
to those of acne sufferers to
establish what the abnor
malities are in the glands of pa
tients with acne.

occurs when there is an hor
monal imbalance."
Karasek pointed out that it is
difficult to find a specific cause
for acne because researchers
are "limited in experimenta
tion.
"There is no effective animal
model that has the disease,"
said Karasek. "This has been a
major problem in trying to de
termine a cause."
Karasek's present research
involves studying sebaceous
glands obtained from human
and animal skin in order to un
derstand how these glands
normally function. Ultimately,
he plans to compare the glands
to those of acne sufferers to
establish what the abnor
malities are in the glands of pa
tients with acne.

According to Dr. Robert
Roth, a Modesto dermatologist
and clinical assistant professor
of dermatology here, hygiene
and a selective diet are not the
important factors in treating
acne.
Roth says he believes acne
may be caused by oversecre

tion of oil resulting from hor
monal stimulation of the oil
glands. A bacteria found in hair
follicles may break down this
oil to produce fatty acids.
Roth explained that
whiteheads are clumps of fatty
acids and shed skin cells. Blac
kheads, which are open to the
air, may be caused by the fatty
acids oxidizing when exposed
to air.
Whiteheads and blackheads
are basically non
inflammatory, said Roth. If the
hair follicle ruptures, spilling
its contents into surrounding
tissue, it can cause more ad
vanced stages of acne, such as
pimples, cysts, or other in
flammations.
Roth also warned against
squeezing or pinching
whiteheads and blackheads.
"Although infection is not very
likely, the pressure can cause
the hair follicle to rupture," he
remarked.
Roth currently feels acne can
be treated by removing the
clumps of fats and bacteria
from the skin through the use
of vitamin A, called "retin A,"
or killing the bacteria with an
antibiotic.
"Retin A is the only agent
applied to the skin which does
prevent blackhead and
whitehead formation," com
mented Roth.
Roth said he is doing clinical
studies by following the prog
ress of his patients over a sev
eral month period to deter

mine if antibiotics could be
more effective if applied di
rectly to the skin rather than
taken orally.
Research is also being done
by Dr. Marvin Karasek, as
sociate professor of
biochemistry in dermatology,
to study the metabolism of
sebaceous glands, which are
associated with acne.
Karasek said that from his
study, which began about a
year ago, he has determined
that cells from sebaceous
glands can be isolated and
maintained in a cell culture.
"These cells respond to a
variety of hormones,"
explained Karasek, "and acne
occurs when there is an hor
monal imbalance."
