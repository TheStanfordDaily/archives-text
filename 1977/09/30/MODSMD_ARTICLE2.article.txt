# New synchrotron lab
## Research facility set up here

Provost William Miller recently
announced the creation of a new na
tional research facility, the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL).
Synchrotron radiation is a very in
tense x-ray or ultra-violet radiation
that may be used for a great variety of
experimental purposes, including
energy research.
SSRL will make use of the radiation
produced in SPEAR, the storage ring
for the Stanford Linear Accelerator
(SLAC), according to Arthur
Bienenstock who will become direc
tor of the new facility on Jan. 1.
SPEAR was developed by SLAC
Prof. Burton Richter, last year's win
ner of the Nobel Prize in physics. Ac
cording to Bienenstock, SPEAR pro
duces radiation uniquely suitable to
the purposes of SSRL.
Synchrotron is not a new concept,
however. The idea originated over2o
years ago, and many places have fine
synchrotron facilities, according to

Bienenstock,
"In fact," said Bicnenstock, "the
Russians devote many more re
sources than we have" to their syn
chrotron projects.
The resources that the National
Science Foundation, SSRL's funding
agency, will provide the project in
clude a current operating budget of
$800,000, which is expected to reach
$4,000,000 after expansion of the
facilities, and a construction budget
of $6.7 million, said Bienenstock.
During the time of expansion, ap
proximately 3-5 years, the number of
scientists working on 100 active ex
periments will expand from 200 to
400-500 scientists working on about
300 active experiments.
According to Bienenstock, there is
a chance that SSRL, as did SLAC, will
play a part in drawing more distin
guished faculty to the University.
According to Bienenstock, the
facility operates in the following
manner:
The SLAC accelerates electrons to

very high energy levels. The elec
trons then enter SPEAR where mag
nets draw them into a nearly circular
orbit. Because the orbit in SPEAR is
particularly stable, the radiation pro
duced by the accelerating electrons
is very useful. It is therefore piped
from SPEAR by beam ports into SSRL
where it is used for a variety of exper
iments.
For instance, the x-ray produced in
SPEAR is up to several million times
More intense than conventional
x-rays and can be used to study
atomic arrangements of elements in
their natural state, whereas most ob

servations must be done on crystals
which have an artifically well ordered
arrangement.
SSRL can therefore be used to
study catalysts which can have the
effect of making materials such as
crude oil more efficient and thus are
very important in energy research.
Bienenstock also said he sees the
possibility of medical uses for syn
chrotron radiation and plans to
speak to members of the medical
school about that.
The ultra-violet rays of SSRL are
useful in studying the arrangements
of atoms on surfaces.

study catalysts which can have the
effect of making materials such as
crude oil more efficient and thus are
very important in energy research.
Bienenstock also said he sees the
possibility of medical uses for syn
chrotron radiation and plans to
speak to members of the medical
school about that.
The ultra-violet rays of SSRL are
useful in studying the arrangements
of atoms on surfaces.

beam line.
Provost William Miller recently
announced the creation of a new na
tional research facility, the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL).
Synchrotron radiation is a very in
tense x-ray or ultra-violet radiation
that may be used for a great variety of
experimental purposes, including
energy research.
SSRL will make use of the radiation
produced in SPEAR, the storage ring
for the Stanford Linear Accelerator
(SLAC), according to Arthur
Bienenstock who will become direc
tor of the new facility on Jan. 1.
SPEAR was developed by SLAC
Prof. Burton Richter, last year's win
ner of the Nobel Prize in physics. Ac
cording to Bienenstock, SPEAR pro
duces radiation uniquely suitable to
the purposes of SSRL.
Synchrotron is not a new concept,
however. The idea originated over2o
years ago, and many places have fine
synchrotron facilities, according to

Bienenstock,
"In fact," said Bicnenstock, "the
Russians devote many more re
sources than we have" to their syn
chrotron projects.
The resources that the National
Science Foundation, SSRL's funding
agency, will provide the project in
clude a current operating budget of
$800,000, which is expected to reach
$4,000,000 after expansion of the
facilities, and a construction budget
of $6.7 million, said Bienenstock.
During the time of expansion, ap
proximately 3-5 years, the number of
scientists working on 100 active ex
periments will expand from 200 to
400-500 scientists working on about
300 active experiments.
According to Bienenstock, there is
a chance that SSRL, as did SLAC, will
play a part in drawing more distin
guished faculty to the University.
According to Bienenstock, the
facility operates in the following
manner:
The SLAC accelerates electrons to

very high energy levels. The elec
trons then enter SPEAR where mag
nets draw them into a nearly circular
orbit. Because the orbit in SPEAR is
particularly stable, the radiation pro
duced by the accelerating electrons
is very useful. It is therefore piped
from SPEAR by beam ports into SSRL
where it is used for a variety of exper
iments.
For instance, the x-ray produced in
SPEAR is up to several million times
More intense than conventional
x-rays and can be used to study
atomic arrangements of elements in
their natural state, whereas most ob

servations must be done on crystals
which have an artifically well ordered
arrangement.
SSRL can therefore be used to
study catalysts which can have the
effect of making materials such as
crude oil more efficient and thus are
very important in energy research.
