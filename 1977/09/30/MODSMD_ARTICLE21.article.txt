# Brown approves pay raise

Sacramento (AP) â€”The first pay raises in eight
years for top state elected officials have been
approved by Gov. Jerry Brown, who axed cost
of-living boosts in the measure.
The bill, signed shortly before midnight Tues
day, grants one-time pay raises of $2831 to $7500
a year to 10 top elected officials, excluding the
governor, beginning January 1979.
The 39-year-old bachelor governor dropped
opposition to the measure SB 884 by Sen. Albert
Rodda (D-Sacramento), when the author de
leted an increase for the governor.
Brown refused to accept a pay raise approved
before he became governor in 1975, leaving him
at $49,100 a year.
The pay raises affect the attorney general,

lieutenant governor, controller, treasurer, sec
retary of state, superintendent of public instruc
tion and members of the Board of Equalization.
Brown vetoed a section of the bill which
would have granted annual cost-of-living raises
of up to five per cent in future years to the same
10 elected officials, plus the governor.
"It is not needed," the governor explained
simply.
The new pay scales raise the attorney gener
al's salary by $5000 to $47,500 and boost salaries
for the lieutenant governor, secretary of state,
controller, treasurer and superintendent of
public instruction by $7500 each to $42,500.
The chairman of the Board of Equalization
gets a $2831 raise to $38,500 and members of the
board are raised $4034 each to $38,000.
