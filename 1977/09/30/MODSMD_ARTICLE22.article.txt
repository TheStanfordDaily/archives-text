# Cambodia flirts with Red China

### 
Tokyo (AP) — China's ardent,
and sometimes frustrated, wo
oing of little Cambodia, begun
seven years ago by the late
Premier Chou En-lai, appears
finally to have paid off.
The arrival Wednesday in
Peking of a high-powered
Cambodian government-
Communist party delegation,
headed by new Premier Pol
Pot, has taken on more the
trappings of a love feast than of
a state visit.
When the Chinese want to
show their friendship for a val
ued friend, they turn out hun
dreds of schoolchildren and
dance and music groups to
welcome him at the airport.
Wednesday's reception
went far beyond that, judging

from Chinese and other news
reports reaching here from
Peking.
Not only did most of the
leadership, led by Chairman
Hua Kuo-feng, show up to
meet the delegation, but this
was followed by a massive,
noisy turnout of 100,000 in the
capital's Tien An Men Square.
At a state banquet, both Pol
Pot and Hua exceeded them
selves in Old World politeness
and praise. The Cambodian in
sisted on addressing Hua and
all four of the Chinese party
vice chairmen as "respected
and beloved," an exuberance
seldom matched by other vis
itors.
But what seemed to confirm
China's long-term policy has
succeeded was Pol Pot's decla
ration that his country had, for
the past two years, imitated
China — the sincerest compli
ment of all.
More exactly, he said, "in
the concrete revolutionary
struggle of our country, we
have creatively and success
fully applied Mao Tse-tung
thought, from the time we had
only empty hands down to
April 17, 1975" — the day the
Cambodian Communists, who
now call their country Democ
ratic Kampuchea, defeated the
U.S.-backed regime in Phnom
Penh.
