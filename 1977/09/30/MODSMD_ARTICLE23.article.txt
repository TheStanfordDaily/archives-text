# Bill could lead to new nuke plant

### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” A bill
which could lead to construc
tion of the Sundesert nuclear
power plant with exemption
from California's nuclear safety
laws has been signed by Gov.
Jerry Brown.
The Democratic governor,
who has critically questioned
the growth of the nuclear in
dustry, signed the bill without
comment, his office said yes
terday.
The bill, AB 1852 by Assemb
lyman Alister McAlister (D-San
Jose) sets a procedure for pos
sible exemption by the Legisla
ture next spring of San Diego
Gas & Electric Co.'s planned
$2.3-billion Sundesert plant
near Blythe.
The California laws have
clamped a de facto moratorium
on new nuclear power plant
construction in California.
Frank DeVore, a SDG&E vice
president, has testified that the
utility needed AB 1852 because
regulatory uncertainty caused
by the laws jeopardizes the
project.
DeVore said $100 million al
ready has been spent on the
project and further financing
could evaporate without a cer
tain date when the project
could be approved or rejected.
SDG&E plans to start
generating electricity from the
first reactor in 1984.
