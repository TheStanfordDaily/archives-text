The Economics Department
here stiffened its bachelor de
gree requirements this year in
order to conform to the new
degree standards set this
summer.
Each student who now de
clares Economics as a major
must take 10 units in a field of
study that complements the
student's work in Economics.
Students must also take 10
units of quantitative courses
such as Economics 90 , 91, 170,
171, 172, 180, 181; any
mathematics course num
bered 5 or above; or any opera
tions research or statistics
courses, according to an
economics memo posted out
side the department office.
The change was made to
conform to the new under
graduate degree requirements
stipulated in Courses and De
grees. The guidelines said a

degree major should occupy at
least one-third (55-65 units) of
the student's program.
Second, the student should
achieve a "breadth and explo
ration" here, by filling about
two-thirds (115-125 units) of his
or her program with other
fields of study.
Finally the University felt that
no more than one-third of the
student's program should be in
any one department.
Economics students must
still complete 45 units of work
within the department.
Students who declared
economics as a major before
the beginning of fall quarter
are unaffected by the change.
The Economics Department,
which altered its degree re
quirements July 1, 1977, was
the only department that had
to tighten up its program fol
lowing the new degree major
specifications.
