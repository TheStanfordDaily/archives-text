Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. Jerry
Brown got pats on the back
from both law-and-order
proponents and liberal groups
Monday as he signed a diverse
group of bills.
"The bills I am signing today

are aimed at improving the
urban climate in Los Angeles
and throughout California,"
Brown said at a ceremony at an
airport hotel.
The 11 bills deal with sub
jects ranging from mandatory
sentencing and child pornog
raphy to unemployment be
nefits for parolees,and redlin
ing, the practice of denying
housing loans to otherwise
credit-worthy applicants from
poor neighborhoods.
The first part of the cere
mony was devoted to the red
lining bill, which prohibits all
state-licensed financial institu
tions from refusing mortgage
and home improvement loans
to individuals with good credit
simply because the home is in a
poor neighborhood.
The bill, intended to encour
age rehabilitation in inner-city
areas, applies to both owner
occupants and landlords who
purchase homes with the in
tention of making improve
ments.
Redlining, which got its
name from the banking prac
tice of marking red lines on
maps around areas for which
housing loans were denied,
was outlawed in 1976 for state
licensed savings and loan as
sociations only.

"We're not saying 'make a
bad loan,' but we are saying
'give a loan to decent people
no matter where they live,' "
Brown said as he signed SB 7,
sponsored by Sen. Nate Hol
den (D-Culver City).
Holden and the public
interest group representatives
surrounding Brown during
signing of the redlining bill
then left and were replaced for
the second part of the cere
mony by legal and law
enforcement officials, includ
ing Los Angeles Dist. Atty. John
Van De Kamp and City Atty.
Burt Pines.
However, Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley remained
at Brown's side during both
parts of the ceremony.
Two of the law and order
bills extend the practice of
mandatory sentencing first in
troduced by Brown two years
ago for persons convicted of
crimes committed with a gun
and heroin sellers.
SB 370 by Sen. George
Deukmejian (R-Long Beach)
requires a prison term for as
sault of an elderly, blind or
handicapped person, and SB
518, by Sen. John Holmdahl
(D-Castro Valley) applies to
parolees who commit violent
crimes while on parole.
