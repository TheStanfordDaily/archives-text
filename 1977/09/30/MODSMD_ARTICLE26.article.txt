# Bridge group teaches coping

How do you feel?
If you are like most of us, you
don't feel great all the time. In
fact, some of the time,
everyone feels unhappy, un
able to cope, and unaware of
how to deal with those feel
ings. A workshop, offered this
fall at the Bridge, is designed to
help people to be happier and
how to better cope and com
municate with others.
"Successful living is chiefly a
matter of coping with failure;
success is easy to live with,"
explained Mark Draper, work
shop facilitator. Learning to
deal with the gap between po
tential and performance; cop
ing with failure, are some of
the aims of the Tuesday night
workshop, Draper said.
"We are not trying to change
you. We are trying to show you
how to change yourself if you
want to, to give you a real op
tion of taking hold of your life
and learning how to live more
in accord with the way you re
ally want to," commented
Draper.
The challenge of effective

ness training revolves around a
choice to get out of the more
is-better, overachievement
spiral and to get in touch with
realistic achievement goals.
"Happiness training might
be a good way to designate
what we do. We can't make
you happy but we can help you
learn to become happier if that
is what you want," Draper said.
He feels that happiness is a
learnable skill.
Draper described himself: "I
am a k .! af failure consultant.
I know about failure in a
deeply, intimate way." The
thrust of effectiveness training
is a positive, sharing, small
group experience. It is a
dynamic orientation towards
life that goes beyond just cop
ing, v :t h people, failure or
yourself," Draper said.
Learning concrete life man
agement and communication
skills is the foundation for the
7:30 workshop at the Bridge,
640 Campus Drive. The em
phasis in the 10-week work
shop is on improving com
munication with others and
within oneself.
