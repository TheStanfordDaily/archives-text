## Black enrollment uncertain 
### Bill Sievert 
Pacific News Service â€” A
year ago, 17-year-old Andrew
Cray, eldest of four children of
a black, middle-class family in
Richmond, was certain
he'd be enrolling in college
this fall. By November he duti
fully had sent off applications
to the University of California
at Davis and less prestigious
Hayward State University "just
in case my grades aren't hot
enough for U.C."
Last spring, Andrew received
rejection notices from both
campuses, a result of his
B-minus grades and an unim
pressive score on his College
entrance exams.
His confidence shaken, he
briefly flirted with a plan to
apply to predominantly black
Central State College in Ohio.
But, he concluded, "it would
cost too much to live away
from home."
A last-ditch plan to attend a
local two-year community col
lege caved in by mid-August.
"I'm joining the Navy," he an
nounced. "A community col
lege would be like two more
years of high school. Besides, I
want some dollars in my poc
ket. The Navy will teach me

computer programming or
something, and they'll pay me.
I can always go to college la
ter."
Maybe. But, like many other
black Americans of college
age, Andrew Gray won't be
heading off to campus this fall.
And that has more than a few
black educators worried.
Doors closing
After a decade of increased
educational opportunities won
through the civil rights strug
gles of the 19605, the doors to
higher education for blacks
seem to be slamming shut
again.
The Census Bureau recently
reported that, as of last fall,
blacks comprised 10.7 per cent
of all American college stu
dents, more than double the
4.6 per cent level of 1966.
But black educators are
charging that the statistics are
misleading. They point to
another statistic in the same
Census Bureau report: the
number of black students
showed no increase between
the 1975 and 1976 academic
years.
Dropping percentages
In fact, the federal Office for
Civil Rights reported last year

that the percentage of under
graduate minority students ac
tually dropped in seven states
between 1972 and 1974, the last
year for which full statistics are
available.
Of even greater concern, the
educators point out that black
students are disproportion
ately represented in two-year
community colleges and trade
schools, while they remain
drastically underrepresented
in the more selective four-year
institutions.
And, as a result of the con
troversial Bakke decision of the
California State Supreme
Court (now under appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court) to
end the University of Califor
nia's special admissions prog
ram for minorities, the number
of blacks applying to the pre
stigious schools of law and
medicine has "declined drasti
cally," according to university
officials.
U.C.-Berkeley sociologist
Harry Edwards, a black profes
sor who recently won a conten
tious battle for tenure, notes
that educational obstacles for
minorities persist even in the
highest ranks of academe. His
research reveals that the

number of blacks on the uni
versity faculty is declining gen
erally.
Such statistics led the Na
tional Association for Equal
Opportunity in Higher Educa
tion (NAEOHE), an organiza
tion of some 500 black college
leaders, to warn that, for a vari
ety of reasons, "our educa
tional process is eroding."
A major reason cited by the
group is the mounting political
pressure to provide more fi
nancial aid to students from
middle-class families, while
reducing the funds available to
lower-income students, many
of whom are black.
Black students, the group
charges, are systematically
being "tracked" into cheap
community colleges and
trade-oriented schools, while
prestigious four-year colleges
remain as "elite" institutions
for middle- and upper-class
whites.
"The real issue of access is
not who goes to college, but
who goes to college where,"
says Alexander W. Astin, pro
fessor of education at UCLA
and author of "The Myth of
Equal Access in Public Higher
Education."
