I transferred from U.C. Berkeley this quarter,
where most any evening one can find frustrated
mountain climbers scaling the buildings on
campus.
What's the story on building climbing at Stan
ford?

If you keep your eyes open as you walk
around certain areas of the Quad, you will in
deed find climbers practicing, or at least evi
dence of them having there there. Look for
chalk marking on some of the sandstone build
ings — that's a good sign that climbers have
been practicing there.
A few years ago, the Stanford Alpine Club
published a pamphlet called, "Mountaineering
at Stanford —The Freedom of the Quad." In this
pamphlet were detailed many of the climbing
"routes" at Stanford (e.g. the history corner
climb, the chem building traverse, etc.). The
pamphlet even included dates and names for
first ascents (when possible). I'm not sure if this
brochure is still being printed, but if you're in
terested, just contact Jim Collins and the Alpine
Club.
Personally, I know of a successful rappel
down the south side of Hoover Tower that oc
curred three years ago. So, just about anything
is possible here on the Farm.

Who lives in the large white house directly
across from the new American Studies House??
It's a beautiful house and it's right along the row

of fraternities - what's the story?
-LM
Mathematics Prof. Harold Bacon and his wife
live in the stately manor which is adjacent to the
Beta House. Now an emeritus professor of
mathematics, Bacon said, "I've been living there
since 1930."

I would like to know the name of Quick Draw
McCraw's pet dog (not Baba-Looey). The answer
to this enigmatic query has eluded even the
most avid of media freaks.
-Captain "Hawkeye" Pierce
Well, sorry to say, but this has eluded even the
Bug. Perhaps you readers could help — anyone
know the name of this dog (I think it used to float
in the air every time it received a biscuit)?
