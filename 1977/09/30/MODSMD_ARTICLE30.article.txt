# Student complaints to the Ombudsman on teaching, equity in grading increased last year

### 
"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.

The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
John O. Goheen Sara G. Stephenson
Ombudsman Assistant to the Ombcidsm*"

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu

What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy

with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
John O. Goheen Sara G. Stephenson
Ombudsman Assistant to the Ombcidsm*"

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are

Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
John O. Goheen Sara G. Stephenson
Ombudsman Assistant to the Ombcidsm*"

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned

their expression.

be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
John O. Goheen Sara G. Stephenson
Ombudsman Assistant to the Ombcidsm*"

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro

office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
John O. Goheen Sara G. Stephenson
Ombudsman Assistant to the Ombcidsm*"

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu

Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
John O. Goheen Sara G. Stephenson
Ombudsman Assistant to the Ombcidsm*"

"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford community from injustices
or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency, from un
necessary delay and complication in administration of Uni
versity rules and regulations, and from inconsistency, un
fairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with University activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and grie
vances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress." (From the Charge to the
Ombudsman, August 1973)
Complaints and problems brought to the office of the
Ombudsman during the past academic year have increased
considerably over previous years. For example, for the aca
demic year 1976-77 the office handled over 400 cases as
compared to 350 cases in 1975-76 and 250 cases in 1974-75.
As usual, the range of problems has varied from those
easily resolved, to the complex, requiring months to resolve.
With one striking exception the number of complaints arising
from the various constituencies of the University has re
mained about the same.
The exception, which accounts for a substantial part of
the total increase, was student expression of dissatisfaction
with the content of courses, teaching, and equity in grading.
These complaints increased from 103 in 1975-76 to 150 in
1976-77. Consequently, student academic grievances became
a major concern of the Ombudsman's Office during the past
year.
The Student Academic Grievance Procedure
Although informal resolution of student academic prob
lems has been a frequent function of the Ombudsman's
office, there are, necessarily, cases in which this proves inef
fective, and students may then be advised to follow the
formal academic procedure established in 1972. Unfortu
nately, as indicated in the Ombudsman's report in 1976, the
procedure is not well understood either by faculty or stu
dents.
The "Peter Cohen case" of last year, however, did serve to
draw public attention to the procedure and to some of the
problems involved in its interpretation. The process, initiated
by Vice-President Miller, is a means by which a student may
appeal an academic grievance that cannot be resolved in
direct confrontation with the professor or instructor.
Under the procedure the student has the right to appeal
to the department chairman; then, if not satisfied, to the
relevant school dean. If not satisfied on this level he may, if a
graduate student, appeal to the dean of Graduate Studies, or,
if an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate studies.
The authority to adjudicate the problem and implement
'he decision has been assigned to the two deans. However,
either party in a dispute may appeal the decision of either
rt«an to the ultimate authorities, the provost, and finally, the
p<esident.
The intent behind this lengthy process is to guarantee
both parties in a dispute a thorough review and a fair resolu
tion of their problems. Although there is no doubt that this
purpose must be fulfilled by any grievance procedure, the
jestion can be raised as to when and at what level in the
p ocess this has been accomplished.
In fact Provost Miller's memorandum of 1972 (Campus
Report, March 8, 1972), assigning the authority to adjudicate
a grievance and implement the decision to the two deans,
merely requires that the matter be reported to him. This
would seem to imply that a sufficient review of the case and
piotection of the parties involved could be achieved at this
point. Further appeal would seem unnecessary and un
desirably cumbersome.
If the present procedure is retained, it is suggested that
the decisions of the deans be made final except in the sense
thjt they are recommendations to the president.
From the point of view oi ihis office the existence of a
student academic grievance procedure is extremely impor
tant, but the present form has proved slow and cumbersome.
Two grievances took over a year to resolve.
In the ideal case, the solution may be achieved through
direct consultation with the professor involved and, if not
resolved at that level, through the chairman of the depart
ment.
Departmental chairmen have recently been assigned the
authority to make such decisions. (This authority, perhaps
implicit in the memorandum of 1972, was made explicit in
Provost Miller's letter of February 28, 1977 to Dean Katcha
dourian and others.) If properly exercised, most student
grievances could probably be resolved at this level.
Both parties to a grievance should, however, be guaran
teed one further step of appeal beyond the departmental
level. Following a practice not uncommon elsewhere, it is
recommended that the final point of appeal be a student
faculty committee with power to review the circumstances
surrounding the grievance and to reach a decision. The com
mittee's action would not be appealable except in the sense
that it is a recommendation to the president.
A principal advantage in this suggested procedure would
be the reduction of the number of levels of appeal and of the
delay involved. Perhaps equally important, the creation of a
student-faculty committee would place the burden of adjudi
cating disputes on representative individuals from the two
;onstituencies involved in student academic grievances, and
in those whose interest the procedure is designed to protect.
The present exclusive reliance on the administrative hier
archy for resolution of grievances places a heavy responsibi
'ity where it does not so clearly belong.
In agreement with Provost Miller's statement that the
grevance procedure should be reexamined, the foregoing
remarks suggest an alternative to the present system. Pro
ceriu'al details would have to be worked out, but there exitts
a model already established—the Stanford Judicial Council.
The Council is, of course, concerned primarily with Honor
Code violations and other student misconduct. A council or
committee on academic grievances could, however, be consti
uted to function in a similar way.
Whatever grievance procedure exists will inevitably raise
Space paid for by News and Publications

the question as to who has the authority to adjudicate and to
implement the decision and under what circumstances. If the
decision is against the student grievant, it is simply a denial of
the validity of his grievance accompanied by an appropriate
explanation. If it is against the instructor, as in the case of a
charge of an unfair or arbitrary action, a much more compli
cated issue arises.
Traditionally the professor has had the final authority
with respect to all matters relevant to his courses. The Fa
culty Handbook (p. 47) clearly assigns this authority to the
professor, and only the most extreme circumstances could
bring this into question. Certainly no grievance procedure
should infringe upon the legitimate exercise of this preroga
tive.
In a recent statement Provost Miller has distinguished
between the legitimate academic functions of the professor
and any action which operates . .unfairly as to a particular
student or students, or violates announced procedures, or
brings nonacademic criteria into the decision. . (Provost
Miller's letter to Dean Katchadourian et al., February 28,
1977).
This statement, made in the context of a change of grade,
clearly applies to other types of student academic grievances.
Any student grievance procedure will require a definition of
the authority on which a ruling against a professor can be
made. The Provost's statement is important because it makes
explicit both the need for clarification of this difficult issue
and indicates the type of professorial or departmental action
that can be grieved.
The Role of the Ombudsman in the Informal Resolution of
Student Academic Grievances.
Most students who bring their academic grievances to this
office have at least prima facie grounds for doing so. Some
cases are easily resolved; the simple intervention of a third
party is often effective in convincing a student that his
grievance is unfounded or in convincing the instructor that
the student has reasonable grounds for complaint.
There are, however, instances where it is not a particular
student questioning the legitimacy of an instructor's action,
but a delegation of students complaining, for example, that a
particular course or course sequence is poorly taught. This
type of grievance may involve professor, teaching assistants,
or even departmental policy.
If the problem has not been discussed with the depart
ment chairman, this office recommends that this be done.
The chairman is informed as to what appears to be the basis
of the problem and is advised to enquire into its validity.
Most chairmen take this kind of group complaint seriously
and try to remedy the situation.
There have been occasions when students, failing to ob
tain a helpful response from the chairman, have presented
their problem to the appropriate school dean—again with the
support of this office. This level of appeal seems to have
worked reasonably well to judge from instances in which the
deans have been asked to intervene.
It is, of course, desirable that student complaints of an
academic nature be settled informally on the level closest to
their origin. The Office of the Ombudsman should and does
foster this whenever possible. Intervention beyond instructor
to chairman or dean has in a few instances been resented.
This is to be expected, but it is a risk that the Ombudsman
must face when the seriousness of the complaint seems to
warrant such action.
Most of the academic complaints coming to this office
have been resolved informally. As mentioned earlier, the
number has increased considerably over the previous year.
There is evidence, however, that many student academic
grievances never reach any form of resolution either because
they are not brought to the attention of anyone concerned
with such problems or out of ignorance that means exist for
their expression.

A piiot survey conducted by this office indicated that
quite serious criticism of teaching, course content, and in
equity in grading does not find expression except among the
students themselves. The institution of universal course evalu
ation by students will undoubtedly help to bring these prob
lems to light, and Dean Katchadourian's vigorous insistence
on the improvement of undergraduate instruction is al
together appropriate and timely.
Honor Code Violations
During the past year the Ombudsman's office has been
involved in a considerable number of Honor Code violations.
The most troublesome cases have been violations by foreign
students who are either unaware of the importance attributed
to this code at Stanford or regard it as irrelevant to their
conduct. For some graduate departments the problem has
been severe.
Consequently this office asked Dean Lyons to convene a
representative group of faculty and administrators to discuss
the matter. It was agreed by the participants that foreign
students did constitute a special problem and that the impor
tance of the Honor Code should be emphasized and fully
explained to them on their entrance to graduate school.
It was also agreed that a very special effort to do this
should be made by the International Center in particular.
This would at least remove the excuse of ignorance and the
special plea of being foreign.
To charge a student with a violation of the Honor Code is
for the instructor an unpleasant and troubling responsibility.
This office is frequently consulted concerning the proper
procedure, especially in cases where there is some degree of
uncertainty. This is entirely appropriate; discussion and ap
praisal of the situation on an informal level can be helpful.
However, before any resolution, consultation with the
Office of the President is a University regulation that should
in general be followed. The Faculty Handbook (p. 65) clearly
states that an instructor who believes that an Honor Code
violation has occurred should report the matter to the Office
of the President.
This does not mean, as some instructors seem to believe,
that a formal charge is thereby initiated. The legal advisor to
the President must first decide whether or not the charge is
strong enough to be carried forward by the President's Of
fice. His appraisal of the evidence and resulting decision is an
important protection for both student and instructor.
Some instructors seek to resolve Honor Code violations
with the student involved, arguing that this is the more
effective way of dealing with student misconduct. There is no
provision for this in the statement of the Faculty Handbook
referred to above. However, under the most recent interpreta
tion of the Honor Code there is recognition of such proce
dure, but the conditions are carefully prescribed.
To quote: "Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
students are not to be penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's
grade on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such
formal proceedings unless the student is informed and gives
consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with
the student's consent, request that the work be redone and
resubmitted, giving a grade on the resubmitted work" ("Pen
alty Grading," Honor Code 2.,e.).
The general rule that a report be made to the President's
Office of each instance of suspected Honor Code violation is,
presumably, not required under these special conditions.
Students often report violations of the Honor Code by
members of the faculty. Proctoring examinations, for ex
ample, is correctly perceived as violating the spirit and intent
of the Code. The recent reaffirmation of the Honor Code and
its reinterpretation make reasonably clear the provisions to
which the faculty should adhere. In some instances, however.

a faculty member may be unaware of the existence of the
code or even unwilling to be guided by its regulations.
Under the rules of the Stanford Judicial Council there are
no general provisions for student complaints of faculty vio
lations of the Honor Code; these rules are almost exclusively
concerned with student disciplinary cases. Charges of faculty
violations have been interpreted by the Ombudsman's Office
as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.

Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.

as academic grievances subject to either formal or informal
redress.
Two Continuing Problems
Faculty members come to this office for advice and
discussion of problems concerning their appointments. These
include claims of discrimination in promotion, suspected
salary inequities and, especially, the denial of reappointment
with or without tenure.
It is the latter that raises the most difficult problem. The
decision to challenge a denial of reappointment through the
faculty grievance procedure is itself a very serious matter. For
the grievant to take this step, it is essential that he know in
advance the basis on which denial of reappointment has been
made.
To assure this, the procedure provides that the "full
substance" of the grounds for the negative decision be dis
closed to the grievant orally or in writing by the provost.
(Faculty Handbook, p. 24). In order to explain the decision
the provost or his delegate is dependent on the information
received from the administrative unit to which the faculty
member belongs.
Cases coming to the attention of this office indicate that a
grievant may find the disclosure inadequate as a basis on
which to challenge a negative departmental decision This
may be a legitimate complaint, for disclosure of "full sub
stance" runs into problems of what can or should be dis
closed.
Guarantee of confidentiality concerning solicited ap
praisals of the candidate's qualifications is, of course, a basic
limitation on disclosure. Apart from this, "full substance" is
subject to a range of interpretations. If narrowly construed,
the faculty member may be discouraged from entering the
appeal process or disadvantaged if he does. The most com
plete disclosure possible seems to this office essential to the
intent of the appeal process itself.
The problems of nonacademic personnel are often
brought to the Office of the Ombudsman. Sometimes the
employee may merely want to review and to discuss a
troubling situation. In other instances the problem is appro
priately referred to the office of Personnel to be handled
through its regulations and procedures.
There are, occasionally, however, special circumstances or
highly personal matters which require consideration trans
cending the application of the usual personnel regulations. It
is to these that the Ombudsman should and does pay particu
lar attention.
What is equitable and fair in a particular case is not °asy
to determine and often requires extensive discussion with the
Office of Personnel and other responsible members of the
administration. A special plea from the Ombudsman's Office
assumes that there is some flexibility in rules and regulations
and, indeed, assumes that exceptions are in principle justi
fiable.
Student Assistants to the Ombudsman
The association of several students with this Office as
assistants to the Ombudsman was begun in 1975-76 as an
experiment to increase the sensitivity and response of the
office to student needs and problems. This proved valuable
and has been continued during the past year.
The work of these students in the study and reporting of
problems of special interest has been particularly helpful.
Miss Marsha Wilkes, a senior who graduated last June,
undertook a study of the academic grievance procedure that
involved interviews with administrative personnel internal to
the University as well as enquiries concerning similar proce
dures in other institutions. Her study was especially helpful.
Barry Bakin, a freshman, conducted a pilot survey of
student academic problems that threw light on the degree to
which these problems exist and fail to be publicly expressed.
Francis Wong, a sophomore, undertook in collaboration
with the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and the
Student Health Service a study of the problems faced by
Asian-Americans in the Stanford community. The results of
this study will be released separately.
Apart from the value of their various studies and reports,
the student assistants, by r eflecting prevailing student atti
tudes and opinions, often give this office a very direct sense
of the realities of student life.
Another student, Nancy Hoebelheinrich, informally asso
ciated with this office, has worked with the Action Researcii
Liaison Office on a continuing study of the status of emeritus
professors in the Stanford community. It is expected that the
results of this study will be forthcoming in the next academic
year.
Conclusion
Over 400 "cases," representing one or many individuals,
have come to the attention of the office over the past year.
The great variety of problems is indicated in the accompany
ing statistical summary.
Only a few of these have been examined in this report,
but all of them have received careful consideration. Manv
have been resolved; others not. In either case, this office is a
place where a complaint can be freely expressed and dis
cussed; a function of the office, important in and of itself.
In investigating and resolving problems and complaints,
the Office of the Ombudsman often makes extensive de
mands on the time and patience of many members of the
academic community. Investigations often involve requests
for detailed information, and responses to such requests can
be burdensome to the Office or individual addressed. In this
respect, the almost universal cooperation is remarkable and is
most appreciated. Thanks are due to many individuals too
numerous to mention.
