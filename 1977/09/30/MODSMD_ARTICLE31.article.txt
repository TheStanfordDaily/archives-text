## Stock clubs: whipping the pros? 
### 
New York (AP) — Can amateur investors
whip the pros, or are claims to that effect
mainly the boastings of individuals who
live in a fantasy world where victories are
recorded and losses forgotten?
Let the statistics speak, says the National
Association of Investment Clubs. Officials
there maintain that nine per cent of pro
fessionally managed funds fared worse
than the market over the past 10 years; but
that 58 per cent of clubs did better.
The association cites more figures: The
median rate of return of the typical profes
sionally managed fund for 10 years
through 1976 was 4.2 per cent. The median
for investment clubs was 5.9 per cent, or 42
per cent better.
Compare investment results to the mar
ket averages, it continues, and there's an
even bigger difference. Managed funds, it
says, earned 2.5 per cent less than the
Standard & Poor's 500 average. The clubs
exceeded S&P by 3.83 per cent.
Amateurs whip ...
And so, based on what it says is the re
cord, the association has just issued a re
port containing an unequivocal subhead,
"Amateurs Whip Professionals," and a
morally certain investment homily, to wit:
"If you want to make money in the
stockmarket, it's the solid, old-fashioned
principles of investing that produce re
sults. Computer addicted analysts and the
fast track boys don't seem to really be in
the running."
What are those principles that seem to
work so well for at least some of the 5216
member clubs in the association which ac

cepts club and individual memberships at
its office in Royal Oak, Mich.? As follows:
—They invest a sum of money regularly,
usually once a month, over a lone period
of time.
—They add dividends received to their
monthly investments.
—They make an effort to invest in good
quality companies that seem reasonably
certain of making greater progress than
industry in general.
Sugar tree?
Says Tom O'Hara, chairman: "We com
pare investing to planting a maple tree
from which we receive increasing
amounts of sugar every year and eventu
ally profit from selling the grown tree." '
Meeting regularly, the club members
often strenuously argue the merits of vari
ous stocks, but when they pick one they
tend to stay with it. That not only keeps
down commissions, they note, but also
gives sound stocks a chance to prove
themselves.
They take considered risks also, and
sometimes score huge gains — on many
stocks as much as 300 or 400 per cent.
Little faith
"The club members obviously don't put
much faith in the 'indexing' fad being ad
vocated by some investors," says O'Hara.
But a nagging question underlies the
comparisons between amateurs and pros:
Do they play in the same league? The ques
tion isn't easily answered. To try is to be
tugged in different directions.
There is the matter of statistics them
selves. The association relies on informa

tion volunteered by a percentage of the
clubs. The data on clubs is usually a matter
of public record.
Profits only
It is true that they both seek profits from
investments. It isn't true that they choose
from the same pool of stocks, or even that
they must play by the same rules.
Investment clubs often choose stocks of
rather little known, swiftly growing com
panies that have too few shares outstand
ing to interest the big funds. The latter
often have to restrict themselves to large,
mature companies.
Being pros, many portfolio managers
also must be ready to prove their pru
dence, and at the moment that term is
interpreted to mean building a portfolio of
stocks having the least risk.
Prudence
This need to show prudence, for exam
ple, has led to indexing, in which the
portfolio manager buys so wide a variety of
stocks that, in effect, he invests in the
same stocks that make up the popular av
erages. In that way he can't fall too far
behind "average."
But some critics maintain that indexing
is just another fad, and that is something
the amateurs jump on. Says O'Hara:
"The lesson of the superior earnings
rate of investment club members may well
be that ... if he can resist the temptation
to follow stockmarket fads and gimmicks
. . . and follow sound, tested principles,
it's possible he'll have a pleasant experi
ence."
