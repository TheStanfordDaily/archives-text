Dacca, Bangladesh (AP) —
Masked terrorists holding 146
hostages aboard a hijacked
Japanese jetliner isolated at
Dacca airport agreed early
today to give the Japanese gov
ernment one more day to meet
their demands.
Air Vice Marshal Mahmoud,
who had been conducting
last-minute negotiations, said
the five hijackers extended
their Thursday midnight dead
line to 4 a.m. Saturday (6 p.m.
EDT Friday) as the siege en
tered its third day.
Mahmoud said he explained
to the gunmen that the
Japanese government was hav
ing difficulty arranging for the
$6 million ransom and the re
lease from Japanese prisons of
nine inmates, most of them
terrorists.
Counting the five hijackers,
151 persons were reported still
on the plane.
One of these released early
yesterday, former Hollywood
actress Carole Wells Karabian,
said the terrorists were armed
with guns and grenades and
had been "terribly rough" at
first but then relaxed some
what after negotiations began.
She said the hostages were
denied food for the first 24

hours and were not even al
lowed to go to the toilet.
Those still on the plane be
sides the hijackers were 14
crew members and 132 pas
sengers, including 10 other
Americans.
A spokesman for the
Japanese cabinet said the gov
ernment was trying to round
up one of the hijackers' ran
som demands in New York —
60,000 U.S. $100 bills, a total of
$6 million.
The other demand was for
the release from Japanese jails
of nine prisoners, "com
rades," most of them known
terrorists. The spokesman said
the government was canvas
sing the prisoners, but two re
portedly refused to accept the
offer of freedom.
After a cabinet meeting
Thursday night, the spokes
man said the demands could
not possibly be met before Fri
day afternoon.
The hijackers, identified as
members of the ultraleftist
Japanese Red Army, have
threatened to begin killing
their hostages one by one,
starting with California banker
John Gabriel, unless the ran

som money and the prisoners
are delivered.
Breakfast
They had set a deadline of
midnight (2 p.m. EDT) Thurs
day, but late yesterday a
spokesman for Japan Air Lines
— JAL — said the gunmen
asked that breakfast be deli
vered to the plane Friday morn
ing.
Asked whether this meant
they were extending the dead
line, the spokesman replied,
"You might as well take it that
way."
Earlier yesterday, the gun
men had finally relented and
ordered that food and toilet
tissue be brought to the DCB.
The JAL plane, comman
deered Wednesday morning
on the Bombay-Bangkok leg of
a flight from Paris to Tokyo, sat
in the stifling heat and humid
ity of Dacca's international air
port. But generators repor
tedly had been hooked up to
continue operating the air
conditioning system.
Release
The hijackers released the
five hostages after being
notified by the Japanese gov
ernment it was willing to meet
their demands.
