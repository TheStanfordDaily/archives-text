# Stanford, Cal soccer teams battle to 0-0 tie

It was, as Stanford soccer coach Nel
son Lodge called it, "a fantastic strug
gle." Make that an epic struggle.
After 90 minutes of regulation play
and two incredibly tense 10-minute
overtimes, the Big Match Wednesday
between the Stanford and California
soccer teams ended in a scoreless tie.
Stanford had lost its last two outings
and Lodge said the Cardinals were glad
to come away from the Big Match with a
draw.
"It was a tough, vigorous soccer
game," Lodge said. "But despite our
youth (Lodge said 70 per cent of the
team is freshmen or sophomores) we
held up well in the second overtime."
"The defense played well," Lodge
said. "Our key problem was ironed out.
We did very well marking on defense,

picking up their players so we had a
man-to-man situation."
Coal keeper Craig Uland played par
ticularly well making 11 saves, includ
ing two that brought raucous approval
from the crowd of several hundred.
Cal, which clearly had some choice
scoring chances, was unable to penet
ite the Stanford goal.
"In the game' we've lost or tied this
season we haven t capitalized on op
portunities," Cal coach Bob DeCracia
said. "We created a lot of chances
but "
In the second overtime, it appeared
that finally the Bears were going to
score when a Cal forward launched a
kick toward the upper right part of the
Stanford goal. But halfback Billy Allstet
ter lept up at the last minute and de
flected the Cal boot.

As tension built as the struggle prog
ressed with neither team managing to
punch through a goal, an animosity
grew between the teams.
"The game was overly physical,"
DeCracia said. "Physical play like this
demands more control on the part of
the officials. People tee off on each
other once things get physical."
The physical exchange on the field
did not match the hostility that grew
between the two benches, which were
separated only by the scorer's table.
Feelings peaked when a Cal player
stepped out of bounds to throw the ball
into play, then turned around and ac
cused Stanford assistant coach Phil
Wright of spitting on him.
"There was lot of verbal abuse from
the (Stanford) bench," said DeGracia.

He said much of it had its roots with
Wright.
Wright also engaged the officials in
shouting matches.
One of the officials told a player he
couldn't make a call because "I don't
know that you're going to get it."
When Wright yelled something from
the Stanford bench to the effect that he
ought to know, the official responded,
"Coach, shut up."
"It's a very emotional game," Lodge
said, "and we have a very volatile
bench."
The taunts and bench jockeying were
but a small part of the struggle going on
on the field. Many would say the strug
gle ended without a victor.
Perhaps instead, everyone
triumphed.

last season's team, had leg cramps against California but still man
aged to play most of the game. The Big Match ended a scoreless tie.
