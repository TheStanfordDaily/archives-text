# Poloists edge Waves, 12-11
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
"I guess that we're good
enough that we can play
crappy and still win," Stanford
water polo coach Dante De
ttamanti said yesterday after
watching the Cardinals hold off
a last minute charge by Pep
perdine to win, 12-11.
With a minute left in the
game, the Cards led 12-9, but
17 seconds later, the Waves
capitalized on a Stanford ejec
tion and scored. Within a few
more seconds, after another
Stanford ejection, Pepperdine
closed the gap to one. Finally,
with one second left, a Pep
perdine shot was deflected and
the Cards had their second vic
tory in as many games.
Dettamanti, however was
less than pleased with his
team's performance. "There is
no way we should have given
them an opportunity to tie us
with only a minute left. That's
not smart water polo."
The game was close all the
way. At the end of the first
quarter it was 2-2. During the
second quarter, junior Doug
Burke scored three of his
team-leading four goals to

match the Waves' output for
the period and at half-time the
score was deadlocked 5-5.
Junior Robby Arnold scored
two of his three goals during
the third quarter and senior
Rick Johannsen added one to
give the Cards an 8-7 lead going
into the mad fourth quarter.
"Whenever we had an op
portunity to take command,
we didn't," Dettamanti said.
"We'd get a two goal lead and
then, instead of going down
and working for a third, we'd
throw the ball away and they'd
come back and score on us.
"We did a terrible job of ad
justing to the game situation
and we didn't make good shot
selection. You've got to pick
your spot but we didn't do that.
We made their goalie look like
an Ail-American."
Dettamanti also said that
Stanford's 10 ejections in the
game, compared to Pepper
dine's six, prevented the Cards
from controlling the game.
In retrospect, however, De
ttamanti said, "We needed a
game like this to wake us up.
It's a difficult thing to try and
get a team to play every game
with the same intensity."

The Cardinals will have to be
awake this weekend. Today at 1
p.m. at deGuerre, the waterca
gers take on University of the
Pacific in the Northern Califor
nia Invitational Tournament. At
5 p.m. Stanford's "B" team will
take on the California "B"
squad.
Tomorrow, the Cards' varsity
"A"s will play the Cal "A"s at 9
a.m.
"That's really going to be
close," Dettamanti said. "Cal
and Stanford are the top two
teams in the nation so it ought
to be a good game."

justing to the game situation
and we didn't make good shot
selection. You've got to pick
your spot but we didn't do that.
We made their goalie look like
an Ail-American."
Dettamanti also said that
Stanford's 10 ejections in the
game, compared to Pepper
dine's six, prevented the Cards
from controlling the game.
In retrospect, however, De
ttamanti said, "We needed a
game like this to wake us up.
It's a difficult thing to try and
get a team to play every game
with the same intensity."

The Cardinals will have to be
awake this weekend. Today at 1
p.m. at deGuerre, the waterca
gers take on University of the
Pacific in the Northern Califor
nia Invitational Tournament. At
5 p.m. Stanford's "B" team will
take on the California "B"
squad.
Tomorrow, the Cards' varsity
"A"s will play the Cal "A"s at 9
a.m.
"That's really going to be
close," Dettamanti said. "Cal
and Stanford are the top two
teams in the nation so it ought
to be a good game."
"I guess that we're good
enough that we can play
crappy and still win," Stanford
water polo coach Dante De
ttamanti said yesterday after
watching the Cardinals hold off
a last minute charge by Pep
perdine to win, 12-11.
With a minute left in the
game, the Cards led 12-9, but
17 seconds later, the Waves
capitalized on a Stanford ejec
tion and scored. Within a few
more seconds, after another
Stanford ejection, Pepperdine
closed the gap to one. Finally,
with one second left, a Pep
perdine shot was deflected and
the Cards had their second vic
tory in as many games.
Dettamanti, however was
less than pleased with his
team's performance. "There is
no way we should have given
them an opportunity to tie us
with only a minute left. That's
not smart water polo."
The game was close all the
way. At the end of the first
quarter it was 2-2. During the
second quarter, junior Doug
Burke scored three of his
team-leading four goals to

match the Waves' output for
the period and at half-time the
score was deadlocked 5-5.
Junior Robby Arnold scored
two of his three goals during
the third quarter and senior
Rick Johannsen added one to
give the Cards an 8-7 lead going
into the mad fourth quarter.
"Whenever we had an op
portunity to take command,
we didn't," Dettamanti said.
"We'd get a two goal lead and
then, instead of going down
and working for a third, we'd
throw the ball away and they'd
come back and score on us.
"We did a terrible job of ad
justing to the game situation
and we didn't make good shot
selection. You've got to pick
your spot but we didn't do that.
We made their goalie look like
an Ail-American."
