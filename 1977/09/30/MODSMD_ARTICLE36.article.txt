# Benjamin, Henderson set to clash in aerial warfare
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
A tip of the hat, a wave of the
wand and "Voila!" A new sea
son.
Stanford begins its new sea
son tomorrow when it hosts
the Oregon Ducks in Stanford
Stadium at 1:50 p.m. in a con
test that will be telecast region
ally by ABC.
Hey, wait a minute. New sea
son? What about those three
games earlier this fall?
Forget 'em.
Sure, they were fun. The
team had a good time playing
in the Rocky Mountains and
the Superdome and it was
great smashing Illinois in front
of the home folk.
Granted, it was exciting find
ing a running back with more
moves than Allied Van Lines.

And Guy Benjamin has justi tied
the faith of those armchair
generals who insisted that he
should have been the starting
quarterback on the Farm for
the last three years.
But forget those first three
games. They were meant only
for pollsters who enjoy juggl
ing their 20 teams each week
Now it's for the marbles.
Tomorrow begif.. the annual
Race for the Roses for both the
Cardinals and th> ')ucks.
Oregon enters kne game to
morrow with a 1-2 mark, having
suffered defeats to Georgia,
27-16, and Wisconsin, 22-10,
and having recorded its sole
victory over Texas Christian,
29-24. (TCU has lost 14
straight.)
On the surface, the game

should be a mismatch. Stan
ford, 2-1, has been established
as a 16-point favorite by those
in Nevada who care about such
items. And despite a talented
secondary, first-year Oregon
coach Rich Brooks' defense
should be in for a tough day
with the Stanford offense.
Halfback Darrin Nelson has
created a very non-Stanford
like interest in the Cards' run
ning game. The first-year
phenom has picked up 6.4
yards a crack. He is a breath of
fresh air in an atmosphere usu
ally filled with aerials from
Cardinal quarterbacks. Not
that Stanford has foresaken the
pass.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
and the Card receiving corps
remain Stanford's bread and

butter. Benjamin, completing
passes at a b8 per cent clip this
season, completed 30 throws
last week against Illinois f0r272
yards and three TDs. Speedster
James Lofton caught eight of
those passes for 107 yards and
two scores
"lames is just scratching the
surface of his abilities," said
Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
Walsh said he hopes that Ben
jamin and Lofton can hook-up
on some deep passes this
week.
Walsh said early this week
that Stanford will see lots of
man-to-man coverage Satur
day and a big blitz from the
Ducks.
"We will see a heavy blitz
down after down this week,"
Walsh said.
For Oregon's pass defense
to be effective, the front line
must pressure Benjamin. And
that means getting through
Cordon King and the Cards' of
fensive line.
"King completely dominated
his man," Walsh said of the
performance by the 6-foot-6,
270 pounder Saturday against
the lllini. "In my way of think
ing he could be the best offen
sive lineman in the country."
And while the Ducks may
have problems stopping the
Stanford offense, the Cardinal
defense may face similar prob
lems with the Oregon attack.
"Oregon will give us more

problems than anyone we've
faced thus far because they
throw the ball well," Walsh
told sportswriters Monday.
Duck signal-caller Jack Hen
derson, a graduate of nearby
Woodside High School, has
been nothing but trouble for
Stanford the last two seasons.
In 1975 he completed 27 passes
for 283 yards in Stanford
Stadium. Last year he com
pleted 22 passes for 277 yards
as Stanford beat the Ducks in
Eugene, 28-17.
Henderson could top both
of those performances, how
ever, if the Stanford pass de
fense doesn't gel. The Cards,
currently last in the conference
in team defense, have allowed
opposing quarterbacks to
complete 68 per cent of their
passes.
Henderson's favorite target
is flanker Tom Cafferty who has
13 receptions. But the Oregon
deep threat is split end Ken
Page who has 10 receptions for
214 yards. Henderson has hit
Page with bombs of 70 and 60
yards.
The Stanford defense, young
and inexperienced, will be
bolstered tomorrow by the re
turn of several veterans who
have been out with injuries.
Chuck Evans will return to start
at left end while senior end
Bruce Barker, who has missed
all of the first three games, will
see action against the Ducks.

Tackle Geoff Kieburtz is listed
at 100 per cent at the left tackle
slot.
And someone in the defen
sive secondary is going to have
♦o move to make room for Larry
Reynolds, junior right corner
back, who played in the sec
ond half against Illinois after
coming off a back injury suf
fered during baseball season
this summer.
On offense, fullback Phil
Francis is coming off a thigh in
jury and will see plenty of ac
tion tomorrow, coaches say.
Card notes: All general ad
mission tickets for the Big
Game have been sold out, the
Athletic Department an
nounced Wednesday. This is

the earliest Big Game sellout
ever. The only tickets left for
the cross-bay clash are student
tickets.
Currently the only way stu
dents can purchase a ticket to
the Stanford-Cal contest is to
purchase season tickets.
Whether individual game tic
kets will be sold at a future date
will be decided by the Athletic
Department in the next week
or two.
Chris Schenkel is doing the
play-by-play of tomorrow's
ABC broadcast and former
Notre Dame coach Ara Parseg
hian will do the color.

moves than Allied Van Lines.

And Guy Benjamin has justi tied
the faith of those armchair
generals who insisted that he
should have been the starting
quarterback on the Farm for
the last three years.
But forget those first three
games. They were meant only

ing their 20 teams each week
Now it's for the marbles.
Tomorrow begif.. the annual
Race for the Roses for both the
Cardinals and th> ')ucks.
Oregon enters kne game to
morrow with a 1-2 mark, having
suffered defeats to Georgia,
27-16, and Wisconsin, 22-10,
and having recorded its sole
victory over Texas Christian,
29-24. (TCU has lost 14
straight.)
On the surface, the game

should be a mismatch. Stan
ford, 2-1, has been established
as a 16-point favorite by those
in Nevada who care about such
items. And despite a talented
secondary, first-year Oregon
coach Rich Brooks' defense
should be in for a tough day
with the Stanford offense.
Halfback Darrin Nelson has
created a very non-Stanford
like interest in the Cards' run
ning game. The first-year
phenom has picked up 6.4
yards a crack. He is a breath of
fresh air in an atmosphere usu
ally filled with aerials from
Cardinal quarterbacks. Not
that Stanford has foresaken the
pass.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
and the Card receiving corps
remain Stanford's bread and

butter. Benjamin, completing
passes at a b8 per cent clip this
season, completed 30 throws
last week against Illinois f0r272
yards and three TDs. Speedster
James Lofton caught eight of
those passes for 107 yards and
two scores
"lames is just scratching the
surface of his abilities," said
Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
Walsh said he hopes that Ben
jamin and Lofton can hook-up
on some deep passes this
week.
Walsh said early this week
that Stanford will see lots of
man-to-man coverage Satur
day and a big blitz from the
Ducks.
"We will see a heavy blitz
down after down this week,"
Walsh said.
For Oregon's pass defense
to be effective, the front line
must pressure Benjamin. And
that means getting through
Cordon King and the Cards' of
fensive line.
"King completely dominated
his man," Walsh said of the
performance by the 6-foot-6,
270 pounder Saturday against
the lllini. "In my way of think
ing he could be the best offen
sive lineman in the country."
And while the Ducks may
have problems stopping the
Stanford offense, the Cardinal
defense may face similar prob
lems with the Oregon attack.
"Oregon will give us more

problems than anyone we've
faced thus far because they
throw the ball well," Walsh
told sportswriters Monday.
Duck signal-caller Jack Hen
derson, a graduate of nearby
Woodside High School, has
been nothing but trouble for
Stanford the last two seasons.
In 1975 he completed 27 passes
for 283 yards in Stanford
Stadium. Last year he com
pleted 22 passes for 277 yards
as Stanford beat the Ducks in
Eugene, 28-17.
Henderson could top both
of those performances, how
ever, if the Stanford pass de
fense doesn't gel. The Cards,
currently last in the conference
in team defense, have allowed
opposing quarterbacks to
complete 68 per cent of their
passes.
Henderson's favorite target
is flanker Tom Cafferty who has
13 receptions. But the Oregon
deep threat is split end Ken
Page who has 10 receptions for
214 yards. Henderson has hit
Page with bombs of 70 and 60
yards.
The Stanford defense, young
and inexperienced, will be
bolstered tomorrow by the re
turn of several veterans who
have been out with injuries.
Chuck Evans will return to start
at left end while senior end
Bruce Barker, who has missed
all of the first three games, will
see action against the Ducks.

Tackle Geoff Kieburtz is listed
at 100 per cent at the left tackle
slot.
And someone in the defen
sive secondary is going to have
♦o move to make room for Larry
Reynolds, junior right corner
back, who played in the sec
ond half against Illinois after
coming off a back injury suf
fered during baseball season
this summer.
On offense, fullback Phil
Francis is coming off a thigh in
jury and will see plenty of ac
tion tomorrow, coaches say.

Cardinals and th> ')ucks.
Oregon enters kne game to
morrow with a 1-2 mark, having
suffered defeats to Georgia,
27-16, and Wisconsin, 22-10,
and having recorded its sole
victory over Texas Christian,
29-24. (TCU has lost 14
straight.)
On the surface, the game

should be a mismatch. Stan
ford, 2-1, has been established
as a 16-point favorite by those
in Nevada who care about such
items. And despite a talented
secondary, first-year Oregon
coach Rich Brooks' defense
should be in for a tough day
with the Stanford offense.
Halfback Darrin Nelson has
created a very non-Stanford
like interest in the Cards' run
ning game. The first-year
phenom has picked up 6.4
yards a crack. He is a breath of
fresh air in an atmosphere usu
ally filled with aerials from
Cardinal quarterbacks. Not
that Stanford has foresaken the
pass.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
and the Card receiving corps
remain Stanford's bread and

butter. Benjamin, completing
passes at a b8 per cent clip this
season, completed 30 throws
last week against Illinois f0r272
yards and three TDs. Speedster
James Lofton caught eight of
those passes for 107 yards and
two scores
"lames is just scratching the
surface of his abilities," said
Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
Walsh said he hopes that Ben
jamin and Lofton can hook-up
on some deep passes this
week.
Walsh said early this week
that Stanford will see lots of
man-to-man coverage Satur
day and a big blitz from the
Ducks.
"We will see a heavy blitz
down after down this week,"
Walsh said.
For Oregon's pass defense
to be effective, the front line
must pressure Benjamin. And
that means getting through
Cordon King and the Cards' of
fensive line.
"King completely dominated
his man," Walsh said of the
performance by the 6-foot-6,
270 pounder Saturday against
the lllini. "In my way of think
ing he could be the best offen
sive lineman in the country."
And while the Ducks may
have problems stopping the
Stanford offense, the Cardinal
defense may face similar prob
lems with the Oregon attack.
"Oregon will give us more

problems than anyone we've
faced thus far because they
throw the ball well," Walsh
told sportswriters Monday.
Duck signal-caller Jack Hen
derson, a graduate of nearby
Woodside High School, has
been nothing but trouble for
Stanford the last two seasons.
In 1975 he completed 27 passes
for 283 yards in Stanford
Stadium. Last year he com
pleted 22 passes for 277 yards
as Stanford beat the Ducks in
Eugene, 28-17.
Henderson could top both
of those performances, how
ever, if the Stanford pass de
fense doesn't gel. The Cards,
currently last in the conference
in team defense, have allowed
opposing quarterbacks to
complete 68 per cent of their
passes.
Henderson's favorite target
is flanker Tom Cafferty who has
13 receptions. But the Oregon
deep threat is split end Ken
Page who has 10 receptions for
214 yards. Henderson has hit
Page with bombs of 70 and 60
yards.
The Stanford defense, young
and inexperienced, will be
bolstered tomorrow by the re
turn of several veterans who
have been out with injuries.
Chuck Evans will return to start
at left end while senior end
Bruce Barker, who has missed
all of the first three games, will
see action against the Ducks.

Tackle Geoff Kieburtz is listed
at 100 per cent at the left tackle
slot.
And someone in the defen
sive secondary is going to have
♦o move to make room for Larry
Reynolds, junior right corner
back, who played in the sec
ond half against Illinois after
coming off a back injury suf
fered during baseball season
this summer.
On offense, fullback Phil
Francis is coming off a thigh in
jury and will see plenty of ac
tion tomorrow, coaches say.
Card notes: All general ad
mission tickets for the Big
Game have been sold out, the
Athletic Department an
nounced Wednesday. This is

the earliest Big Game sellout
ever. The only tickets left for
the cross-bay clash are student
tickets.
Currently the only way stu
dents can purchase a ticket to
the Stanford-Cal contest is to
purchase season tickets.
Whether individual game tic
kets will be sold at a future date
will be decided by the Athletic
Department in the next week
or two.
Chris Schenkel is doing the
play-by-play of tomorrow's
ABC broadcast and former
Notre Dame coach Ara Parseg
hian will do the color.
The Stanford highlight show
with coach Walsh will be aired
at 1 p.m. Sunday on KRON-TV,
Channel 4.
A tip of the hat, a wave of the

Stanford begins its new sea

the Oregon Ducks in Stanford
Stadium at 1:50 p.m. in a con
test that will be telecast region

Hey, wait a minute. New sea
son? What about those three
games earlier this fall?
Forget 'em.
Sure, they were fun. The
team had a good time playing
in the Rocky Mountains and
the Superdome and it was
great smashing Illinois in front
of the home folk.
Granted, it was exciting find
ing a running back with more
moves than Allied Van Lines.

And Guy Benjamin has justi tied
the faith of those armchair
generals who insisted that he
should have been the starting
quarterback on the Farm for
the last three years.
But forget those first three
games. They were meant only
for pollsters who enjoy juggl
ing their 20 teams each week
