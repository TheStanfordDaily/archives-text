# Young tennis great arrives at Stanford after 'hot' summer John McEnroe latest net gain for Cards
## 
### Paul Bauman 
San Francisco, Calif. — Eighteen
year-old freshman John McEnroe could
write the "What I Did This Summer"
report to end all "What I Did This Sum
mer" reports.
Here's some sample material:
—reached the semifinals at Wimble
don, the most prestigious tennis tour
nament in the world.
—reached the round of 16 in the U.S.
Open in Forest Hills, N.Y.,
second-most prestigious tournament
in the world.
—defeated four of the world's top 20
players (Eddie Dibbs — 8, Wojtek Fivak
—14, Phil Dent —18, and Jaime Fillol —
20).
—defeated three NCAA singles
champions (Sandy Mayer and Matt
Mitchell of Stanford, and Bill Scanlon of
Trinity).
To appreciate McEnroe, it's neces
sary to understand that a good 18-
year-old player has no business doing
any of these things. He should be play
ing in small tournaments in places like
Shreveport, La., content to knock off an
obscure pro now and then. He should
feel honored just to string Jimmy Con
nors' racket. He should be elated just to
qualify for a professional tournament.
The pro tour is a competitive jungle
that's supposed to eat young hotshots
alive.
McEnroe is apparently above all that.
He's also above 90 per cent of the tour

ing pros ranked by the Association of
Tennis Professionals.
The tennis prodigy from Douglas
town, N.Y., left high school last spring
ranked 274 th in the world. He enters
Stanford as No. 25.
If McEnroe were to play tennis at
Stanford for four years, win the NCAA
singles title, play professionally for a
few years and then have the summer he
just had — that would still be extraordi
nary. There are plenty of veterans with

impressive backgrounds on the tour
who would give up drinking beer to
have some of young McEnroe's vic
tories.
McEnroe does not seem to be awed
by his performance at Wimbledon. If
so, he's the only one.
"Now, it's nice to know I can win," he
said the other night at the Cow Palace,
where he is seeded No. 11 in the
$125,000 Transamerica Open. "Wimb
ledon gave me confidence. I'll never
forget it — I know that — but I don't
think about it every night."
After Wimbledon, there was specula
tion that McEnroe would turn pro im
mediately and not attend Stanford as
planned. "Noway," said McEnroe, who

may not play tennis like an 18 year old,
but talks like one.
"I never leaned toward turning pro.
Mentally, I'm not ready. If I turned pro I
might be going to Europe or Asia alone,
and I might not be ready for that."
Although he is supremely confident
on the court (before his match at Wimb
ledon against Mayer, a top pro, McEn
roe said, "There's no way this guy can
beat me. No way."), McEnroe speaks
apprehensively about school.

"I hope I can handle Stanford," he
said.
McEnroe is clearly concerned about
academics as well as athletics, which is
one reason he chose to attend Stan
ford.
"But let's not overdo it,"he said. "I
don't feel like killing myself (academi
cally), but I'm not going to take the
easiest course on campus, either."
If McEnroe approaches studying with
half the intensity he displays on the
court, he has nothing to worry about.
McEnroe wants to win every point,
which frequently results in bickering
with linesmen.
"He has always been a tough guy to
put down, the kind who didn't want to

get beat at anything, ' said Mary Carillo,
McEnroe's best friend from home and
mixed doubles partner. "I mean, when
we were just kids, maybe he was 10 and
I was 12, I was playing a game and he
was fighting.a war."
It's this intensity combined with his
quickness and solid all-around game
that makes McEnroe as good as he is.
"I don't have any weaknesses," he
explained.
Add McEnroe to a team that has all
starters returning from an NCAA
Championship year, and you have pos
sibly the best tennis team in college
history. You also have a touchy situa
tion.
McEnroe, you see, is clearly capable
of demoting defending NCAA singles
champion Matt Mitchell to No. 2 on the
team ladder. (McEnroe won the only
match they've played to date — on
clay.) And if Mitchell, or anyone else on
the team, were to complain about his
ladder position, it wouldn't be the first
time at Stanford.
Neither Mitchell or McEnroe antici
pates a problem, though.
"I'm going to accept where I play and
do my best," Mitchell said.
"If Mitchell beats me out, he beats
me out," McEnroe said. "He'll give me
better practice than I ever had back
home."
If Mitchell does defeat McEnroe next
spring for the right to play No. 1, a lot of
confused pros would like to learn his
secret.

"I never leaned toward turning pro. Mentally, I'm not ready."

It's this intensity combined with his
quickness and solid all-around game
that makes McEnroe as good as he is.
"I don't have any weaknesses," he
explained.
Add McEnroe to a team that has all
starters returning from an NCAA
Championship year, and you have pos
sibly the best tennis team in college
history. You also have a touchy situa
tion.
McEnroe, you see, is clearly capable
of demoting defending NCAA singles
champion Matt Mitchell to No. 2 on the
team ladder. (McEnroe won the only
match they've played to date — on
clay.) And if Mitchell, or anyone else on
the team, were to complain about his
ladder position, it wouldn't be the first
time at Stanford.
Neither Mitchell or McEnroe antici
pates a problem, though.
"I'm going to accept where I play and
do my best," Mitchell said.
"If Mitchell beats me out, he beats
me out," McEnroe said. "He'll give me
better practice than I ever had back
home."
If Mitchell does defeat McEnroe next
spring for the right to play No. 1, a lot of
confused pros would like to learn his
secret.

John McEnroe
San Francisco, Calif. — Eighteen
year-old freshman John McEnroe could
write the "What I Did This Summer"
report to end all "What I Did This Sum
mer" reports.
Here's some sample material:
—reached the semifinals at Wimble
don, the most prestigious tennis tour
nament in the world.
—reached the round of 16 in the U.S.
Open in Forest Hills, N.Y.,
second-most prestigious tournament
in the world.
—defeated four of the world's top 20
players (Eddie Dibbs — 8, Wojtek Fivak
—14, Phil Dent —18, and Jaime Fillol —
20).
—defeated three NCAA singles
champions (Sandy Mayer and Matt
Mitchell of Stanford, and Bill Scanlon of
Trinity).
To appreciate McEnroe, it's neces
sary to understand that a good 18-
year-old player has no business doing
any of these things. He should be play
ing in small tournaments in places like
Shreveport, La., content to knock off an
obscure pro now and then. He should
feel honored just to string Jimmy Con
nors' racket. He should be elated just to
qualify for a professional tournament.
The pro tour is a competitive jungle
that's supposed to eat young hotshots
alive.
McEnroe is apparently above all that.
He's also above 90 per cent of the tour

ing pros ranked by the Association of
Tennis Professionals.
The tennis prodigy from Douglas
town, N.Y., left high school last spring
ranked 274 th in the world. He enters
Stanford as No. 25.
If McEnroe were to play tennis at
Stanford for four years, win the NCAA
singles title, play professionally for a
few years and then have the summer he
just had — that would still be extraordi
nary. There are plenty of veterans with

impressive backgrounds on the tour
who would give up drinking beer to
have some of young McEnroe's vic
tories.
McEnroe does not seem to be awed
by his performance at Wimbledon. If
so, he's the only one.
"Now, it's nice to know I can win," he
said the other night at the Cow Palace,
where he is seeded No. 11 in the
$125,000 Transamerica Open. "Wimb
ledon gave me confidence. I'll never
forget it — I know that — but I don't
think about it every night."
After Wimbledon, there was specula
tion that McEnroe would turn pro im
mediately and not attend Stanford as
planned. "Noway," said McEnroe, who

may not play tennis like an 18 year old,
but talks like one.
"I never leaned toward turning pro.
Mentally, I'm not ready. If I turned pro I
might be going to Europe or Asia alone,
and I might not be ready for that."
Although he is supremely confident
on the court (before his match at Wimb
ledon against Mayer, a top pro, McEn
roe said, "There's no way this guy can
beat me. No way."), McEnroe speaks
apprehensively about school.

"I hope I can handle Stanford," he
said.
McEnroe is clearly concerned about
academics as well as athletics, which is
one reason he chose to attend Stan
ford.
"But let's not overdo it,"he said. "I
don't feel like killing myself (academi
cally), but I'm not going to take the
easiest course on campus, either."
If McEnroe approaches studying with
half the intensity he displays on the
court, he has nothing to worry about.
McEnroe wants to win every point,
which frequently results in bickering
with linesmen.
"He has always been a tough guy to
put down, the kind who didn't want to

get beat at anything, ' said Mary Carillo,
McEnroe's best friend from home and
mixed doubles partner. "I mean, when
we were just kids, maybe he was 10 and
I was 12, I was playing a game and he
was fighting.a war."

might be going to Europe or Asia alone,
and I might not be ready for that."
Although he is supremely confident
on the court (before his match at Wimb
ledon against Mayer, a top pro, McEn
roe said, "There's no way this guy can
beat me. No way."), McEnroe speaks
apprehensively about school.

"I hope I can handle Stanford," he
said.
McEnroe is clearly concerned about
academics as well as athletics, which is
one reason he chose to attend Stan
ford.
"But let's not overdo it,"he said. "I
don't feel like killing myself (academi
cally), but I'm not going to take the
easiest course on campus, either."
If McEnroe approaches studying with
half the intensity he displays on the
court, he has nothing to worry about.
McEnroe wants to win every point,
which frequently results in bickering
with linesmen.
"He has always been a tough guy to
put down, the kind who didn't want to

get beat at anything, ' said Mary Carillo,
McEnroe's best friend from home and
mixed doubles partner. "I mean, when
we were just kids, maybe he was 10 and
I was 12, I was playing a game and he
was fighting.a war."
It's this intensity combined with his
quickness and solid all-around game
that makes McEnroe as good as he is.
"I don't have any weaknesses," he
explained.
Add McEnroe to a team that has all
starters returning from an NCAA
Championship year, and you have pos
sibly the best tennis team in college
history. You also have a touchy situa
tion.
McEnroe, you see, is clearly capable
of demoting defending NCAA singles
champion Matt Mitchell to No. 2 on the
team ladder. (McEnroe won the only
match they've played to date — on
clay.) And if Mitchell, or anyone else on
the team, were to complain about his
ladder position, it wouldn't be the first
time at Stanford.
Neither Mitchell or McEnroe antici
pates a problem, though.
"I'm going to accept where I play and
do my best," Mitchell said.
"If Mitchell beats me out, he beats
me out," McEnroe said. "He'll give me
better practice than I ever had back
home."
If Mitchell does defeat McEnroe next
spring for the right to play No. 1, a lot of
confused pros would like to learn his
secret.

John McEnroe
San Francisco, Calif. — Eighteen
year-old freshman John McEnroe could
write the "What I Did This Summer"
report to end all "What I Did This Sum
mer" reports.
Here's some sample material:
—reached the semifinals at Wimble
don, the most prestigious tennis tour
nament in the world.
—reached the round of 16 in the U.S.
Open in Forest Hills, N.Y.,
second-most prestigious tournament
in the world.
—defeated four of the world's top 20
players (Eddie Dibbs — 8, Wojtek Fivak
—14, Phil Dent —18, and Jaime Fillol —
20).
—defeated three NCAA singles
champions (Sandy Mayer and Matt
Mitchell of Stanford, and Bill Scanlon of
Trinity).
To appreciate McEnroe, it's neces
sary to understand that a good 18-
year-old player has no business doing
any of these things. He should be play
ing in small tournaments in places like
Shreveport, La., content to knock off an
obscure pro now and then. He should
feel honored just to string Jimmy Con
nors' racket. He should be elated just to
qualify for a professional tournament.
The pro tour is a competitive jungle
that's supposed to eat young hotshots
alive.
McEnroe is apparently above all that.
He's also above 90 per cent of the tour

ing pros ranked by the Association of
Tennis Professionals.
The tennis prodigy from Douglas
town, N.Y., left high school last spring
ranked 274 th in the world. He enters
Stanford as No. 25.
If McEnroe were to play tennis at
Stanford for four years, win the NCAA
singles title, play professionally for a
few years and then have the summer he
just had — that would still be extraordi
nary. There are plenty of veterans with

impressive backgrounds on the tour
who would give up drinking beer to
have some of young McEnroe's vic
tories.
McEnroe does not seem to be awed
by his performance at Wimbledon. If
so, he's the only one.
"Now, it's nice to know I can win," he
said the other night at the Cow Palace,
where he is seeded No. 11 in the
$125,000 Transamerica Open. "Wimb
ledon gave me confidence. I'll never
forget it — I know that — but I don't
think about it every night."
After Wimbledon, there was specula
tion that McEnroe would turn pro im
mediately and not attend Stanford as
planned. "Noway," said McEnroe, who

may not play tennis like an 18 year old,
but talks like one.
"I never leaned toward turning pro.
Mentally, I'm not ready. If I turned pro I
might be going to Europe or Asia alone,
and I might not be ready for that."
Although he is supremely confident
on the court (before his match at Wimb
