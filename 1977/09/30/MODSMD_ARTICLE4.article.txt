# Congress feuding over abortion aid
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Members of a
House and Senate conference com
mittee failed again yesterday to agree
on a government abortion policy,
but said their impasse will not cut off
federal welfare benefits for the na
tion's poor.
After an acrimonious, three-hour
session, committee members agreed
to try again on Monday to decide
when the government should pay for
abortions for poor women.
While the dispute will not affect
payments for most federal social ser
vice programs, it may mean a re
duced paycheck for thousands of
federal bureaucrats unless it is resol
ved by Oct. 18.
The controversy over federal fund
ing of abortions for poor women is
tied to legislation providing $60.2
billion for the departments of Labor
and Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW).
The current funding authorization
for the two departments expires to
day, and approval of operating
money for next year has been de
layed in Congress by the abortion
dispute.

The committee has been dead
locked for three months on the is
sue.
The Senate maintains that the gov
ernment should pay for abortions in
cases of rape, incest or where "med
ically necessary," a phrase detractors
say is vague enough to allow abor
tions under almost any cir
cumstances.
The House insists that the gov
ernment should fund abortions only
when a woman's life would be
jeopardized by a full-term pre
gnancy.
Each side has rejected the other's
position. The House voted Tuesday
against accepting the Senate prop
osal.
Meanwhile, officials at various
government agencies and the con
gressional appropriations commit
tees said yesterday spending on wel
fare programs can proceed in antici
pation of future funding.
As a result, persons will continue
receiving government checks from
programs such as Aid to Families with
Dependent Children and Supple
mental Security Income for the aged,
blind and disabled.
Money for Social Security is not
involved in the legislation, and be
nefits under that program are not af
fected. *
But employes at the department* of
Labor and HEW, as well as at other
agencies, may get only one week's
pay instead of two on Oct. 18.
HEW employs 132,500 persons,
and there are about 16,300 workers at
the Labor Department.
The next pay check for them, dis
tributed on Tuesday, is fortwo weeks
of work in September. The Oct. 18
check ordinarily would be for the
final week in September and the first
week in October. But unless Con
gress passes new legislation, salaries
can be paid only through Sept. 30.
The abortion question is linked to
the funding bill because most
government-financed abortions are
performed for Medicaid recipients.

gnancy.
Each side has rejected the other's
position. The House voted Tuesday
against accepting the Senate prop
osal.
Meanwhile, officials at various
government agencies and the con
gressional appropriations commit
tees said yesterday spending on wel
fare programs can proceed in antici
pation of future funding.
As a result, persons will continue
receiving government checks from
programs such as Aid to Families with
Dependent Children and Supple
mental Security Income for the aged,
blind and disabled.
Money for Social Security is not
involved in the legislation, and be
nefits under that program are not af
fected. *
But employes at the department* of
Labor and HEW, as well as at other
agencies, may get only one week's
pay instead of two on Oct. 18.
HEW employs 132,500 persons,
and there are about 16,300 workers at
the Labor Department.
The next pay check for them, dis
tributed on Tuesday, is fortwo weeks
of work in September. The Oct. 18
check ordinarily would be for the
final week in September and the first
week in October. But unless Con
gress passes new legislation, salaries
can be paid only through Sept. 30.
The abortion question is linked to
the funding bill because most
government-financed abortions are
performed for Medicaid recipients.
Washington (AP) — Members of a
House and Senate conference com
mittee failed again yesterday to agree
on a government abortion policy,
but said their impasse will not cut off
federal welfare benefits for the na
tion's poor.
After an acrimonious, three-hour
session, committee members agreed
to try again on Monday to decide
when the government should pay for
abortions for poor women.
While the dispute will not affect
payments for most federal social ser
vice programs, it may mean a re
duced paycheck for thousands of
federal bureaucrats unless it is resol
ved by Oct. 18.
The controversy over federal fund
ing of abortions for poor women is
tied to legislation providing $60.2
billion for the departments of Labor
and Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW).
The current funding authorization
for the two departments expires to
day, and approval of operating
money for next year has been de
layed in Congress by the abortion
dispute.

The committee has been dead
locked for three months on the is
sue.
The Senate maintains that the gov
ernment should pay for abortions in
cases of rape, incest or where "med
ically necessary," a phrase detractors
say is vague enough to allow abor
tions under almost any cir
cumstances.
The House insists that the gov
ernment should fund abortions only
when a woman's life would be
jeopardized by a full-term pre
gnancy.
Each side has rejected the other's
position. The House voted Tuesday
against accepting the Senate prop
osal.

government agencies and the con
gressional appropriations commit
tees said yesterday spending on wel
fare programs can proceed in antici
