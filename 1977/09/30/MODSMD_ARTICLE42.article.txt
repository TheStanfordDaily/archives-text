House OKs funds for neutron bomb
Washington — The House yesterday authorized
spending funds on the neutron bomb, a controversial
weapon that kills people while causing little damage to
buildings.
The funds were concealed in an authorization bill for
the Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA) passed on a vote of 330 to 78.
The House rejected, 297 to 109, an amendment that
would have forbidden any funding for production or
deployment of the weapon.
The bill does not specify how much ERDA could spend
on neutron bomb research.
The Senate previously passed a similar bill, meaning
that as soon as agreement is reached between the two
bodies a final bill can be sent to President jimmy Carter.
The two versions each follow Carter's request to leave it
up to him whether to build the neutron bomb.
While asking for the authorization, Carter has said that
he has not decided whether to produce the weapon.
Senate deadlocked on gas pricing
Washington — A compromise effort to snap a two
week deadlock on natural gas pricing collapsed last
night and the Senate adjourned without voting on a
critical element of President Jimmy Carter's energy plan.
Although preparations had been made for a second
all-night session, Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.), gave up after a full day's effort to end the im
passe and sent the senators home.
The latest in a series of lengthy Senate sessions began
with hopes that a decisive vote would be taken on
whether to end federal control on natural gas, but ended
in bitter parliamentary bickering by both sides.
At issue is whether lifting federal price controls would
increase the nation's dwindling natural gas supplies or
provide producers with excessive profits instead.
Both opponents and proponents of gas deregulation
took actions blocking votes on the compromise, dash
ing hopes of Senate leaders that the intensive two-day
effort had succeeded.
Senate employes wheeled in cots to rooms off the
Senate floor in preparation for a possible second all
night session in three days.
The final vote on the critical natural gas issue is ex
pected to be extremely close.
The first critical test vote was expected to come on a
deregulation plan urged by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen (D-
Tex.), and fames Pearson (R-kan.).
If that should fail, the Senate would move to a com
promise worked out by Majority Leader Robert Byrd and
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee.
Carter urges energy plan approval
Washington — Warning that energy crisis is imminent,

President Jimmy Carter urged the Senate yesterday to
reassemble his energy program and approve it. "They
have their own reputation at stake," he said.
Carter told a nationally televised news conference
that the energy bill is the major product he and the
nation expect from Congress this year.
"The reason that we have to act is not because we have
crises or emergencies at the present time, but because
they are imminent," the president said.
Carter said "there are tremendous pressures on the
Senate now from lobbyists," and urged the lawmakers
to withstand them.
He put special emphasis on three features of his prog
ram that are in jeopardy in the Senate: a new tax on
domestically produced oil, his "gas guzzler tax" on the
big automobiles that burn themos gasoline, and conser
vation measures to shift industrial users of gas and oil to
coal and other energy sources.
Carter also reaffirmed that the United States would
have no dealings with the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) until the PLOaccepts a United Nations resolu
tion implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist.
On another matter, Carter said an immediate agree
ment with the Soviet Union to limit strategic arms is not
in prospect but "reasonable progress has been made" in
his recent meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko.
Improved economic outlook shown
Washington — The U.S. economic outlook brightened
yesterday when the government's index of economic
indicators for August suddenly jumped eight-tenths of
one per cent.
Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal said the
one-month increase, although not decisive, indicated
the economy is moving ahead on schedule.
After a strong winter, the index had declined two
tenths of one per cent in both May and June before
rising two-tenths in July, the Commerce Department
said.
Economists were particularly encouraged in the Au
gust report by an increase of three-tenths of one per
cent in contracts and orders for new plants and equip
ment. This indicator, which shows that businesses are
spending money on factories, often is a sign of confi
dence in the economy.
Economists have said consumer spending may have
peaked and that new growth may depend on new plants
and equipment.
Despite the brighter outlook, several clouds remained
on the horizon. Blumenthal said the nation's trade de
ficit probably will total $25 billion to $30 billion this year
and that another huge deficit is expected in 1978.
Carter approves $11 billion farm bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed an $11

billion farm bill yesterday, hailing it as a "great boon'' to
farmers and consumers alike.
"As a farmer myself," Carter said at a Rose Garden
ceremony, he was pleased to sign what he termed the
most far-reaching agricultural legislation in 40 years.
The new law boosts grain farmers' incomes, revamps
the federal food stamp program and expands agricul
tural research while continuing and revising virtually
every statute administered by the Agriculture Depart
ment.
Although the food stamp and price support sections
will be costly to taxpayers, experts say the measure's
immediate effect on prices at the supermarket will be
minimal.
The legislation contains about $2 billion more than
Carter originally requested. However, he said the final,
compromise version was only $300 million more than he
later had in mind.
Congress and the Ford and Carter administrations
worked nearly three years to prepare the bill, which will
be in effect for the next four years. Heralding it as a
cooperative venture, the president praised members of
Congress of both parties, nutritionists and consumers
for helping to shape the final product.
The law tightens food stamp eligibility requirements
for families with incomes above the official poverty
level, while increasing aid to families with incomes
under the poverty level.
Lockheed pledges financial stability
Burbank — Lockheed Aircraft Corporation held its first
shareholders meeting since 1974 yesterday and outgo
ing Board Chairman Robert Haack won a standing ova
tion after promising that 1977 earnings would be "emi
nently satisfactory."
Haack, who has guided the giant aerospace firm
through 20 turbulent months, also drew applause when
he noted that Lockheed's lending banks are dropping
the controversial $250 million government loan guaran
tee that averted a bankruptcy in 1971.
It was a tour de force for Haack, who praised the
director of the federal Emergency Loan Guarantee Board
and then announced that "he has worked himself out of
a job." Haack noted that Lockheed has repaid $190 mill
ion of the loans and added, "some of us feel the remain
ing $60 million is a mere bagatelle."
Haack said the newly negotiated $100 million credit
line with the firm's bankers prohibits payment of di
vidends, as did the government loan guarantee, but said
he hoped payouts could be resumed in the near future.
He said third-quarter results would be "quite encourag
ing" and noted that Lockheed's overall debt load had
been cut $265 million during his tenure.
The shareholders approved a resolution changing the
company's name from Lockheed Aircraft Corp. to Loc
kheed Corp. Haack said the change was needed because
Lockheed is now involved in many non-aircraft fields but

stressed that it did not mean "any lessening of commit
ment to the aircraft business."
Efforts to label wine bottles continue
Washington — The government's lengthy effort to
label what's inside a wine bottle has concluded another
chapter with two days of hearings in Washington and
now moves to San Francisco.
The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, To
bacco and Firearms more than a year ago proposed a
special government seal for wine that met especially
strict labeling standards.
But this idea was scuttled after strong opposition was
expressed at hearings last February. Critics said the>
were concerned that consumers would mistake the seal
for a guarantee of quality.
Then in june, the government came up with proposed
rules to require that wines labeled as coming from a
specific location contain a minimum amount of wine
from that location. Wines that give no such claim as to
origin would be exempt from the requirement.
The proposed rules also would forbid the use of
foreign language terms that refer to quality or to the
condition of grapes at the time of harvest.
Varietal wines, those made from a single kind of
grape, would have to derive at least 75 per cent of their
volume from the type of grape listed on the label.
A spokesman for the Treasury bureau said wines im
ported into the United States from abroad as well as
domestic varieties would be affected by the labeling
standards.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows tonight in the
50s. Slightly warmer days. Highs today in the upper 60s
and 70s and tomorrow to near 80 inland. Westerly wind
10 to 20 mph.

The legislation contains about $2 billion more than
Carter originally requested. However, he said the final,
compromise version was only $300 million more than he
later had in mind.
Congress and the Ford and Carter administrations
worked nearly three years to prepare the bill, which will
be in effect for the next four years. Heralding it as a
cooperative venture, the president praised members of
Congress of both parties, nutritionists and consumers
for helping to shape the final product.
The law tightens food stamp eligibility requirements
for families with incomes above the official poverty
level, while increasing aid to families with incomes
under the poverty level.
Lockheed pledges financial stability
Burbank — Lockheed Aircraft Corporation held its first
shareholders meeting since 1974 yesterday and outgo
ing Board Chairman Robert Haack won a standing ova
tion after promising that 1977 earnings would be "emi
nently satisfactory."
Haack, who has guided the giant aerospace firm
through 20 turbulent months, also drew applause when
he noted that Lockheed's lending banks are dropping
the controversial $250 million government loan guaran
tee that averted a bankruptcy in 1971.
It was a tour de force for Haack, who praised the
director of the federal Emergency Loan Guarantee Board
and then announced that "he has worked himself out of
a job." Haack noted that Lockheed has repaid $190 mill
ion of the loans and added, "some of us feel the remain
ing $60 million is a mere bagatelle."
Haack said the newly negotiated $100 million credit
line with the firm's bankers prohibits payment of di
vidends, as did the government loan guarantee, but said
he hoped payouts could be resumed in the near future.
He said third-quarter results would be "quite encourag
ing" and noted that Lockheed's overall debt load had
been cut $265 million during his tenure.
The shareholders approved a resolution changing the
company's name from Lockheed Aircraft Corp. to Loc
kheed Corp. Haack said the change was needed because
Lockheed is now involved in many non-aircraft fields but

stressed that it did not mean "any lessening of commit
ment to the aircraft business."
Efforts to label wine bottles continue
Washington — The government's lengthy effort to
label what's inside a wine bottle has concluded another
chapter with two days of hearings in Washington and
now moves to San Francisco.
The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, To
bacco and Firearms more than a year ago proposed a
special government seal for wine that met especially
strict labeling standards.
But this idea was scuttled after strong opposition was
expressed at hearings last February. Critics said the>
were concerned that consumers would mistake the seal
for a guarantee of quality.
Then in june, the government came up with proposed
rules to require that wines labeled as coming from a
specific location contain a minimum amount of wine
from that location. Wines that give no such claim as to
origin would be exempt from the requirement.
The proposed rules also would forbid the use of
foreign language terms that refer to quality or to the
condition of grapes at the time of harvest.
Varietal wines, those made from a single kind of
grape, would have to derive at least 75 per cent of their
volume from the type of grape listed on the label.
A spokesman for the Treasury bureau said wines im
ported into the United States from abroad as well as
domestic varieties would be affected by the labeling
standards.
Today's weather

50s. Slightly warmer days. Highs today in the upper 60s
and 70s and tomorrow to near 80 inland. Westerly wind
10 to 20 mph.
House OKs funds for neutron bomb
Washington — The House yesterday authorized
spending funds on the neutron bomb, a controversial
weapon that kills people while causing little damage to
buildings.
The funds were concealed in an authorization bill for
the Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA) passed on a vote of 330 to 78.
The House rejected, 297 to 109, an amendment that
would have forbidden any funding for production or
deployment of the weapon.
The bill does not specify how much ERDA could spend
on neutron bomb research.
The Senate previously passed a similar bill, meaning
that as soon as agreement is reached between the two
bodies a final bill can be sent to President jimmy Carter.
The two versions each follow Carter's request to leave it
up to him whether to build the neutron bomb.
While asking for the authorization, Carter has said that
he has not decided whether to produce the weapon.
Senate deadlocked on gas pricing
Washington — A compromise effort to snap a two
week deadlock on natural gas pricing collapsed last
night and the Senate adjourned without voting on a
critical element of President Jimmy Carter's energy plan.
Although preparations had been made for a second
all-night session, Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.), gave up after a full day's effort to end the im
passe and sent the senators home.
The latest in a series of lengthy Senate sessions began
with hopes that a decisive vote would be taken on
whether to end federal control on natural gas, but ended
in bitter parliamentary bickering by both sides.
At issue is whether lifting federal price controls would
increase the nation's dwindling natural gas supplies or
provide producers with excessive profits instead.
Both opponents and proponents of gas deregulation
took actions blocking votes on the compromise, dash
ing hopes of Senate leaders that the intensive two-day
effort had succeeded.
Senate employes wheeled in cots to rooms off the
Senate floor in preparation for a possible second all
night session in three days.
The final vote on the critical natural gas issue is ex
pected to be extremely close.
The first critical test vote was expected to come on a
deregulation plan urged by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen (D-
Tex.), and fames Pearson (R-kan.).
If that should fail, the Senate would move to a com
promise worked out by Majority Leader Robert Byrd and
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee.
Carter urges energy plan approval
Washington — Warning that energy crisis is imminent,

President Jimmy Carter urged the Senate yesterday to
reassemble his energy program and approve it. "They
have their own reputation at stake," he said.
Carter told a nationally televised news conference
that the energy bill is the major product he and the
nation expect from Congress this year.
"The reason that we have to act is not because we have
crises or emergencies at the present time, but because
they are imminent," the president said.
Carter said "there are tremendous pressures on the
Senate now from lobbyists," and urged the lawmakers
to withstand them.
He put special emphasis on three features of his prog
ram that are in jeopardy in the Senate: a new tax on
domestically produced oil, his "gas guzzler tax" on the
big automobiles that burn themos gasoline, and conser
vation measures to shift industrial users of gas and oil to
coal and other energy sources.
Carter also reaffirmed that the United States would
have no dealings with the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) until the PLOaccepts a United Nations resolu
tion implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist.
On another matter, Carter said an immediate agree
ment with the Soviet Union to limit strategic arms is not
in prospect but "reasonable progress has been made" in
his recent meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko.
Improved economic outlook shown
Washington — The U.S. economic outlook brightened
yesterday when the government's index of economic
indicators for August suddenly jumped eight-tenths of
one per cent.
Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal said the
one-month increase, although not decisive, indicated
the economy is moving ahead on schedule.
After a strong winter, the index had declined two
tenths of one per cent in both May and June before
rising two-tenths in July, the Commerce Department
said.
Economists were particularly encouraged in the Au
gust report by an increase of three-tenths of one per
cent in contracts and orders for new plants and equip
ment. This indicator, which shows that businesses are
spending money on factories, often is a sign of confi
dence in the economy.
Economists have said consumer spending may have
peaked and that new growth may depend on new plants
and equipment.
Despite the brighter outlook, several clouds remained
on the horizon. Blumenthal said the nation's trade de
ficit probably will total $25 billion to $30 billion this year
and that another huge deficit is expected in 1978.
Carter approves $11 billion farm bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed an $11

billion farm bill yesterday, hailing it as a "great boon'' to
farmers and consumers alike.
"As a farmer myself," Carter said at a Rose Garden
ceremony, he was pleased to sign what he termed the
most far-reaching agricultural legislation in 40 years.
The new law boosts grain farmers' incomes, revamps
the federal food stamp program and expands agricul
tural research while continuing and revising virtually
every statute administered by the Agriculture Depart
ment.
Although the food stamp and price support sections
will be costly to taxpayers, experts say the measure's
immediate effect on prices at the supermarket will be
minimal.
The legislation contains about $2 billion more than
Carter originally requested. However, he said the final,
compromise version was only $300 million more than he

Senate floor in preparation for a possible second all
night session in three days.
The final vote on the critical natural gas issue is ex
pected to be extremely close.
The first critical test vote was expected to come on a
deregulation plan urged by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen (D-
Tex.), and fames Pearson (R-kan.).
If that should fail, the Senate would move to a com
promise worked out by Majority Leader Robert Byrd and
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee.
Carter urges energy plan approval
Washington — Warning that energy crisis is imminent,

President Jimmy Carter urged the Senate yesterday to
reassemble his energy program and approve it. "They
have their own reputation at stake," he said.
Carter told a nationally televised news conference
that the energy bill is the major product he and the
nation expect from Congress this year.
"The reason that we have to act is not because we have
crises or emergencies at the present time, but because
they are imminent," the president said.
Carter said "there are tremendous pressures on the
Senate now from lobbyists," and urged the lawmakers
to withstand them.
He put special emphasis on three features of his prog
ram that are in jeopardy in the Senate: a new tax on
domestically produced oil, his "gas guzzler tax" on the
big automobiles that burn themos gasoline, and conser
vation measures to shift industrial users of gas and oil to
coal and other energy sources.
Carter also reaffirmed that the United States would
have no dealings with the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) until the PLOaccepts a United Nations resolu
tion implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist.
On another matter, Carter said an immediate agree
ment with the Soviet Union to limit strategic arms is not
in prospect but "reasonable progress has been made" in
his recent meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko.
Improved economic outlook shown
Washington — The U.S. economic outlook brightened
yesterday when the government's index of economic
indicators for August suddenly jumped eight-tenths of
one per cent.
Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal said the
one-month increase, although not decisive, indicated
the economy is moving ahead on schedule.
After a strong winter, the index had declined two
tenths of one per cent in both May and June before
rising two-tenths in July, the Commerce Department
said.
Economists were particularly encouraged in the Au
gust report by an increase of three-tenths of one per
cent in contracts and orders for new plants and equip
ment. This indicator, which shows that businesses are
spending money on factories, often is a sign of confi
dence in the economy.
Economists have said consumer spending may have
peaked and that new growth may depend on new plants
and equipment.
Despite the brighter outlook, several clouds remained
on the horizon. Blumenthal said the nation's trade de
ficit probably will total $25 billion to $30 billion this year
and that another huge deficit is expected in 1978.
Carter approves $11 billion farm bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed an $11

billion farm bill yesterday, hailing it as a "great boon'' to
farmers and consumers alike.
"As a farmer myself," Carter said at a Rose Garden
ceremony, he was pleased to sign what he termed the
most far-reaching agricultural legislation in 40 years.
The new law boosts grain farmers' incomes, revamps
the federal food stamp program and expands agricul
tural research while continuing and revising virtually
every statute administered by the Agriculture Depart
ment.
Although the food stamp and price support sections
will be costly to taxpayers, experts say the measure's
immediate effect on prices at the supermarket will be
minimal.
The legislation contains about $2 billion more than
Carter originally requested. However, he said the final,
compromise version was only $300 million more than he
later had in mind.
Congress and the Ford and Carter administrations
worked nearly three years to prepare the bill, which will
be in effect for the next four years. Heralding it as a
cooperative venture, the president praised members of
Congress of both parties, nutritionists and consumers
for helping to shape the final product.
The law tightens food stamp eligibility requirements
for families with incomes above the official poverty
level, while increasing aid to families with incomes
under the poverty level.
Lockheed pledges financial stability
Burbank — Lockheed Aircraft Corporation held its first
shareholders meeting since 1974 yesterday and outgo
ing Board Chairman Robert Haack won a standing ova
tion after promising that 1977 earnings would be "emi
nently satisfactory."
Haack, who has guided the giant aerospace firm
through 20 turbulent months, also drew applause when
he noted that Lockheed's lending banks are dropping
the controversial $250 million government loan guaran
tee that averted a bankruptcy in 1971.
It was a tour de force for Haack, who praised the
director of the federal Emergency Loan Guarantee Board
and then announced that "he has worked himself out of
a job." Haack noted that Lockheed has repaid $190 mill
ion of the loans and added, "some of us feel the remain
ing $60 million is a mere bagatelle."
Haack said the newly negotiated $100 million credit
line with the firm's bankers prohibits payment of di
vidends, as did the government loan guarantee, but said
he hoped payouts could be resumed in the near future.
He said third-quarter results would be "quite encourag
ing" and noted that Lockheed's overall debt load had
been cut $265 million during his tenure.
The shareholders approved a resolution changing the
company's name from Lockheed Aircraft Corp. to Loc
kheed Corp. Haack said the change was needed because
Lockheed is now involved in many non-aircraft fields but

stressed that it did not mean "any lessening of commit
ment to the aircraft business."
Efforts to label wine bottles continue
Washington — The government's lengthy effort to
label what's inside a wine bottle has concluded another
chapter with two days of hearings in Washington and
now moves to San Francisco.
The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, To
bacco and Firearms more than a year ago proposed a
special government seal for wine that met especially
strict labeling standards.
But this idea was scuttled after strong opposition was
expressed at hearings last February. Critics said the>
were concerned that consumers would mistake the seal
for a guarantee of quality.
Then in june, the government came up with proposed
rules to require that wines labeled as coming from a
specific location contain a minimum amount of wine
from that location. Wines that give no such claim as to
origin would be exempt from the requirement.
The proposed rules also would forbid the use of
foreign language terms that refer to quality or to the
condition of grapes at the time of harvest.
Varietal wines, those made from a single kind of
grape, would have to derive at least 75 per cent of their
volume from the type of grape listed on the label.
A spokesman for the Treasury bureau said wines im
ported into the United States from abroad as well as
domestic varieties would be affected by the labeling
standards.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows tonight in the
50s. Slightly warmer days. Highs today in the upper 60s
and 70s and tomorrow to near 80 inland. Westerly wind
10 to 20 mph.
House OKs funds for neutron bomb
Washington — The House yesterday authorized
spending funds on the neutron bomb, a controversial
weapon that kills people while causing little damage to
buildings.
The funds were concealed in an authorization bill for
the Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA) passed on a vote of 330 to 78.
The House rejected, 297 to 109, an amendment that
would have forbidden any funding for production or
deployment of the weapon.
The bill does not specify how much ERDA could spend
on neutron bomb research.
The Senate previously passed a similar bill, meaning
that as soon as agreement is reached between the two
bodies a final bill can be sent to President jimmy Carter.
The two versions each follow Carter's request to leave it
up to him whether to build the neutron bomb.
While asking for the authorization, Carter has said that
he has not decided whether to produce the weapon.
Senate deadlocked on gas pricing
Washington — A compromise effort to snap a two
week deadlock on natural gas pricing collapsed last
night and the Senate adjourned without voting on a
critical element of President Jimmy Carter's energy plan.
Although preparations had been made for a second
all-night session, Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.), gave up after a full day's effort to end the im
passe and sent the senators home.
The latest in a series of lengthy Senate sessions began
with hopes that a decisive vote would be taken on
whether to end federal control on natural gas, but ended
in bitter parliamentary bickering by both sides.
At issue is whether lifting federal price controls would
increase the nation's dwindling natural gas supplies or
provide producers with excessive profits instead.
Both opponents and proponents of gas deregulation
took actions blocking votes on the compromise, dash
ing hopes of Senate leaders that the intensive two-day
effort had succeeded.
Senate employes wheeled in cots to rooms off the
Senate floor in preparation for a possible second all
night session in three days.
The final vote on the critical natural gas issue is ex
pected to be extremely close.
The first critical test vote was expected to come on a

The shareholders approved a resolution changing the
company's name from Lockheed Aircraft Corp. to Loc
kheed Corp. Haack said the change was needed because
Lockheed is now involved in many non-aircraft fields but

stressed that it did not mean "any lessening of commit
ment to the aircraft business."
Efforts to label wine bottles continue
Washington — The government's lengthy effort to
label what's inside a wine bottle has concluded another
chapter with two days of hearings in Washington and
now moves to San Francisco.
The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, To
bacco and Firearms more than a year ago proposed a
special government seal for wine that met especially
strict labeling standards.
But this idea was scuttled after strong opposition was
expressed at hearings last February. Critics said the>
were concerned that consumers would mistake the seal
for a guarantee of quality.
Then in june, the government came up with proposed
rules to require that wines labeled as coming from a
specific location contain a minimum amount of wine
from that location. Wines that give no such claim as to
origin would be exempt from the requirement.
The proposed rules also would forbid the use of
foreign language terms that refer to quality or to the
condition of grapes at the time of harvest.
Varietal wines, those made from a single kind of
grape, would have to derive at least 75 per cent of their
volume from the type of grape listed on the label.
A spokesman for the Treasury bureau said wines im
ported into the United States from abroad as well as
domestic varieties would be affected by the labeling
standards.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. Lows tonight in the
50s. Slightly warmer days. Highs today in the upper 60s
and 70s and tomorrow to near 80 inland. Westerly wind
10 to 20 mph.
House OKs funds for neutron bomb
Washington — The House yesterday authorized
spending funds on the neutron bomb, a controversial
weapon that kills people while causing little damage to
buildings.
The funds were concealed in an authorization bill for
the Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA) passed on a vote of 330 to 78.
The House rejected, 297 to 109, an amendment that
would have forbidden any funding for production or
deployment of the weapon.
The bill does not specify how much ERDA could spend
on neutron bomb research.
The Senate previously passed a similar bill, meaning
that as soon as agreement is reached between the two
bodies a final bill can be sent to President jimmy Carter.
The two versions each follow Carter's request to leave it
up to him whether to build the neutron bomb.
While asking for the authorization, Carter has said that
he has not decided whether to produce the weapon.
Senate deadlocked on gas pricing
Washington — A compromise effort to snap a two
week deadlock on natural gas pricing collapsed last
night and the Senate adjourned without voting on a
critical element of President Jimmy Carter's energy plan.
Although preparations had been made for a second
all-night session, Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.), gave up after a full day's effort to end the im
passe and sent the senators home.
The latest in a series of lengthy Senate sessions began
with hopes that a decisive vote would be taken on
whether to end federal control on natural gas, but ended
in bitter parliamentary bickering by both sides.
At issue is whether lifting federal price controls would
increase the nation's dwindling natural gas supplies or
provide producers with excessive profits instead.
Both opponents and proponents of gas deregulation
took actions blocking votes on the compromise, dash
ing hopes of Senate leaders that the intensive two-day
effort had succeeded.
Senate employes wheeled in cots to rooms off the
Senate floor in preparation for a possible second all
night session in three days.
The final vote on the critical natural gas issue is ex
pected to be extremely close.
The first critical test vote was expected to come on a
deregulation plan urged by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen (D-
Tex.), and fames Pearson (R-kan.).
If that should fail, the Senate would move to a com
promise worked out by Majority Leader Robert Byrd and
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee.
Carter urges energy plan approval
Washington — Warning that energy crisis is imminent,

President Jimmy Carter urged the Senate yesterday to
reassemble his energy program and approve it. "They
have their own reputation at stake," he said.
Carter told a nationally televised news conference
that the energy bill is the major product he and the
nation expect from Congress this year.
"The reason that we have to act is not because we have
crises or emergencies at the present time, but because
they are imminent," the president said.
Carter said "there are tremendous pressures on the
Senate now from lobbyists," and urged the lawmakers
to withstand them.
He put special emphasis on three features of his prog
ram that are in jeopardy in the Senate: a new tax on
domestically produced oil, his "gas guzzler tax" on the
big automobiles that burn themos gasoline, and conser
vation measures to shift industrial users of gas and oil to
coal and other energy sources.
Carter also reaffirmed that the United States would
have no dealings with the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) until the PLOaccepts a United Nations resolu
tion implicitly recognizing Israel's right to exist.
On another matter, Carter said an immediate agree
ment with the Soviet Union to limit strategic arms is not
in prospect but "reasonable progress has been made" in
his recent meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko.
Improved economic outlook shown
Washington — The U.S. economic outlook brightened
yesterday when the government's index of economic
indicators for August suddenly jumped eight-tenths of
one per cent.
Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal said the
one-month increase, although not decisive, indicated
the economy is moving ahead on schedule.
After a strong winter, the index had declined two
tenths of one per cent in both May and June before
rising two-tenths in July, the Commerce Department
said.
Economists were particularly encouraged in the Au
gust report by an increase of three-tenths of one per
cent in contracts and orders for new plants and equip
ment. This indicator, which shows that businesses are
spending money on factories, often is a sign of confi
dence in the economy.
Economists have said consumer spending may have
peaked and that new growth may depend on new plants
and equipment.
Despite the brighter outlook, several clouds remained
on the horizon. Blumenthal said the nation's trade de
ficit probably will total $25 billion to $30 billion this year
and that another huge deficit is expected in 1978.
Carter approves $11 billion farm bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter signed an $11

billion farm bill yesterday, hailing it as a "great boon'' to
farmers and consumers alike.
"As a farmer myself," Carter said at a Rose Garden
ceremony, he was pleased to sign what he termed the
most far-reaching agricultural legislation in 40 years.
The new law boosts grain farmers' incomes, revamps
the federal food stamp program and expands agricul
tural research while continuing and revising virtually
every statute administered by the Agriculture Depart
ment.
Although the food stamp and price support sections
will be costly to taxpayers, experts say the measure's
immediate effect on prices at the supermarket will be
minimal.
The legislation contains about $2 billion more than
Carter originally requested. However, he said the final,
compromise version was only $300 million more than he
later had in mind.
Congress and the Ford and Carter administrations
worked nearly three years to prepare the bill, which will
be in effect for the next four years. Heralding it as a
cooperative venture, the president praised members of
Congress of both parties, nutritionists and consumers
for helping to shape the final product.
The law tightens food stamp eligibility requirements
for families with incomes above the official poverty
level, while increasing aid to families with incomes
under the poverty level.
Lockheed pledges financial stability
Burbank — Lockheed Aircraft Corporation held its first
shareholders meeting since 1974 yesterday and outgo
ing Board Chairman Robert Haack won a standing ova
tion after promising that 1977 earnings would be "emi
nently satisfactory."
Haack, who has guided the giant aerospace firm
through 20 turbulent months, also drew applause when
he noted that Lockheed's lending banks are dropping
the controversial $250 million government loan guaran
tee that averted a bankruptcy in 1971.
It was a tour de force for Haack, who praised the
director of the federal Emergency Loan Guarantee Board
and then announced that "he has worked himself out of
a job." Haack noted that Lockheed has repaid $190 mill
ion of the loans and added, "some of us feel the remain
ing $60 million is a mere bagatelle."
Haack said the newly negotiated $100 million credit
line with the firm's bankers prohibits payment of di
vidends, as did the government loan guarantee, but said
he hoped payouts could be resumed in the near future.
He said third-quarter results would be "quite encourag
ing" and noted that Lockheed's overall debt load had
been cut $265 million during his tenure.
The shareholders approved a resolution changing the
company's name from Lockheed Aircraft Corp. to Loc
kheed Corp. Haack said the change was needed because
Lockheed is now involved in many non-aircraft fields but

stressed that it did not mean "any lessening of commit
ment to the aircraft business."
