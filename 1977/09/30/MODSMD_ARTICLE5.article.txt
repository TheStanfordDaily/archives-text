A $250 tax credit for families paying
college tuition has been put into the
1978 federal budget by both the
House and the Senate.
If such a provision is passed,
families paying tuition would receive
$250 reduction on the taxes they
must pay. Tax credits are different
from tax deductions, in which de
ductable items are removed from
taxable income before taxes are fi
gured.
Tax credits have much more im
pact on after-tax income than tax de
ductions.
Tuition tax credits are not new to
Congress. As early as 1963, Roger
Freeman, associated with the Hoover
Institute, testified before congres
sional committees in favor of such
tuition tax credits. More recently, the
Senate, in four of the last five con
gresses, has approved tuition tax
credits as amendments to other bills,
but after discussions, these have al
ways been removed.

The University in the past has been
opposed to tuition tax credits, but
accordingto Robert Freelen, director
of government relations here, the
University has not seen the current
proposal and has not taken an official
position.
Freelen added that past opposition
was based on the belief that a $250
tuition tax credit was not an effective
means of relieving tuition pressures.
The University has generally been
more in favor of increases in student
aid allotments by the government,
he added.
Lose other benefits
Freelen also pointed out that a tax
credit could lead to a loss in tax re
venues to the government as high as
$1 billion. Fie expressed the fear that
this loss could be made up by trading
off other educational benefits.
Robert Huff, director of financial
aids here, said he was also against
tuition tax credits. He said an in
crease in student aid benefits would
be more beneficial for middle

income families than a tax credit.
Huff added that tuition tax credits
may have negative aspects. "They
could lead to a decrease in student
aid."
Foot in the door
Freeman said he still advocates
some type of tuition tax credit. He
said he feels a straight tax reduction
would help the upper class while a
tuition tax credit would help middle
income groups.
Freeman added that a $250 credit is
not much, but "it is a foot in the
door, it is better than nothing."
A spokesperson for Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) said
McCloskey is against the proposed
tuition tax credit. The spokesperson
said McCloskey feels the tax struc
ture is too complicated already and
that he favors more simplicity rather
than more deductions and credits.
Most budget experts give little
chance for the passage of the tuition
tax credit provisions this year, the
Post said.
