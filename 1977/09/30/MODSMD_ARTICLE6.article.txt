# At Boulder with LSJUMB; a strange and terrible saga
## 
### John Nielsen 
True to the spirit of Big Eight
Football, Colorado keeps a
buffalo as a mascot. Not an
idiot in a fur suit though — this
is a real, live, 1100 pound zip
perless beast, with a personal
trailer and guards.
Her name is Ralphie, and
every home game halftime fea
tures an appearance. Harnes
sed and attached to five or six
big cowboy types, she whips
the masses into a paroxysm of
glee by running around the
field. Ralphie occasionally es
capes her handlers, and she
sometimes excretes when she
should W galloping, but these
actions only heighten her mys
tique. CU fans are awfully
proud of their mascot — they
consider it the most rousing
such organism in college foot
ball.
I don't think so. I think Ral
phie met her match two

weekends ago at halftime of
the Colorado-Stanford game. I
saw another beast on the field
that day—one that like Ralphie
was impossible to control. This
one came out of the stands,
making all manner of noises,
a r ranging itself on the field in
positions never before seen in
those parts. It screamed, and
chanted, and offended every
thing in sight. When it left,
reactions varied from stunned
silence to orgiastic frenzy. The
new beast was primal. It was
foul. It was Ralphie unchained.
In short, it was the Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band.
Four days before, they had
converged upon CU in unpre
cedented numbers, arriving
from everywhere in our United
States, despite satanic Utah
one-lane highways and insidi
ous airline champagne break
fasts. It was the first outing of
the season, and as is typically

the case, it was more of a reun
ion than any thing else.
Famous ex-band members
were everywhere. There was
Bruce Goldstein, with a hair
line and demeanor that gave
away his Rose Bowl status in an
instant. There was Scott Setra
kian, of gorilla suit fame. Also
Ron Zuritsky, the man who
single-handedly out-decibeled
the entire Michigan mel
lophone corps. Even Dave Dew
appeared — that notorious
King of the Old Farts, a man
known far and wide for his wil
lingness to Test his Toyota on
any golf course near Penn
State. Add to this the usual as
sortment of ringers, con
cubines, and total strangers
and you'll have a pretty good
idea of the size and nature of
the gathering.

lascivious pleasings of the first

practice in months, they
moved to the field house and
got to work. Wednesday night
saw a marathon SMUT (Stan
ford Marching Unit Thinkers)
session, in which those re
sponsible for inventing a show
attempted to discover a way to
slander Adolph Coors without
getting sued. Other potential
targets included:
—Alfred E. Packard, former
local known for his habit of eat
ing other human beings.
—Harry Reems, another
local whose cannibalism takes
slightly different form (he is
usually the victim).
—Hunter S. Thompson, the
renowned neoclassical poet
from Colorado Springs.
—Levitz Furniture.
Still, Coors was irrestible. He
attends every CU home game,
and his brewery workers are on
strike, creating the kind of vol
atile, touchy situation which
LSJUMB loves to prod.
After six or so hours of dis
cussion a show began to take
shape. It would be an all Col
orado routine, with tributes to
Coors, Packard, snow, and a
local controversy precipitated
by a legislative plan to install a
light bulb in every room of
every massage parlor in Boul
der. Provided Idi Amin lived, it
would run as it stood in three
days. . . .
But Idi was a problem. The
Band got news early on that he
was in a coma, and since death
shows are a specialty, they
were ready at any moment to
dump the whole thing and start
over. When he lived, they
proposed a "save-ldi-until
the-UCLA-game-and-then-kill-
him" fund.
Wednesday and Thursday they
didn't do much of anything ex
cept practice a few times until
their lips bled, and try out
the formations, which looked
at that time to be in either Heb
rew or Sanskrit. After that they

played at rallies for polite
alumni, followed by rallies for
slightly tipsy alumni, topped
off by rallies for totally bombed
men and women anxious to tell
everyone within earshot what
the campus looked like before
they built the Quad.
Band members passed the
nights by pledging all the local
fraternities, or by wandering
the.streets in small groups, re
enacting key scenes from "A
Clockwork Orange." Nobody
seemed particularly worried by
the fact that they had been
consistently unable to stand in
anything resembling a straight
line. . . .
On game day they rose (in
credibly) and took to the
field for a final (worse than
ever) rehearsal. It was a lot of
fun. CU administrative officials
had generously allowed for a
whopping one hour of field
time, during which interval the
completely impartial techni
cians tested the audio system
at maximum volume, playing
Big Eight muzak, counting end
lessly backwards and forwards
from one to five. It bothered
the Band, but they took solace
in the fact that by then it was
too late anyway. . . .
After a short rally for hung
over alumni they went back to
the stadium, which by that time
appeared to be priming for a
billion-person primal therapy
session. They were herded into
the seats reserved for oppos
ing bands (row z, wing y, sec
tion 247).
The first half was boring.
There were several attempts to
cure Ralphie of the stupor in
duced by the drugs given prior
to each game, but it didn't
work. We wanted her to jump
the fence and run rampant
over helpless spectators, but it
didn't work. Damn.
The halftime show went as
follows, more or less. Probably
less though — I never did fi
gure out where the hell I was
supposed to be standing. The
rest of them were perfect, but I
sort of got lost. I know that I
was one of the nose hairs in the
snow formation (there was this
giant nose, and it snorted a line
of trumpet players), and I was
part of the T in E-A-T M-E, but
that's about it. I just stood
around while they did the
Coors thing (spelling out
O-L-Y, playing "Yellow River").
And the light bulbs were a

stupid idea in the first place.
Two huge and bulbous light
bulbs. Stupid idea for the mas
sage parlor thing. Besides,
what you really want to hear
about is the rally after the game
where the all-time record for
drinks in an evening was bro
ken. The old one (2300) was set
after a Nebraska game or
something like that. Anyway,
this was probably the only rally
in band history that was at the
Boulder Hilton Hotel where
the behavior of the audience
was stranger than that of the
performers. They were literally
throwing six packs at us and
climbing up onto the first floor
terrace where we were stand
ing but I wasn't there, so never
mind. . . .
Editor's note: the following is
an unexpurgated interview
with Mr. Nielsen. It was in
itiated by the Daily when he re
fused to continue the article he
had been assigned unless we
promised "zany irreverence"
or "wacky antics."
Daily: Are you all right in there?
JTN: (Barely audible) Oh Lord
Daily: Why don't you open the
door for a while?

JTN: (Shrieking) Listen to me
you little weasels — I saw a
Colorado reporter reduced to
nothing more than a twitching
blob in less than two hours and
you sent me up there for a
whole goddam week! Do you
understand what those people
do to reporters?
Daily: Uh . . .
JTN: Listen to me. I think its a
ritual of theirs, or some kind of
tribal rite. Whenever they find
a reporter they take him away
from everybody else, and they
surround him with those hor
ribly sincere smiles, and know
ing glances. Then they use
peer pressure to make him im
bibe until his brain is the con
sistency of Jello. After that they
take away the little yellow pad,
and the new Pentel Rolling
Writer, and they stare. They
ask "do you feel ill at ease?", or
"would you like to go to the
bathroom?" Then, when the
humiliation is complete, they
begin to give you the true story
of the band, starting in 1840
Daily: Now calm down John.
Get a hold on yourself. Talk
slowly, and tell us something
about the Colorado band. Do

they have a band? Why haven't
you mentioned them?
JTN: O.K. Alright. Yes, Col
orado University has a march
ing band. They are called the
Colorado University Golden
Buffalo Marching Band. They
have clean uniforms, and they
march. They also play music.
The music was a John-Philip-
Sousa-ish version of the theme
from "Rocky," and a partially
unsyncopated rendition of
Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke." It
sounded like a polka. Wait a
minute while I move my leg.
O.K. Go ahead.
Daily: Did you like the Col
orado Band?
JTN: They were good at what
they did. There are people who
like that sort of thing up in the
press box somewhere, and
they were probably satisfied.
Lots of straight lines, and such.
Personally I was hoping for
sniper fire.
Daily: Tell us some more about
the buffalo, John.
JTN: No. No more buffalo.
What the hell is the matter with
you anyway? The buffalo was
grotesque. It smelled, and it
was grotesque. I hate Buffalos
... I remember now. I re
member Al Jardetsky borrow
ing some of Rich Johnson's
No-Doz because they had to
do paperwork, and because
bandspersons kept disappear
ing. I remember Ken Doxsee
loading and unloading the
truck. And Hal was there too.
Hal is the announcer. He sang
to us . . .
Daily: Open the door, please.
JTN: Listen to me. I would not
be surprised to see the band
attacked and destroyed by an
away game some day. They
liked us in CU, but if we ever
play at Texas A&M, or BVU, it
will be different. We'll go out
there to play, and we won't
notice the wide panel vans ap
proaching from either end of
the field. We won't notice until
the doors swing open and the
machine gun fire begins. But
by then it will be too late.
They'll get Jett first, and then
they'll move towards the drum
section . . .

point. Mr. Nielsen's voice was
nothing more than a low gar
ble, and we thought it might be

you little weasels — I saw a
Colorado reporter reduced to
nothing more than a twitching
blob in less than two hours and
you sent me up there for a
whole goddam week! Do you
understand what those people
do to reporters?
Daily: Uh . . .
JTN: Listen to me. I think its a
ritual of theirs, or some kind of
tribal rite. Whenever they find
a reporter they take him away
from everybody else, and they
surround him with those hor
ribly sincere smiles, and know
ing glances. Then they use
peer pressure to make him im
bibe until his brain is the con
sistency of Jello. After that they
take away the little yellow pad,
and the new Pentel Rolling
Writer, and they stare. They
ask "do you feel ill at ease?", or
"would you like to go to the

Get a hold on yourself. Talk
slowly, and tell us something
about the Colorado band. Do

they have a band? Why haven't
you mentioned them?
JTN: O.K. Alright. Yes, Col
orado University has a march
ing band. They are called the
Colorado University Golden
Buffalo Marching Band. They
have clean uniforms, and they
march. They also play music.
The music was a John-Philip-
Sousa-ish version of the theme
from "Rocky," and a partially
unsyncopated rendition of
Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke." It
sounded like a polka. Wait a
minute while I move my leg.
O.K. Go ahead.
Daily: Did you like the Col
orado Band?
JTN: They were good at what
they did. There are people who
like that sort of thing up in the
press box somewhere, and
they were probably satisfied.
Lots of straight lines, and such.
Personally I was hoping for
sniper fire.

JTN: Listen to me. I would not
be surprised to see the band
attacked and destroyed by an

liked us in CU, but if we ever
play at Texas A&M, or BVU, it
will be different. We'll go out
there to play, and we won't
notice the wide panel vans ap

by then it will be too late.

True to the spirit of Big Eight
Football, Colorado keeps a
buffalo as a mascot. Not an
idiot in a fur suit though — this
is a real, live, 1100 pound zip
perless beast, with a personal
trailer and guards.
Her name is Ralphie, and
every home game halftime fea
tures an appearance. Harnes
sed and attached to five or six
big cowboy types, she whips
the masses into a paroxysm of
glee by running around the
field. Ralphie occasionally es
capes her handlers, and she
sometimes excretes when she
should W galloping, but these
actions only heighten her mys
tique. CU fans are awfully
proud of their mascot — they
consider it the most rousing
such organism in college foot
ball.
I don't think so. I think Ral
phie met her match two

weekends ago at halftime of
the Colorado-Stanford game. I
saw another beast on the field
that day—one that like Ralphie
was impossible to control. This
one came out of the stands,
making all manner of noises,
a r ranging itself on the field in
positions never before seen in
those parts. It screamed, and
chanted, and offended every
thing in sight. When it left,
reactions varied from stunned
silence to orgiastic frenzy. The
new beast was primal. It was
foul. It was Ralphie unchained.
In short, it was the Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band.
Four days before, they had
converged upon CU in unpre
cedented numbers, arriving
from everywhere in our United
States, despite satanic Utah
one-lane highways and insidi
ous airline champagne break
fasts. It was the first outing of
the season, and as is typically

the case, it was more of a reun
ion than any thing else.
Famous ex-band members
were everywhere. There was
Bruce Goldstein, with a hair
line and demeanor that gave
away his Rose Bowl status in an
instant. There was Scott Setra
kian, of gorilla suit fame. Also
Ron Zuritsky, the man who
single-handedly out-decibeled
the entire Michigan mel
lophone corps. Even Dave Dew
appeared — that notorious
King of the Old Farts, a man
known far and wide for his wil
lingness to Test his Toyota on
any golf course near Penn
State. Add to this the usual as
sortment of ringers, con
cubines, and total strangers
and you'll have a pretty good
idea of the size and nature of
the gathering.

practice in months, they
moved to the field house and
got to work. Wednesday night
saw a marathon SMUT (Stan
ford Marching Unit Thinkers)
session, in which those re
sponsible for inventing a show
attempted to discover a way to
slander Adolph Coors without
getting sued. Other potential
targets included:
—Alfred E. Packard, former
local known for his habit of eat
ing other human beings.
—Harry Reems, another
local whose cannibalism takes
slightly different form (he is
usually the victim).
—Hunter S. Thompson, the
renowned neoclassical poet
from Colorado Springs.
—Levitz Furniture.
Still, Coors was irrestible. He
attends every CU home game,
and his brewery workers are on
strike, creating the kind of vol
atile, touchy situation which
LSJUMB loves to prod.
After six or so hours of dis
cussion a show began to take
shape. It would be an all Col
orado routine, with tributes to
Coors, Packard, snow, and a
local controversy precipitated
by a legislative plan to install a
light bulb in every room of
every massage parlor in Boul
der. Provided Idi Amin lived, it
would run as it stood in three
days. . . .
But Idi was a problem. The
Band got news early on that he
was in a coma, and since death
shows are a specialty, they
were ready at any moment to
dump the whole thing and start
over. When he lived, they
proposed a "save-ldi-until
the-UCLA-game-and-then-kill-
him" fund.
Wednesday and Thursday they
didn't do much of anything ex
cept practice a few times until
their lips bled, and try out
the formations, which looked
at that time to be in either Heb
rew or Sanskrit. After that they

played at rallies for polite
alumni, followed by rallies for
slightly tipsy alumni, topped
off by rallies for totally bombed
men and women anxious to tell
everyone within earshot what
the campus looked like before
they built the Quad.
Band members passed the
nights by pledging all the local
fraternities, or by wandering
the.streets in small groups, re
enacting key scenes from "A
Clockwork Orange." Nobody
seemed particularly worried by
the fact that they had been
consistently unable to stand in
anything resembling a straight
line. . . .
On game day they rose (in
credibly) and took to the
field for a final (worse than
ever) rehearsal. It was a lot of
fun. CU administrative officials
had generously allowed for a
whopping one hour of field
time, during which interval the
completely impartial techni
cians tested the audio system
at maximum volume, playing
Big Eight muzak, counting end
lessly backwards and forwards
from one to five. It bothered
the Band, but they took solace
in the fact that by then it was
too late anyway. . . .
After a short rally for hung
over alumni they went back to
the stadium, which by that time
appeared to be priming for a
billion-person primal therapy
session. They were herded into
the seats reserved for oppos
ing bands (row z, wing y, sec
tion 247).
The first half was boring.
There were several attempts to
cure Ralphie of the stupor in
duced by the drugs given prior
to each game, but it didn't
work. We wanted her to jump
the fence and run rampant
over helpless spectators, but it
didn't work. Damn.
The halftime show went as
follows, more or less. Probably
less though — I never did fi
gure out where the hell I was
supposed to be standing. The
rest of them were perfect, but I
sort of got lost. I know that I
was one of the nose hairs in the
snow formation (there was this
giant nose, and it snorted a line
of trumpet players), and I was
part of the T in E-A-T M-E, but
that's about it. I just stood
around while they did the
Coors thing (spelling out
O-L-Y, playing "Yellow River").
And the light bulbs were a

stupid idea in the first place.
Two huge and bulbous light
bulbs. Stupid idea for the mas
sage parlor thing. Besides,
what you really want to hear
about is the rally after the game
where the all-time record for
drinks in an evening was bro
ken. The old one (2300) was set
after a Nebraska game or
something like that. Anyway,
this was probably the only rally
in band history that was at the
Boulder Hilton Hotel where
the behavior of the audience
was stranger than that of the
performers. They were literally
throwing six packs at us and
climbing up onto the first floor
terrace where we were stand
ing but I wasn't there, so never
mind. . . .

the-UCLA-game-and-then-kill-
him" fund.
Wednesday and Thursday they
didn't do much of anything ex
cept practice a few times until
their lips bled, and try out
the formations, which looked
at that time to be in either Heb
rew or Sanskrit. After that they

played at rallies for polite
alumni, followed by rallies for
slightly tipsy alumni, topped
off by rallies for totally bombed
men and women anxious to tell
everyone within earshot what
the campus looked like before
they built the Quad.
Band members passed the
nights by pledging all the local
fraternities, or by wandering
the.streets in small groups, re
enacting key scenes from "A
Clockwork Orange." Nobody
seemed particularly worried by
the fact that they had been
consistently unable to stand in
anything resembling a straight
line. . . .
On game day they rose (in
credibly) and took to the
field for a final (worse than
ever) rehearsal. It was a lot of
fun. CU administrative officials
had generously allowed for a
whopping one hour of field
time, during which interval the
completely impartial techni
cians tested the audio system
at maximum volume, playing
Big Eight muzak, counting end
lessly backwards and forwards
from one to five. It bothered
the Band, but they took solace
in the fact that by then it was
too late anyway. . . .
After a short rally for hung
over alumni they went back to
the stadium, which by that time
appeared to be priming for a
billion-person primal therapy
session. They were herded into
the seats reserved for oppos
ing bands (row z, wing y, sec
tion 247).
The first half was boring.
There were several attempts to
cure Ralphie of the stupor in
duced by the drugs given prior
to each game, but it didn't
work. We wanted her to jump
the fence and run rampant
over helpless spectators, but it
didn't work. Damn.
The halftime show went as
follows, more or less. Probably
less though — I never did fi
gure out where the hell I was
supposed to be standing. The
rest of them were perfect, but I
sort of got lost. I know that I
was one of the nose hairs in the
snow formation (there was this
giant nose, and it snorted a line
of trumpet players), and I was
part of the T in E-A-T M-E, but
that's about it. I just stood
around while they did the
Coors thing (spelling out
O-L-Y, playing "Yellow River").
And the light bulbs were a

stupid idea in the first place.
Two huge and bulbous light
bulbs. Stupid idea for the mas
sage parlor thing. Besides,
what you really want to hear
about is the rally after the game
where the all-time record for
drinks in an evening was bro
ken. The old one (2300) was set
after a Nebraska game or
something like that. Anyway,
this was probably the only rally
in band history that was at the
Boulder Hilton Hotel where
the behavior of the audience
was stranger than that of the
performers. They were literally
throwing six packs at us and
climbing up onto the first floor
terrace where we were stand
ing but I wasn't there, so never
mind. . . .
Editor's note: the following is
an unexpurgated interview
with Mr. Nielsen. It was in
itiated by the Daily when he re
fused to continue the article he
had been assigned unless we
promised "zany irreverence"
or "wacky antics."
Daily: Are you all right in there?
JTN: (Barely audible) Oh Lord
Daily: Why don't you open the
door for a while?

JTN: (Shrieking) Listen to me
you little weasels — I saw a
Colorado reporter reduced to
nothing more than a twitching
blob in less than two hours and
you sent me up there for a
whole goddam week! Do you
understand what those people
do to reporters?
Daily: Uh . . .
JTN: Listen to me. I think its a
ritual of theirs, or some kind of
tribal rite. Whenever they find
a reporter they take him away
from everybody else, and they
surround him with those hor
ribly sincere smiles, and know
ing glances. Then they use
peer pressure to make him im
bibe until his brain is the con
sistency of Jello. After that they
take away the little yellow pad,
and the new Pentel Rolling
Writer, and they stare. They
ask "do you feel ill at ease?", or
"would you like to go to the
bathroom?" Then, when the
humiliation is complete, they
begin to give you the true story
of the band, starting in 1840
Daily: Now calm down John.
Get a hold on yourself. Talk
slowly, and tell us something
about the Colorado band. Do

they have a band? Why haven't
you mentioned them?
JTN: O.K. Alright. Yes, Col
orado University has a march
ing band. They are called the
Colorado University Golden
Buffalo Marching Band. They
have clean uniforms, and they
march. They also play music.
The music was a John-Philip-
Sousa-ish version of the theme
from "Rocky," and a partially
unsyncopated rendition of
Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke." It
sounded like a polka. Wait a
minute while I move my leg.
O.K. Go ahead.
Daily: Did you like the Col
orado Band?
JTN: They were good at what
they did. There are people who
like that sort of thing up in the
press box somewhere, and
they were probably satisfied.
Lots of straight lines, and such.
Personally I was hoping for
sniper fire.
Daily: Tell us some more about
the buffalo, John.
JTN: No. No more buffalo.
What the hell is the matter with
you anyway? The buffalo was
grotesque. It smelled, and it
was grotesque. I hate Buffalos
... I remember now. I re
member Al Jardetsky borrow
ing some of Rich Johnson's
No-Doz because they had to
do paperwork, and because
bandspersons kept disappear
ing. I remember Ken Doxsee
loading and unloading the
truck. And Hal was there too.
Hal is the announcer. He sang
to us . . .
Daily: Open the door, please.
JTN: Listen to me. I would not
be surprised to see the band
attacked and destroyed by an
away game some day. They
liked us in CU, but if we ever
play at Texas A&M, or BVU, it
will be different. We'll go out
there to play, and we won't
notice the wide panel vans ap
proaching from either end of
the field. We won't notice until
the doors swing open and the
machine gun fire begins. But
by then it will be too late.
They'll get Jett first, and then
they'll move towards the drum
section . . .

wise to leave him alone.)

True to the spirit of Big Eight
Football, Colorado keeps a
buffalo as a mascot. Not an
idiot in a fur suit though — this
is a real, live, 1100 pound zip
perless beast, with a personal
trailer and guards.
Her name is Ralphie, and
every home game halftime fea
tures an appearance. Harnes
sed and attached to five or six
big cowboy types, she whips
the masses into a paroxysm of
glee by running around the
field. Ralphie occasionally es
capes her handlers, and she
sometimes excretes when she
should W galloping, but these
actions only heighten her mys
tique. CU fans are awfully
proud of their mascot — they
consider it the most rousing
such organism in college foot
ball.
I don't think so. I think Ral
phie met her match two

weekends ago at halftime of
the Colorado-Stanford game. I
saw another beast on the field
that day—one that like Ralphie
was impossible to control. This
one came out of the stands,
making all manner of noises,
a r ranging itself on the field in
positions never before seen in
those parts. It screamed, and
chanted, and offended every
thing in sight. When it left,
reactions varied from stunned
silence to orgiastic frenzy. The
new beast was primal. It was
foul. It was Ralphie unchained.
In short, it was the Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band.
Four days before, they had
converged upon CU in unpre
cedented numbers, arriving
from everywhere in our United
States, despite satanic Utah
one-lane highways and insidi
ous airline champagne break
fasts. It was the first outing of
the season, and as is typically

the case, it was more of a reun
ion than any thing else.
Famous ex-band members
were everywhere. There was
Bruce Goldstein, with a hair
line and demeanor that gave
away his Rose Bowl status in an
instant. There was Scott Setra
kian, of gorilla suit fame. Also
Ron Zuritsky, the man who
single-handedly out-decibeled
the entire Michigan mel
lophone corps. Even Dave Dew
appeared — that notorious
King of the Old Farts, a man
known far and wide for his wil
lingness to Test his Toyota on
any golf course near Penn
State. Add to this the usual as
sortment of ringers, con
cubines, and total strangers
and you'll have a pretty good
idea of the size and nature of
the gathering.
After catering nimbly to the
lascivious pleasings of the first

practice in months, they
moved to the field house and
got to work. Wednesday night
saw a marathon SMUT (Stan
ford Marching Unit Thinkers)
session, in which those re
sponsible for inventing a show
attempted to discover a way to
slander Adolph Coors without
getting sued. Other potential
targets included:
—Alfred E. Packard, former
local known for his habit of eat
ing other human beings.
—Harry Reems, another
local whose cannibalism takes
slightly different form (he is
usually the victim).
—Hunter S. Thompson, the
renowned neoclassical poet
from Colorado Springs.
—Levitz Furniture.
Still, Coors was irrestible. He
attends every CU home game,
and his brewery workers are on
strike, creating the kind of vol
atile, touchy situation which
LSJUMB loves to prod.
After six or so hours of dis
cussion a show began to take
shape. It would be an all Col
orado routine, with tributes to
Coors, Packard, snow, and a
local controversy precipitated
by a legislative plan to install a
light bulb in every room of
every massage parlor in Boul
der. Provided Idi Amin lived, it
would run as it stood in three
days. . . .
But Idi was a problem. The
Band got news early on that he
was in a coma, and since death
shows are a specialty, they
were ready at any moment to
dump the whole thing and start
over. When he lived, they
proposed a "save-ldi-until
the-UCLA-game-and-then-kill-
him" fund.

proud of their mascot — they
consider it the most rousing

I don't think so. I think Ral
phie met her match two

weekends ago at halftime of
the Colorado-Stanford game. I
saw another beast on the field
that day—one that like Ralphie
was impossible to control. This
one came out of the stands,
making all manner of noises,
a r ranging itself on the field in
positions never before seen in
those parts. It screamed, and
chanted, and offended every
thing in sight. When it left,
reactions varied from stunned
silence to orgiastic frenzy. The
new beast was primal. It was
foul. It was Ralphie unchained.
In short, it was the Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band.
Four days before, they had
converged upon CU in unpre
cedented numbers, arriving
from everywhere in our United
States, despite satanic Utah
one-lane highways and insidi
ous airline champagne break
fasts. It was the first outing of
the season, and as is typically

the case, it was more of a reun
ion than any thing else.
Famous ex-band members
were everywhere. There was
Bruce Goldstein, with a hair
line and demeanor that gave
away his Rose Bowl status in an
instant. There was Scott Setra
kian, of gorilla suit fame. Also
Ron Zuritsky, the man who
single-handedly out-decibeled
the entire Michigan mel
lophone corps. Even Dave Dew
appeared — that notorious
King of the Old Farts, a man
known far and wide for his wil
lingness to Test his Toyota on
any golf course near Penn
State. Add to this the usual as
sortment of ringers, con
cubines, and total strangers
and you'll have a pretty good
idea of the size and nature of
the gathering.

practice in months, they
moved to the field house and
got to work. Wednesday night
saw a marathon SMUT (Stan
ford Marching Unit Thinkers)
session, in which those re
sponsible for inventing a show
attempted to discover a way to
slander Adolph Coors without
getting sued. Other potential
targets included:
—Alfred E. Packard, former
local known for his habit of eat
ing other human beings.
—Harry Reems, another
local whose cannibalism takes
slightly different form (he is
usually the victim).
—Hunter S. Thompson, the
renowned neoclassical poet
from Colorado Springs.
—Levitz Furniture.
Still, Coors was irrestible. He
attends every CU home game,
and his brewery workers are on
strike, creating the kind of vol
atile, touchy situation which
LSJUMB loves to prod.
After six or so hours of dis
cussion a show began to take
shape. It would be an all Col
orado routine, with tributes to
Coors, Packard, snow, and a
local controversy precipitated
by a legislative plan to install a
light bulb in every room of
every massage parlor in Boul
der. Provided Idi Amin lived, it
would run as it stood in three
days. . . .
But Idi was a problem. The
Band got news early on that he
was in a coma, and since death
shows are a specialty, they
were ready at any moment to
dump the whole thing and start
over. When he lived, they
proposed a "save-ldi-until
the-UCLA-game-and-then-kill-
him" fund.
Wednesday and Thursday they
didn't do much of anything ex
cept practice a few times until
their lips bled, and try out
the formations, which looked
at that time to be in either Heb
rew or Sanskrit. After that they

played at rallies for polite
alumni, followed by rallies for
slightly tipsy alumni, topped
off by rallies for totally bombed
men and women anxious to tell
everyone within earshot what
the campus looked like before
they built the Quad.
Band members passed the
nights by pledging all the local
fraternities, or by wandering
the.streets in small groups, re
enacting key scenes from "A
Clockwork Orange." Nobody
seemed particularly worried by
the fact that they had been
consistently unable to stand in
anything resembling a straight
line. . . .
On game day they rose (in
credibly) and took to the
field for a final (worse than
ever) rehearsal. It was a lot of
fun. CU administrative officials
had generously allowed for a
whopping one hour of field
time, during which interval the
completely impartial techni
cians tested the audio system
at maximum volume, playing
Big Eight muzak, counting end
lessly backwards and forwards
from one to five. It bothered
the Band, but they took solace
in the fact that by then it was
too late anyway. . . .
After a short rally for hung
over alumni they went back to
the stadium, which by that time
appeared to be priming for a
billion-person primal therapy
session. They were herded into
the seats reserved for oppos
ing bands (row z, wing y, sec
tion 247).
The first half was boring.
There were several attempts to
cure Ralphie of the stupor in
duced by the drugs given prior
to each game, but it didn't
work. We wanted her to jump
the fence and run rampant
over helpless spectators, but it
didn't work. Damn.
The halftime show went as
follows, more or less. Probably
less though — I never did fi
gure out where the hell I was
supposed to be standing. The
rest of them were perfect, but I
sort of got lost. I know that I
was one of the nose hairs in the
snow formation (there was this
giant nose, and it snorted a line
of trumpet players), and I was
part of the T in E-A-T M-E, but
that's about it. I just stood
around while they did the
Coors thing (spelling out
O-L-Y, playing "Yellow River").
And the light bulbs were a

stupid idea in the first place.
Two huge and bulbous light
bulbs. Stupid idea for the mas
sage parlor thing. Besides,
what you really want to hear
about is the rally after the game
where the all-time record for
drinks in an evening was bro
ken. The old one (2300) was set
after a Nebraska game or
something like that. Anyway,
this was probably the only rally
in band history that was at the
Boulder Hilton Hotel where
the behavior of the audience
was stranger than that of the
performers. They were literally
throwing six packs at us and
climbing up onto the first floor
terrace where we were stand
ing but I wasn't there, so never
mind. . . .
Editor's note: the following is
an unexpurgated interview
with Mr. Nielsen. It was in
itiated by the Daily when he re
fused to continue the article he
had been assigned unless we
promised "zany irreverence"
or "wacky antics."
Daily: Are you all right in there?
JTN: (Barely audible) Oh Lord
Daily: Why don't you open the
door for a while?

JTN: (Shrieking) Listen to me
you little weasels — I saw a
Colorado reporter reduced to
nothing more than a twitching
blob in less than two hours and
you sent me up there for a
whole goddam week! Do you
understand what those people
do to reporters?
Daily: Uh . . .
JTN: Listen to me. I think its a
ritual of theirs, or some kind of
tribal rite. Whenever they find
a reporter they take him away
from everybody else, and they
surround him with those hor
ribly sincere smiles, and know
ing glances. Then they use
peer pressure to make him im
bibe until his brain is the con
sistency of Jello. After that they
take away the little yellow pad,
and the new Pentel Rolling
Writer, and they stare. They
ask "do you feel ill at ease?", or
"would you like to go to the
bathroom?" Then, when the
humiliation is complete, they
begin to give you the true story
of the band, starting in 1840
Daily: Now calm down John.
Get a hold on yourself. Talk
slowly, and tell us something
about the Colorado band. Do

they have a band? Why haven't
you mentioned them?
JTN: O.K. Alright. Yes, Col
orado University has a march
ing band. They are called the
Colorado University Golden
Buffalo Marching Band. They
have clean uniforms, and they
march. They also play music.
The music was a John-Philip-
Sousa-ish version of the theme
from "Rocky," and a partially
unsyncopated rendition of
Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke." It
sounded like a polka. Wait a
minute while I move my leg.
O.K. Go ahead.
Daily: Did you like the Col
orado Band?
JTN: They were good at what
they did. There are people who
like that sort of thing up in the
press box somewhere, and
they were probably satisfied.
Lots of straight lines, and such.
Personally I was hoping for
sniper fire.
Daily: Tell us some more about
the buffalo, John.
JTN: No. No more buffalo.
What the hell is the matter with
you anyway? The buffalo was
grotesque. It smelled, and it
was grotesque. I hate Buffalos
... I remember now. I re
member Al Jardetsky borrow
ing some of Rich Johnson's
No-Doz because they had to
do paperwork, and because
bandspersons kept disappear
ing. I remember Ken Doxsee
loading and unloading the
truck. And Hal was there too.
Hal is the announcer. He sang
to us . . .
Daily: Open the door, please.
JTN: Listen to me. I would not
be surprised to see the band
attacked and destroyed by an
away game some day. They
liked us in CU, but if we ever
play at Texas A&M, or BVU, it
will be different. We'll go out
there to play, and we won't
notice the wide panel vans ap
proaching from either end of
the field. We won't notice until
the doors swing open and the
machine gun fire begins. But
by then it will be too late.
They'll get Jett first, and then
they'll move towards the drum
section . . .

point. Mr. Nielsen's voice was
nothing more than a low gar
ble, and we thought it might be
wise to leave him alone.)

about the Colorado band. Do

they have a band? Why haven't
you mentioned them?
JTN: O.K. Alright. Yes, Col
orado University has a march
ing band. They are called the
Colorado University Golden
Buffalo Marching Band. They
have clean uniforms, and they
march. They also play music.
The music was a John-Philip-

from "Rocky," and a partially
unsyncopated rendition of
Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke." It
sounded like a polka. Wait a
minute while I move my leg.
O.K. Go ahead.
Daily: Did you like the Col
orado Band?

will be different. We'll go out

True to the spirit of Big Eight
Football, Colorado keeps a
buffalo as a mascot. Not an
idiot in a fur suit though — this
is a real, live, 1100 pound zip
perless beast, with a personal
trailer and guards.
Her name is Ralphie, and
every home game halftime fea
tures an appearance. Harnes
sed and attached to five or six
big cowboy types, she whips
the masses into a paroxysm of
glee by running around the
field. Ralphie occasionally es
capes her handlers, and she
sometimes excretes when she
should W galloping, but these
actions only heighten her mys
tique. CU fans are awfully
proud of their mascot — they
consider it the most rousing
such organism in college foot
ball.
I don't think so. I think Ral
phie met her match two

weekends ago at halftime of
the Colorado-Stanford game. I
saw another beast on the field
that day—one that like Ralphie
was impossible to control. This
one came out of the stands,
making all manner of noises,
a r ranging itself on the field in
positions never before seen in
those parts. It screamed, and
chanted, and offended every
thing in sight. When it left,
reactions varied from stunned
silence to orgiastic frenzy. The
new beast was primal. It was
foul. It was Ralphie unchained.
In short, it was the Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band.
Four days before, they had
converged upon CU in unpre
cedented numbers, arriving
from everywhere in our United
States, despite satanic Utah
one-lane highways and insidi
ous airline champagne break
fasts. It was the first outing of
the season, and as is typically

the case, it was more of a reun
ion than any thing else.
Famous ex-band members
were everywhere. There was
Bruce Goldstein, with a hair
line and demeanor that gave
away his Rose Bowl status in an
instant. There was Scott Setra
kian, of gorilla suit fame. Also
Ron Zuritsky, the man who
single-handedly out-decibeled
the entire Michigan mel
lophone corps. Even Dave Dew
appeared — that notorious
King of the Old Farts, a man
known far and wide for his wil
lingness to Test his Toyota on
any golf course near Penn
State. Add to this the usual as
sortment of ringers, con
cubines, and total strangers
and you'll have a pretty good
idea of the size and nature of
the gathering.
After catering nimbly to the
lascivious pleasings of the first

practice in months, they
moved to the field house and
got to work. Wednesday night
saw a marathon SMUT (Stan
ford Marching Unit Thinkers)
session, in which those re
sponsible for inventing a show
attempted to discover a way to
slander Adolph Coors without
getting sued. Other potential
targets included:
—Alfred E. Packard, former
local known for his habit of eat
ing other human beings.
—Harry Reems, another
local whose cannibalism takes
slightly different form (he is
usually the victim).
—Hunter S. Thompson, the
renowned neoclassical poet
from Colorado Springs.
—Levitz Furniture.
Still, Coors was irrestible. He
attends every CU home game,
and his brewery workers are on
strike, creating the kind of vol
atile, touchy situation which
LSJUMB loves to prod.
After six or so hours of dis
cussion a show began to take
shape. It would be an all Col
orado routine, with tributes to
Coors, Packard, snow, and a
local controversy precipitated
by a legislative plan to install a
light bulb in every room of
every massage parlor in Boul
der. Provided Idi Amin lived, it
would run as it stood in three
days. . . .
But Idi was a problem. The
Band got news early on that he
was in a coma, and since death
shows are a specialty, they
were ready at any moment to
dump the whole thing and start
over. When he lived, they
proposed a "save-ldi-until
the-UCLA-game-and-then-kill-
him" fund.
Wednesday and Thursday they
didn't do much of anything ex
cept practice a few times until
their lips bled, and try out
the formations, which looked
at that time to be in either Heb
rew or Sanskrit. After that they

played at rallies for polite
alumni, followed by rallies for
slightly tipsy alumni, topped
off by rallies for totally bombed
men and women anxious to tell
everyone within earshot what
the campus looked like before
they built the Quad.
Band members passed the
nights by pledging all the local
fraternities, or by wandering
the.streets in small groups, re
enacting key scenes from "A
Clockwork Orange." Nobody
seemed particularly worried by
the fact that they had been
consistently unable to stand in
anything resembling a straight
line. . . .
On game day they rose (in
credibly) and took to the
field for a final (worse than
ever) rehearsal. It was a lot of
fun. CU administrative officials
had generously allowed for a
whopping one hour of field
time, during which interval the
completely impartial techni
cians tested the audio system
at maximum volume, playing
Big Eight muzak, counting end
lessly backwards and forwards
from one to five. It bothered
the Band, but they took solace
in the fact that by then it was
too late anyway. . . .
After a short rally for hung
over alumni they went back to
the stadium, which by that time
appeared to be priming for a
billion-person primal therapy
session. They were herded into
the seats reserved for oppos
ing bands (row z, wing y, sec
tion 247).
The first half was boring.
There were several attempts to
cure Ralphie of the stupor in
duced by the drugs given prior
to each game, but it didn't
work. We wanted her to jump
the fence and run rampant
over helpless spectators, but it
didn't work. Damn.
The halftime show went as
follows, more or less. Probably
less though — I never did fi
gure out where the hell I was
supposed to be standing. The
rest of them were perfect, but I
sort of got lost. I know that I
was one of the nose hairs in the
snow formation (there was this
giant nose, and it snorted a line
of trumpet players), and I was
part of the T in E-A-T M-E, but
that's about it. I just stood
around while they did the
Coors thing (spelling out
O-L-Y, playing "Yellow River").
And the light bulbs were a

stupid idea in the first place.
Two huge and bulbous light
bulbs. Stupid idea for the mas
sage parlor thing. Besides,
what you really want to hear
about is the rally after the game
where the all-time record for
drinks in an evening was bro
ken. The old one (2300) was set
after a Nebraska game or
something like that. Anyway,
this was probably the only rally
in band history that was at the
Boulder Hilton Hotel where
the behavior of the audience
was stranger than that of the
performers. They were literally
throwing six packs at us and
climbing up onto the first floor
terrace where we were stand
ing but I wasn't there, so never
mind. . . .
Editor's note: the following is
an unexpurgated interview
with Mr. Nielsen. It was in

or "wacky antics."
Daily: Are you all right in there?
JTN: (Barely audible) Oh Lord
Daily: Why don't you open the

JTN: (Shrieking) Listen to me
you little weasels — I saw a
Colorado reporter reduced to
nothing more than a twitching
blob in less than two hours and
you sent me up there for a
whole goddam week! Do you
understand what those people
do to reporters?
Daily: Uh . . .
JTN: Listen to me. I think its a
ritual of theirs, or some kind of
tribal rite. Whenever they find
a reporter they take him away
from everybody else, and they
surround him with those hor
ribly sincere smiles, and know
ing glances. Then they use
peer pressure to make him im
bibe until his brain is the con
sistency of Jello. After that they
take away the little yellow pad,
and the new Pentel Rolling
Writer, and they stare. They
ask "do you feel ill at ease?", or
