# At Boulder with LSJUMB; a strange and terrible saga

True to the spirit of Big Eight
Football, Colorado keeps a
buffalo as a mascot. Not an
idiot in a fur suit though — this
is a real, live, 1100 pound zip
perless beast, with a personal
trailer and guards.
Her name is Ralphie, and
every home game halftime fea
tures an appearance. Harnes
sed and attached to five or six
big cowboy types, she whips
the masses into a paroxysm of
glee by running around the
field. Ralphie occasionally es
capes her handlers, and she
sometimes excretes when she
should W galloping, but these
actions only heighten her mys
tique. CU fans are awfully
proud of their mascot — they
consider it the most rousing
such organism in college foot
ball.
I don't think so. I think Ral
phie met her match two

weekends ago at halftime of
the Colorado-Stanford game. I
saw another beast on the field
that day—one that like Ralphie
was impossible to control. This
one came out of the stands,
making all manner of noises,
a r ranging itself on the field in
positions never before seen in
those parts. It screamed, and
chanted, and offended every
thing in sight. When it left,
reactions varied from stunned
silence to orgiastic frenzy. The
new beast was primal. It was
foul. It was Ralphie unchained.
In short, it was the Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band.
Four days before, they had
converged upon CU in unpre
cedented numbers, arriving
from everywhere in our United
States, despite satanic Utah
one-lane highways and insidi
ous airline champagne break
fasts. It was the first outing of
the season, and as is typically

the case, it was more of a reun
ion than any thing else.
Famous ex-band members
were everywhere. There was
Bruce Goldstein, with a hair
line and demeanor that gave
away his Rose Bowl status in an
instant. There was Scott Setra
kian, of gorilla suit fame. Also
Ron Zuritsky, the man who
single-handedly out-decibeled
the entire Michigan mel
lophone corps. Even Dave Dew
appeared — that notorious
King of the Old Farts, a man
known far and wide for his wil
lingness to Test his Toyota on
any golf course near Penn
State. Add to this the usual as
sortment of ringers, con
cubines, and total strangers
and you'll have a pretty good
idea of the size and nature of
the gathering.
After catering nimbly to the
lascivious pleasings of the first


Stanford's half-brassed crusaders (shown above at their
most fearful and loathsome) recently left a mark on the
