# Health care involved
## Bakke a poor test case 
### 
David Sartoris

The upcoming Supreme Court de
cision on the controversial civil rights
case of the University of California
vs. Bakke will undoubtedly have sig
nificant influence on affirmative ac
tion programs in many areas of
nationwide education and employ
ment.
This fact, compounded by Presi
dent Carter's repeatedly proclaimed
dedication to improved educational
and job opportunities for women
and racial minorities, makes it highly
likely that the Court will rule against
the concept of "reverse discrimina
tion."
However, careful analysis of the
Bakke case reveals that medical
school admission constitutes a poor
testing ground for equal rights in
general.
In most areas of employment or
educational opportunity, individual
advancement is the major factor at
stake. These settings clearly warrant
special consideration for women and
minorities in order to overcome per
sonal prejudices which might other
wise lead to their unfair exclusion.
In such situations, only the indi

vidual employer or educational in
stitution stands to lose from accep
tance of a perhaps less-qualified in
dividual as required by the affirma
tive action concept.
Additional factors
On the other hand, medical school
admission involves several addi
tional factors shared by all public
service-related entities. The purpose
of a medical school is to train physi
cians — individuals whose primary
concern is the health of others — not
to provide for individual advance
ment.
The nature of the doctor's role in
society is such that basing medical
school admission on anything but
qualitications is detrimental to the
public as a whole.
The unique nature of medical
school admissions as applied to the
affirmative action controversy is
clearly emphasized via a useful anal
ogy. It is obviously beneficial to en
courage the hiring of physically
handicapped individuals (a group
which presently constitutes an im
portant minority in American soci
ety) by private employers for tasks of

which they are capable.
However, a blind police officer or
quadriplegic firefighter is clearly not
in the best interests of the public pro
tection demanded by these occupa
tions.
No hard data
The argument is commonly raised
that increased minority admissions
will help to alleviate the current shor
tage of physicians in rural and inner
city areas. However, there is pre
sently no hard data to support this
simple solution to an important
problem.
Until such a contention is proven,
medical schools should admit
applicants who are likely to become
good doctors, requesting age, sex,
and racial data only after the fact.
Thus, it is unfortunate that the
Supreme Court will be fighting the
right battle on the wrong battlefield
next month as it deals with the affir
mative action controversy.
The preceding remarks emphasize
that the University of California
Bakke case is poorly representative
of the overall discrimination prob
lem and that a "reverse influence"
effect may be detrimental to national
health care in the long run.
Clearly, discrimination, reverse or
otherwise, has no place in the pro
cess of gaining acceptance to medi
cal school.
