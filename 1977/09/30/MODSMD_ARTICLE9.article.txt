Cheer for falling scores
Hurray for falling SAT scores! I
couldn't stand the sight of a book for
two years after high school; it took
me that long to recover â€” to "get
through to my own head" and finally
discover what I, and not some school
fool, wanted and needed me to
study.
My years in public school were a
horrendous waste of my time and a
reprehensible handicap to my artistic
and intellectual development. Down
with these disguised concentration
camps which smother all creativity
and innocent, vital, vulnerable inspi
ration.

Band offensive
I generally enjoy the antics, wit,
and pizazz of the band and its
halftime performances. However,
last Saturday's show was marred by a
needlessly offensive display of gutter
humor that simply was not funny.
Everyone near us in the stands was
moaning, not laughing. The graphic
numbers were especially inapprop
riate on the occasion of the Ernie
Nevers tribute.
Please show a bit more class and
perhaps judgment next time. The
game was great.
