Fk£ND OF THE FAMILY
A lot of American families are bringing home a friendly Euro
pean. The Batavus MoPed.
It's sporty and fun to ride; delivers up to 150 miles to the gallon
and seldom needs servicing. It has pedals for a boost over the steepest
hills. And it has a step-through frame so mothers, fathers, and teen-agers
can get on with ease.
In fact, it's so easy to get on, the biggest problem may be tiying
to keep the rest of the family off. M«VIH P|j^
