# LSJUMB offers its perspectives
## 
### 
The early morning fog dis
solves to reveal gently sloping
foothills basking in the bright
noontime sun. Vacant benches
gradually fill with anxious fans,
each one tense with anticipa
tion of what is to occur.
The faint odor of burning
herbs confirms their arrival.
Showing amazing coordina
tion in the face of massive brain
cell destruction, the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
flows onto the field, to the de
light of students, to the disgust
of alums and to the horror of
ABC lawyers.
With all the subtlety of a
rhinoceros in heat, the
LSJUMB invades the field for
today's pregame presentation
entitled "Why TV Upsets the
Timing in Your Microwave
Oven." The Band runs to form
the mark of network execu
tives nationwide the Axe
and plays its traditional "Fan
fare," followed by the even
more traditional "Come Join
the Band." Having dispensed
with the dirty work, the In
comparables meander into
formation, depicting the sym
bol of TV's Wednesday night
spiritual offering.
Judging by their Nielsen rat
ings, even Charlie would have
to admit, they're "Everybody's
Everything." Not yet ready to
pull out, the Band keeps on
plugging by spelling out TV's
latest presentation to the keen
mind of the American public.
In conclusion, the Band
speeds to its well-known USA
formation, patiently awaiting
.an ABC cue to begin Arthur P.
Barnes' famed arrangement of

"The Star Spangled Banner."
The LSJUMB leaves the field to
the strains of "Yellow River."
Just gearing up for their next
engagement on Polk Street in
San Francisco, the "nattering
nabobs of novelty" return,
center-stadium, for a soon to
be forgotten halftime presen
tation entitled "Being Gay is
Really a Drag."
In response to recent ploys
of migrant farm workers near
the Bay Area, the Band forms
an apple, a pear and a cherry to
acknowledge the fact that
there is a bit of fruit in all of us.
On the Stanford campus, at
least, there are more fruits than
vegetables, and the Band ap
propriately plays "Knowing Me
Knowing You."
With the letters H-O-M-E the
LSJUMB would like to remind
all that home can mean more
than just mom and apple pie.
Many a "Wayward Son" has
been exiled frojri the place of
his very origins.
Next, the Band would like to
say hello to the Oregon fans
and the viewing audience by
forming two gargantuan, sweet
and enticing navel oranges.
The song is a message to that
great crusader Anita Bryant
who provides all of us with
"More Than A Feeling."
Finally, the Band would like
to offer a word of encourage
ment to everyone. In the face
of fierce attacks on their cho
sen sexual endeavors, many
are still determined to
C-O-M-E O-U-T because, as
they feel, "There Ain't Nothin'
Stoppin' Us Now!"

After the Stanford Band members bounce and weave their way into the stadium
(above), they often limber up for the day's activities with a couple of calisthenics.
