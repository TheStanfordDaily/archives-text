# Cardinal assistant
## Dowhower knows his stuff 
### David Georgette 
Throwing the football
that's how the Stanford offense
has been moving the pigskin
since the days of Frankie Al
bert.
But there've been some
changes and alterations in the
forward pass through the
years, and this season new
head coach Bill Walsh has in
stalled his philosophy in the
Card pass offense.
The man who Walsh selected
to help implement his offense
is Rod Dowhower, whose 12-
year coaching career has
brought him into contact with
many fine offensive players
and coaches.
Dowhower said the Cardinal
attack is "coach Walsh's of
fense that he's developed over
a period of time." Dowhower,
as receiver coach, is therefore
most involved in Walsh's over
all offensive strategy. "As assis
tants, we have to teach the
players the fundamentals and
assignments to complete the
game plan," Dowhower said.
The 34-year-old Dowhower
came to the Farm from Boise
State, where as the offensive
coordinator he directed the
most potent offense in the Big
Sky Conference.
"He has a national reputa
tion as a football coach," said
Walsh of his assistant. "He's
worked with some of the top
men in the field, and he was
highly recommended."
Dowhower got his start in
major college football and
coaching at San Diego State
with Don Coryell. A transfer
from Santa Barbara City Col
lege, Dowhower quarter
backed the Aztecs for two sea
sons before getting a tryout in
the pros with San Francisco.
Alma mater
When Dowhower was cut
from the 49ers, he returned to
San Diego State in 1966 where
"I coached for free for about
four years," he said.
While coaching, Dowhower
also continued his education,
earning his teaching credential
in 1968 and later adding a mas
ter's degree in history from Un
ited States International Uni
versity in 1970.
Under Coryell, Dowhower
worked with offensive stand
outs Haven Moses, Isaac Cur
tis, Jesse Freitas, Don Horn and
Brian Sipe. And when Coryell
moved into the NFL as head
coach at St. Louis, Dowhower

went along as quarterback and
receiver coach.
A year later, Dowhower re
turned to the college ranks as
offensive coordinator for Dick
Vermeil at UCLA. "It was a mat
ter of wanting to live in Califor
nia and be by the coast,"
Dowhower said. "My family
and I just like being in the
sun."
Assisting Vermeil at UCLA,
Dowhower was exposed to a
different style of offense.
"When I went to UCLA, we
were going to throw but our
quarterback turned out to be
John Sciarra," he said. Because
Sciarra was a better runner
than a passer, the Bruins instal
led an option offense.
Dowhower said that where
ver a coach works, "You always
learn something. At UCLA, I
learned something about foot
ball (the option) I'd never given
much thought to before."
Contrasts
Having worked in the pros
and collegiate football,
Dowhower has witnessed
many of the recent trends in
football.
In college footbalt, for

instance, good passing teams
are rare. "Today the option is
the big deal on offense," he
said. "But people are begin
ning to run the option from
formations that go well with
play-action passing. It's a mat
ter really, more than any
thing else, of what you do best
as a coach and what kind of
players you have. When you
run an option, you better have
an offensive line which can
knock people off the ball."
In Stanford's case, "The flex
ibility of the offense is the key
to its success, and of course,
the quarterback and receivers
we have. You don't get bored
like you might with the op
tion." *
In comparing college foot
ball to the pros, Dowhower
said, "Pro football players are
very conscientious. It's their
living and a full-time job. Col
lege football is not as concen
trated. The players go to
school. They concentrate on
the field, but it's not a living."
For a college player, football
may not be a living, but for
Dowhower, it's been that and
more.

that's how the Stanford offense
has been moving the pigskin
since the days of Frankie Al
bert.
But there've been some
changes and alterations in the
forward pass through the
years, and this season new
head coach Bill Walsh has in
stalled his philosophy in the
Card pass offense.
The man who Walsh selected
to help implement his offense
is Rod Dowhower, whose 12-
year coaching career has
brought him into contact with
many fine offensive players
and coaches.
Dowhower said the Cardinal
attack is "coach Walsh's of
fense that he's developed over
a period of time." Dowhower,
as receiver coach, is therefore
most involved in Walsh's over
all offensive strategy. "As assis
tants, we have to teach the
players the fundamentals and
assignments to complete the
game plan," Dowhower said.
The 34-year-old Dowhower
came to the Farm from Boise
State, where as the offensive
coordinator he directed the
most potent offense in the Big
Sky Conference.
"He has a national reputa
tion as a football coach," said
Walsh of his assistant. "He's
worked with some of the top
men in the field, and he was
highly recommended."
Dowhower got his start in
major college football and
coaching at San Diego State
with Don Coryell. A transfer
from Santa Barbara City Col
lege, Dowhower quarter
backed the Aztecs for two sea
sons before getting a tryout in
the pros with San Francisco.
Alma mater
When Dowhower was cut
from the 49ers, he returned to
San Diego State in 1966 where
"I coached for free for about
four years," he said.
While coaching, Dowhower
also continued his education,
earning his teaching credential
in 1968 and later adding a mas
ter's degree in history from Un
ited States International Uni
versity in 1970.
Under Coryell, Dowhower
worked with offensive stand
outs Haven Moses, Isaac Cur
tis, Jesse Freitas, Don Horn and
Brian Sipe. And when Coryell
moved into the NFL as head
coach at St. Louis, Dowhower

went along as quarterback and
receiver coach.
A year later, Dowhower re
turned to the college ranks as
offensive coordinator for Dick
Vermeil at UCLA. "It was a mat
ter of wanting to live in Califor
nia and be by the coast,"
Dowhower said. "My family
and I just like being in the
sun."
Assisting Vermeil at UCLA,
Dowhower was exposed to a
different style of offense.
"When I went to UCLA, we
were going to throw but our
quarterback turned out to be
John Sciarra," he said. Because
Sciarra was a better runner
than a passer, the Bruins instal
led an option offense.
Dowhower said that where
ver a coach works, "You always
learn something. At UCLA, I
learned something about foot
ball (the option) I'd never given
much thought to before."
Contrasts
Having worked in the pros
and collegiate football,
Dowhower has witnessed
many of the recent trends in
football.
In college footbalt, for

instance, good passing teams
are rare. "Today the option is
the big deal on offense," he
said. "But people are begin
ning to run the option from
formations that go well with
play-action passing. It's a mat
ter really, more than any
thing else, of what you do best
as a coach and what kind of
players you have. When you
run an option, you better have
an offensive line which can
knock people off the ball."
In Stanford's case, "The flex
ibility of the offense is the key
to its success, and of course,
the quarterback and receivers
we have. You don't get bored
like you might with the op
tion." *
In comparing college foot
ball to the pros, Dowhower
said, "Pro football players are
very conscientious. It's their
living and a full-time job. Col
lege football is not as concen
trated. The players go to
school. They concentrate on
the field, but it's not a living."
For a college player, football
may not be a living, but for
Dowhower, it's been that and
more.
