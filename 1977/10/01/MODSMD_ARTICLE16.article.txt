By surveying the defense prior to the snap, a quarterback gets
idea of what type pass coverage he will be facing. With the needed
protection from the offensive line, the quarterback has the time
to find an open receiver and deliver a catch able pass. A leaping grab in
the back of the endzone finishes the play - and puts six more points
on the board.
