# Berkeley's Bears are looking golden
## 
### 
While Stanford and Oregon
are deciding which team is
going to have a perfect mark in
conference play, across the
Bay the California Golden
Bears wiH be trying to keep
their overall record perfect.
The Bears are 3-0 with wins
over Tennessee, Air Force and
Missouri their best start
since 1968. The last time Cal
opened with four straight wins
was 1952, and San Jose State
(1-2) will be trying to keep the
Bears from matching that mark
today.
Two of the reasons Cal is un
defeated are quarterback Char
lie Young and setback Paul
Jones. Young, a transfer from
Pierce Junior College in South
ern California, is sixth in the
conference in total offense.
Jones is second in rushing, av
eraging nearly 125 yards per
game.
The other three conference
members in action this after
noon are also playing noncon
ference foes, seeking to im
prove the Pac-B's 13-9 noncon
ference record. Five of those
losses have been by less than a
touchdown.

Oregon State is in Knoxville
for the first-ever grid meeting
with Tennessee. The Beavers,
though 1-2, lost by a
touchdown to USC and were
upended in the final minute by
Arizona State last Saturday,
33-31.
Disappointments
The two Pac-8 teams which
have been the biggest disap
pointments so far have a
chance to gain a win and
some confidence against Big
10 teams.
The UCLA Bruins, staggering
with a 1-2 mark and hampered
with injuries to key personnel,
entertain lowa in the Coliseum
tonight. The Hawkeyes have
defeated UCLA only once in
the six-garne series.
Meanwhile, the Washington
Huskies are pitted against the
team which upset the Bruins
last week the Minnesota
Golden Gophers. Washington
put on a "Husky Fever" cam
paign this summer to drum up
support for the Dogs, but their
1-2 record would tend to indi
cate that the players must have
caught something instead.
