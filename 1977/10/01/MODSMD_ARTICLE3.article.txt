# Oregon's improved under Brooks
## Ducks fly south for league opener 
### David Georgette 
This season for the Oregon Duck football program has been
billed "The Dawning of a New Day," arid although the Ducks' 1-2
record falls short of being a brilliant sunrise, things are brighter in
the Willamette Valley.
New coach Rich Brooks left his assistant coaching position at
UCLA to take over for the deposed Don Read, and brought with
him plans for turning the Ducks into a ground threat with an
option-based attack.
Things didn't go as planned, but the Ducks are nevertheless
improved. And when Oregon and Stanford (2-1) tangle in this
afternoon's televised Pacific-8 Conference opener for both teams,
Oregon quarterback Jack Henderson will probably put the ball in
the air just as often as Stanford passer Guy Benjamin.
The reason the Ducks have returned to the airways is because
the ground game has not come around. Oregon is averaging only
125 yards rushing per game.
Though Brooks said, "We've improved Oregon's ground game
over last year," even the Ducks' best performance did not satisfy
him. "We rushed for 194 yards against TCU," Brooks said, "and
that's nothing to brag about."
The Ducks held off a late charge by the Horned Frogs to win that
game 29-24, following their opening loss at Georgia and prior to
last week's 22-10 setback at home by Wisconsin.
The Ducks have been playing better, but Brooks wants more
than coming close before losing. "We've looked better losing," he
said, "but I'm not interested in that. I'd rather look bad and win."
One of Brooks' preseason hopes has gone according to plan,
though. "Quarterback should be our strongest position," he said
during the summer, and Henderson, a 6-foot-1 senior from nearby
Woodside, has lived up to his coach's predictions.
He is fourth in the conference in total offense, completings3 per
cent of his passes for 546 yards.
Henderson's top targets are 6-1 senior flanker Tom Cafferty (13
catches) and junior split end Ken Page. The 5-11 Page has had
catches for 70 and 60 yards this season.
Passes to lead
The Cards' Benjamin, meanwhile, overtook Washington State's
Jack Thompson for the conference passing leadership with his 30
of 41 effort last Saturday against Illinois.
"Benjamin is by far the best we've seen so far," said Brooks.
"We're gonna have our hands full."
The senior quarterback had plenty of help in passing Thompson.
"Benjamin had outstanding pass protection all day," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh. "Gordon King completely dominated his man. I
don't think I've ever seen a better performance by an offensive
lineman. James Lofton is coming into his own as an outstanding
receiver, and our tight ends all played very well."
Scoring barrage?
Expectations for an offensive donnybrook seem justified then,
right? "That's what the statistics would indicate," said Brooks, "but
oftentimes the game won't turn out like that. Both defenses will
probably play better than they played last week."
Walsh shared the Oregon coach's view. "You can never tell
about these games. I'm sure coach Brooks feels he can stop our
offense.
Walsh said the Cards will try to open up the offense more, but
"we're not going to show everything."
And if a Stanford romp seems in the offing, don't wait for it.
"We're not going to strut around with a 52-7 win," said Walsh.
"That doesn't interest me."
One thing which does interest Walsh is the Cardinal defense. "I
hope our defense can come through," he said. "We think we are
improving every week, believe it or not."
Return
The defense will be aided by the return of ends Chuck Evans,
Bruce Barker and linebacker Terry Rennaker. All this should
please defensive front coach Fred vonAppen, who coached at
Oregon for five years before joining Walsh's staff.
Playing his former team adds something to the game for vonAp
pen, but any sentimental attachment has been lessened with the
tasks in preparing for the game.
"We (the coaches) are employed by the University to win foot
ball games," vonAppen said, "and your loyalties and interest rest
with your employer."
Offensively the Cards should be bolstered by the return of
fullback Phil Francis, who has been sidelined with tendinitis in his
hip.
The Ducks' tailback, Dennis Bullock, will probably not play, and
Ed Radcliff, who has a six-yard per carry, will start in his place.
Despite the improvement in Oregon football, facing the Ducks
in the conference opener certainly is better than kicking off league
action with UCLA or USC, as the Cards have done for the past five
seasons.
In fact, Stanford hasn't won a Pac-8 opener since 1971 38-17
over Oregon.
