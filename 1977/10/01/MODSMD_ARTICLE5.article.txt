# Henderson air show paces Oregon attack
## Menlo Park native stars 
### Richard Keller 
Year after year, Stanford's
recruiting staff somehow man
ages to snare Oregon's finest
prep talent. Bill Kellar and Phil
Francis are just two of eight
gridders on the current Stan
ford roster who arrived at the
Farm via the "Oregon Trail."
In 1974, Jack Henderson, a
high school standout for
Woodside High School in
nearby Menlo Park, moved
north to become one of the
finest quarterbacks in the his
tory of Oregon football. By the
end of the 1977 campaign,
Henderson should gain sec
ond place in the Duck's all
time passing statistics.
Troy Ratliff, head football
coach at Woodside and Hen
derson's neighbor for many
years, witnessed the
metamorphosis of Henderson
as an athlete.
"He's lived across the street
from me since he was 11 years

old," recalled Ratliff. "As a
young kid he was a baseball
pitcher, so that gave him a
strong arm. But when he came
to Woodside he wasn't that
big. His freshman year was no
thing outstanding."
By the time Henderson was
in his second season, though,
he "grew physically" and
showed "great- improvement"
according to his former men
tor. "You could see the poten
tial was there," remarked Rat
liff.
Henderson's two varsity
years at Woodside resulted in
2903 yards passing and 40
touchdowns. His junior-year
team won the league champ
ionship and then progressed to
the Central Coast Section
(CCS) semifinals.
"I can't say enough about
Jack," continued Ratliff.
"Number one, he has a strong
arm. He always put points on
the board for us. From what

I've seen, he's second only to
Benjamin on the coast. He's
also a fine leader, and was
highly respected by his team
mates," he added.
"Probably hfs major weak
ness," explained Ratliff, "is
that he's not that strong a run
ner. It isn't his lack of ability to
run, it's just that he hasn't had a
chance to do much of it. We
just wanted him to pass the
ball. We didn't want him to get
hurt."
Farm recruit
Until the final week before
letters of intent were offered,
Henderson was recruited by
Stanford. His exodus to Ore
gon was mutually beneficial to
himself and Stanford. Stanford
had enough problems with
finding playing time for two
quarterbacks, Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin, let alone a
third. And Henderson was able
to establish himself as a quality
football player. The 6-foot-1,

195 senior has passed for
nearly 4000 yards in his two
plus years on the Duck's varsity,
squad.
As with most losing teams,
Oregon football has under
gone frequent turnovers In
both the coaching staff and the
offensive set-up. During his
freshman year under coach
Don Read, Henderson was ex
posed to the veer offense,
which involves more
groundwork for the quarter
back. It was Henderson's first
real exposure to running the
football, and it didn't last for
long.
Under Read, Henderson
worked out of the "Pro Set I"
formation. That amounted to
nearly two miles of passing
yardage for the Duck quarter
back. This fall, however, new
coach Rich Brooks has put all
his chips on the veer, the suc
cess of which depends on how
well his quarterback can adapt
to it.
Said Henderson, "I've made
definite progress, but it took
awhile in the spring. I'm not
the greatest option quarter
back and I never will be. I don't
have the size. I'd like to be 6-4,
210, but I'm not."
With such a fine passing
quarterback as Henderson,
one would have to wonder why
the Ducks moved to an offense
that doesn't really complement
the abilities of their signal cal
ler. Henderson offered this
explanation:

"We had to hang our hat on
the pass too often," he said.
"Oregon is not in a position
that it can throw every down,
and it's not in a position where
it can run every down. They
have to complement each
other. Teams like USC and
UCLA can tell the defense what
they're going to do and still do
it, but we can't."
Lost to graduation was Greg
Bauer, Henderson's favorite
target and the number two re
ceiver in the Pac-8 last year.
"Greg was a super receiver,"
said Henderson. "He was
short, didn't have the greatest
hands in the world and wasn't
the quickest receiver in the
world. But he was the smar
test."
Despite the loss of Bauer,
Henderson claims he has more
confidence in his receivers this
year. His current aerial assault
is most frequently aimed at
senior Tom Cafferty and junior
Ken Page. Both are in the top
10 of the Pac-8 with 13 and 10
catches respectively.
Oregon's offensive line has
been "sporadic," according to
Henderson. He claimed that
they can "stack up man for man
physically with any other
team," but that experience and
consistency are lacking.
First test
Stanford has yet to face a
pass-oriented team this fall.
