# He's a walk-on!
## Fox gives Cards a kick 
### Brad Brockbank 
"He's got poise. He's very intelligent. He's an
excellent punter and he's been a real asset to our
team. He operates well under pressure and he's
very consistent, you know, he's all the things
you look for in a punter." - Head football coach
Bill Walsh on Brad Fox.
Bill Walsh got an early Christmas present this
year.
Senior Brad Fox played baseball for most of
his sophomore and junior years at Stanford and
was first on the waiting list for acceptance to an
overseas campus last spring.
After trying spring football, Fox decided to
stay at Stanford. He now boasts a 42.6-yard punt
ing average, the highest average for a Cardinal in
more than a decade.
Merry Christmas, coach Walsh.
"I knew it was a long shot all the way," Fox
said of his chances of making the team this fall as
a walk-on. Why, then, did he try?
"It seemed like there was a little bit of an
opening," Fox said. "Mike Michel had
graduated. They really didn't have an estab
lished kicker returning. They had recruited a
freshman, Ken Naber, and he was the No. 1
kicker. At least, the way it looked, he was the
person I would have to beat out."
r Fox then entered fall camp with only Naber
between himself and the starting job as punter.
Surprise
After camp started, Walsh found himself
somewhat surprised.
"Honestly, we expected Ken Naber to be the
punter. We had four punters come back for fall
practice but it didn't take long to see that Brad
was the best of the four.
"He was a steady punter. He consistently
kicked it some distance. What you have to have
in a kicker is consistently; he can't be great on
one punt and then poor on the next. The aver
age might turn out OK but when you do that,
you never know what's going to happen."
At the end of fall practice, Naber became the
place-kicker and Fox found himself with the
starting punting job.
"I was very pleased, to say the least," Fox
recalled. "It took me awhile to realize that I'd
made it. The first couple of trips seemed like a
dream come true."
For the 6-foot, 165 kicker, who got his start as a
football player on the streets of Winnetka, 111., it
didn't take long to find out what college ball can
sometimes be like. On his first punt attempt
against Colorado, a low snap caused him to mis
handle the ball and forced him to fall on the ball
for a nine-yard loss.
"The snap bounced and I didn't get it
cleanly," Fox said. "It bounced off my shoulder
pad and went down at my feet. By the time I
picked up the ball, they were in on me.
"I wasn't really prepared for that situation. It
kind of caught me by surprise. Once I couldn't
get the kick off, I froze a little bit and didn't

know what to do."
After returning to the sidelines, Fox recalled
that everyone was very understanding.-
Encouragement
"I was feeling pretty low when I came over to
the sidelines and coach Walsh grabbed me as I
was going by and said, 'lt's going to be all right;
you're going to do OK.' That was a real lift."
Apparently it was. His next kick was a 54 yar
der into Colorado's end zone.
Fox said, however, that distance is not the
most important factor in punting.
"Height is what's really important. In my
freshman year (playing junior varsity) my kicks
were long and low. I was outkicking the cover
age. The important statistic that you don't read
about is the net yardage.
"You can have a 50-yard punt, but if they get a
20-yard return, that's only a net 30-yard punt.
You're better off with a shorter kick with better
hang time.
"I try to concentrate on getting the ball high
because if you get a kick good and high, the
distance will follow."
This year Fox said he believes that his hang
time is the strongest aspect of his kicking.
Fox's job does not end with the kick, how
ever.
On defense
"The punt is an offensive play," he explained,
"but it's also a defensive play. As soon as you
kick the ball you're on defense. I play a safety. I
usually cover the left side of the field after the
punt.
"If they've got a big return set up with a wall of
blockers, my job is just to try and fight my way
through there and stall for time. I don't go in
there to try and make a crisp, open field tackle.
We don't practice that and chances are it'll be
some nifty back who's just going to run right
over you.
"The best way to do it is just to get a good
angle and use the field to your advantage by
backing up for a time and trying to make a tackle
that will prevent a touchdown. If you can grab a
jersey to bring a player down all you want is to
stop a touchdown you don't care about
another 10 yards."
The punting play is a unique one to Fox for
another reason as well.
"For me, it's kind of a dilemma. The punting
game goes into play when the offense has not
picked up yardage. So when I see a lot of action,
the offense is not having a good day. Obviously,
I want to go out and participate in the game but
the more I participate, the worse we're doing.
"I'm behind the offense all the way but when
they have trouble, I just go out and try to help as
much as possible with the punt."
Between punts, Fox will just have to continue
spending his time on the sidelines, vyatching the
game, hoping that he can help out but hoping
that have to.

kicker. At least, the way it looked, he was the
person I would have to beat out."
r Fox then entered fall camp with only Naber
between himself and the starting job as punter.
Surprise
After camp started, Walsh found himself
somewhat surprised.
"Honestly, we expected Ken Naber to be the
punter. We had four punters come back for fall
practice but it didn't take long to see that Brad
was the best of the four.
"He was a steady punter. He consistently
kicked it some distance. What you have to have
in a kicker is consistently; he can't be great on
one punt and then poor on the next. The aver
age might turn out OK but when you do that,
you never know what's going to happen."
At the end of fall practice, Naber became the
place-kicker and Fox found himself with the
starting punting job.
"I was very pleased, to say the least," Fox
recalled. "It took me awhile to realize that I'd
made it. The first couple of trips seemed like a
dream come true."
For the 6-foot, 165 kicker, who got his start as a
football player on the streets of Winnetka, 111., it
didn't take long to find out what college ball can
sometimes be like. On his first punt attempt
against Colorado, a low snap caused him to mis
handle the ball and forced him to fall on the ball
for a nine-yard loss.
"The snap bounced and I didn't get it
cleanly," Fox said. "It bounced off my shoulder
pad and went down at my feet. By the time I
picked up the ball, they were in on me.
"I wasn't really prepared for that situation. It
kind of caught me by surprise. Once I couldn't
get the kick off, I froze a little bit and didn't

know what to do."
After returning to the sidelines, Fox recalled
that everyone was very understanding.-
Encouragement
"I was feeling pretty low when I came over to
the sidelines and coach Walsh grabbed me as I
was going by and said, 'lt's going to be all right;
you're going to do OK.' That was a real lift."
Apparently it was. His next kick was a 54 yar
der into Colorado's end zone.
Fox said, however, that distance is not the
most important factor in punting.
"Height is what's really important. In my
freshman year (playing junior varsity) my kicks
were long and low. I was outkicking the cover
age. The important statistic that you don't read
about is the net yardage.
"You can have a 50-yard punt, but if they get a
20-yard return, that's only a net 30-yard punt.
You're better off with a shorter kick with better
hang time.
"I try to concentrate on getting the ball high
because if you get a kick good and high, the
distance will follow."
This year Fox said he believes that his hang
time is the strongest aspect of his kicking.
Fox's job does not end with the kick, how
ever.
On defense
"The punt is an offensive play," he explained,
"but it's also a defensive play. As soon as you
kick the ball you're on defense. I play a safety. I
usually cover the left side of the field after the
punt.
"If they've got a big return set up with a wall of
blockers, my job is just to try and fight my way
through there and stall for time. I don't go in
there to try and make a crisp, open field tackle.
We don't practice that and chances are it'll be
some nifty back who's just going to run right
over you.
"The best way to do it is just to get a good
angle and use the field to your advantage by
backing up for a time and trying to make a tackle
that will prevent a touchdown. If you can grab a
jersey to bring a player down all you want is to
stop a touchdown you don't care about
another 10 yards."
The punting play is a unique one to Fox for
another reason as well.
"For me, it's kind of a dilemma. The punting
game goes into play when the offense has not
picked up yardage. So when I see a lot of action,
the offense is not having a good day. Obviously,
I want to go out and participate in the game but
the more I participate, the worse we're doing.
"I'm behind the offense all the way but when
they have trouble, I just go out and try to help as
much as possible with the punt."
Between punts, Fox will just have to continue
spending his time on the sidelines, vyatching the
game, hoping that he can help out but hoping
that have to.

Punting isn't all that simple, as Stanford kicker Brad Fox knows. Here

any kicks blocked in a game and is maintaining a 42.6 average.
"He's got poise. He's very intelligent. He's an

football player on the streets of Winnetka, 111., it
didn't take long to find out what college ball can
sometimes be like. On his first punt attempt
against Colorado, a low snap caused him to mis
handle the ball and forced him to fall on the ball
for a nine-yard loss.
"The snap bounced and I didn't get it
cleanly," Fox said. "It bounced off my shoulder
pad and went down at my feet. By the time I
picked up the ball, they were in on me.
"I wasn't really prepared for that situation. It
kind of caught me by surprise. Once I couldn't
get the kick off, I froze a little bit and didn't

know what to do."
After returning to the sidelines, Fox recalled
that everyone was very understanding.-
Encouragement
"I was feeling pretty low when I came over to
the sidelines and coach Walsh grabbed me as I
was going by and said, 'lt's going to be all right;
you're going to do OK.' That was a real lift."
Apparently it was. His next kick was a 54 yar
der into Colorado's end zone.
Fox said, however, that distance is not the
most important factor in punting.
"Height is what's really important. In my
freshman year (playing junior varsity) my kicks
were long and low. I was outkicking the cover
age. The important statistic that you don't read
about is the net yardage.
"You can have a 50-yard punt, but if they get a
20-yard return, that's only a net 30-yard punt.
You're better off with a shorter kick with better
hang time.
"I try to concentrate on getting the ball high
because if you get a kick good and high, the
distance will follow."
This year Fox said he believes that his hang
time is the strongest aspect of his kicking.
Fox's job does not end with the kick, how
ever.
On defense
"The punt is an offensive play," he explained,
"but it's also a defensive play. As soon as you
kick the ball you're on defense. I play a safety. I
usually cover the left side of the field after the
punt.
"If they've got a big return set up with a wall of
blockers, my job is just to try and fight my way
through there and stall for time. I don't go in
there to try and make a crisp, open field tackle.
We don't practice that and chances are it'll be
some nifty back who's just going to run right
over you.
"The best way to do it is just to get a good
angle and use the field to your advantage by
backing up for a time and trying to make a tackle
that will prevent a touchdown. If you can grab a
jersey to bring a player down all you want is to
stop a touchdown you don't care about
another 10 yards."
The punting play is a unique one to Fox for
another reason as well.
"For me, it's kind of a dilemma. The punting
game goes into play when the offense has not
picked up yardage. So when I see a lot of action,
the offense is not having a good day. Obviously,
I want to go out and participate in the game but
the more I participate, the worse we're doing.
"I'm behind the offense all the way but when
they have trouble, I just go out and try to help as
much as possible with the punt."
Between punts, Fox will just have to continue
spending his time on the sidelines, vyatching the
game, hoping that he can help out but hoping
that have to.

Punting isn't all that simple, as Stanford kicker Brad Fox knows. Here
Ralph Phillips blocks a punt in practice. Fortunately, Fox hasn't had
any kicks blocked in a game and is maintaining a 42.6 average.
"He's got poise. He's very intelligent. He's an
excellent punter and he's been a real asset to our
team. He operates well under pressure and he's
very consistent, you know, he's all the things
you look for in a punter." - Head football coach
Bill Walsh on Brad Fox.
Bill Walsh got an early Christmas present this
year.
Senior Brad Fox played baseball for most of
his sophomore and junior years at Stanford and
was first on the waiting list for acceptance to an
overseas campus last spring.
After trying spring football, Fox decided to
stay at Stanford. He now boasts a 42.6-yard punt
ing average, the highest average for a Cardinal in
more than a decade.
Merry Christmas, coach Walsh.
"I knew it was a long shot all the way," Fox
said of his chances of making the team this fall as
a walk-on. Why, then, did he try?
"It seemed like there was a little bit of an
opening," Fox said. "Mike Michel had
graduated. They really didn't have an estab
lished kicker returning. They had recruited a
freshman, Ken Naber, and he was the No. 1
kicker. At least, the way it looked, he was the
person I would have to beat out."
r Fox then entered fall camp with only Naber
between himself and the starting job as punter.
Surprise
After camp started, Walsh found himself
somewhat surprised.
"Honestly, we expected Ken Naber to be the
punter. We had four punters come back for fall
practice but it didn't take long to see that Brad
was the best of the four.
"He was a steady punter. He consistently
kicked it some distance. What you have to have
in a kicker is consistently; he can't be great on
one punt and then poor on the next. The aver
age might turn out OK but when you do that,
you never know what's going to happen."
At the end of fall practice, Naber became the
place-kicker and Fox found himself with the
starting punting job.
"I was very pleased, to say the least," Fox
recalled. "It took me awhile to realize that I'd
made it. The first couple of trips seemed like a
dream come true."
