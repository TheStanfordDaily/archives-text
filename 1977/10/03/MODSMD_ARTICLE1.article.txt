# Funding, relocation problems
## Albers' Wall assembly delayed 
### Rob Lempert 
Construction of the so-called Albers' Wall,
scheduled to begin last summer, has been de
layed by cost overruns and obligations to re
view the chosen site, according to Assoc. Pro
vost Edward Shaw.
Last June, the work would have cost a pro
hibitive $100,000. Cutting the expense caused a
major delay, Shaw said. After working most of
the summer on the problem, he said he has
skimmed the figure down nearly $15,000. In,
one or two months he predicts the project
shou!d be within its budget of roughly $80,000.
The sculpture, a two-sided relief 155 feet long
and nearly nine feet high by artist Josef Albers,
will stand in Lomita Mall between the Phsyics
Tank and the Quad, according to the present
plan.
Last year the sculpture met with much con
troversy and was juggled from site to site. Shaw
said he has promised the Physics Department

that an independent group of art experts will
review the location choice, the favorite of both
the Art Department and the administration.
Less biased
The location group is scheduled to come
here in the next few weeks. Shaw said he feels
the experts here are at least as good as any in
the area, but those not intimately associated
with the project might have a less biased view.
If the site is approved by the group, construc
tion will be ready to procede as soon as the
costs are brought down.
The sculpture will be financed by gifts from
various individuals and foundations specifically
interested in Albers' work. Shaw said no gen
eral University funds will be used for the pro
ject.
The sculpture itself was a gift from Albers.
One side of the wall-shaped art piece will be
white brick, outlined with darkened steel tub

ing in the spaces where the mortar should be.
The opposing side, which will face the Quad, is
black African granite ornamented with stainless
steel tubing spread in patterns across its face.
Patch of grass
The work is slated to stand on the small patch
of grass directly in front of the Physics Tank with
its length angled at 45 degrees to the lines of the
mall.
Shaw said he feels there are bound to be
complaints wherever the work is built. He said
he thought problems will arise because the
work is outside and everyone will see it and
some will not like it.
"I don't know of a piece of outdoor art that
went up anywhere without controversy," Shaw
said. But Shaw also says he feels leaving it to a
vote would only lead to the "lowest de
nomenator" of art.
Once construction starts, it should take
about six months to complete, Shaw said.

shou!d be within its budget of roughly $80,000.
The sculpture, a two-sided relief 155 feet long
and nearly nine feet high by artist Josef Albers,
will stand in Lomita Mall between the Phsyics
Tank and the Quad, according to the present
plan.
Last year the sculpture met with much con
troversy and was juggled from site to site. Shaw
said he has promised the Physics Department

that an independent group of art experts will
review the location choice, the favorite of both
the Art Department and the administration.
Less biased
The location group is scheduled to come
here in the next few weeks. Shaw said he feels
the experts here are at least as good as any in
the area, but those not intimately associated
with the project might have a less biased view.
If the site is approved by the group, construc
tion will be ready to procede as soon as the
costs are brought down.
The sculpture will be financed by gifts from
various individuals and foundations specifically
interested in Albers' work. Shaw said no gen
eral University funds will be used for the pro
ject.
The sculpture itself was a gift from Albers.
One side of the wall-shaped art piece will be
white brick, outlined with darkened steel tub

ing in the spaces where the mortar should be.
The opposing side, which will face the Quad, is
black African granite ornamented with stainless
steel tubing spread in patterns across its face.
Patch of grass
The work is slated to stand on the small patch
of grass directly in front of the Physics Tank with
its length angled at 45 degrees to the lines of the
mall.
Shaw said he feels there are bound to be
complaints wherever the work is built. He said
he thought problems will arise because the
work is outside and everyone will see it and
some will not like it.
"I don't know of a piece of outdoor art that
went up anywhere without controversy," Shaw
said. But Shaw also says he feels leaving it to a
vote would only lead to the "lowest de
nomenator" of art.
Once construction starts, it should take
about six months to complete, Shaw said.

Construction of the so-called Albers' Wall,
scheduled to begin last summer, has been de
layed by cost overruns and obligations to re
view the chosen site, according to Assoc. Pro
vost Edward Shaw.
Last June, the work would have cost a pro
hibitive $100,000. Cutting the expense caused a
major delay, Shaw said. After working most of
the summer on the problem, he said he has
skimmed the figure down nearly $15,000. In,
one or two months he predicts the project
shou!d be within its budget of roughly $80,000.
