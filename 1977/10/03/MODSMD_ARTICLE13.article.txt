# University loans parents $1 million

The parents of 115 incoming
freshmen received over $1 mill
ion in loans from the University
under the new Parent Loan
Program (PLP), according to
Asst. Director of Finance and
PLP Administrator Harry
Turner.
The undergraduate program
provides the University with a
valuable investment and the
"added benefit of being able to
help Stanford parents," said
Turner.
Parents must earn between
$20,000 and $60,000 annually
and submit a credit application
to become eligible for the loan.
Once eligibility require
ments are-met and details have
been taken care of, the funds
become available to the stu
dent on registration day in the
form of a credit slip payable di
rectly to the cashier, Turner
said.
At a negotiated time, the pa
rents begin monthly payments
which continue over a six-year
period at an annual 8.75 per
cent interest rate.
Administrative costs
If not used for this program,
the money would normally
have gone into another Uni
versity investment program
with an interest rate of eight
percent, Turner said. The addi
tional .75 per cent in the PLP is
used for various administrative
costs.
According to Robert Huff,
director of financial aids, the
program is not based on need.
It is aimed primarily at parents
who do not meet the income
regulations for other types of
financial aid, yet still need re

lief from expenses of a four
year education here.
Turner said parents feel the
program is meeting their
needs. This year, 115 out of an
entering class of 1600 took ad
vantage of this new opportun
ity.
Seven applicants were
turned down for not meeting
credit or income regulations.
The average loan issued was
$4000 and the total investment
this year came to $1,000,007.
Turner said he is hopeful the
loan program will accommo
date as many as 10 per cent of
future freshmen but said it will
"regrettably" not apply to stu
dents in the classes of 1980 or
earlier.
Assistance
The Knight Agency assists in
administering the loan prog
ram and receives $6 per ac
count per year for that service.
Dealing with an outside agent
and also directly with the pa
rent rather than the student are
the major differences between
this type of loan and the Feder
ally Insured Student Loans
(FISL).
The PLP is also not based on
demonstration of financial
need.
The University is not the only
school engaging in this type of
loan operation. Harvard's
program is going into its sec
ond year, and Mills, Pomona
and Princeton are also offering
these loans.
Although the long-term suc
cess of this program cannot be
determined for two or three
years, Turner said, the Univer
sity's program is currently
satisfying an obvious need.
