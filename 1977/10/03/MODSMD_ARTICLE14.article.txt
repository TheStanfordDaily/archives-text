# Night classes to get summer test
## 
### Heidi Hedlund 
A program of summer night classes will be
offered again next year "to give it a full test,"
said Michael Oman, associate provost and di
rector of the summer session.
He said the program of night classes would be
a sumrtier program only with.no offerings dur
ing the regular school year.
The program, offered for the first time last
summer, enrolled 74 students, 27 of whom re
gistered for "Introduction to Statistical
Methods." The main drawing card for this class
was the convenient time, according to a student
survey.
Oman said the number of students last sum
mer was about what he had expected.
The other three courses offered were "The
English Novel in the 19th Century," "How to
Survive in American Society: A Sociological
Perspective" and "American Perceptions of Na
ture: A Religious History."
Although only the English class was taught by
a University professor, Oman said he felt that
the visiting professors from New York, Canada
and North Carolina universities maintained a
standard of excellence on a par with Stanford's.

Students planning to enroll in last summer's
courses had a choice of taking a four-unit class
for $420 or a five-unit session for $512. Oman
expressed hope that an appropriately prorated
three unit class would be available next year.
Although the admissions procedure for the
summer night classes is less stringent than that
for the University's full-time students, the prog
ram seems to favor those over 25 with a college
degree. It's "not that strict of a selection pro
cess," Oman commented. "We're looking
mainly for maturity in our students."
One class drew only three enrollees. The lack
of students in "American Perceptions of Nature:
A Religious History," was probably due to its
time conflict with the popular sociology class,
said Oman.
Berton Kaplan, visiting professor from the
University of North Carolina, said he thought his
sociology class was "very relevant" to the stu
dents. The course focused on the correlation
between American lifestyles and heart disease,
stress and coping in general. "We talked about
what deeply interested them (the students),"
Kaplan added.
