# Benjamin out in 20-10 triumph
## Defense shines in Cardinal victory 
### Bruce Anderson 
"Coach Walsh said before
the season that the offense
would win a few and the de
fense would win a few," mid
dle linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said after Saturday's game with
Oregon. "Well the defense
won this one."
.Ceresino and his defensive
cohorts shut the Ducks out in
the second half while heading
Stanford to a 20-10 victory in
the Pacific-8 Conference
opener for both teams. The
Cards are now 3-1 on the sea
son and the Ducks stand at 1 -3.
While Stanford's offense
sputtered against the Ducks —
in stark contrast to the oppor
tunistic scoring machine dis
played a week previous against
Illinois — the defense had its
best performance of the sea
son.
"We didn't play well on of
fense," said Darrin Nelson,
who won offensive player of
the game honors from ABC.
"The defense did the job."
"Defensively we dominated
Oregon," Ceresino said.
Secondary shredded
Oregon quarterback Jack
Henderson had shredded
Stanford's secondary for 560
yards in the past two meetings
between the Ducks and thre
Cards.
This time, Stanford,
bolstered by the return of
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
to the lineup and the improved
health of Geoff Kieburtz and
Larry Reynolds, held Hender
son to 13 completions in 27 at
tempts for a scant 135 yards and
limited Oregon's inside option
running attack to 182 yards.
Stanford's defense also
caused four turnovers, recov
ering two fumbles and pirating
two Henderson passes.
Stanford, too, was plagued
by offensive miscues. But the
biggest loss of the afternoon
was neither the fumble by Nel

son or the two passes the
Ducks intercepted. It was the
loss of Guy Benjamin with a
sprained ligament in his left
knee.
Without crutches
Sunday Benjamin was walk
ing without crutches and the
swelling around his knee was
minimal.
"It's not as bad as we origi
nally thought," Walsh said
Sunday. "But we just don't
know what his status is at this
time."
"It's still up in the air," said
Dr. Fr£d Behling, the team
physician. "We're not sure
how serious the knee is
sprained. It is unlikely, but not
impossible, that he will play
against UCLA (this Saturday)."
Behling was going to re
examine Benjamin's knee
today and it is expected that by
tomorrow his future playing
status will be more definite.
The ball was on the Oregon
18 and the Cards had fourth
and a half-yard on the play
which Benjamin was injured.
No second thoughts
"I've no second thoughts
about going for first down,"
Walsh said of the play that sent
Benjamin hobbling to the
sidelines. "It was an easy deci
sion. Kicking a field goal would
have given us just a six-point
lead and they could have come
back and won it with a
touchdown. A field goal could
have been blocked and a field
goal blocked at that point was
just what they needed."
Benjamin was hit from be
hind after giving the ball to

fullback John Finley, who came
up short of the first down.
Enter Steve Dils. Benjamin's
understudy, Dils is usually
seen only as the holder for
placekicker Ken Naber.
70-yard march
In his first series, Dils led the
Cards on a 70-yard march that
ended with Francis going into
the end zone on an off-tackle
slant from the nine yard line.
"112 didn't do that much," said
an overly modest Dils after
leading the Cards downfield
for the score that iced the game
for Stanford. "I just came in
and said that we had to play ball
control and gave the ball to
Francis and Nelson."
On third-and-eight from the
Oregon 34, Dils fired a 23-yard
strike to split end Bill Kellar.
One play later Francis brushed
aside several would-be tacklers
to ramble in with his first
touchdown of the year.
Tendinitis
The 6-foot-2 fullback said it
wasn't until late in the game
that his hip, bothered by ten
dinitis, began to loosen up.
Francis commended Dils for
his two series at the helm of the
offense.
"Steve was really poised,"
Francis said. "He showed no
nervousness at all. Hedid a hell
of a job."
"Steve Dils showed the fans
that we have a backup quarter
back," Ceresino said. "We'll
give UCLA a fight."
While Dils impressed the
crowd with his coolness, Nel
son once again charmed it with
his electric moves and his un

matched stop-and-go accelera
tion.
On a safety valve pass in the
first quarter Nelson was appa
rently trapped at the line of
scrimmage, but the scintillat
ing freshman raced back and
forth, finally escaping out the
right side to race 65 yards and
set up Stanford's first
touchdown.
"It was a check-off pass; I
was not the primary receiver ,"
Nelson said. "They blitzed and
Guy was rushed hard. Instead
of panicking, he just threw it to
me.
"I felt like I ran all day," Nel
son said. The tiring frosh
speedster was hauled down
from behind on his 65-yard run
by free safety Kenny Bryant. "I
couldn't quite make it."
Stanford was penalized for
clipping on Nelson's run, and
ended up with the ball on the
Oregon 31. Benjamin then hit
Mitch Pleis with an 11-yard
pass. Four plays later Benjamin
crossed the goal line from one
yard out on a keeper to put
Stanford on top, 10-7.'
A 33-yard field goal by Roy
Geiger knotted the score at
10-10 but a 36-yard boot by Ken
Naber, his second of the game
and his seventh consecutive
successful attempt, put Stan
ford ahead to stay in the sec
ond quarter.
Individual student tickets for
the UCLA, Washington State,
San Jose State and California
football games against Stan
ford will go on sale tomorrow
at 8:30 a.m. at the Maples Pavil
ion ticket window.

On a safety valve pass in the

touchdown.
"It was a check-off pass; I
was not the primary receiver ,"
Nelson said. "They blitzed and
Guy was rushed hard. Instead
of panicking, he just threw it to
me.
"I felt like I ran all day," Nel

from behind on his 65-yard run
by free safety Kenny Bryant. "I

Stanford was penalized for
clipping on Nelson's run, and
ended up with the ball on the
Oregon 31. Benjamin then hit
Mitch Pleis with an 11-yard
pass. Four plays later Benjamin
crossed the goal line from one
yard out on a keeper to put
Stanford on top, 10-7.'
A 33-yard field goal by Roy
Geiger knotted the score at
10-10 but a 36-yard boot by Ken
Naber, his second of the game

Fullback Phil Francis falls across the goal line for Stanford's second touchdown in Saturday's 20-10
victory over Oregon. Francis ran for 66 yards against the Ducks, including this nine-yard scoring run.
"Coach Walsh said before
the season that the offense
would win a few and the de
fense would win a few," mid
dle linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said after Saturday's game with
Oregon. "Well the defense
won this one."
.Ceresino and his defensive
cohorts shut the Ducks out in
the second half while heading
Stanford to a 20-10 victory in
the Pacific-8 Conference
opener for both teams. The
Cards are now 3-1 on the sea
son and the Ducks stand at 1 -3.
While Stanford's offense
sputtered against the Ducks —
in stark contrast to the oppor
tunistic scoring machine dis
played a week previous against
Illinois — the defense had its
best performance of the sea
son.
"We didn't play well on of
fense," said Darrin Nelson,
who won offensive player of
the game honors from ABC.
"The defense did the job."
"Defensively we dominated
Oregon," Ceresino said.
Secondary shredded
Oregon quarterback Jack
Henderson had shredded
Stanford's secondary for 560
yards in the past two meetings
between the Ducks and thre
Cards.
This time, Stanford,
bolstered by the return of
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
to the lineup and the improved
health of Geoff Kieburtz and
Larry Reynolds, held Hender
son to 13 completions in 27 at
tempts for a scant 135 yards and
limited Oregon's inside option
running attack to 182 yards.
Stanford's defense also
caused four turnovers, recov
ering two fumbles and pirating
two Henderson passes.
Stanford, too, was plagued
by offensive miscues. But the
biggest loss of the afternoon
was neither the fumble by Nel

son or the two passes the
Ducks intercepted. It was the
loss of Guy Benjamin with a
sprained ligament in his left
knee.
Without crutches
Sunday Benjamin was walk
ing without crutches and the
swelling around his knee was
minimal.
"It's not as bad as we origi
nally thought," Walsh said
Sunday. "But we just don't
know what his status is at this
time."
"It's still up in the air," said
Dr. Fr£d Behling, the team
physician. "We're not sure
how serious the knee is
sprained. It is unlikely, but not
impossible, that he will play
against UCLA (this Saturday)."
Behling was going to re
examine Benjamin's knee
today and it is expected that by
tomorrow his future playing
status will be more definite.
The ball was on the Oregon
18 and the Cards had fourth
and a half-yard on the play
which Benjamin was injured.
No second thoughts
"I've no second thoughts
about going for first down,"
Walsh said of the play that sent
Benjamin hobbling to the
sidelines. "It was an easy deci
sion. Kicking a field goal would
have given us just a six-point
lead and they could have come
back and won it with a
touchdown. A field goal could
have been blocked and a field
goal blocked at that point was
just what they needed."
Benjamin was hit from be
hind after giving the ball to

fullback John Finley, who came
up short of the first down.
Enter Steve Dils. Benjamin's
understudy, Dils is usually
seen only as the holder for
placekicker Ken Naber.
70-yard march
In his first series, Dils led the
Cards on a 70-yard march that
ended with Francis going into
the end zone on an off-tackle
slant from the nine yard line.
"112 didn't do that much," said
an overly modest Dils after
leading the Cards downfield
for the score that iced the game
for Stanford. "I just came in
and said that we had to play ball
control and gave the ball to
Francis and Nelson."
On third-and-eight from the
Oregon 34, Dils fired a 23-yard
strike to split end Bill Kellar.
One play later Francis brushed
aside several would-be tacklers
to ramble in with his first
touchdown of the year.
Tendinitis
The 6-foot-2 fullback said it
wasn't until late in the game
that his hip, bothered by ten
dinitis, began to loosen up.
Francis commended Dils for
his two series at the helm of the
offense.
"Steve was really poised,"
Francis said. "He showed no
nervousness at all. Hedid a hell
of a job."
"Steve Dils showed the fans
that we have a backup quarter
back," Ceresino said. "We'll
give UCLA a fight."

"I've no second thoughts
about going for first down,"
Walsh said of the play that sent
Benjamin hobbling to the
sidelines. "It was an easy deci
sion. Kicking a field goal would
have given us just a six-point
lead and they could have come
back and won it with a
touchdown. A field goal could
have been blocked and a field
goal blocked at that point was
just what they needed."
Benjamin was hit from be
hind after giving the ball to

fullback John Finley, who came
up short of the first down.
Enter Steve Dils. Benjamin's
understudy, Dils is usually
seen only as the holder for
placekicker Ken Naber.
70-yard march
In his first series, Dils led the
Cards on a 70-yard march that
ended with Francis going into
the end zone on an off-tackle
slant from the nine yard line.
"112 didn't do that much," said
an overly modest Dils after
leading the Cards downfield
for the score that iced the game
for Stanford. "I just came in
and said that we had to play ball
control and gave the ball to
Francis and Nelson."
On third-and-eight from the
Oregon 34, Dils fired a 23-yard
strike to split end Bill Kellar.
One play later Francis brushed
aside several would-be tacklers
to ramble in with his first
touchdown of the year.
Tendinitis
The 6-foot-2 fullback said it
wasn't until late in the game
that his hip, bothered by ten
dinitis, began to loosen up.
Francis commended Dils for
his two series at the helm of the
offense.
"Steve was really poised,"
Francis said. "He showed no
nervousness at all. Hedid a hell
of a job."
"Steve Dils showed the fans
that we have a backup quarter
back," Ceresino said. "We'll
give UCLA a fight."
While Dils impressed the
crowd with his coolness, Nel
son once again charmed it with
his electric moves and his un

matched stop-and-go accelera
tion.
On a safety valve pass in the
first quarter Nelson was appa
rently trapped at the line of
scrimmage, but the scintillat
ing freshman raced back and
forth, finally escaping out the
right side to race 65 yards and
set up Stanford's first
touchdown.
"It was a check-off pass; I
was not the primary receiver ,"
Nelson said. "They blitzed and
Guy was rushed hard. Instead
of panicking, he just threw it to
me.
"I felt like I ran all day," Nel
son said. The tiring frosh
speedster was hauled down
from behind on his 65-yard run
by free safety Kenny Bryant. "I
couldn't quite make it."
Stanford was penalized for
clipping on Nelson's run, and
ended up with the ball on the
Oregon 31. Benjamin then hit
Mitch Pleis with an 11-yard
pass. Four plays later Benjamin
crossed the goal line from one
yard out on a keeper to put
Stanford on top, 10-7.'
A 33-yard field goal by Roy
Geiger knotted the score at
10-10 but a 36-yard boot by Ken
Naber, his second of the game
and his seventh consecutive
successful attempt, put Stan
ford ahead to stay in the sec
ond quarter.

Fullback Phil Francis falls across the goal line for Stanford's second touchdown in Saturday's 20-10
victory over Oregon. Francis ran for 66 yards against the Ducks, including this nine-yard scoring run.
"Coach Walsh said before
the season that the offense
would win a few and the de
fense would win a few," mid
dle linebacker Gordy Ceresino
said after Saturday's game with
Oregon. "Well the defense
won this one."
.Ceresino and his defensive
cohorts shut the Ducks out in
the second half while heading
Stanford to a 20-10 victory in
the Pacific-8 Conference
opener for both teams. The
Cards are now 3-1 on the sea
son and the Ducks stand at 1 -3.
While Stanford's offense
sputtered against the Ducks —
in stark contrast to the oppor
tunistic scoring machine dis
played a week previous against
Illinois — the defense had its
best performance of the sea
son.
"We didn't play well on of
fense," said Darrin Nelson,
who won offensive player of
the game honors from ABC.
"The defense did the job."
"Defensively we dominated
Oregon," Ceresino said.
Secondary shredded
Oregon quarterback Jack
Henderson had shredded
Stanford's secondary for 560
yards in the past two meetings
between the Ducks and thre
Cards.
This time, Stanford,
bolstered by the return of
Bruce Barker and Chuck Evans
to the lineup and the improved
health of Geoff Kieburtz and
Larry Reynolds, held Hender
son to 13 completions in 27 at
tempts for a scant 135 yards and
limited Oregon's inside option
running attack to 182 yards.
Stanford's defense also
caused four turnovers, recov
ering two fumbles and pirating
two Henderson passes.
Stanford, too, was plagued
by offensive miscues. But the
biggest loss of the afternoon
was neither the fumble by Nel

son or the two passes the
Ducks intercepted. It was the
loss of Guy Benjamin with a
sprained ligament in his left
knee.
Without crutches
Sunday Benjamin was walk
ing without crutches and the
swelling around his knee was
minimal.
"It's not as bad as we origi
nally thought," Walsh said
Sunday. "But we just don't
know what his status is at this
time."
"It's still up in the air," said
Dr. Fr£d Behling, the team
physician. "We're not sure
how serious the knee is
sprained. It is unlikely, but not
impossible, that he will play
against UCLA (this Saturday)."
Behling was going to re
examine Benjamin's knee
today and it is expected that by
tomorrow his future playing
status will be more definite.
The ball was on the Oregon
18 and the Cards had fourth
and a half-yard on the play
which Benjamin was injured.
