women's cross country team won its half of the
Fresno State Invitational Saturday, while the
Cards' men's team finished fourth.
The men's race was won by Tom Wysacki of
Nevada-Reno in 29:54.2, an impressive time
over a grinder of a course which caused a. lot of
late race fading. Gary Romesser of Fresno, who
led for five miles, finished second in 30:15.0.
Stanford's top finishers were Roy Kissin in ninth
at 30:54, Bill Haldeman, eleventh at 30:59; and
Harold Celms, fifteenth at 31:19.
The women's three-mile race was won by
Dianne Barrett, unattached, who ran 18:18. But
seven of the first 11 finishers were Stanford wo
men. Audrey Kemp and loanne Ernst led the
Cardinal pack, finishingfourth at 19:19and sixth
at 19:26, respectively.

The Fresno Pacific Track Club took team hon
ors in the men's meet in an upset, followed by
Nevada-Reno, Fresno State and Stanford.
Bakersfield State captured second and Fresno
Pacific Track Club third in the women's competi
tion.
Although most of the men said they felt the
team still has a long way to go, times showed
improvement. Jeff Norton, on his way back after
a spring track injury, finished 22nd at 31:49, and
Mitch Wasterlain, Stanford's fifth finisher at
31:52, ran nearly two minutes faster than last
year at this meet.
