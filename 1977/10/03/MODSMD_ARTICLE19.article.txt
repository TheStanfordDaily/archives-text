# Poloists cop Nor-Cal Invite
## Cardinals best top-rated California, 9-7 
### Brad Brockbank 
Paced by junior Doug Burke's four goals
and freshman goalie John Cansel's 12
saves, the Stanford water polo team de
feated California Saturday, 9-7, to win the
Northern California Invitational Tourna
ment and take the No. 1 national ranking
from the previously first-ranked Bears.
The poloists are now 7*o for the season
and have won 22 straight since Cal beat
them in this same tournament last year.
With the score tied 3-3 in the second
quarter, Burke and junior Robby Arnold
each scored from the corners on man-up
situations and put the Cards ahead to stay.
During the third quarter, the Cards
stretched their lead to four goals but the
Bears fought back and closed the gap to
one. With three minutes left in the period,
however, Burke came high out of the
water and fired in a 20 foot shot which
proved to be the game winner.
The bearded 175 pounder said after
ward, however, that he wasn't particularly
psyched before the game.

"I started out just wanting to do my
job," he said, "but after that first goal went
in, everything fell into place and nothing
could go wrong."
Coach Dante Dettamanti said, "If we
play every game with this intensity no one
will touch us." Pausing for a moment, he
added, "Except Cal."
Stanford and Cal will meet twice more
during the conference season and De
ttamanti suspects that they will clash in the
NCAA championships as well.
"They should all be exciting games," he
said. "We were up by four goals at one
point in the game and I hope that's indica
tive of our dominance over them. The har
dest thing to do, though' in any sport, is to
protect a lead."
"We just made two defensive mis
takes," said senior Marty Davis, referring
to Cal's third-quarter charge, "and they
capitalized on them. They were just men
tal errors."
Gansel, in recording his 12 saves, re
ceived praise from his coach. "He played a

super game," Dettamanti said. "He knows
i nsti nctively what he's supposed to do. We
still need to work with him on inside water
shots but he has the capability to be a great
goalie.
"He's got quick reactions and he's got a
tremendous amount of poise for a
freshman, which is so important for a
goalie. When you screw up in the goal,
everyone knows about it. In the field, if a
player blows it, there are five others to
cover up for it but that's not true in the
goal.
"He never gets visibly upset; his emo
tional make-up is perfect for his position."
Dettamanti was impressed with the way
the entire team played defense in the
game and he termed the team's man-up
playing as the "best I've seen it." Out of
seven kickout situations, the Cardinals
scored on five.
In other tournament games this
weekend, the Cards defeated University
of the Pacific, 17-3, California's "B", 9-3,
West Germany, 11-9, and Arizona 6-4.

feated California Saturday, 9-7, to win the
Northern California Invitational Tourna
ment and take the No. 1 national ranking
from the previously first-ranked Bears.
The poloists are now 7*o for the season
and have won 22 straight since Cal beat
them in this same tournament last year.
With the score tied 3-3 in the second
quarter, Burke and junior Robby Arnold
each scored from the corners on man-up
situations and put the Cards ahead to stay.
During the third quarter, the Cards
stretched their lead to four goals but the
Bears fought back and closed the gap to
one. With three minutes left in the period,
however, Burke came high out of the
water and fired in a 20 foot shot which
proved to be the game winner.
The bearded 175 pounder said after
ward, however, that he wasn't particularly
psyched before the game.

"I started out just wanting to do my
job," he said, "but after that first goal went
in, everything fell into place and nothing
could go wrong."
Coach Dante Dettamanti said, "If we
play every game with this intensity no one
will touch us." Pausing for a moment, he
added, "Except Cal."
Stanford and Cal will meet twice more
during the conference season and De
ttamanti suspects that they will clash in the
NCAA championships as well.
"They should all be exciting games," he
said. "We were up by four goals at one
point in the game and I hope that's indica
tive of our dominance over them. The har
dest thing to do, though' in any sport, is to
protect a lead."
"We just made two defensive mis
takes," said senior Marty Davis, referring
to Cal's third-quarter charge, "and they
capitalized on them. They were just men
tal errors."
Gansel, in recording his 12 saves, re
ceived praise from his coach. "He played a

super game," Dettamanti said. "He knows
i nsti nctively what he's supposed to do. We
still need to work with him on inside water
shots but he has the capability to be a great
goalie.
"He's got quick reactions and he's got a
tremendous amount of poise for a
freshman, which is so important for a
goalie. When you screw up in the goal,
everyone knows about it. In the field, if a
player blows it, there are five others to
cover up for it but that's not true in the
goal.
"He never gets visibly upset; his emo
tional make-up is perfect for his position."
Dettamanti was impressed with the way
the entire team played defense in the
game and he termed the team's man-up
playing as the "best I've seen it." Out of
seven kickout situations, the Cardinals
scored on five.
In other tournament games this
weekend, the Cards defeated University
of the Pacific, 17-3, California's "B", 9-3,
West Germany, 11-9, and Arizona 6-4.
