# Lyman attacks gov't restrictions

### Steven Burr 
President Richard Lyman strongly
criticized the recent state elimination
of mandatory retirement and federal
requirements for medical school
funding in a speech to the Academic
Council Friday.
Lyman began his remarks with
comment on recent efforts by the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW) to assign places
in American medical schools to
Americans who have studied for two
years abroad and passed the first part
of the medical boards.
According to Lyman, the Universi
ty's major objection to this provision
of last year's Health Professions Edu
cational Assistance Act was that it
"takes away a piece of the admis
sions process from the institutions
and gives it to the federal govern
ment."
Said Lyman, "We could not accept
it even as the necessary condition for

receiving capitation grants to our
schools."
However, Lyman indicated that
Congress might either amend the of
fending provision "to give academic
institutions greater control over the
process," or completely rescind it.
He then turned to the act abolish
ing a mandatory retirement age
which Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
signed into law Sept. 23. According
to Lyman, "the practical effects of
such a sweeping change in our soci
ety are impossible to predict with any
accuracy," and therefore, "we
strongly urged the governor not to
sign this bill."
Lyman said the impact of such
changes "will be widely felt â€” on
affirmative action, on our ability to
maintain regular influx of younger ta
lent into our institutions, on the
caseload both of the state FEPC (Fair
Employment Practices Commission)

and of the courts."
He went on to say, however, that
these examples of recent govern
ment intervention are "not necessar
ily typical."
The University was "caught nap
ping" on the retirement bill, accord
ing to Lyman, but he indicated that
he is taking measures to prevent
such surprises in the future.
As a positive sign that colleges will
not be caught unaware by future
government interference, Lyman
cited the recent stationing of a per
manent president of the Association
of American Universities in
Washington.
Lyman predicted that the coming
year would be "one of lively political
controversy," and cited investment
responsibility and minority admis
sions as "issues about which pas
sions run most strongly."
He indicated, however, that he
does not "believe that a repetition of

the on-campus events of 1968-70 is
likely."
In other business, Peter Stansky,
chairman of the Faculty Senate, deli
vered an address to the meeting, and
resolutions in memoriam were
adopted for five former University
faculty members: Stefan Bergman,
Hermann Frankel, Emile Holman,
George Houck and George Os
borne.
