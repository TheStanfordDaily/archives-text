ranked team.
The San Jose State Tourna
ment victory partially rpade up
for Friday night's loss to No.
2-ranked UCLA in Maples Pavil
ion.
The Cards defeated the Uni
versity of the Pacific 15-13,15-9
in the first round Saturday. Cal
State-Northridge, a strong
team from southern California,
was the next team to fall to the
Stanford six in another two
game sweep 15-12, 15-9.
The day's third match was
against the University of San
Francisco and the spikers
downed the Dons with an easy
15-1, 15-10 win.
Stanford's semifinal match
was against Pepperdine and
the Cards dropped the first

game 9-15 for its first loss of the
day. Coming back with impres
sive 15-13 and 15-10 wins,
the team moved into the day's
finals against Northridge,
which had moved into the fi
nals with a victory over tour
nament host San Jose State.
Stanford beat Northridge,
the Cards second-round op
ponent, 15-11,15-8, to win the
tournament and finish the day
with a 10-1 record.
Friday evening's 6-15, 8-15,
11-15 loss to UCLA was simply a
matter of one team outplaying
the other. The games followed
a similar pattern; Stanford re
mained within striking dis
tance for the first half only to
have UCLA run off a string of
points to seal the victory.
Tuesday at 8 p.m. the Cards
face UOP in their league
opener at Maples Pavilion.
