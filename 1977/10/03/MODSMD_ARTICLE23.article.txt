San Jose — Tough Stanford
defense held a powerful San
Jose State soccer team score
less for more than a half of last
Friday night's game before the
Spartans broke through for a
3-0 win.
Card coach Nelson Lodge's
strategy focused on stiff defen
sive play in the first half to pre
vent San Jose from taking good
shots. The usually quick
scoring Spartans, led by
Olympic-team members Is
mael "Easy" Perez and Greg
Ryan, were contained.
Stanford fullback Mark
Toney and goalie Craig Ueland
were exceptional defensive
standouts, the former breaking
up passes and fast breaks,
while Ueland made fine stops
on any shots at the goal.
The play that turned the
game arou nd for San Jose came
15 minutes ih the second
period. A shot by the Spartans'
Perez came a full second after
an official's whistle. The Stan
ford defense, especially Ue
land, was distracted by the
whistle, allowing the score.
The referee's call should
have resulted in a stopped ball
and the ruling on the play. This
discrepancy will be noted in a
memorandum to the official's
association.

The second and third Spar
tan scores, by Ryan and Perez
respectively, were cleanly exe
cuted and "unstoppable" ac
cording to assistant coach Phil
WrighCHe said the controver
sial first goal hurt Stanford.
"When you're behind 1-0,
the reaction is just to get the
goal back." Wright explained
that the tendency is to relax,
allowing opposing men to get
free.
Recent games show that
"we're out of our slump. We
played well," Wright added.
Like other Stanford teams,
the soccer squad will "play well
against good teams and badly
against bad teams," Wright
said. "Craig (Ueland) and Peter
Phillips played especially well.
Everyone worked hard. I saw a
lot of hopeful things."
Head coach Lodge said he
was "really pleased" by Fri
day's game. "The defense
worked well. We were well
complimented by the San Jose
coach." Spartan coach Julio
Menendez told Lodge that it
was the toughest of six games
since losing to Simon Frazier,
the National Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics champ
ion from Vancouver, British
Columbia.
Lodge added, "We've im
proved. I feel really good about

the game; so does every
body." Regarding Ueland's
goal tending, Lodge said this
game was the second in a row
displaying his fine abilities.
Menendez said "Stanford
played really well, especially in
the first half." He has watched
the Cardinals last three games
and said he feels "they've defi
nitely improved each game."
Analyzing his Spartan's per
formance, he said "they played
real well in the second half"
after a "nervous" first half. .
The Spartans next face two
time NCAA soccer champ USF.
The two teams last met last
spring, with USF playing to a
2-1 victory. Stanford continues
the season with a game against
San Francisco State today at 3
p.m.

prompting Wright to shout at
the official that his bench was
being spit at. The Cal player re
sponded by making a number
of accusations about the Stan
ford bench. Wright did not spit
at the visiting player.

The Daily reported Friday
that a California soccer player
accused Stanford's assistant
soccer coach Phil Wright of
spitting on him.
The Cal player, in fact, spit
toward the Stanford bench,
prompting Wright to shout at
the official that his bench was
being spit at. The Cal player re
sponded by making a number
of accusations about the Stan
ford bench. Wright did not spit
at the visiting player.
San Jose — Tough Stanford
defense held a powerful San
Jose State soccer team score
less for more than a half of last
Friday night's game before the
Spartans broke through for a
3-0 win.
Card coach Nelson Lodge's
strategy focused on stiff defen
sive play in the first half to pre
vent San Jose from taking good
shots. The usually quick
scoring Spartans, led by
Olympic-team members Is
mael "Easy" Perez and Greg
Ryan, were contained.
Stanford fullback Mark
Toney and goalie Craig Ueland
were exceptional defensive
standouts, the former breaking
up passes and fast breaks,
while Ueland made fine stops
on any shots at the goal.
The play that turned the
game arou nd for San Jose came
15 minutes ih the second
period. A shot by the Spartans'
Perez came a full second after
an official's whistle. The Stan
ford defense, especially Ue
land, was distracted by the
whistle, allowing the score.
The referee's call should
have resulted in a stopped ball
and the ruling on the play. This
discrepancy will be noted in a
memorandum to the official's
association.

The second and third Spar
tan scores, by Ryan and Perez
respectively, were cleanly exe
cuted and "unstoppable" ac
cording to assistant coach Phil
WrighCHe said the controver
sial first goal hurt Stanford.
"When you're behind 1-0,
the reaction is just to get the
goal back." Wright explained
that the tendency is to relax,
allowing opposing men to get
free.
Recent games show that
"we're out of our slump. We
played well," Wright added.
Like other Stanford teams,
the soccer squad will "play well
against good teams and badly
against bad teams," Wright
said. "Craig (Ueland) and Peter
Phillips played especially well.
Everyone worked hard. I saw a
lot of hopeful things."
Head coach Lodge said he
was "really pleased" by Fri
day's game. "The defense
worked well. We were well
complimented by the San Jose
coach." Spartan coach Julio
Menendez told Lodge that it
was the toughest of six games
since losing to Simon Frazier,
the National Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics champ
ion from Vancouver, British
Columbia.
Lodge added, "We've im
proved. I feel really good about

the game; so does every
body." Regarding Ueland's
goal tending, Lodge said this
game was the second in a row
displaying his fine abilities.
Menendez said "Stanford
played really well, especially in
the first half." He has watched
the Cardinals last three games
and said he feels "they've defi
nitely improved each game."
Analyzing his Spartan's per
formance, he said "they played
real well in the second half"
after a "nervous" first half. .
The Spartans next face two
time NCAA soccer champ USF.
The two teams last met last
spring, with USF playing to a
2-1 victory. Stanford continues
the season with a game against
San Francisco State today at 3
p.m.
