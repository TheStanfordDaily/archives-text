Hijacked plane lands in Syria
Kuwait — A hijacked Japanese jetliner with 29
hostages aboard landed in Damascus early today
after a refuelling stop in Kuwait, where the heavily
armed hijackers released seven passengers,
Japanese officials announced.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said it
received a report from its embassy in Damascus
saying the plane had landed safely at 5:28 a.m.
(11:28 p.m. EDT Sunday).
Three Americans were reported among the cap
tives of the Japanese "Red Army" guerrillas on the
Japan Air Lines DCB. The hijackers had ordered the
plane to fly to the Middle East yesterday after s'/2
terror-filled days at Dacca airport in Bangladesh.
JAL officials said those aboard the plane in
cluded 22 passengers and seven crew members, as
well as the five hijackers and six of their terrorist
comrades freed from Japanese jails last week. The
hijackers were also carrying a $6 million ransom.
After a seven-hour flight from Dacca and more
than two hours on the ground at Kuwait, the jet
took off at 3:57 a.m. (8:57 p.m. EDT Sunday),
Kuwait Defense Minister Sheik Saad Abdullah
said.
Kuwaiti officials initially had refused to let the jet
land. But Saad said the pilot pleaded with au
thorities that he was low on fuel and his craft was in
danger. The pilot also gave assurances that the
plane would land only to refuel, the sheik added.
"We accepted that it lands only for humanitarian
reasons," the sheik told reporters. "And the per
mission was granted on one clear condition — that
it refuels and takes off as soon as possible."
The ultra leftist hijackers had seized the jetliner
over India on Wednesday and, in the course of
round-the-clock negotiations with Bangladesh au
thorities, freed 118 of their hostages in exchange
for $6 million in ransom and six "comrades" freed
from Japanese jails.
Senate ponders gas pricing bill
Washington — The Senate remains tied up in a
filibuster as it enters its third week of debate over
natural gas pricing while the House prepares to
tackle a controversial labor issue.
"The forum where this decision is going to be
made will be in conference," Sen. Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) said yesterday, speaking of the impasse
in the Senate over whether to deregulate natural
gas prices.
"I predict it will be regulation with an incentive
to the producers to get the natural gas," Jackson
said.
The Carter administration proposed raising
price ceilings on natural gas to $l .75 per thousand
cubic feet in order to provide incentives for pro

ducers to find gas. But the administration is op
posed to deregulating prices. The House has ap
proved a $1.75 ceiling.
There have been reports President Jimmy Carter
would agree to a compromise lid of $2.03. How
ever, Jackson said he has been advised that Carter
would not agree to a compromise.
Two test votes have shown that supporters of
natural gas deregulation would win if given the
chance, but Democratic Sens. James Abourezk of
South Dakota and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio
have promised to continue their filibuster.
U.S.-Soviet plan upsets Israel
A clearly worried Israeli government yesterday
sharply criticized the new joint U.S.-Soviet decla
ration on the Middle East, and the Palestinians and
other Arabs hailed it as a positive step toward
peace.
The joint declaration, aimed at reconvening a
Middle East peace conference in Geneva before
the end of the year, urged Israel to recognize the
"legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" and to
grant the Palestinians a role in Geneva negotia
tions.
Israel claimed the declaration would stiffen Arab
policy toward Israel and hamper efforts to resume
the peace conference, which met only briefly in
December 1973 after the last Arab-Israeli war.
Jerusalem contends the superpower endorse
ment of Palestinian participation in Geneva will
open the way for a Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) delegate to join the talks and for crea
tion of an independent Palestinian state, options
rejected out-of-hand in Jerusalem.
The Israelis have said only that they will accept
non-PLO Palestinian representation in a Jordanian
delegation at Geneva.
The declaration, issued Saturday by Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko, did not define the so-called
"rights" of the Palestinians. A State Department
spokesman said later those rights should be
negotiated at Geneva.
The statement represented the closest coopera
tion between Moscow and Washington on the
Mideast since they co-chaired the first Geneva
talks. It called for participation in a new peace
conference by "all the parties involved in the con
flict, including the Palestinians." But it did not
mention the PLO.
Prices drop 1 per cent in Sept.
Supermarket shoppers got a break last month,
with prices edging down almost one per cent, an
Associated Press marketbasket survey shows.
Continuing declines in the cost of coffee and
pork chops, along with scattered savings on a vari

ety of other items, helped offset increases, mainly
in the price of orange juice.
The AP drew up a random list of 15 commonly
purchased food and nonfood items, checked the
price at one supermarket in each of 13 cities on
March 1, 1973 and has rechecked on or about the
start of each succeeding month.
The latest survey showed that the marketbasket
total at the checklist store declined during Sep
tember in 10 cities, dropping an average of 1.9 per
cent, and increased in three cities, rising an aver
age of 2.9 per cent. On an overall basis, the mar
ketbasket bill at the checklist stores was eight
tenths of a per cent lower at the start of October
than it was at the start of the preceding month.
Train-truck wreck kills 10
Plant City, Fla. — At least 10 people were killed
late yesterday when an Amtrak passenger train
slammed into the pickup truck in which they were
riding, according to a Hillsborough County
emergency service spokesman.
Four bodies were found in the truck and six
others were scattered along the track, a highway
patrol dispatcher said.
"They're still looking for more," said ambulance
supervisor Larry Matson.
A county sheriff's department spokeswoman
said no passengers or crew members aboard the
St. Petersburg-bound train were reported injured
in the accident about 15 miles west of Tampa.

U.S.-Soviet plan upsets Israel
A clearly worried Israeli government yesterday
sharply criticized the new joint U.S.-Soviet decla
ration on the Middle East, and the Palestinians and
other Arabs hailed it as a positive step toward
peace.
The joint declaration, aimed at reconvening a
Middle East peace conference in Geneva before
the end of the year, urged Israel to recognize the
"legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" and to
grant the Palestinians a role in Geneva negotia
tions.
Israel claimed the declaration would stiffen Arab
policy toward Israel and hamper efforts to resume
the peace conference, which met only briefly in
December 1973 after the last Arab-Israeli war.
Jerusalem contends the superpower endorse
ment of Palestinian participation in Geneva will
open the way for a Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) delegate to join the talks and for crea
tion of an independent Palestinian state, options
rejected out-of-hand in Jerusalem.
The Israelis have said only that they will accept
non-PLO Palestinian representation in a Jordanian
delegation at Geneva.
The declaration, issued Saturday by Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko, did not define the so-called
"rights" of the Palestinians. A State Department
spokesman said later those rights should be
negotiated at Geneva.
The statement represented the closest coopera
tion between Moscow and Washington on the
Mideast since they co-chaired the first Geneva
talks. It called for participation in a new peace
conference by "all the parties involved in the con
flict, including the Palestinians." But it did not
mention the PLO.
Prices drop 1 per cent in Sept.
Supermarket shoppers got a break last month,
with prices edging down almost one per cent, an
Associated Press marketbasket survey shows.
Continuing declines in the cost of coffee and
pork chops, along with scattered savings on a vari

ety of other items, helped offset increases, mainly
in the price of orange juice.
The AP drew up a random list of 15 commonly
purchased food and nonfood items, checked the
price at one supermarket in each of 13 cities on
March 1, 1973 and has rechecked on or about the
start of each succeeding month.
The latest survey showed that the marketbasket
total at the checklist store declined during Sep
tember in 10 cities, dropping an average of 1.9 per
cent, and increased in three cities, rising an aver
age of 2.9 per cent. On an overall basis, the mar
ketbasket bill at the checklist stores was eight
tenths of a per cent lower at the start of October
than it was at the start of the preceding month.
Train-truck wreck kills 10
Plant City, Fla. — At least 10 people were killed
late yesterday when an Amtrak passenger train
slammed into the pickup truck in which they were
riding, according to a Hillsborough County
emergency service spokesman.
Four bodies were found in the truck and six
others were scattered along the track, a highway
patrol dispatcher said.
"They're still looking for more," said ambulance
supervisor Larry Matson.
A county sheriff's department spokeswoman
said no passengers or crew members aboard the
St. Petersburg-bound train were reported injured
in the accident about 15 miles west of Tampa.

Hijacked plane lands in Syria
Kuwait — A hijacked Japanese jetliner with 29
hostages aboard landed in Damascus early today
after a refuelling stop in Kuwait, where the heavily
armed hijackers released seven passengers,
Japanese officials announced.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said it
received a report from its embassy in Damascus
saying the plane had landed safely at 5:28 a.m.
(11:28 p.m. EDT Sunday).
Three Americans were reported among the cap
tives of the Japanese "Red Army" guerrillas on the
Japan Air Lines DCB. The hijackers had ordered the
plane to fly to the Middle East yesterday after s'/2
terror-filled days at Dacca airport in Bangladesh.
JAL officials said those aboard the plane in
cluded 22 passengers and seven crew members, as
well as the five hijackers and six of their terrorist
comrades freed from Japanese jails last week. The
hijackers were also carrying a $6 million ransom.
After a seven-hour flight from Dacca and more
than two hours on the ground at Kuwait, the jet
took off at 3:57 a.m. (8:57 p.m. EDT Sunday),
Kuwait Defense Minister Sheik Saad Abdullah
said.
Kuwaiti officials initially had refused to let the jet
land. But Saad said the pilot pleaded with au
thorities that he was low on fuel and his craft was in
danger. The pilot also gave assurances that the
plane would land only to refuel, the sheik added.
"We accepted that it lands only for humanitarian
reasons," the sheik told reporters. "And the per
mission was granted on one clear condition — that
it refuels and takes off as soon as possible."
The ultra leftist hijackers had seized the jetliner
over India on Wednesday and, in the course of
round-the-clock negotiations with Bangladesh au
thorities, freed 118 of their hostages in exchange
for $6 million in ransom and six "comrades" freed
from Japanese jails.
Senate ponders gas pricing bill
Washington — The Senate remains tied up in a
filibuster as it enters its third week of debate over
natural gas pricing while the House prepares to
tackle a controversial labor issue.
"The forum where this decision is going to be
made will be in conference," Sen. Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) said yesterday, speaking of the impasse
in the Senate over whether to deregulate natural
gas prices.
"I predict it will be regulation with an incentive
to the producers to get the natural gas," Jackson
said.
The Carter administration proposed raising
price ceilings on natural gas to $l .75 per thousand
cubic feet in order to provide incentives for pro

ducers to find gas. But the administration is op
posed to deregulating prices. The House has ap
proved a $1.75 ceiling.
There have been reports President Jimmy Carter
would agree to a compromise lid of $2.03. How
ever, Jackson said he has been advised that Carter
would not agree to a compromise.
Two test votes have shown that supporters of
natural gas deregulation would win if given the

Hijacked plane lands in Syria
Kuwait — A hijacked Japanese jetliner with 29
hostages aboard landed in Damascus early today
after a refuelling stop in Kuwait, where the heavily
armed hijackers released seven passengers,
Japanese officials announced.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said it
received a report from its embassy in Damascus
saying the plane had landed safely at 5:28 a.m.
(11:28 p.m. EDT Sunday).
Three Americans were reported among the cap
tives of the Japanese "Red Army" guerrillas on the
Japan Air Lines DCB. The hijackers had ordered the
plane to fly to the Middle East yesterday after s'/2
terror-filled days at Dacca airport in Bangladesh.
JAL officials said those aboard the plane in
cluded 22 passengers and seven crew members, as
well as the five hijackers and six of their terrorist
comrades freed from Japanese jails last week. The
hijackers were also carrying a $6 million ransom.
After a seven-hour flight from Dacca and more
than two hours on the ground at Kuwait, the jet
took off at 3:57 a.m. (8:57 p.m. EDT Sunday),
Kuwait Defense Minister Sheik Saad Abdullah
said.
Kuwaiti officials initially had refused to let the jet
land. But Saad said the pilot pleaded with au
thorities that he was low on fuel and his craft was in
danger. The pilot also gave assurances that the
plane would land only to refuel, the sheik added.
"We accepted that it lands only for humanitarian
reasons," the sheik told reporters. "And the per
mission was granted on one clear condition — that
it refuels and takes off as soon as possible."
The ultra leftist hijackers had seized the jetliner
over India on Wednesday and, in the course of
round-the-clock negotiations with Bangladesh au
thorities, freed 118 of their hostages in exchange
for $6 million in ransom and six "comrades" freed
from Japanese jails.
Senate ponders gas pricing bill
Washington — The Senate remains tied up in a
filibuster as it enters its third week of debate over
natural gas pricing while the House prepares to
tackle a controversial labor issue.
"The forum where this decision is going to be
made will be in conference," Sen. Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) said yesterday, speaking of the impasse
in the Senate over whether to deregulate natural
gas prices.
"I predict it will be regulation with an incentive
to the producers to get the natural gas," Jackson
said.
The Carter administration proposed raising
price ceilings on natural gas to $l .75 per thousand
cubic feet in order to provide incentives for pro

ducers to find gas. But the administration is op
posed to deregulating prices. The House has ap
proved a $1.75 ceiling.
There have been reports President Jimmy Carter
would agree to a compromise lid of $2.03. How
ever, Jackson said he has been advised that Carter
would not agree to a compromise.
Two test votes have shown that supporters of
natural gas deregulation would win if given the
chance, but Democratic Sens. James Abourezk of
South Dakota and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio
have promised to continue their filibuster.
U.S.-Soviet plan upsets Israel
A clearly worried Israeli government yesterday
sharply criticized the new joint U.S.-Soviet decla
ration on the Middle East, and the Palestinians and
other Arabs hailed it as a positive step toward
peace.
The joint declaration, aimed at reconvening a
Middle East peace conference in Geneva before
the end of the year, urged Israel to recognize the
"legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" and to
grant the Palestinians a role in Geneva negotia
tions.
Israel claimed the declaration would stiffen Arab
policy toward Israel and hamper efforts to resume
the peace conference, which met only briefly in
December 1973 after the last Arab-Israeli war.
Jerusalem contends the superpower endorse
ment of Palestinian participation in Geneva will
open the way for a Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) delegate to join the talks and for crea
tion of an independent Palestinian state, options
rejected out-of-hand in Jerusalem.
The Israelis have said only that they will accept
non-PLO Palestinian representation in a Jordanian
delegation at Geneva.
The declaration, issued Saturday by Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko, did not define the so-called
"rights" of the Palestinians. A State Department
spokesman said later those rights should be
negotiated at Geneva.
The statement represented the closest coopera
tion between Moscow and Washington on the
Mideast since they co-chaired the first Geneva
talks. It called for participation in a new peace
conference by "all the parties involved in the con
flict, including the Palestinians." But it did not
mention the PLO.
Prices drop 1 per cent in Sept.
Supermarket shoppers got a break last month,
with prices edging down almost one per cent, an
Associated Press marketbasket survey shows.
Continuing declines in the cost of coffee and
pork chops, along with scattered savings on a vari

ety of other items, helped offset increases, mainly
in the price of orange juice.
The AP drew up a random list of 15 commonly
purchased food and nonfood items, checked the
price at one supermarket in each of 13 cities on
March 1, 1973 and has rechecked on or about the
start of each succeeding month.
The latest survey showed that the marketbasket
total at the checklist store declined during Sep
tember in 10 cities, dropping an average of 1.9 per
cent, and increased in three cities, rising an aver
age of 2.9 per cent. On an overall basis, the mar
ketbasket bill at the checklist stores was eight
tenths of a per cent lower at the start of October
than it was at the start of the preceding month.
Train-truck wreck kills 10
Plant City, Fla. — At least 10 people were killed

mission was granted on one clear condition — that
it refuels and takes off as soon as possible."
The ultra leftist hijackers had seized the jetliner
over India on Wednesday and, in the course of
round-the-clock negotiations with Bangladesh au
thorities, freed 118 of their hostages in exchange
for $6 million in ransom and six "comrades" freed
from Japanese jails.
Senate ponders gas pricing bill
Washington — The Senate remains tied up in a
filibuster as it enters its third week of debate over
natural gas pricing while the House prepares to
tackle a controversial labor issue.
"The forum where this decision is going to be
made will be in conference," Sen. Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) said yesterday, speaking of the impasse
in the Senate over whether to deregulate natural
gas prices.
"I predict it will be regulation with an incentive
to the producers to get the natural gas," Jackson
said.
The Carter administration proposed raising
price ceilings on natural gas to $l .75 per thousand
cubic feet in order to provide incentives for pro

ducers to find gas. But the administration is op
posed to deregulating prices. The House has ap
proved a $1.75 ceiling.
There have been reports President Jimmy Carter
would agree to a compromise lid of $2.03. How
ever, Jackson said he has been advised that Carter
would not agree to a compromise.
Two test votes have shown that supporters of
natural gas deregulation would win if given the
chance, but Democratic Sens. James Abourezk of
South Dakota and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio
have promised to continue their filibuster.
U.S.-Soviet plan upsets Israel
A clearly worried Israeli government yesterday
sharply criticized the new joint U.S.-Soviet decla
ration on the Middle East, and the Palestinians and
other Arabs hailed it as a positive step toward
peace.
The joint declaration, aimed at reconvening a
Middle East peace conference in Geneva before
the end of the year, urged Israel to recognize the
"legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" and to
grant the Palestinians a role in Geneva negotia
tions.
Israel claimed the declaration would stiffen Arab
policy toward Israel and hamper efforts to resume
the peace conference, which met only briefly in
December 1973 after the last Arab-Israeli war.
Jerusalem contends the superpower endorse
ment of Palestinian participation in Geneva will
open the way for a Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) delegate to join the talks and for crea
tion of an independent Palestinian state, options
rejected out-of-hand in Jerusalem.
The Israelis have said only that they will accept
non-PLO Palestinian representation in a Jordanian
delegation at Geneva.
The declaration, issued Saturday by Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko, did not define the so-called
"rights" of the Palestinians. A State Department
spokesman said later those rights should be
negotiated at Geneva.
The statement represented the closest coopera
tion between Moscow and Washington on the
Mideast since they co-chaired the first Geneva
talks. It called for participation in a new peace
conference by "all the parties involved in the con
flict, including the Palestinians." But it did not
mention the PLO.
Prices drop 1 per cent in Sept.
Supermarket shoppers got a break last month,
with prices edging down almost one per cent, an
Associated Press marketbasket survey shows.
Continuing declines in the cost of coffee and
pork chops, along with scattered savings on a vari

ety of other items, helped offset increases, mainly
in the price of orange juice.
The AP drew up a random list of 15 commonly
purchased food and nonfood items, checked the
price at one supermarket in each of 13 cities on
March 1, 1973 and has rechecked on or about the
start of each succeeding month.
The latest survey showed that the marketbasket
total at the checklist store declined during Sep
tember in 10 cities, dropping an average of 1.9 per
cent, and increased in three cities, rising an aver
age of 2.9 per cent. On an overall basis, the mar
ketbasket bill at the checklist stores was eight
tenths of a per cent lower at the start of October
than it was at the start of the preceding month.
Train-truck wreck kills 10
Plant City, Fla. — At least 10 people were killed
late yesterday when an Amtrak passenger train
slammed into the pickup truck in which they were
riding, according to a Hillsborough County
emergency service spokesman.
Four bodies were found in the truck and six
others were scattered along the track, a highway
patrol dispatcher said.
"They're still looking for more," said ambulance
supervisor Larry Matson.
A county sheriff's department spokeswoman
said no passengers or crew members aboard the
St. Petersburg-bound train were reported injured
in the accident about 15 miles west of Tampa.
