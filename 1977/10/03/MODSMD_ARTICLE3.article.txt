# Brown nixes scholarship raise
## 
### George Anders 
Needy freshmen next year may be
asked to pay more of their tuition
because Gov. Jerry brown recently
vetoed a scholarship increase bill,
according to Robert Huff, financial
aids director here.
The bill, vetoed by Brown on Sept.
24, would have raised the maximum
annual California State Scholarship
stipend from the current $2700 to
$J2OO for 1978-79.
Had the bill been enacted, Huff
said, it would have become "one of
the ways we could control the ever
burgeoning self-help requirement."
Some 900 students here receive
Cal State scholarships, Huff said.
"The average stipend here is pretty
close to the maximum" already, he
said.
Thus, Brown's veto affects only
private schools such as Stanford,
Huff said. He noted that Cal States go
only to California residents and are
applicable only toward tuition.

Therefore, he said, students at
state schools receive stipends well
below the maximum, and only un
dergraduates at expensive private
schools are affected by the
maximum.
"I think the governor's veto is
shortsighted," said Larry Horton, an
administrator in charge of govern
ment relations. "We are disap
pointed and discouraged."
Horton said that if Cal States had
risen at the same pace tuition has,
the maximum for 1978-79 would be
$3750, about $1000 higher than it ac
tually will be.
The University was "quite active"
in lobbying for the bill, Horton said.
Both President Richard Lyman and
Huff had written Brown, urging the
governor to sign the bill, Horton
said.
Also, the Association of Indepen
dent California Colleges and Univer
sities, of which Stanford is a
member, had a full time staffer who

"worked very hard" to lobby for the
bill, Horton said.
"We made our views clearly
known on the matter," Horton re
marked.
"We were hopeful" the bill would
be signed, Horton said, "because it
received such solid support in sev
eral key committees in both
houses."
Huff said he was "hopeful we can
persuade him (Brown) at a later date
that this is a very necessary" bill.
