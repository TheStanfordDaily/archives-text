### Mindy Mayer 
The ASSU Sunday Flicks has in
itiated four new programs designed
to furnish films, film-ordering ser
vices, and funds and showcases for
student filmmakers.
In an effort to "fulfill its obligations
of providing service to Stanford stu
dents," Flicks Manager Brian Becker
said the organization will serve such
diverse groups as campus filmmak
ers, children in Escondido Village,
dormitory and fraternity residents,
campus organizations and all those
who enjoy an occasional free movie.
The first program, entitled "Sun
day Flicks Special Events" provide
films, both free and priced, to ac
company campuswide events such
as ASSU Orientation Night and Wo
men's Week 1977.
A free midnight screening of "The
Graduate" capped off Orientation
Night and "Diary of a Mad House
wife," also free, will be shown on

Oct. 19 as part of Women's Week.
The program will also provide films
to other campus organizations, such
as the Speaker's Bureau, which
hopes to attract director Lina
Wertmuller to speak sometime this
year, Becker said.
The second program, "Escondido
Village Children's Series," will sup
ply films to approximately 900 chil
dren of graduate and married stu
dents.
The series will be held Saturdays at
the Escondido Village Center, and
will feature such titles as "A Boy
Named Charlie Brown" and "Godzil
la's Revenge."
The series is being co-produced by
the Escondido Village Council.
The third pilot project will furnish
funds to produce films and the
showplace to premier them.
It costs approximately $250 to pro
duce the requisite homework for an
advanced film class at Stanford — a
sum that t'he student must pay him
self, Becker said.
The ASSU "Filmmaker's Fund" will
provide a continuing scholarship
fund of from $500 to $1000 to be dis
tributed by instructors on the basis of
merit and need.
The finished projects will be vie
wed either before the main Sunday
night features or as part of the Flicks'
Special Events program, Becker said.
The scholarship will not be availa
ble until Spring Quarter and was
termed the "most tentative" of the
projects by Becker.
The final project pioposal offers
free film-ordering services and
commercially low prices to dor
mitories, fraternities and campus or
ganizations.
All four programs were conceived
by Becker, and all are year-long pro
jects. The bulk of the financing will
come from the Sunday Flicks, with
help from organizations such as the
Office of Student Affairs.
Although the cost of a season pass
to the Flicks has risen from $5 to $7,
Becker said this is not a reflection of
the new projects, but of other factors

such as the loss of profit that accom
panied last year's reduction of ad
mission from 75 to 50 cents.
Thus far, response to at least one
of the programs has been enthusias
tic — "The Graduate" attracted an
overflow crowd of approximately
600, according to Becker.

The program will also provide films
to other campus organizations, such
as the Speaker's Bureau, which
hopes to attract director Lina
Wertmuller to speak sometime this
year, Becker said.
The second program, "Escondido
Village Children's Series," will sup
ply films to approximately 900 chil
dren of graduate and married stu
dents.
The series will be held Saturdays at
the Escondido Village Center, and
will feature such titles as "A Boy
Named Charlie Brown" and "Godzil
la's Revenge."
The series is being co-produced by
the Escondido Village Council.
The third pilot project will furnish
funds to produce films and the
showplace to premier them.
It costs approximately $250 to pro
duce the requisite homework for an
advanced film class at Stanford — a
sum that t'he student must pay him
self, Becker said.
The ASSU "Filmmaker's Fund" will
provide a continuing scholarship
fund of from $500 to $1000 to be dis
tributed by instructors on the basis of
merit and need.
The finished projects will be vie
wed either before the main Sunday
night features or as part of the Flicks'
Special Events program, Becker said.
The scholarship will not be availa
ble until Spring Quarter and was
termed the "most tentative" of the
projects by Becker.
The final project pioposal offers
free film-ordering services and
commercially low prices to dor
mitories, fraternities and campus or
ganizations.
All four programs were conceived
by Becker, and all are year-long pro
jects. The bulk of the financing will
come from the Sunday Flicks, with
help from organizations such as the
Office of Student Affairs.
Although the cost of a season pass
to the Flicks has risen from $5 to $7,
Becker said this is not a reflection of
the new projects, but of other factors

such as the loss of profit that accom
panied last year's reduction of ad
mission from 75 to 50 cents.
Thus far, response to at least one
of the programs has been enthusias
tic — "The Graduate" attracted an
overflow crowd of approximately
600, according to Becker.
The ASSU Sunday Flicks has in
itiated four new programs designed
to furnish films, film-ordering ser
vices, and funds and showcases for
student filmmakers.
In an effort to "fulfill its obligations
of providing service to Stanford stu
dents," Flicks Manager Brian Becker
said the organization will serve such
diverse groups as campus filmmak
ers, children in Escondido Village,
dormitory and fraternity residents,
campus organizations and all those
who enjoy an occasional free movie.
The first program, entitled "Sun
day Flicks Special Events" provide
films, both free and priced, to ac
company campuswide events such
as ASSU Orientation Night and Wo
men's Week 1977.
A free midnight screening of "The
Graduate" capped off Orientation
Night and "Diary of a Mad House
wife," also free, will be shown on

Oct. 19 as part of Women's Week.
