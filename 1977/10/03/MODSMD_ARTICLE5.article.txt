# Litigation stalls grant to Hoover
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The Hoover Institution may not re
ceive a $9 million gift from a Kansas
City, Mo.-based fund because of liti
gation resulting from a plan drawn
up to disperse its assets.
A temporary restraining order was
issued Thursday against the Board of
Directors of the William Volker Fund
by a Jackson County Circuit Court
Judge. The order prevents the board
from dispersing the Fund unless
members can show that their plan to
transfer nearly 90 per cent of the
fund's assets to the Hoover Institu
tion is not a violation of the purposes
of the fund.
Missouri Attorney Gen. John
Ashcroft, who filed for the restrain
ing order, has also petitioned the
court for an order removing the fund
from the jurisdiction of its present
five directors.
In the petition Ashcroft accuses
Morris Cox, president of the fund's
board of making the gift to the Insti
tute to obtain "personal financial
benefit" since Cox expected to re
ceive an appointment at Hoover at
about the same time.
No comment
W. Glenn Campbell, Hooverdirec
tor, was asked by the Daily whether
an offer of employment was made to
Cox by mail. After Campbell had con
tradicted himself on this point sev
eral times he refused to comment
.further on:
—whether Cox had been sent a let
ter offering him a position at the In
stitution;
—whether Cox had accepted any
such offer; and
—whether Cox was aware of the
salary he would receive if appointed
to a position.
Attorney Gen. Ashcroft's petition,
however, cites a letter dated Jan. 22,

1977 submitted by the fund to the
Internal Revenue Service which
states that Cox would be appointed
to the institution starting January
1978 for five years at a salary of
$25,000 per year as a consultant to the
director.
Cox would also be appointed to
the Domestic Studies Advisory
Committee which would make prim
ary use of the newly created fund.
In a news release Robert Beyers,
director of News and Publications
Service here, said, "The University
carefully examined the proposed
grant and found its terms entirely
proper. The Internal Revenue Ser
vice (IRS) approved the proposed
grant-to Stanford in March.
"At that time, the IRS was fully ap
prised that it was likely that Morris A.
Cox would be appointed a consul
taht to the director of the Hoover
Institution. This was not a condition
of the grant," Beyers said.
Unpaid positions
Beyers also added that Joseph Car
ter of Moraga and John Burkhart of
Columbus, Ind. along with Cox were
to receive unpaid positions on the
seven-member Domestic Studies
Advisory Committee.
Beyers said, "So far as the Univer
sity knows, there is no basis to
suggest that the Volker Fund board
of directors acted other than in an
appropriate manner."
Attorney Gen. Ashcroft con
tended, however, that the dispersal
plan for the money would be "con
trary to the intent of the founder,
William Volker, and its adoption by
the defendants (the board) consti
tutes clearly improper self-dealing
and promotion of self-interest."
Roy Dietrich, another board
member, told the Kansas City Times
that the plan of distribution for the
Fund simply transferred the money
into a new memorial fund. This con
tradicts Volker's instructions given
before his death in 1947 for terminat
ing and liquidating the fund 30 years
after his death.
Receive a post
Dietrich also told the Times he un
derstood Cox was to receive a post at
the Hoover Institution at $25,000 a
year for five years and he added he
objected to this.
Cox refused to talk to the Daily
about any aspect of the fund and the
pending gift to the University. He did
tell the Times in September, "I'm not
denying that I've discussed the pos
sibility of becoming associated with
the Hoover Institution, but I have
signed nothing yet and it has nothing

to do with the advisory committee."
Cox was a member of the Hoover
Institution's Board of Overseers until
Aug. 1976. Only a short time later the
fund approached the University with
the gift offer.
Carter, Burkhart, Dietrich, and
William Ditto of San Francisco (who,
with Cox, comprise the full board for
the fund) could not be reached for
comment.
If Attorney Gen. Ashcroft's peti
tion is granted, the responsibility for
dissolving the fund and dispersing its
assets will go to five court appointed
executors whose decisions will be
subject to approval by the court.
The original dispersal plan called
for a gift of $9 million to the Hoover
Institution and gave $1 million to
Kansas City area projects and organi
zations.

tradicts Volker's instructions given
before his death in 1947 for terminat
ing and liquidating the fund 30 years
after his death.
Receive a post
Dietrich also told the Times he un
derstood Cox was to receive a post at
the Hoover Institution at $25,000 a
year for five years and he added he
objected to this.
Cox refused to talk to the Daily
about any aspect of the fund and the
pending gift to the University. He did
tell the Times in September, "I'm not
denying that I've discussed the pos
sibility of becoming associated with
the Hoover Institution, but I have
signed nothing yet and it has nothing

to do with the advisory committee."
Cox was a member of the Hoover
Institution's Board of Overseers until
Aug. 1976. Only a short time later the
fund approached the University with
the gift offer.
Carter, Burkhart, Dietrich, and
William Ditto of San Francisco (who,
with Cox, comprise the full board for
the fund) could not be reached for
comment.
If Attorney Gen. Ashcroft's peti
tion is granted, the responsibility for
dissolving the fund and dispersing its
assets will go to five court appointed
executors whose decisions will be
subject to approval by the court.
The original dispersal plan called
for a gift of $9 million to the Hoover
Institution and gave $1 million to
Kansas City area projects and organi
zations.
The Hoover Institution may not re
ceive a $9 million gift from a Kansas
City, Mo.-based fund because of liti
gation resulting from a plan drawn
up to disperse its assets.
A temporary restraining order was
issued Thursday against the Board of
Directors of the William Volker Fund
by a Jackson County Circuit Court
Judge. The order prevents the board
from dispersing the Fund unless
members can show that their plan to
transfer nearly 90 per cent of the
fund's assets to the Hoover Institu
tion is not a violation of the purposes
of the fund.
Missouri Attorney Gen. John
Ashcroft, who filed for the restrain
ing order, has also petitioned the
court for an order removing the fund
from the jurisdiction of its present
five directors.
In the petition Ashcroft accuses
Morris Cox, president of the fund's
board of making the gift to the Insti
tute to obtain "personal financial
benefit" since Cox expected to re
ceive an appointment at Hoover at
about the same time.
No comment
W. Glenn Campbell, Hooverdirec
tor, was asked by the Daily whether
an offer of employment was made to
Cox by mail. After Campbell had con
tradicted himself on this point sev
eral times he refused to comment
.further on:
—whether Cox had been sent a let
ter offering him a position at the In
stitution;
—whether Cox had accepted any
such offer; and
—whether Cox was aware of the
salary he would receive if appointed
to a position.
Attorney Gen. Ashcroft's petition,
however, cites a letter dated Jan. 22,

1977 submitted by the fund to the
Internal Revenue Service which
states that Cox would be appointed
to the institution starting January
1978 for five years at a salary of
$25,000 per year as a consultant to the
director.
Cox would also be appointed to
the Domestic Studies Advisory
Committee which would make prim
ary use of the newly created fund.
In a news release Robert Beyers,
director of News and Publications
Service here, said, "The University
carefully examined the proposed
grant and found its terms entirely
proper. The Internal Revenue Ser
vice (IRS) approved the proposed
grant-to Stanford in March.
"At that time, the IRS was fully ap
prised that it was likely that Morris A.
Cox would be appointed a consul
taht to the director of the Hoover
Institution. This was not a condition
of the grant," Beyers said.
Unpaid positions
Beyers also added that Joseph Car
ter of Moraga and John Burkhart of
Columbus, Ind. along with Cox were
to receive unpaid positions on the
seven-member Domestic Studies
Advisory Committee.
Beyers said, "So far as the Univer
sity knows, there is no basis to
suggest that the Volker Fund board
of directors acted other than in an
appropriate manner."
Attorney Gen. Ashcroft con
tended, however, that the dispersal
plan for the money would be "con
trary to the intent of the founder,
William Volker, and its adoption by
the defendants (the board) consti
tutes clearly improper self-dealing
and promotion of self-interest."

the Domestic Studies Advisory
Committee which would make prim
ary use of the newly created fund.
In a news release Robert Beyers,
director of News and Publications
Service here, said, "The University
carefully examined the proposed
grant and found its terms entirely
proper. The Internal Revenue Ser
vice (IRS) approved the proposed
grant-to Stanford in March.
"At that time, the IRS was fully ap
prised that it was likely that Morris A.
Cox would be appointed a consul
taht to the director of the Hoover
Institution. This was not a condition
of the grant," Beyers said.
Unpaid positions
Beyers also added that Joseph Car
ter of Moraga and John Burkhart of
Columbus, Ind. along with Cox were
to receive unpaid positions on the
seven-member Domestic Studies
Advisory Committee.
Beyers said, "So far as the Univer
sity knows, there is no basis to
suggest that the Volker Fund board
of directors acted other than in an
appropriate manner."
Attorney Gen. Ashcroft con
tended, however, that the dispersal
plan for the money would be "con
trary to the intent of the founder,
William Volker, and its adoption by
the defendants (the board) consti
tutes clearly improper self-dealing
and promotion of self-interest."
Roy Dietrich, another board
member, told the Kansas City Times
that the plan of distribution for the
Fund simply transferred the money
into a new memorial fund. This con
tradicts Volker's instructions given
before his death in 1947 for terminat
ing and liquidating the fund 30 years
after his death.
Receive a post
Dietrich also told the Times he un
derstood Cox was to receive a post at
the Hoover Institution at $25,000 a
year for five years and he added he
objected to this.
Cox refused to talk to the Daily
about any aspect of the fund and the
pending gift to the University. He did
tell the Times in September, "I'm not
denying that I've discussed the pos
sibility of becoming associated with
the Hoover Institution, but I have
signed nothing yet and it has nothing

to do with the advisory committee."
Cox was a member of the Hoover
Institution's Board of Overseers until
Aug. 1976. Only a short time later the
fund approached the University with
the gift offer.
Carter, Burkhart, Dietrich, and
William Ditto of San Francisco (who,
with Cox, comprise the full board for
the fund) could not be reached for
comment.
If Attorney Gen. Ashcroft's peti
tion is granted, the responsibility for
dissolving the fund and dispersing its
assets will go to five court appointed
executors whose decisions will be
subject to approval by the court.
The original dispersal plan called
for a gift of $9 million to the Hoover
Institution and gave $1 million to
Kansas City area projects and organi
zations.
