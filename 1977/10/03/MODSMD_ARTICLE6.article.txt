# Medical School awaits funds
## 
### Andrea James 
The School of Medicine will not
know until February whether it lost
$410,000 in federal funds because
school officials refused to accept
students who did not meet the Uni
versity's admission standards.
The University recently applied for
a grant made available under the
Health Professions Educational As
sistance Act of 1976. The act requires
medical schools to waive their own
academic standards in order to admit
American medical students previ
ously enrolled in foreign medical
schools who had passed only the
basic science portion of national
board examinations.
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
enclosed a letter with the application
qualifying the statement of the act.
"We believe it is essential for the
academic integrity and indepen
dence of universities that the critical
judgments about standaids for ad
mission and the quality of applicants
be made by the University and not

given over to an agency of the gov
ernment," Rich stated.
Carl Hitchner, associate counsel
for the medical center legal depart
ment, said, "I don't know the legal
consequence of the qualifying
statement, but I assume they (the
federal government) will reject our
application."
The funds are for the 1978-79
school year. Rich said the $410,000
"is a substantial fund these days" but
added the current budget does not
include the amount.
"What we especially dislike," Pres
ident Richard Lyman said, "is that
this provision takes away a piece of
the admissions process from the in
stitutions and gives it to the federal
government, with an explicit provi
sion that judgments as to the relative
academic quality of the applicants
were prohibited."
Lyman made these remarks to the
Academic Council Friday afternoon.
According to John Schwartz, Uni
versity counsel, several American

universities are challenging their
position. A number of groups, in
cluding the Association of Medical
Colleges, are working in Washington
to have the act revised.
The author of the act, Rep. Paul
Rogers (D-Fla.), has introduced a bill
modifying the law. The bill requires
schools to expand third-year enroll
ment by five per cent or 10 students,
whichever is greater, but removes
the requirement that each school set
aside its own selection criteria.
"We would seriously consider that
(Rogers' proposed amendment),"
Rich said. "In my opinion, the legis
lators just didn't think when they
made the admissions clause."
Robert Freelan, director of gov
ernment relations, explained that
Rogers was looking for a way to re
turn U.S. medical students studying
abroad back to the United States.
"There are a lot of good people who
don't get into American schools," he
said. "The supply of American medi
cal schools does not meet the de
mand."

added the current budget does not
include the amount.
"What we especially dislike," Pres
ident Richard Lyman said, "is that
this provision takes away a piece of
the admissions process from the in
stitutions and gives it to the federal
government, with an explicit provi
sion that judgments as to the relative
academic quality of the applicants
were prohibited."
Lyman made these remarks to the
Academic Council Friday afternoon.
According to John Schwartz, Uni
versity counsel, several American

universities are challenging their
position. A number of groups, in
cluding the Association of Medical
Colleges, are working in Washington
to have the act revised.
The author of the act, Rep. Paul
Rogers (D-Fla.), has introduced a bill
modifying the law. The bill requires
schools to expand third-year enroll
ment by five per cent or 10 students,
whichever is greater, but removes
the requirement that each school set
aside its own selection criteria.
"We would seriously consider that
(Rogers' proposed amendment),"
Rich said. "In my opinion, the legis
lators just didn't think when they
made the admissions clause."
Robert Freelan, director of gov
ernment relations, explained that
Rogers was looking for a way to re
turn U.S. medical students studying
abroad back to the United States.
"There are a lot of good people who
don't get into American schools," he
said. "The supply of American medi
cal schools does not meet the de
mand."
The School of Medicine will not
know until February whether it lost
$410,000 in federal funds because
school officials refused to accept
students who did not meet the Uni
versity's admission standards.
The University recently applied for
a grant made available under the
Health Professions Educational As
sistance Act of 1976. The act requires
medical schools to waive their own
academic standards in order to admit
American medical students previ
ously enrolled in foreign medical
schools who had passed only the
basic science portion of national
board examinations.
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
enclosed a letter with the application
qualifying the statement of the act.
"We believe it is essential for the
academic integrity and indepen
dence of universities that the critical
judgments about standaids for ad
mission and the quality of applicants
be made by the University and not

given over to an agency of the gov
ernment," Rich stated.
Carl Hitchner, associate counsel
for the medical center legal depart
ment, said, "I don't know the legal
consequence of the qualifying
statement, but I assume they (the
federal government) will reject our
application."
The funds are for the 1978-79
school year. Rich said the $410,000
"is a substantial fund these days" but
added the current budget does not
include the amount.
