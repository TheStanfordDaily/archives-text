# Drought conditions stay severe here

### Barbie Fields 
Drought conditions on campus continue to be severe despite in
creased cooperation from staff, faculty, and students, according to
Herb Fong, grounds supervisor for plant services.
The drought's primary victims have been large eucalyptus trees, Fong
said, with over 100 perishing in the last two years. He placed their value
at "over $500 each."
Hardest hit areas of campus include Frost Amphitheater, the Ar
boretum, and the trees just north of the golfing range. "Lake Lagunita
won't be filled for at least another two years even if we have normal
rainfall in that time," said Fong.
I n response to the crisis, plant services has cut back its water usage by
50 per cent, twice the requested reduction. The University as a whole
has lowered water consumption by 26 per cent for 1976-77 over 1975-76,
according to official figures.
However, the University policy of not running fountains is in at least
one case being ignored. TheTerman Engineering Building fountain was
drained of its 60,000 gallons of water, cleaned, then filled with the same
amount of fresh water. It has been flowing since that time. Fong said the
fountain was activated for publicity pictures but he saw no reason why it
is running at present.
"Several waste water reclamation projects are now being researched
by the University," said Jim McKnight, manager of utilities here.
"Students may not realize the indirect consequences of not conserv
ing water themselves," he added. These consequences may include
anything from increased board payments to less money for special
programs.
Palo Alto has also answered the 25 per cent cutback request with a 29
per cent reduction in August 1977 compared with August 1976. Monthly
cutbacks have been as high as 40 per cent of the 1976 base year,
according to a Palo Alto Water Department spokesman.
"California is still in the middle of a serious drought," Fong said.
"The need for concerned and careful water usage will be with us for a
long time," said Fong.
McKnight said rationing here was unlikely because the University is
not on a municipal water system.

Over $50,000 in drought related damage has destroyed many eucalyptus
trees on the Stanford campus. Even with a normal rainfall this winter, the
water shortage will prevent the filling of Lake Lagunita for at least two
years.
