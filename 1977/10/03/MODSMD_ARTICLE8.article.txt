# Government oppression of gays — never again?

On July 11, the Santa Clara Valley
Coalition for Human Rights adopted
the following statement of purpose:
"We, the members of the Santa
Clara Valley Coalition for Human
Rights, support the right of all indi
viduals to peacefully pursue the
creed and lifestyle of their choice,
and hold that it is not a proper func
tion of government to either prom
ote or discourage any such choice.
"We therefore oppose the at
tempts of some individuals and
groups to use coercive power, in
cluding that of the state, to repress
peaceful behavior which they find
objectionable. And we support the
education of the general public on
the contributions of minority lifes
tyles to the advancement of the gen
eral welfare."
Our coalition will no longer toler
ate the government taxing gay
people to pay for housing and urban
development and then denying them
the housing and services provided by
these programs. Nor can we tolerate
such acts as the deliberate exclusion
of gay individuals from government
funded legal aid programs, as was
recently approved by Congress.
We have watched the injustice of
our sisters and brothers being de
nied access to housing, jobs, and
public accommodations, not because
of what they are as individuals, but
because they have been slandered
by misconceptions and deliberate
lies, as members of an undesirable

group.
We have watched the invasion of
their personal privacy behind the
doors of their own homes and know
that the same potential threat awaits
other groups if none speak out in
opposition. And so we say "never
again."
Gay individuals are not asking for
special rights —they are demanding
their full rights as human beings. Gay
persons are not "special people."
There are an estimated 20,000,000
gays in this country, in all walks of
life: doctors, factory workers, police
officers, college professors, busi
ness owners, priests and ministers,
family members — and yes —
teachers.
There are some 75,000 of these
productive members of our society
right here in the Santa Clara Valley.
This coalition demands for them full
citizenship in this community, this
state and this nation. We demand
that they be accorded their full rights
to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness —as they conceive it to
be).
These rights exist, and they are
threatened. We can not remain silent
any longer.
Gays have been exploited by fame
— and glory-seeking politicians —
and it would seem that they shall now
become the victims of legislation that
would deny them the right even to
seek certain kinds of employment.
What is to happen next? Is it possible

that people might be encouraged to
abuse or even murder gay men and
women? *
It is obvious to us that many of
those people who would deny gays
their rights promote their own cause
by using emotionally powerful lies.
To them we say: "We deny your
charges. We deny that there is truth
in your vicious distortions."
And, most emphatically, we deny
that this is a battle which the gay
community must fight alone. We
stand here today, gay and straight
alike, united in the belief that when
the rights of any are threatened, then
the rights of all are threatened. In the
words of Pastor Niemoller, a Luthe
ran minister who died in the con
centration camps of Nazi Germany:
"In Germany they came first for
the Communists, but I did not speak
up because I wasn't a Communist.
And then they came for the trade un
ionists, but I did not speak up be
cause I was not a trade unionist. And
then they came for the Jews, but I did
not speak up for I was not a Jew. And
then they came for me, and by that
time there was no one left to speak
up."
And so we of the coalition say to
you yet once more — "never again."

creed and lifestyle of their choice,
and hold that it is not a proper func
tion of government to either prom
ote or discourage any such choice.
"We therefore oppose the at
tempts of some individuals and
groups to use coercive power, in
cluding that of the state, to repress
peaceful behavior which they find
objectionable. And we support the
education of the general public on
the contributions of minority lifes
tyles to the advancement of the gen
eral welfare."
Our coalition will no longer toler
ate the government taxing gay
people to pay for housing and urban
development and then denying them
the housing and services provided by
these programs. Nor can we tolerate
such acts as the deliberate exclusion
of gay individuals from government
funded legal aid programs, as was
recently approved by Congress.
We have watched the injustice of
our sisters and brothers being de
nied access to housing, jobs, and
public accommodations, not because
of what they are as individuals, but
because they have been slandered
by misconceptions and deliberate
lies, as members of an undesirable

group.
We have watched the invasion of
their personal privacy behind the
doors of their own homes and know
that the same potential threat awaits
other groups if none speak out in
opposition. And so we say "never
again."
Gay individuals are not asking for
special rights —they are demanding
their full rights as human beings. Gay
persons are not "special people."
There are an estimated 20,000,000
gays in this country, in all walks of
life: doctors, factory workers, police
officers, college professors, busi
ness owners, priests and ministers,
family members — and yes —
teachers.
There are some 75,000 of these
productive members of our society
right here in the Santa Clara Valley.
This coalition demands for them full
citizenship in this community, this
state and this nation. We demand
that they be accorded their full rights
to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness —as they conceive it to
be).
These rights exist, and they are
threatened. We can not remain silent
any longer.
Gays have been exploited by fame
— and glory-seeking politicians —
and it would seem that they shall now
become the victims of legislation that
would deny them the right even to
seek certain kinds of employment.
What is to happen next? Is it possible

that people might be encouraged to
abuse or even murder gay men and
women? *
It is obvious to us that many of
those people who would deny gays
their rights promote their own cause
by using emotionally powerful lies.
To them we say: "We deny your
charges. We deny that there is truth
in your vicious distortions."
And, most emphatically, we deny
that this is a battle which the gay
community must fight alone. We
stand here today, gay and straight
alike, united in the belief that when
the rights of any are threatened, then
the rights of all are threatened. In the
words of Pastor Niemoller, a Luthe
ran minister who died in the con
centration camps of Nazi Germany:
"In Germany they came first for
the Communists, but I did not speak
up because I wasn't a Communist.
And then they came for the trade un
ionists, but I did not speak up be
cause I was not a trade unionist. And
then they came for the Jews, but I did
not speak up for I was not a Jew. And
then they came for me, and by that
time there was no one left to speak
up."
And so we of the coalition say to
you yet once more — "never again."
