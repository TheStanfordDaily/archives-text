# High court to hear Daily search case
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The U.S. Supreme Court decided
yesterday that it will rule on the con
stitutionality of a raid conducted on
the offices of the Stanford Daily by
officers of the Palo Alto police de
partment in 1971.
The high court granted the peti
tions for a hearing on the case follow
ing the appeal to the court by the
Santa Clara District Attorney and the
city of Palo Alto, both defendants in
the case.
A federal district court and the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals have ruled
the search unconstitutional, saying it
violated the First and Fourth
Amendments.
Also, the appeals court upheld an
award of $47,500 in attorneys' fees to
the Daily.
The city and county have 45 days to
file briefs in the case and the Daily
has 30 days to respond thereafter.
Oral arguments in the case are ex
pected to begin sometime in
lanuary, according to Supreme
Court clerk Michael Rodak.
'Amicus' briefs
In addition tothe briefs filed by the
immediate parties in the case, Daily
lawyer Jerome Falk Jr. expects sev
eral amicus curiae briefs to be filed
on behalf of the Daily, including one
from the Reporter's Committee for
Freedom of the Press.
Falk said he was somewhat
perplexed by the court's decision to
hear the case because the case
lacked some of the normal reasons
for granting certiorari. He noted that
the high court often takes cases
where the lower and appellate courts
have severe differences.
In the Daily case, however, there
was no point on which the two courts
had disagreed.
The case, The Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher, stems from a raid on the
Daily offices by four Palo Alto police
officers on April 12, 1971. Equipped
with a search warrant, police went
through files, desks and wastebas
kets looking for photographic evi
dence to use against participants in
an April 9,1971 demonstration at the
Stanford hospital.
Twenty-three persons were ar
rested and at least 37 persons were
injured — including nine police of
ficers — when police ended the hos
pital sit-in. The sit-in was called to
protest the firing of a black hospital
worker.
First raid
The raid was the first known time
in U.S. history that police obtained a
warrant to search a news organiza
tion for evidence, according to Falk.
Since the Daily raid, Berkeley radio
station KPFA-FM, Los Angeles station
KPFK-FM and San Francisco station
KPOO have experienced similar
raids. A search also occurred at the
Los Angeles Star and at least two
search warrants have been issued
against the Berkeley Barb.
In October 1972, U.S. Dist. Court
Judge Robert Peckham ruled police
should employ the "least drastic
means" available when seeking evi
dence from nonsuspects.

The police obtained a search war
rant, which gave the Daily no ad
vance warning, rather than a sub
poena, which the Daily could have
attempted to quash.
Peckham's opinion, adopted in its
entirety by the appeals court, said
the search violated the Fourth
Amendment's protection against
"unreasonable searches and sei
zures." He warned law enforcement
agencies to be especially careful
when First Amendment interests are
involved.
'Preferred'
In such a case, he said, "the sub
poena should always be preferred to
a search warrant. A search warrant
should be permitted only in the rare
circumstances where there is a clear
showing that 1) important materials
will be destroyed or removed from
the jurisdiction; and 2) a restraining
order would prove futile. To stop
short of this standard would be to
sneer at all the First Amendment has
come to represent in our society."
Palo Alto, in its brief for certiorari
contended the decisions "will cut
back severely the instances in which
a warrant may be employed in 'non
suspect' situations" and will result in
an "unprecedented extension of the
Fourth Amendment's probable
cause language ... in all warrant
contexts."
Daily lawyers, however, argued in
their response opposing certiorari
that the district court "expressly re
fused in this very case to extend its
ruling beyond the immediate context
of a newspaper office search."
Robert Horn, professor of political
science here, said that when "the
court grants certiorari it's more likely
to reverse the lower court decision."
Horn said this had been particularly
true with Fourth Amendment cases
in the last 20 years.
