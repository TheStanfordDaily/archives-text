# What really happened in NIRT contract?

As an Iranian student, I protest the
statement made by Sponsored Pro
jects Director Earl Cilley in reference
to the NIRT contract in the Sept. 26
Daily which said "(Iranians) don't put
the same premium on time, and it's a
cultural thing."
This is clearly a statement showing
shocking ignorance issued by an of
ficial member of the Stanford ad
ministration. My opinion is that the
issue of the contract deal settlement
had less to do with cultural notions of
"time" than it did with availability of
funds in Iran to meet financial com
mitments abroad.
Cilley certainly knows that the en
tire Iranian government is under U.S.

control. The NIRT contract is another
means to hold this relationship,
especially now that the Iranian
people are more organized in their
just struggle against the U.S.-backed
regime of the Shah.
However, in association with other
Western countries, the U.S. recycled
most Iranian oil money back into
U.S. multi-national corporations
while the remainder went into the
bank accounts of the Shah and other
members of the ruling class. The
country as a whole went bankrupt;
local planners had great difficulties
in balancing the 1975 and 1976
budgets (See: Iran at the End of the
Century, R. Looney, 1977). Thus most
of the "planned" projects had to be
cut, and naturally the NIRT deal was
no exception.
Turning to the quality of the con
tract work. While members of the re
view committee organized by Vice
President for Business and Finance
William Massy were "very satisfied"
by the quality of the work that has
been done, I am wondering how
other members of the Stanford
community would react after reading
the industrial engineering disserta
tion which was developed under the
deal by D.E. Djawan and the princi
ple investigdior, Assoc. Prof. Bruce
Lusignan of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department on "Planning for Ag
ricultural Education in Developing
Countries."
Looking just at the summary of re
sults one can find such vague state
ments as "The step by step proce
dures described in Section D were
very effective in being able to reduce
the complexity and receive clear, ac
curate input from the experts. The
process converged rapidly to an effi
cient set of courses and schedules."
And other statements which one
could call ignorant by implication:
"The single resource the planners
could not seen an answer for was the
skill of the farmers."
I feel it is interesting to point out
that the dissertation was developed
in less than one year. Rarely has a
Ph.D. dissertation been developed,
written, accepted and approved in
less than a year. I wonder about this
Iranian student's sense of "time." No
one has bothered to comment on
this dissertation approved in such an
unusually short period of time â€” nor
on the fact that Stanford approved
the dissertation of a student who
studied a project which his country

awarded to Stanford.
The apparent goal may have been a
fast implementation of Stanford-
NIRT's blueprint to impose cultural
change to the Iranian farmers which
previous U.S. plans have failed to ac
complish.

If you would be interested in form
ing a different Review Committee to
evaluate the contract reports, please
call 497-4331 and ask for the Inde
pendent NIRT Review Committee.
