# Sniff and Sip
## Know your wine 
### Jill Liscom 
Imagine that you are at a party and when the
wine is served, you are able to tell with a sniff
and a sip the grape variety, country, age and
approximate price range.
Sound impressive? With the help of an
eight-week wine tasting class offered here, it's a
relatively easy thing to learn.
The wine tasting courses taught this quarter,
sponsored by the Stanford Enology Club, in
clude "Basic Tasting" and "Perspectives on
California Wine." The classes are held weekly in
Tresidder for a fee of about $40.
Students in the class taste eight to 12 different
wines at each session, in addition to receiving
about an hour of instruction.

When tasting wine, 'the
hardest part is en
couraging students to
get over that test anxiety
that so many Stanford
students have. . . yet, if
you force them to do it,
how happy they are
when they find it's easy
to do.'

According to Bruce Cass, one of the three
course instructors, people usually find it dif
ficult to teach themselves to be wine connois
seurs by drinking different wines on separate
occasions. "They don't get pungent examples
and it's hard to put all the tastes and smells
together," he said.
Comparison
In the classes, students usually compare two
or three wines at a time to emphasize one point,
such as its regionality. Sometimes the wines will
be altered chemically to make the difference
more noticeable.
Cass also stressed the importance of using
expensive wines for tasting because they are
more distinctive. "If you use mediocre bulk
wines, there is no individuality and it's hard to
tell the differences," he explained.

Most of the people who choose to take the
class already have an interest in wine and are
looking for direction and technical background,
said Cass. However, the classes are also "a good
social time," he said.
"The hardest part is encouraging students to
get over that test anxiety that so many Stanford
students have," remarked Cass. Class members
are sometimes asked to taste a wine while
blindfolded and tell what variety it is.
Amazed
"It's amazing how resistant they are, yet if you
force them to do it, how happy they are when
they find it's easy to do," Cass commented.
"The level of personal accomplishment is very
high, and the people are usually very enthusias
tic."
In addition, the class has a relaxed atmos
phere because "everybody is on an equal level.
The students are usually very relieved you don't
have to participate in a snobbish hierarchy. The
main emphasis is on using creativity in trying to
describe the smells and tastes," added Cass.
At the end of the course, students are given
four white wines and four red wines and asked
to name the grape variety, country, age and ap
proximate price. According to Cass, about 80
per cent of the students can name at least six
varieties correctly.
One of the major concerns of the class, said
Cass, is the problem of students drinking too
much. "We prefer that people take only a small
amount of each wine, and we suggest that they
spit the wine out after tasting it."
Bread and cheese
Also, bread and cheese are served at each
session and the wine tasting is spread out over a
period of two and a half hours to dull the effects
of the alcohol.
"The volume of people talking goes up as the
class goes on, but there aren't people stumbling
around or telling dirty jokes," Cass said jok
ingly. "Even if people were getting high, they
don't act it out as much. They're much more
responsible in a class atmosphere than if they
were at a picnic."
In addition to the wine tasting classes, the
Enology Club also sponsors individual wine tast
ings on Tuesday nights in Lagunita Dining Hall.
A different type of wine is featured at each tast
ing, and the cost to participate varies according
to the price of the wines being tasted.
These tastings are conductedby Enology Club
members, and, while there is not much instruc
tion, Cass said the tastings are considered excel
lent social events.

main emphasis is on using creativity in trying to
describe the smells and tastes," added Cass.
At the end of the course, students are given
four white wines and four red wines and asked
to name the grape variety, country, age and ap
proximate price. According to Cass, about 80
per cent of the students can name at least six
varieties correctly.
One of the major concerns of the class, said
Cass, is the problem of students drinking too
much. "We prefer that people take only a small
amount of each wine, and we suggest that they
spit the wine out after tasting it."
Bread and cheese
Also, bread and cheese are served at each
session and the wine tasting is spread out over a
period of two and a half hours to dull the effects
of the alcohol.
"The volume of people talking goes up as the
class goes on, but there aren't people stumbling
around or telling dirty jokes," Cass said jok
ingly. "Even if people were getting high, they
don't act it out as much. They're much more
responsible in a class atmosphere than if they
were at a picnic."
In addition to the wine tasting classes, the
Enology Club also sponsors individual wine tast
ings on Tuesday nights in Lagunita Dining Hall.
A different type of wine is featured at each tast
ing, and the cost to participate varies according
to the price of the wines being tasted.
These tastings are conductedby Enology Club
members, and, while there is not much instruc
tion, Cass said the tastings are considered excel
lent social events.

Imagine that you are at a party and when the
wine is served, you are able to tell with a sniff
and a sip the grape variety, country, age and
approximate price range.
Sound impressive? With the help of an
eight-week wine tasting class offered here, it's a
relatively easy thing to learn.
The wine tasting courses taught this quarter,
sponsored by the Stanford Enology Club, in
clude "Basic Tasting" and "Perspectives on
California Wine." The classes are held weekly in
Tresidder for a fee of about $40.
Students in the class taste eight to 12 different
wines at each session, in addition to receiving
about an hour of instruction.

When tasting wine, 'the
hardest part is en
couraging students to
get over that test anxiety
that so many Stanford
students have. . . yet, if
you force them to do it,
how happy they are
when they find it's easy
to do.'

According to Bruce Cass, one of the three
course instructors, people usually find it dif
ficult to teach themselves to be wine connois
seurs by drinking different wines on separate
occasions. "They don't get pungent examples
and it's hard to put all the tastes and smells
together," he said.
Comparison
In the classes, students usually compare two
or three wines at a time to emphasize one point,
such as its regionality. Sometimes the wines will
be altered chemically to make the difference
more noticeable.
Cass also stressed the importance of using
expensive wines for tasting because they are
more distinctive. "If you use mediocre bulk
wines, there is no individuality and it's hard to
tell the differences," he explained.

Most of the people who choose to take the
class already have an interest in wine and are
looking for direction and technical background,
said Cass. However, the classes are also "a good
social time," he said.
"The hardest part is encouraging students to
get over that test anxiety that so many Stanford
students have," remarked Cass. Class members
are sometimes asked to taste a wine while
blindfolded and tell what variety it is.
Amazed
"It's amazing how resistant they are, yet if you
force them to do it, how happy they are when
they find it's easy to do," Cass commented.
"The level of personal accomplishment is very
high, and the people are usually very enthusias
tic."
In addition, the class has a relaxed atmos
phere because "everybody is on an equal level.

have to participate in a snobbish hierarchy. The
main emphasis is on using creativity in trying to
