# Jarrett scores after two misses
## Strong backup, slick solos make 'Byablue' a winner 
### 
Byablue: Keith Jarrett
Impulse Records
Staircase: Keith larrett
ECM Records
Although Keith Jarrett has not recorded
for ABC/Impulse for over two years, the
company has continued to release albums
under his name at a steady rate. The last
two, "Mysteries" and "Shades," con
tained music which would have been best
forgotten, leaving many listeners and cri
tics with the impression that ABC had only
sub-par material left in its vaults.
The latest Jarrett album from ABC,
"Byablue," is a surprising and pleasant
change from the previous releases. Al
though ABC has discontinued its practice
of listing recording dates, the music re
sembles Jarrett's more recent (and more
mature) work for the ECM label.
Part of the credit for the album's success
also must lie with Jarrett's sidemen. Char
lie Haden literally sparkles on bass, par
ticularly on "Rainbow" and "Fantasm,"
while Dewey Redman plays his best sax to
date. Paul Motian, who surprisingly con
tributed over half the songs on the album,
remains one of the most innovative
drummers playing today.
But Jarrett is the star. His playing is
beautifully fluid and melodic; the album's
only low points occur when he abandons
the piano to play soprano saxophone.

His playing on "Trieste" is remarkable
not only for its virtuosity, but also for the
way Jarrett never allows virtuosity to pre
vent the music from being a group effort.
"Trieste" is perhaps the best piece the
Keith Jarrett quartet has recorded.
"Staircase," on the ECM label, is a more
recent recording which showcases Jar
rett's abilities as a solo pianist. Jarrett's first
solo album since the highly successful
"Koln Concert," "Staircase" is more com
plex and more mature than its predeces
sor.
Relying less upon repetitive patterns
and ostinato bass lines, "Staircase"
houses a wealth of musical ideas. This is
not to say that the music is less accessible
than the "Koln Concert"; the album
moves at a relaxed, meditative tempo with
a greater reliance on harmonic tension
than on high-speed piano acrobatics. The
music captures the imagination and, un
like many albums released today, benefits
from repeated listening.
The album consists of four composi
tions, each one side long and apparently
composed rather than improvised. The
four pieces, entitled "Staircase,"
"Hourglass," "Sundial" and "Sand" dis
play a wide variety of pianistic approaches
and strengthens Jarrett's position as the
most eclectic acoustic pianist in jazz today.
While McCoy Tyner and Cecil Taylor, both

of whom received more votes than Jarrett
in the recent Downbeat poll, are unmis
takably brilliant, their approaches to the
piano are very stylistic and lack Jarrett's
comprehensiveness.
The acoustic jazz pianist of the '70s has
been challenged on one hand by the
onslaught of electric instruments and on
the other by the problem of remaining in
novative without relinquishing traditional
harmony. The spectre of atonality, which
deprived contemporary classical music
almost completely of its audience,
threatens to engulf avant-garde jazz.
Jarrett's ability to approach his music
from any number of harmonic perspec
tives (romantic, impressionistic, atonal,
gospel) has endowed him with the most
persuasive viewpoint on jazz piano to be
found today.
Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, who
have displayed the ability to make innova
tive and important music, have opted for
more conservative, more popularcourses.
If jazz piano is to rival classical, it will be
through the path Jarrett is breaking.
Both "Byablue" and "Staircase" are very
enjoyable albums and will, perhaps, in
time be seen as significant records as well.
For the avid jazz fan, in addition to the
casual listener, they are highly recom
mended.

beautifully fluid and melodic; the album's
only low points occur when he abandons
the piano to play soprano saxophone.

His playing on "Trieste" is remarkable
not only for its virtuosity, but also for the
way Jarrett never allows virtuosity to pre
vent the music from being a group effort.
"Trieste" is perhaps the best piece the
Keith Jarrett quartet has recorded.
"Staircase," on the ECM label, is a more
recent recording which showcases Jar
rett's abilities as a solo pianist. Jarrett's first
solo album since the highly successful
"Koln Concert," "Staircase" is more com
plex and more mature than its predeces
sor.
Relying less upon repetitive patterns
and ostinato bass lines, "Staircase"
houses a wealth of musical ideas. This is
not to say that the music is less accessible
than the "Koln Concert"; the album
moves at a relaxed, meditative tempo with
a greater reliance on harmonic tension
than on high-speed piano acrobatics. The
music captures the imagination and, un
like many albums released today, benefits
from repeated listening.
The album consists of four composi
tions, each one side long and apparently
composed rather than improvised. The
four pieces, entitled "Staircase,"
"Hourglass," "Sundial" and "Sand" dis
play a wide variety of pianistic approaches
and strengthens Jarrett's position as the
most eclectic acoustic pianist in jazz today.
While McCoy Tyner and Cecil Taylor, both

of whom received more votes than Jarrett
in the recent Downbeat poll, are unmis
takably brilliant, their approaches to the
piano are very stylistic and lack Jarrett's
comprehensiveness.
The acoustic jazz pianist of the '70s has
been challenged on one hand by the
onslaught of electric instruments and on
the other by the problem of remaining in
novative without relinquishing traditional
harmony. The spectre of atonality, which
deprived contemporary classical music
almost completely of its audience,
threatens to engulf avant-garde jazz.
Jarrett's ability to approach his music
from any number of harmonic perspec
tives (romantic, impressionistic, atonal,
gospel) has endowed him with the most
persuasive viewpoint on jazz piano to be
found today.
Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, who
have displayed the ability to make innova
tive and important music, have opted for
more conservative, more popularcourses.
If jazz piano is to rival classical, it will be
through the path Jarrett is breaking.
Both "Byablue" and "Staircase" are very
enjoyable albums and will, perhaps, in
time be seen as significant records as well.
For the avid jazz fan, in addition to the
casual listener, they are highly recom
mended.

Byablue: Keith Jarrett
Impulse Records
Staircase: Keith larrett
ECM Records
Although Keith Jarrett has not recorded
for ABC/Impulse for over two years, the
company has continued to release albums
under his name at a steady rate. The last
two, "Mysteries" and "Shades," con
tained music which would have been best
forgotten, leaving many listeners and cri
tics with the impression that ABC had only
sub-par material left in its vaults.
The latest Jarrett album from ABC,
"Byablue," is a surprising and pleasant
change from the previous releases. Al
though ABC has discontinued its practice
of listing recording dates, the music re
sembles Jarrett's more recent (and more
mature) work for the ECM label.
Part of the credit for the album's success
also must lie with Jarrett's sidemen. Char
lie Haden literally sparkles on bass, par
ticularly on "Rainbow" and "Fantasm,"
while Dewey Redman plays his best sax to
date. Paul Motian, who surprisingly con
tributed over half the songs on the album,
remains one of the most innovative
drummers playing today.
But Jarrett is the star. His playing is
beautifully fluid and melodic; the album's
only low points occur when he abandons
the piano to play soprano saxophone.
