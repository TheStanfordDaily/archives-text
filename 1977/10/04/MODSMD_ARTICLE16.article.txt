# Two revivals in the City
## 'Irma' & 'Sorceror' 
### 
The Civic Light Opera's
"Irma La Douce" is a "what
if. . and "why not?" pro
duction.
Who could ask for more?
Priscilla Lopez, Larry Kert
and George S. Irving.
Robert Fletcher's costumes.
Michael Kidd as director/
choreographer.
But the script limps and
the songs sound suspici
ously similar. "Irma La
Douce," only a moderate
Broadway hit years ago, de
feats its cast.

To make up for the weak
nesses, Kidd and his desig
ners go wild. This story of a
goldenhearted prostitute
who finds love in Cay Paree
opens as a Toulouse-
Lautrec and ends some
where between Gilligan's Is
land and the Ziegfield Fol
lies.
Which isn't so bad.
This footloose staging
pumps life into a flat show.
Fletcher, the ACT vete
ran, brings out his undersea
line, polar wardrobe and
Devil's Island wear with in
genious creations like a

giant manta ray, dancing oc
topi and floppy penguins.
Sets and special effects
include whirling tables, flip
flop walls, flashing lights,
balloons and ladders with
balconies that make the
most of the Orpheum stage.
George S. Irving, the
Stage Manager-bartender,
wins wry laughs and guffaws
with sharp timing and stunts
like a one-man band pan
tomime with orchestra ac
companiment.
As Irma, the hooker who
can't stop giving (that's how
she sees it), Priscilla Lopez
doesn't have the songs she
did in "A Chorus Line." But
she shines anyway, her
cardboard character enter
taining if not intriguing.
Larry Kert plays both the
law student who wins Irma
and the old benefactor who
demands she cut her clien
tele in a ploy to keep her off
the streets. Kert the student
is too old, always a step be
hind Lopez. More comfort
able as the benefactor, he
sings both parts with his
familiar sharp, clear voice.
("Irma La Douce" plays at
the Orpheum Theatre,
Market St. in San Francisco,
through October.)

Gilbert & Sullivan
If you're in the mood for
Gilbert and Sullivan, you'll
love the Lamplighters'
"Sorcerer."
It's comfortably classic
fun, glowing with magic,
music and British tongue in
cheek.
This production makes no
pretensions beyond
polished if flatly traditional
theater.
Robert Wood's Alexis is a
sharp, clear tenor who soars
with the long notes. This
love-crazed grenadier, who
uses magic to marry off his
entire village swaggers,
cowers and stumbles like
the best G & S hero.
Georgia Prugh's Aline
matches Wood's acting but
her voice melts into her
songs. Her face is a comic
canvas.
)ohn Rouse, the sorceror
who helps Alexis, plays off
his pyrotechnic entrances
and lighthearted magic
tricks with a used car
dealer's delivery.
("The Sorceror" runs
through Oct. 29 at the Pre
sentation Hall, 2350 Turk St.
in San Francisco.)

able as the benefactor, he
sings both parts with his
familiar sharp, clear voice.
("Irma La Douce" plays at
the Orpheum Theatre,
Market St. in San Francisco,
through October.)

Gilbert & Sullivan
If you're in the mood for
Gilbert and Sullivan, you'll
love the Lamplighters'
"Sorcerer."
It's comfortably classic
fun, glowing with magic,
music and British tongue in
cheek.
This production makes no
pretensions beyond
polished if flatly traditional
theater.
Robert Wood's Alexis is a
sharp, clear tenor who soars
with the long notes. This
love-crazed grenadier, who
uses magic to marry off his
entire village swaggers,
cowers and stumbles like
the best G & S hero.
Georgia Prugh's Aline
matches Wood's acting but
her voice melts into her
songs. Her face is a comic
canvas.
)ohn Rouse, the sorceror
who helps Alexis, plays off
his pyrotechnic entrances
and lighthearted magic
tricks with a used car
dealer's delivery.
("The Sorceror" runs
through Oct. 29 at the Pre
sentation Hall, 2350 Turk St.
in San Francisco.)

The Civic Light Opera's
"Irma La Douce" is a "what
if. . and "why not?" pro
duction.
Who could ask for more?
Priscilla Lopez, Larry Kert
and George S. Irving.
Robert Fletcher's costumes.
Michael Kidd as director/
choreographer.
But the script limps and
the songs sound suspici
ously similar. "Irma La
Douce," only a moderate
Broadway hit years ago, de
feats its cast.

To make up for the weak
nesses, Kidd and his desig
ners go wild. This story of a
goldenhearted prostitute
who finds love in Cay Paree
opens as a Toulouse-
Lautrec and ends some
where between Gilligan's Is
land and the Ziegfield Fol
lies.
Which isn't so bad.
This footloose staging
pumps life into a flat show.
Fletcher, the ACT vete
ran, brings out his undersea
line, polar wardrobe and
Devil's Island wear with in
genious creations like a

giant manta ray, dancing oc
topi and floppy penguins.
Sets and special effects
include whirling tables, flip
flop walls, flashing lights,
balloons and ladders with
balconies that make the
most of the Orpheum stage.
George S. Irving, the
Stage Manager-bartender,
wins wry laughs and guffaws
with sharp timing and stunts
like a one-man band pan
tomime with orchestra ac
companiment.
As Irma, the hooker who
can't stop giving (that's how
she sees it), Priscilla Lopez
doesn't have the songs she
did in "A Chorus Line." But
she shines anyway, her
cardboard character enter
taining if not intriguing.
Larry Kert plays both the
law student who wins Irma
and the old benefactor who
demands she cut her clien
tele in a ploy to keep her off
the streets. Kert the student
is too old, always a step be
hind Lopez. More comfort
able as the benefactor, he
sings both parts with his
familiar sharp, clear voice.
