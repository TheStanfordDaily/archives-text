# La 						Grande Bourgeoise
## Unsatisfying period piece by Bolognini 
### 
"La Grande Bourgeoise" is
an extremely well done period
piece set in turn-of-the
century Italy, based on a scan
dal which occurred in 1897
Bologna. The film has probably
been anticipated more for its
stars, Ciancarlo Ciannini and
Catherine Deneuve, than for

the reputation of veteran Ita
lian director, Mauro Bolognini.
Giannini and Deneuve por
tray a brother and sister in
tensely devoted to one
another. Fernando Rey plays
their father, a famous doctor
and free-thinking socialist,
who has attempted to instill his

high moral code in his chil
dren. Deneuve has made a
poor marriage to a conserva
tive doctor, despised by both
Giannini and Rey.
To end his sister's misery,
Giannini, a prominent lawyer
and Socialist Party candidate,
would willingly sacrifice any
thing. The consequences of his
plan involve theentire family in
a scandalous investigation.
Because of the upcoming
elections and the family's
strong socialist and progres
sive tendencies, the Catholic-
Conservative Party, led by a
fanatic police detective (played
by Marcel Bozzufi, the assassin
in both "Z" and"The French
Connection"), is determined
to destroy the family's reputa
tion and to hurt the socialist's
election chances.
justice becomes a blurred
concept influenced by political
animosities; however, the in

nocence of the accused is not
definitely established and it is
difficult for the viewer to feel
the injustice involved.
The plot has potential, but
the film devotes too much time
to developing certain relation
ships and counts too much on
impressing the viewer with
lavish scenery. It is also hard to
identify with the characters be
cause of difficulty in getting
emotionally tied to their feel
ings and thoughts. Bolognini
raises some valid questions
concerning society and poli
tics, but in a manner which is
neither intriguing nor relevant.
Giannini is a polished actor
and plays his part well, but this
is not as impressive as his per
formances for Lina Wertmuller
in movies such as "Swept
Away," "Seven Beauties," and
"The Seduction of Mimi."
Bolognini doesn't take advan

tage of Giannini's facial ex
pression and the part is less
convincing since it relies too
heavily on vocal expression.
Catherine Deneuve does an
adequate job, but her role
doesn't reach out to viewer
empathy since it lacks depth of
character.
As a movie set in historical
mood and perspective, "La
Grande Bourgeoise" is an ex
cellent film with beautiful
scenery. The viewer who ap
preciates these facts will enjoy
the movie, although the film
supplies neitherentertainment
nor intellectual stimulation.

raises some valid questions
concerning society and poli
tics, but in a manner which is
neither intriguing nor relevant.
Giannini is a polished actor
and plays his part well, but this
is not as impressive as his per
formances for Lina Wertmuller
in movies such as "Swept
Away," "Seven Beauties," and
"The Seduction of Mimi."
Bolognini doesn't take advan

tage of Giannini's facial ex
pression and the part is less
convincing since it relies too
heavily on vocal expression.
Catherine Deneuve does an
adequate job, but her role
doesn't reach out to viewer
empathy since it lacks depth of
character.
As a movie set in historical
mood and perspective, "La
Grande Bourgeoise" is an ex
cellent film with beautiful
scenery. The viewer who ap
preciates these facts will enjoy
the movie, although the film
supplies neitherentertainment
nor intellectual stimulation.

"La Grande Bourgeoise" is
an extremely well done period
piece set in turn-of-the
century Italy, based on a scan
dal which occurred in 1897
Bologna. The film has probably
been anticipated more for its
stars, Ciancarlo Ciannini and
Catherine Deneuve, than for

the reputation of veteran Ita
lian director, Mauro Bolognini.
Giannini and Deneuve por
tray a brother and sister in
tensely devoted to one
another. Fernando Rey plays
their father, a famous doctor
and free-thinking socialist,
who has attempted to instill his

high moral code in his chil
dren. Deneuve has made a
poor marriage to a conserva
tive doctor, despised by both
Giannini and Rey.
To end his sister's misery,
Giannini, a prominent lawyer
and Socialist Party candidate,
would willingly sacrifice any
thing. The consequences of his
plan involve theentire family in
a scandalous investigation.
Because of the upcoming
elections and the family's
strong socialist and progres
sive tendencies, the Catholic-
Conservative Party, led by a
fanatic police detective (played
by Marcel Bozzufi, the assassin
in both "Z" and"The French
Connection"), is determined
to destroy the family's reputa
tion and to hurt the socialist's
election chances.
justice becomes a blurred
concept influenced by political
animosities; however, the in

nocence of the accused is not
definitely established and it is
difficult for the viewer to feel
the injustice involved.
The plot has potential, but
the film devotes too much time
to developing certain relation
ships and counts too much on
impressing the viewer with
lavish scenery. It is also hard to
identify with the characters be
cause of difficulty in getting
emotionally tied to their feel
ings and thoughts. Bolognini
