# Bread & Roses
## Guthrie, Seeger star 
### 
Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez and Country Joe McDonald are
among over 20 artists performing in the Festival of Music at
Berkeley's Greek Theatre October 7, 8 and 9. Presented by
the non-profit "Bread and Roses" organization and the
Committee of Arts and Lectures at UC-Berkeley, the festival
will provide an opportunity to hear top name acts in an
intimate setting, with each performer using only acoustic
instruments.
Acoustic music is riot the drawing card it once was.
Though headline acts such as Baez, Crosby, Stills and Nash
and Dan Fogelberg regularly include entire acoustic sets in
their concerts, most have forsaken their wooden instru
ments for the slicker- multi-instrumental style of the mid
'7os.
Opening the festival on Friday, Oct. 7, will be Guthrie,
Mimi Farina, the John Herald Band, Hoyt Axton, Mickey
Newberry, Robin Williamson and his Merry Band, and John
McEuen of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
Saturday's schedule includes Baez, Theodore Bikel, the
Boys of the Lough and a crew of famous folkies of the '60s,
Dave Van Ronk, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Tom Paxton and the
ageless Pete Seeger.
Country Joe, Maria Muldaur, Richie Havens, Terry
Garthwaite and Toni Brown, the Persuasions and Josh
White Jr. will perform on Sunday afternoon.
