# Part of trial program
## Course questionnaire tested 
### Jon Hornsby 
Students will see a new course
questionnaire this quarter, part of a
trial program of "universal course
evaluation by students."
The program, which calls for sur
veys of every course each time it is
offered, was endorsed "in principle"
last spring by an overwhelming vote
in the Faculty Senate.
A subcommittee on evaluation and
improvement of teaching (CEIT) took
the vote as a mandate to experiment
with implementing the program and
is nearly finished with an evaluation
to be tested this quarter and next,
said Robert Calfee, committee chair
person.
The committee will work jointly
with the ASSU Course Guide staff
and Registrar Sally Mahoney in dis
tributing the test questionnaire to
samplings of undergraduate and
graduate classes, Calfee said.
Availability of results to students is

still an undecided question, he said.
Results of this quarter's evaluation
will be released to instructors and
CEIT for review and statistical
analysis.
Comments and suggestions
"An important feature of the trial
questionnaire is a section asking for
comments on the questionnaire and
suggestions for its effective use in
improving the quality of teaching at
the University," said Greg Larson,
also a committee member and ASSU
co-president.
According to Larson, the tentative
questionnaire divides evaluative
criteria into four broad categories
dealing with instructor performance,
relationship with students, course
organization, and student learning
experience with more specific fac
tors mentioned under each heading.
Other questions assess the stu
dent's background, satisfaction with
the course and effort invested in it.

Calfee said that the committee will
be "doing some experimental work
to make the questionnaire more effi
cient for the University and the stu
dent."
He also said that from the point of
view of a number of the committee
members, the most important result
would be "improving teaching qual
ity."
Another committee member,
David Abernethy, associate dean of
undergraduate studies, said "our ef
fort has been to design a question
naire with enough questions to get
meaningful results but not so many
questions that the data would simply
overwhelm the interpreter."
Salary considerations
Very important, Abernethy said,
that "this material may be available to
department chairmen with respect to
considerations as yearly salaries, as
well as for tenure and promotion de
cisions."
President Richard Lyman, who
spoke before the Faculty Senate in
favor of the principle of universal
course evaluation, arguing that "it
could hardly be unuseful," said that
in the end he hoped it would be use
ful in all of these areas.
And, he pointed out, the student is
just one part of the evaluative pro
cess.
Dave Parker, ASSU Course Guide
manager, stressed that further revi
sions of the questionnaire will be
made. He said he believes "profes
sors want a more detailed and effec
tive questionnaire so they can use it
to improve their teaching capabil
ity."
Poor response
Parker said in the past the Course
Guide has targeted over 800 courses
to be covered and "only about 270
have responded." He approximated
that about 1000 courses are offered
to undergraduates. "Maybe in the fu
ture we can survey up to 600 of
them," he said.
Currently the School of
Humanities and Sciences is the only
one without mandatory evaluation
requirements, according to Larson.
The Business, Law and Medical
Schools conduct their own course
surveys, as does the School of En
gineering.
CEIT is under the Faculty Senate
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (CAAA). The sub
committee's recommendation of
universal course evaluation to the
senate came after a report from the
ASSU Task Force on Tenure and
Teaching Quality.
CEIT will report back to the senate
after its testing this year.

Another committee member,
David Abernethy, associate dean of
undergraduate studies, said "our ef
fort has been to design a question
naire with enough questions to get
meaningful results but not so many
questions that the data would simply
overwhelm the interpreter."
Salary considerations
Very important, Abernethy said,
that "this material may be available to
department chairmen with respect to
considerations as yearly salaries, as
well as for tenure and promotion de
cisions."
President Richard Lyman, who
spoke before the Faculty Senate in
favor of the principle of universal
course evaluation, arguing that "it
could hardly be unuseful," said that
in the end he hoped it would be use
ful in all of these areas.
And, he pointed out, the student is
just one part of the evaluative pro
cess.
Dave Parker, ASSU Course Guide
manager, stressed that further revi
sions of the questionnaire will be
made. He said he believes "profes
sors want a more detailed and effec
tive questionnaire so they can use it
to improve their teaching capabil
ity."
Poor response
Parker said in the past the Course
Guide has targeted over 800 courses
to be covered and "only about 270
have responded." He approximated
that about 1000 courses are offered
to undergraduates. "Maybe in the fu
ture we can survey up to 600 of
them," he said.
Currently the School of
Humanities and Sciences is the only
one without mandatory evaluation
requirements, according to Larson.
The Business, Law and Medical
Schools conduct their own course
surveys, as does the School of En
gineering.
CEIT is under the Faculty Senate
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (CAAA). The sub
committee's recommendation of
universal course evaluation to the
senate came after a report from the
ASSU Task Force on Tenure and
Teaching Quality.
CEIT will report back to the senate
after its testing this year.
Students will see a new course
questionnaire this quarter, part of a
trial program of "universal course
evaluation by students."
The program, which calls for sur
veys of every course each time it is
offered, was endorsed "in principle"
last spring by an overwhelming vote
in the Faculty Senate.
A subcommittee on evaluation and
improvement of teaching (CEIT) took
the vote as a mandate to experiment
with implementing the program and
is nearly finished with an evaluation
to be tested this quarter and next,
said Robert Calfee, committee chair
person.
The committee will work jointly
with the ASSU Course Guide staff
and Registrar Sally Mahoney in dis
tributing the test questionnaire to
samplings of undergraduate and
graduate classes, Calfee said.
Availability of results to students is

still an undecided question, he said.
Results of this quarter's evaluation
will be released to instructors and
CEIT for review and statistical
analysis.
Comments and suggestions
"An important feature of the trial
questionnaire is a section asking for
comments on the questionnaire and
suggestions for its effective use in
improving the quality of teaching at
the University," said Greg Larson,
also a committee member and ASSU
co-president.
According to Larson, the tentative
questionnaire divides evaluative
criteria into four broad categories
dealing with instructor performance,
relationship with students, course
organization, and student learning
experience with more specific fac
tors mentioned under each heading.
Other questions assess the stu
dent's background, satisfaction with
the course and effort invested in it.

Calfee said that the committee will
be "doing some experimental work
to make the questionnaire more effi
cient for the University and the stu
dent."
He also said that from the point of
view of a number of the committee
members, the most important result
would be "improving teaching qual
ity."
