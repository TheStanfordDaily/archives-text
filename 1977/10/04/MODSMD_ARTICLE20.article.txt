Court rules gays immoral
Washington — The Supreme Court, in a busy
first day yesterday of its fall term, let stand the
ruling of a state court in Washington that
homosexuals are immoral and may be fired
from their jobs.
The court refused to hear the appeal of
James Gaylord, fired in 1972 when his
homosexuality was discovered by officials at
the Tacoma high school where he had taught
for 13 years.
Gaylord contended that his constitutional
rights were violated when his status as a
homosexual was used to dismiss him. The
Washington Supreme Court ruled that
homosexuality is immoral and Gaylord could
be fired even though he was accused of no
homosexual act.
Civil liberties attorneys, who had hoped to
use the case to have the Supreme Court review
the rights of homosexuals, predictably were
outraged by the court's action.
"The case presented the Supreme Court
with an opportunity to say that discrimination
against people by government because of their
status as homosexuals is impermissible," the
American Civil Liberties Union said.
"This Supreme Court maintains its record of
gross insensitivity to individual rights," the or
ganization said in a statement from its New
York headquarters.
Indira Gandhi arrested
New Delhi — Seven months after her iron grip
on India was broken in a stunning election
defeat, Indira Gandhi was arrested yesterday
and charged with abusing her position as
prime minister. She promptly charged the ar
rest was political.
Authorities said at least 10 other persons,
including four former cabinet ministers and
Gandhi's personal secretary, also were ar
rested.
Gandhi, 59, was charged in two cases under
India's Prevention of Corruption Act, officials
reported.
They said she was accused in one case of
"illegally conniving" with others in pressuring
two companies to obtain 104 jeeps for cam
paign work in several election districts includ
ing her own.
The second charge alleged Gandhi misused
her position by awarding a $ 13.4 million gov
ernment oil drilling contract to the French firm
Consultancy Services de Petroles, despite a
lower bid by an unidentified American com
petitor.
The former prime minister, defeated in na

tional elections last spring, said in a statement
that her arrest "is to prevent me from going to
the people ... to discredit me in their eyes."
Terror ends for 19 hostages
Algiers, Algeria — A 5000-mile, six-day odys
sey of terror over Asia and North Africa ended
yesterday when five Japanese hijackers freed
their last 19 hostages from a commandeered
jetliner and surrendered to Algerian au
thorities.
Officials said the hostages, 12 passengers
and seven crew members, appeared to be in
good health and were relaxed and smiling
when they were driven away in an airport bus.
U.S. diplomatic sources said the only Ameri
can on the final leg of the flight, Thomas Phe
lan, a 29-year-old State Department employe
from San Francisco, was "well but tired, with
digestive problems resulting from irregular
meals."
Algerian authorities refused to say what
would become of the ultra-leftist Japanese Red
Army terrorists who took over the Japan Air
Lines DCS on Wednesday over India, or their
six "comrades." The comrades, including two
women, were freed from Japanese jails to meet
the hijackers' demands.
Bangladesh coup-try kills 86
Dacca, Bangladesh — At least 86 members of
the Bangladesh armed forces were killed dur
ing Sunday's abortive uprising, informed
sources said yesterday.
Among those killed were 11 "seniormost"
air force officers, ranging in rank from group
captain to flying officer, the unofficial sources
said. There was no independent confirmation
of the report.
The president and chief martial law adminis
trator, Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman, was appa
rently a target of the predawn uprising but was
never in danger during the 2Vi hours of
sporadic automatic weapons fire in three parts
of Dacca.
Another target was Air Vice Marshal A.G.
Mahmud, the government's chief negotiator
during a 4V2-day airport siege with five
Japanese Red Army terrorists holding a
hijacked Japan Air Lines jetliner at Dacca air
port.
Mahmud was in the control tower when a
shootout erupted outside the airport among
dissident soldiers within the traditionally
faction-ridden Bangladesh armed forces.
Mahmud, however, escaped injury.
Gas pricing filibuster ends
Washington — Militant Senate opponents of

deregulating natural gas ended a 13-day-long
filibuster yesterday, saying lack of support
from the White House made it impossible to
continue their delaying tactics.
Sens. James Abourezk (D-S.D.), and Howard
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), said they would allow
the Senate to vote on the natural gas pricing
legislation.
"In view of the White House position, we
will call off the filibuster effective im
mediately," Metzenbaum told reporters.
A vote on the bill could come today.
The Senate adjourned until today, when the
bill could come up for a vote.
Their surrender came after Vice President
Walter Mondale joined in a dramatic effort by
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd designed
to break the filibuster.
Policy to aid cancer prevention
Washington — The Labor Department prop
osed a comprehensive new policy yesterday
for controlling the more than 1500 known or
suspected cancer-causing chemicals now
found in the American workplace.
The proposal establishes for the first time a
systematic procedure for quickly identifying,
classifying and regulating carcinogenic sub
stances that threaten workers' health.
I n the past, cancer-causing agents have been
dealt with on a case-by-case basis — a system
which Labor Secretary Ray Marshall described
as "trying to put out a forest fire one tree at a
time."
Only 17 of the 1500 to 2000 chemicals iden
tified as known or suspected to cause cancer
have been brought under regulatory action by
the Occupational Safety and Health Administ
ration in its six-year history.
The Labor Department proposals were an
nounced as officials of the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health reported the
results of a survey that estimates nearly one
million Americans are potentially exposed to
known carcinogens at their workplace.
Average family beats inflation
Washington — The average American family
gained three per cent on inflation last year but
was still not doing as well as in 1973, the Cen
sus Bureau said yesterday.
In 1976, the median income of all U.S.
families was $14,960, an increase of nine per
cent over 1975.
However, prices during the year rose six per
cent. After inflation is considered, the average
family's income rose by about $450, or three
per cent, the bureau said.
The $14,960 income was still $480 below the

record $15,437 in real income set in 1973, just
before a long recession. This year's increase
followed declines of three per cent and four
per cent in the past two years.
The Census Bureau describes a family as any
unit of two or more related individuals. Among
unrelated individuals, the average real income
rose from $5164 to $5375.
Helsinki agreement reviewed
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — The United States
and the Soviet Union sit down with 33 other
nations today to review the 1975 Helsinki ac
cords. The two superpowers seem anxious to
avoid a clash over human rights, but Russian
dissidents are pressing the issue.
The conference was convened to check how
the signatory nations have complied with the
agreement reached in Helsinki, Finland, on
European security and cooperation.
The accords recognized post-World War II
boundaries in Europe, thus tacitly accepting
Soviet influence in the East. In exchange.
Western countries obtained provisions they
view as promises of greater civil liberties in the
East bloc.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little cooler days.
Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the
60s to lower 70s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph
in afternoons with locally stronger gusts.
