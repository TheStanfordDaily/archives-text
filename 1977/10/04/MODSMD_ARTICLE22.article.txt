October 14, a star that heralds a series of stars.
That evening the curtain rises on one of the
most exciting seasons of music, dance and
theater in the Bay Area with a concert by the
keyboard artist, Philippe Entremont.
The event launches The Lively Arts at
Stanford—l 977-78, an outstanding program of
performances by world-famous artists.
Commenting on the Lively Arts 1977-78
season, Susie Farr, assistant director of Public
Events, says, "It's a mixture of proven favorites
at Stanford and the debut here of many other
well-known performing artists."
Returning to The Farm as part of The Lively
Arts' season are Nicanor Zabaleta, the great
harpist; Music From Marlboro, a highly talented
traveling ensemble selected from the annual
musical festival of that name held in Vermont;
and the Paul Taylor Dance Company, one of
the world's most innovative and delightful
dance groups.
Chamber music favorites back for encore
performances in the 1977-78 season are the
Cuarneri String Quartet, the Cleveland Quartet,
the Beaux Arts Trio and the New York Cham
ber Soloists, the latter performing Bach's
"Brandenburg Concerti."
Enriching Stanford's already outstanding
offerings in chamber music and also appearing
here for the first time will be Aston Magna, a
group directed by Albert Fuller that plays music
of the early classical and Baroque periods with
original instruments or exact modern replicas;
the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra conducted by

The Lively Arts Series
schedule.

Dennis Russell Davies; the pre-eminent New
York Woodwind Quintet; and Quadro Hotteterre,
a Dutch group that features 17th century Italian
and English music and early 18th century
French music.
Anthony Zerbe, a distinguished actor familiar
to many for his role as Lieutenant Trench in the
television series, "Harry O," makes his Stanford'
debut with an interpretative reading of works by
e.e. cummings.
Entitled "it's all done with mirrors," the one
man dramatization will put Zerbe's many and
diverse acting skills to test.
Other big name newcomers to campus are
Carlos Barbosa-Lima, a leading classical gui
tarist; Aldo Ciccolini, known for his piano
interpretations of French composers and very
famous for his performances and recordings of
the works of Erik Satie; Dennis Wayne's
Dancers, a contemporary ballet company

appearing at Stanford as part of its first West
Coast tour; and Gary Karr and Harmon Lewis, a
dynamic duo on double bass and harpsichord.
This year The Lively Arts at Stanford though
its Young Concert Artists Series also welcomes
for the first time the maturing talents of the
Chilingirian String Quartet, pianist Boris Bloch
and violinist Sung-Ju Lee.
"The Lively Arts gives students an opportunity
to get an idea of 'Who's Who' in the arts world,"
states Farr.
"The program is a challenge and an invitation
for people to try something unfamiliar, experi
ence a different dimension of human experi
ence and perhaps change a misconception or
even discover a new joy.
"Dance for example, is the most intimidating
of the arts to the uninitiated," continues Farr,
"because it combines the audio and the visual
for a stage full of sound, movement, color and
drama."
Vicky Holt, new director of Public Events,
feels that The Lively Arts program can be an
excellent means for students to gain exposure to
talents of international artists at prices they can
afford. It also enables area residents to enjoy the
rich cultural resources of a major university.
Both the Paul Taylor and Dennis Wayne
dance troupes will give free lecture-demonstra
tions and workshops as part of their residency
at Stanford. And the Young Concert Artists will
perform mini-concerts on and off campus at
local schools and in the dorms in order to share
the living and learning experience of the arts
with more people.
The Lively Arts presentations are divided
among four series and include 26 different
events.
Buying series tickets is advantageous, says
Farr, because many of our performances will
sell out and thus you don't have to worry about
being able to get a ticket or a good seat if you
have purchased them in advance.
Because they have series tickets, she adds,
some people attend a concert they might not
normally choose and then find the new experi
ence very enjoyable.
Series and individual tickets for Lively Arts
events can be purchased now at Tresidder
Ticket Office on campus. During the season,
tickets for individual events are also sold at
BASS outlets, all Macy's, Emporium's and
major Bay Area ticket agencies. The student
price of each Lively Arts ticket is $3.

program or have some ideas to share, visit the
Office of Public Events, now in Room 3, Encina

Both the Paul Taylor and Dennis Wayne
dance troupes will give free lecture-demonstra
tions and workshops as part of their residency
at Stanford. And the Young Concert Artists will
perform mini-concerts on and off campus at
local schools and in the dorms in order to share
the living and learning experience of the arts
with more people.
The Lively Arts presentations are divided
among four series and include 26 different
events.
Buying series tickets is advantageous, says
Farr, because many of our performances will
sell out and thus you don't have to worry about
being able to get a ticket or a good seat if you
have purchased them in advance.
Because they have series tickets, she adds,
some people attend a concert they might not
normally choose and then find the new experi
ence very enjoyable.
Series and individual tickets for Lively Arts
events can be purchased now at Tresidder
Ticket Office on campus. During the season,
tickets for individual events are also sold at
BASS outlets, all Macy's, Emporium's and
major Bay Area ticket agencies. The student

theater in the Bay Area with a concert by the
keyboard artist, Philippe Entremont.
The event launches The Lively Arts at
Stanford—l 977-78, an outstanding program of
performances by world-famous artists.
Commenting on the Lively Arts 1977-78
season, Susie Farr, assistant director of Public
Events, says, "It's a mixture of proven favorites
at Stanford and the debut here of many other
well-known performing artists."
Returning to The Farm as part of The Lively
Arts' season are Nicanor Zabaleta, the great
harpist; Music From Marlboro, a highly talented
traveling ensemble selected from the annual

group directed by Albert Fuller that plays music
of the early classical and Baroque periods with
original instruments or exact modern replicas;
the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra conducted by

schedule.

York Woodwind Quintet; and Quadro Hotteterre,
a Dutch group that features 17th century Italian
and English music and early 18th century
French music.
Anthony Zerbe, a distinguished actor familiar
to many for his role as Lieutenant Trench in the
television series, "Harry O," makes his Stanford'
debut with an interpretative reading of works by
e.e. cummings.
Entitled "it's all done with mirrors," the one
man dramatization will put Zerbe's many and
diverse acting skills to test.
Other big name newcomers to campus are
Carlos Barbosa-Lima, a leading classical gui
tarist; Aldo Ciccolini, known for his piano
interpretations of French composers and very
famous for his performances and recordings of
the works of Erik Satie; Dennis Wayne's
Dancers, a contemporary ballet company

appearing at Stanford as part of its first West

dynamic duo on double bass and harpsichord.
This year The Lively Arts at Stanford though
its Young Concert Artists Series also welcomes
for the first time the maturing talents of the
Chilingirian String Quartet, pianist Boris Bloch
and violinist Sung-Ju Lee.
"The Lively Arts gives students an opportunity
to get an idea of 'Who's Who' in the arts world,"
states Farr.
"The program is a challenge and an invitation
for people to try something unfamiliar, experi
ence a different dimension of human experi
ence and perhaps change a misconception or
even discover a new joy.
"Dance for example, is the most intimidating
of the arts to the uninitiated," continues Farr,
"because it combines the audio and the visual
for a stage full of sound, movement, color and
drama."
Vicky Holt, new director of Public Events,
feels that The Lively Arts program can be an

schedule.

Dennis Russell Davies; the pre-eminent New
York Woodwind Quintet; and Quadro Hotteterre,
a Dutch group that features 17th century Italian
and English music and early 18th century
French music.
Anthony Zerbe, a distinguished actor familiar
to many for his role as Lieutenant Trench in the
television series, "Harry O," makes his Stanford'
debut with an interpretative reading of works by
e.e. cummings.
Entitled "it's all done with mirrors," the one
man dramatization will put Zerbe's many and
diverse acting skills to test.
Other big name newcomers to campus are
Carlos Barbosa-Lima, a leading classical gui
tarist; Aldo Ciccolini, known for his piano
interpretations of French composers and very
famous for his performances and recordings of
the works of Erik Satie; Dennis Wayne's
Dancers, a contemporary ballet company

appearing at Stanford as part of its first West
Coast tour; and Gary Karr and Harmon Lewis, a
dynamic duo on double bass and harpsichord.
This year The Lively Arts at Stanford though
its Young Concert Artists Series also welcomes
for the first time the maturing talents of the
Chilingirian String Quartet, pianist Boris Bloch
and violinist Sung-Ju Lee.
"The Lively Arts gives students an opportunity
to get an idea of 'Who's Who' in the arts world,"
states Farr.
"The program is a challenge and an invitation
for people to try something unfamiliar, experi
ence a different dimension of human experi
ence and perhaps change a misconception or
even discover a new joy.
"Dance for example, is the most intimidating
of the arts to the uninitiated," continues Farr,
"because it combines the audio and the visual
for a stage full of sound, movement, color and
drama."
Vicky Holt, new director of Public Events,
feels that The Lively Arts program can be an
excellent means for students to gain exposure to
talents of international artists at prices they can
afford. It also enables area residents to enjoy the
rich cultural resources of a major university.
Both the Paul Taylor and Dennis Wayne
dance troupes will give free lecture-demonstra
tions and workshops as part of their residency
at Stanford. And the Young Concert Artists will
perform mini-concerts on and off campus at
local schools and in the dorms in order to share
the living and learning experience of the arts
with more people.
The Lively Arts presentations are divided
among four series and include 26 different
events.
Buying series tickets is advantageous, says
Farr, because many of our performances will
sell out and thus you don't have to worry about
being able to get a ticket or a good seat if you
have purchased them in advance.
Because they have series tickets, she adds,
some people attend a concert they might not
normally choose and then find the new experi
ence very enjoyable.
Series and individual tickets for Lively Arts
events can be purchased now at Tresidder
Ticket Office on campus. During the season,
tickets for individual events are also sold at
BASS outlets, all Macy's, Emporium's and
major Bay Area ticket agencies. The student
price of each Lively Arts ticket is $3.
