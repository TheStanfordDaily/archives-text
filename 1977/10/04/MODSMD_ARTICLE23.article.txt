Would you like to actively support The
Lively Arts at Stanford and get even closer
to the performing artists visiting here
through a number of special activities and
ticket advantages?
The "Patrons of the Lively Arts at

Stanford" program begun this year pro
vides those opportunities!
Students can become Patrons with a $10
gift. Area residents can become Patrons
with a minimal donation of $25. Help spur
the growth of one of the mid-Peninsula's
most exciting cultural movements.
