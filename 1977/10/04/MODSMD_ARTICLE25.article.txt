# Ticket Information

U.C. Davis and Santa Gruz Box Offices.
The Ticket Office publishes a monthly event
guide listing all upcoming events for which we
sell tickets. Stop by Tresidder and pick up a
copy. If you like to order your tickets well in
advance, ask us for a mail flyer; we stock them
for most major events.
Call 497-4317 with your questions and we'll
do our best to answer them. If the correct
answers are more easily and accurately obtained
from another source, we will direct you to it,
with a phone number if we have one. Any time
that we don't carry tickets for a particular event,
we will try to refer you to an agency that does.
(The pink section of the Sunday San Francisco
Chronicle and Examiner generally has complete
listings of all Bay Area events with dates, times,
prices, and where to buy tickets. It will save you
time and unnecessary phone calls, as well as
serving as an inspiration when you're looking
for something to do.)
The Tresidder Information Center compiles a
daily entertainment tape, 497-3880, which lists
all Stanford events, including those which are
free, for the day you are calling. If you phone the
Ticket Office when we are closed, our tape will
tell you our business hours and provide up-to
the-minute information on the availability of
tickets for current Stanford events.

BUYING TICKETS
We realize that buying tickets isn't always
the simple procedure that one expects it to be.
We hope you find the following information
helpful when you make your next trip to the
Ticket Office.
Two types of seating are possible at a
performance: general admission or reserved. If
your ticket is reserved, your seat location is
determined at the time of purchase. A general
admission ticket simply admits you to the
theatre and you pick the seat you want, or the
best you can find, depending on when you
arrive. (General admission can also refer to the
full price of a ticket, as opposed to a discounted
price, for example, General Admission $2.50,
Student $1.00.)
Tickets come in three varieties: "hard,"
computerized, and voucher. Hard tickets are
printed in advance of, and specifically for, one
performance, and they are generally handled by
only one box office, although they may be
distributed to certain other agencies.
When you buy a ticket at the Tresidder Ticket
Office for a Stanford event, you will get a hard
ticket; if the event is presented by a Stanford
organization there will be no service charge.
After you purchase a hard ticket, you simply

arrive at the theatre for the performance and
walk in.
Computerized tickets are similar to hard
tickets. When you want a ticket that is sold on
Ticketron (we do not have a BASS computer
outlet) we enter your request on our Ticketron
terminal and the teleprinter responds with
ticket availability and, if seating is reserved,
with one or several seating locations.
If you choose one of these locations, the
terminal prints up your ticket on the spot. You
now have what is comparable to a hard ticket.
The service charge for Ticketron will be 50, 70,
or 80 cents per ticket, depending on the event;
Ticketron receives all but 150 of this.
When we don't have hard tickets for a
performance and it isn't on the computer, we
can still save you a trip to a distant box office by
selling you the third type of ticket, a voucher.
Tell us what price ticket and/or area of the
theatre you want for a performance and we will
call the appropriate box office while you wait
and reserve your tickets for you.
You pay for the tickets at the time the
reservation is made and receive a voucher
which you then exchange at the theatre box
office on the night of the performance for your

tickets. Your seats are guaranteed and are held
for you indefinitely. Our charge for this service
is 50# per voucher plus 10% of the total ticket
price. This may seem expensive, but it is
relatively low for a voucher; we request it
because vouchers require many more times the
labor than any other type of ticket sale.
When you order a ticket on a voucher, you
won't know where your seat is until you reach
the theatre. However, the box office will always
give you the best seats left at the time yolir
reservation is made. Box offices have nothing to
gain by not giving all their customers the very
best seats they can.
It is an unpleasant but inescapable fact of life
that if you wait to buy your tickets until the day
before a popular performance that's been on sale
for three months, then no matter where you
purchase them, they just aren't going to be tenth
row center orchestra. So avoid disappointment;
buy your tickets just as soon as you know there's
a show you want to see.
TYesidder Ticket Office is here to serve you in
whatever way we can. Our hours are Monday-
Friday, 10:00-5:30, and Saturday, noon-4:00.
Please stop byâ€”for tickets or an event guide, to
ask a question, to meet our management and
offer suggestions. And enjoy the show!
