Ikiru _
Friday, October 7
Directed by Akira Kurosawa
"Sometimes I think of my death," Kurosawa has written: "I
think of ceasing to be . . . and it is from these thoughts that
Ikiru came."
Like so many of Kurosawa's modern heroes, the protagonist
VVatanabe (Takashi Shimura) discovers that he is dying. But more
significantly, he discovers that he "has been dead a long time
without even knowing it," that around the office he is jokingly
called "the mummy," that in fact he is really loved by and loves
no one. In the few months left to him, he makes a passionate
effort to discover what it is "to really live."
In his acceptance speech for his Venice Prize winning Rashomon,
Kurosawa said, "Everyone likes to receive prizes and so I'm
happy . . . but I'd be even happier if I were getting it for having
shown something of contemporary Japan." Ikiru was Kurasawa's
next film.

Hara Kiri
Friday, October 14
Directed by Masaki Kobayashi
Tatsuya Nakadai plays an aging ronin in the early Tokagawa
period, planning a revenge suicide to protest the deaths of his
son-in-law, daughter and grandchild. The action takes place in
two hours, exactly the length of the film. Kobayashi uses
flashbacks, both to unveil the mystery of the past and to
create suspense by delaying resolution. For much of the film,
Kobayashi's camera is as formal and restrained as his
characters are, emphasizing the excessive formality of japanese
manners, and the way custom tyrannizes feeling. Then when
repression bursts into inevitable violence, Kobayashi under
scores the madness with dizzying camera angles and editing.
Ugetsu
Friday, November 4
Directed by Kenji MUoguchi
Ugetsu, a prize winner at the Venice Film Festival, presents a
16th century ghostly legend of two peasant neighbors. The
two men Itave their families, one to become wealthy in the
city, the other to fulfill his ambition to become a samurai
warrior. The genius of this film rests on the superb
photography which transforms the acting, the story and the
background into a flow of insistently haunting images. At the
end it is difficult to remember where reality stops and illusion
begins.

The Island
Friday, October 21
Directed and written by Kaneto Shindo
The Island has been an international classic ever since its
release. It uses a poetic and eloquent camera to document a
way of life interwoven with nature. The story concerns a
farming family (parents and their two small sons), attempting
to survive on arid, forbidding land. Their struggle with the soil
and the seasons unfolds in a simple plot that moves as
naturally and unevenly as life itself. There is no dialogue —
sounds and music express the elemental struggle in nonverbal
terms.
Woman in the Dunes
Friday, November 11
Directed by Hiroshi Teshigjhjrj
Man, woman, sand and sun ... these are the basic elements of
this fine adaptation of Kobo Abe's best selling Kafkaesque
novel. A man and a woman held captive in a sand pit provide
the perfect visual metaphor for director Hiroshi Teshigahara's
examination of the fundamentals of existance, rebellion,
adaptation and freedom. Outstanding photography and sound
create a self contained world of particularities. The almost
visceral experience of sand on flesh becomes an entire
universe.

An Autumn Afternoon
Friday, October 28
Directed by Yasujiro Oiu
An Autumn Afternoon is about the transient joys of family
life and the loneliness of parents after children leave home.
The film is less a story than an examination of a particular
period in a person's life. It is Ozu's fifty-third and final film.
The last panel in that great fresco with which he has so
completely captured Japan as it is. The simplicity of the
picture is the result of a style brought to perfection. Nothing is
wanting, nothing is extraneous. At the same time Ozu's regard
was never kinder, never wiser. There is a mellowness about this
picture which is stronger than nostalgia.
Double Suicide
Friday, November 18
Directed by Masahiro Shinoda
Internationally acclaimed, Double Suicide is based on a classic
Bunraku drama by the 18th Century playwright, Chikamatsu.
The Bunraku, or Puppet Drama, uses frank artifice to achieve
emotional effect, and Shinoda attempts to apply cinematic
equivalent of this technique in adapting Chikamatsu to the
screen. At times the characters are manipulated as if they were
puppets by figures dressed in black - just as stage crews of
Kabuki and Bunraku are. It is a story of an Osaka paper shop
merchant who falls so in love with a courtesan that he neglects
his business, his children and his wife. The courtesan, in turn,
is so in love with him that she rejects other customers.

Hara Kiri
Friday, October 14
Directed by Masaki Kobayashi
Tatsuya Nakadai plays an aging ronin in the early Tokagawa
period, planning a revenge suicide to protest the deaths of his
son-in-law, daughter and grandchild. The action takes place in
two hours, exactly the length of the film. Kobayashi uses
flashbacks, both to unveil the mystery of the past and to
create suspense by delaying resolution. For much of the film,
Kobayashi's camera is as formal and restrained as his
characters are, emphasizing the excessive formality of japanese
manners, and the way custom tyrannizes feeling. Then when
repression bursts into inevitable violence, Kobayashi under
scores the madness with dizzying camera angles and editing.
Ugetsu
Friday, November 4
Directed by Kenji MUoguchi
Ugetsu, a prize winner at the Venice Film Festival, presents a
16th century ghostly legend of two peasant neighbors. The
two men Itave their families, one to become wealthy in the
city, the other to fulfill his ambition to become a samurai
warrior. The genius of this film rests on the superb
photography which transforms the acting, the story and the
background into a flow of insistently haunting images. At the
end it is difficult to remember where reality stops and illusion
begins.

The Island
Friday, October 21
Directed and written by Kaneto Shindo
The Island has been an international classic ever since its
release. It uses a poetic and eloquent camera to document a
way of life interwoven with nature. The story concerns a
farming family (parents and their two small sons), attempting
to survive on arid, forbidding land. Their struggle with the soil
and the seasons unfolds in a simple plot that moves as
naturally and unevenly as life itself. There is no dialogue —
sounds and music express the elemental struggle in nonverbal
terms.
Woman in the Dunes
Friday, November 11
Directed by Hiroshi Teshigjhjrj
Man, woman, sand and sun ... these are the basic elements of
this fine adaptation of Kobo Abe's best selling Kafkaesque
novel. A man and a woman held captive in a sand pit provide
the perfect visual metaphor for director Hiroshi Teshigahara's
examination of the fundamentals of existance, rebellion,
adaptation and freedom. Outstanding photography and sound
create a self contained world of particularities. The almost
visceral experience of sand on flesh becomes an entire
universe.

An Autumn Afternoon
Friday, October 28
Directed by Yasujiro Oiu
An Autumn Afternoon is about the transient joys of family
life and the loneliness of parents after children leave home.
The film is less a story than an examination of a particular
period in a person's life. It is Ozu's fifty-third and final film.
The last panel in that great fresco with which he has so
completely captured Japan as it is. The simplicity of the
picture is the result of a style brought to perfection. Nothing is
wanting, nothing is extraneous. At the same time Ozu's regard
was never kinder, never wiser. There is a mellowness about this
picture which is stronger than nostalgia.
Double Suicide
Friday, November 18
Directed by Masahiro Shinoda
Internationally acclaimed, Double Suicide is based on a classic
Bunraku drama by the 18th Century playwright, Chikamatsu.
The Bunraku, or Puppet Drama, uses frank artifice to achieve
emotional effect, and Shinoda attempts to apply cinematic
equivalent of this technique in adapting Chikamatsu to the
screen. At times the characters are manipulated as if they were
puppets by figures dressed in black - just as stage crews of
Kabuki and Bunraku are. It is a story of an Osaka paper shop
merchant who falls so in love with a courtesan that he neglects
his business, his children and his wife. The courtesan, in turn,
is so in love with him that she rejects other customers.

Ikiru _
Friday, October 7
Directed by Akira Kurosawa
"Sometimes I think of my death," Kurosawa has written: "I
think of ceasing to be . . . and it is from these thoughts that
Ikiru came."
Like so many of Kurosawa's modern heroes, the protagonist
VVatanabe (Takashi Shimura) discovers that he is dying. But more
significantly, he discovers that he "has been dead a long time
without even knowing it," that around the office he is jokingly
called "the mummy," that in fact he is really loved by and loves
no one. In the few months left to him, he makes a passionate
effort to discover what it is "to really live."
In his acceptance speech for his Venice Prize winning Rashomon,
Kurosawa said, "Everyone likes to receive prizes and so I'm
happy . . . but I'd be even happier if I were getting it for having
shown something of contemporary Japan." Ikiru was Kurasawa's
next film.

two men Itave their families, one to become wealthy in the
city, the other to fulfill his ambition to become a samurai
warrior. The genius of this film rests on the superb
photography which transforms the acting, the story and the
background into a flow of insistently haunting images. At the
end it is difficult to remember where reality stops and illusion
begins.

The Island
Friday, October 21
Directed and written by Kaneto Shindo
The Island has been an international classic ever since its
release. It uses a poetic and eloquent camera to document a
way of life interwoven with nature. The story concerns a
farming family (parents and their two small sons), attempting
to survive on arid, forbidding land. Their struggle with the soil
and the seasons unfolds in a simple plot that moves as
naturally and unevenly as life itself. There is no dialogue —
sounds and music express the elemental struggle in nonverbal
terms.
Woman in the Dunes
Friday, November 11
Directed by Hiroshi Teshigjhjrj
Man, woman, sand and sun ... these are the basic elements of
this fine adaptation of Kobo Abe's best selling Kafkaesque
novel. A man and a woman held captive in a sand pit provide
the perfect visual metaphor for director Hiroshi Teshigahara's
examination of the fundamentals of existance, rebellion,
adaptation and freedom. Outstanding photography and sound
create a self contained world of particularities. The almost
visceral experience of sand on flesh becomes an entire
universe.

An Autumn Afternoon
Friday, October 28
Directed by Yasujiro Oiu
An Autumn Afternoon is about the transient joys of family
life and the loneliness of parents after children leave home.
The film is less a story than an examination of a particular
period in a person's life. It is Ozu's fifty-third and final film.
The last panel in that great fresco with which he has so
completely captured Japan as it is. The simplicity of the
picture is the result of a style brought to perfection. Nothing is
wanting, nothing is extraneous. At the same time Ozu's regard
was never kinder, never wiser. There is a mellowness about this
picture which is stronger than nostalgia.
Double Suicide
Friday, November 18
Directed by Masahiro Shinoda
Internationally acclaimed, Double Suicide is based on a classic
Bunraku drama by the 18th Century playwright, Chikamatsu.
The Bunraku, or Puppet Drama, uses frank artifice to achieve
emotional effect, and Shinoda attempts to apply cinematic
equivalent of this technique in adapting Chikamatsu to the
screen. At times the characters are manipulated as if they were
puppets by figures dressed in black - just as stage crews of
Kabuki and Bunraku are. It is a story of an Osaka paper shop
merchant who falls so in love with a courtesan that he neglects
his business, his children and his wife. The courtesan, in turn,
is so in love with him that she rejects other customers.

Ikiru _
Friday, October 7
Directed by Akira Kurosawa
"Sometimes I think of my death," Kurosawa has written: "I
think of ceasing to be . . . and it is from these thoughts that
Ikiru came."
Like so many of Kurosawa's modern heroes, the protagonist
VVatanabe (Takashi Shimura) discovers that he is dying. But more
significantly, he discovers that he "has been dead a long time
without even knowing it," that around the office he is jokingly
called "the mummy," that in fact he is really loved by and loves
no one. In the few months left to him, he makes a passionate
effort to discover what it is "to really live."
In his acceptance speech for his Venice Prize winning Rashomon,
Kurosawa said, "Everyone likes to receive prizes and so I'm
happy . . . but I'd be even happier if I were getting it for having
shown something of contemporary Japan." Ikiru was Kurasawa's
next film.

Hara Kiri
Friday, October 14
Directed by Masaki Kobayashi
Tatsuya Nakadai plays an aging ronin in the early Tokagawa
period, planning a revenge suicide to protest the deaths of his
son-in-law, daughter and grandchild. The action takes place in
two hours, exactly the length of the film. Kobayashi uses
flashbacks, both to unveil the mystery of the past and to
create suspense by delaying resolution. For much of the film,
Kobayashi's camera is as formal and restrained as his
characters are, emphasizing the excessive formality of japanese
manners, and the way custom tyrannizes feeling. Then when
repression bursts into inevitable violence, Kobayashi under
scores the madness with dizzying camera angles and editing.
