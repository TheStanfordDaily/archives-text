### Ali Webb 
A lack of graduate candidates for
the ASSU Senate has prompted ASSU
Co-presidents Steve Westly and
Creg Larson to announce that the
deadline for graduate student peti
tions has been extended until tomor
row at 4 p.m.
"Only nine graduate students had
filed petitions by the 4 p.m. deadline
yesterday," said ASSU Elections
Commissioner Sean Murphy.

According to the ASSU Constitu
tion, 20 positions are to be filled in
the senate election: 10 senators and
10 alternates. Approximately 30
graduates filed in lastyear's election,
said Murphy.
Some 43 petitions were filed for
the 10 undergraduate seats and 10
alternate positions, said Murphy.
This represents a decrease from the
approximately 80 undergraduates
who filed last fall, he said.

"Several slates are running but an
exact count is not available at this
point," he said.
The second part of the 25-
signature petition gave all candidates
an opportunity to answer three ques
tions for a new ASSU Elections Pam
phlet. The questions probe each
candidate's conception of the senate
and also his or her ideas about the
major issues that the coming term
will bring.
"We hope that the pamphlet will
serve both the students and the can
didates. It will enable the student to
compare the candidates answers to
the same questions and also it asks
that the candidate think in specifics
about the senate," explained Westly.
"The pamphlet as a whole is a good
idea but the questions were a little
vague," commented one Under
graduate candidate.
Publication of the pamphlet is in
fulfillment of a campaign promise
made last year by the present COP,
said Westly. "The pamphlet is
funded through the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs with the idea
that the senate will reimburse costs,"
said Murphy.
The pamphlet will be distributed
over the weekend and on Monday in
the same manner as the ASSU
Course Guide, explained Westly.
