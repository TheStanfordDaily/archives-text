# Final pleas entered by sit-in defendants

Most of the remaining defendants
arrested during a May 9 sit-in at Old
Union protesting University invest
ment policy pleaded "no contest" in
municipal court yesterday.
Speaking for a large group of the
defendants, Connie Replogle said in
entering her plea, "We are at this
time simply rejecting the court's
gross inability to provide a thorough,
impartial framework for dealing with
the issues we raised."
Nearly 100 defendants who origi
nally requested jury trials were
brought up for consideration before
Judge Elva Aguilar during yesterday's
three hour proceedings.
About 30 of the defendants ap
peared personally in court yesterday
while the remaining pleas were en
tered using signed waivers by the
numerous defense attorneys.
Except for those defendants not
contacted or represented by one of
the attorneys, all defendants were
sentenced to six months probation
and either a $65 fine or 50 hours of
volunteer work. Those with cases
still outstandingwere rescheduled to
appear before the Municipal Court
on Oct. 20.

Judge Aguilar accepted all pleas
before allowing seven defendants to
make statements before the court.
Replogle's group statement was
prepared at last week's defendants'
meeting where the group decided to
enter the "no contest" pleas and ag
reed that further jury trials would not
be beneficial, given the high proba
bility of conviction.
She told the judge, "The struggle
for justice here and in South Africa
will continue, but it is apparent that
we c&nnot depend on the courts to
secure it for us."
During two previous trials this
summer, 11 of 15 defendants were
found guilty, and received the same
sentence handed down yesterday. A
hung jury occurred in the trial of the
other four defendants.
Aguilar is the second of two judges
to handle the sit-in cases. The jury
trials this summer were held in the
courtroom of Judge Edward Scoyen.
The inability of those who went to
trial this summer to tell the court
their reasons for sitting in was cited
as the main reason for not going to
trial again by those making state
ments yesterday.
Chris Coleman, one of the or
ganizers of the Old Union sit-in and
the first of the 294 to be arrested, said
"we saw that the most important tes
timony, the most fundamental evi
dence, and the most relevant insight
into the root causes of the distur
bances at Stanford last spring were
not going to be allowed into discus
sion (at a trial)."
He also told Aguilar, "You have
only increased the determination of
the 294 to end Stanford's complicity
in apartheid, secured more tightly
our commitment to create a truly
democratic university at Stanford
and decreased our respect and our
allegiance to the courts and the au
thorities which you represent."
Todd Tieger, a graduate student in
psychology, accused the court of
doing "the dirty work of Stanford
University," and said the struggle
will continue at many levels.
Speaking for David Hawes and
herself, Leah Mertes said, "My arrest
and conviction record are an insig
nificant price to pay in relation to the
much bigger contribution I can make
in encouraging everyone to make the
strong stand that the time has come
for the abolition of apartheid, to
enact a more responsible university
investment policy and to work to
gether to make a better world."
Drew Weschler, a graduate stu
dent in economics said, "This (the
trial) is the final pay off for us in en
gaging in this struggle. This struggle
has not started and not finished. It
will go on, and I am not ashamed."


Remaining defendants arrested in the Old Union sit-in last spring entered pleas of
"no contest" yesterday at the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
