# University working to remove barriers

### Jack Vaughn 
The University is preparing to de
cide which buildings must be mod
ified to provide access for handicap
ped students, according to Assoc.
Director of Planning Gene Kershner.
The action is in response to
recently-adopted U.S. Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) regulations which require in
stitutions of higher education to
eliminate barriers, both structural
and nonstructural, to handicapped
students.
The regulations require that the
University submit a plan for eliminat
ing barriers to HEW by December
and that the project be completed by
)une 1980.
"We've canvassed a number of
leading institutions across the coun
try" to see what the response to the
rules has been and "we have de
veloped our own survey sheets
which indicate all the important
criteria — the presence of steps, the
difficulty of opening doors, the ac
cessibility of elevators and their con
trols, etc. — to determine the degree
of accessibility of each building on
campus," Kershner said.
After the survey is completed in
the next few weeks, "we will sit down
and assign priorities," listing "which
buildings are most in need of struc
tural changes," Kershner said.
Only at that point, he said, will
administrators in the University's
planning and provost's offices meet
with financial officers to determine
the cost of needed changes.
Administrators working on the
problem are counting on a liberal in
terpretation of the HEW regulations
which would mandate that programs,
rather than all University buildings,
be made accessible to handicapped

students.
Under this interpretation a combi
nation of structural changes for large
assembly areas and rescheduling of
classes with handicapped students
would be possible.
"The regulations are quite clear
that it is programs rather than build
ings which must be accessible," Ker
shner said. "HEW is going to have to
work with us on a reasonable basis.
"If that is not the case, schools will
be closing down all over the coun
try," he said.
Assoc. Provost L. Wayne Price ag
reed with Kershner's interpretation.
"What's legally required is not as
demanding as some people might
think," he said. "What the law says is
that a student needs to have the same
choice of programs whether he or
she is handicapped or not, rather
than that every building on campus
be made completely accessible."
University buildings completed
since 1970 have access "at grade" ac
cording to Kershner. In addition,
"we've been making curb cuts and
ramps for both bicycles and wheel
chairs for 10 years," said Master
Planner Oscar Nelson.
However, the Quad, which has no
elevators in its older sections, and
buildings such as Memorial Au
ditorium lack access for handicap
ped students.
Nelson said University committees
began working on the problem sev
eral years ago, well in advance of the
regulations. He said that when hand
icapped students have wanted to
take courses in inaccessible build
ings, either the class has been re
scheduled in an accessible building
or the Department of Plant Services
has constructed temporary access
ramps.
"We've just never really gone
bureaucratic on it — that's the difler
ence," Nelson said.
Kershner said the only outside
money available for the structural
changes administrators may decide
are necessary is a $45,000 grant from
the Department of Housing and
Urban Development's (HUD) Com
munity Block Funds. The local HUD
office has approved the grant, but
the University is awaiting a check
from Washington before allocating
the money.
A committee of administrators, fa
culty members and students has
been working since January on
nonstructural administrative efforts
such as providing Braille readers, at
tendants for paraplegic students and
student readers for blind students,
said Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Harold Boyd. "We are in the process
of negotiating with Alpha Phi
Omega, the service fraternity, to
provide attendants," he said. "We
are also talking to the Financial Aids
Office to come up with students who
need to do work/study who might be
willing to be readers or attendants."
Boyd said that while he has been
working on the problem for four
years, "it wasn't until recently that
we were able to get a lot of University
administrators involved in making
changes that are amenable to the
needs of handicapped students."

buildings are most in need of struc
tural changes," Kershner said.
Only at that point, he said, will
administrators in the University's
planning and provost's offices meet
with financial officers to determine
the cost of needed changes.
Administrators working on the
problem are counting on a liberal in
terpretation of the HEW regulations
which would mandate that programs,
rather than all University buildings,
be made accessible to handicapped

students.
Under this interpretation a combi
nation of structural changes for large
assembly areas and rescheduling of
classes with handicapped students
would be possible.
"The regulations are quite clear
that it is programs rather than build
ings which must be accessible," Ker
shner said. "HEW is going to have to
work with us on a reasonable basis.
"If that is not the case, schools will
be closing down all over the coun
try," he said.
Assoc. Provost L. Wayne Price ag
reed with Kershner's interpretation.
"What's legally required is not as
demanding as some people might
think," he said. "What the law says is
that a student needs to have the same
choice of programs whether he or
she is handicapped or not, rather
than that every building on campus
be made completely accessible."
University buildings completed
since 1970 have access "at grade" ac
cording to Kershner. In addition,
"we've been making curb cuts and
ramps for both bicycles and wheel
chairs for 10 years," said Master
Planner Oscar Nelson.
However, the Quad, which has no
elevators in its older sections, and
buildings such as Memorial Au
ditorium lack access for handicap
ped students.
Nelson said University committees
began working on the problem sev
eral years ago, well in advance of the
regulations. He said that when hand
icapped students have wanted to
take courses in inaccessible build
ings, either the class has been re
scheduled in an accessible building
or the Department of Plant Services
has constructed temporary access
ramps.
"We've just never really gone
bureaucratic on it — that's the difler
ence," Nelson said.
Kershner said the only outside
money available for the structural
changes administrators may decide
are necessary is a $45,000 grant from
the Department of Housing and
Urban Development's (HUD) Com
munity Block Funds. The local HUD
office has approved the grant, but
the University is awaiting a check
from Washington before allocating
the money.
A committee of administrators, fa
culty members and students has
been working since January on
nonstructural administrative efforts
such as providing Braille readers, at
tendants for paraplegic students and
student readers for blind students,
said Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Harold Boyd. "We are in the process
of negotiating with Alpha Phi
Omega, the service fraternity, to
provide attendants," he said. "We
are also talking to the Financial Aids
Office to come up with students who
need to do work/study who might be
willing to be readers or attendants."
Boyd said that while he has been
working on the problem for four
years, "it wasn't until recently that
we were able to get a lot of University
administrators involved in making
changes that are amenable to the
needs of handicapped students."
The University is preparing to de
cide which buildings must be mod
ified to provide access for handicap
ped students, according to Assoc.
Director of Planning Gene Kershner.
The action is in response to
recently-adopted U.S. Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) regulations which require in
stitutions of higher education to
eliminate barriers, both structural
and nonstructural, to handicapped
students.
The regulations require that the
University submit a plan for eliminat
ing barriers to HEW by December
and that the project be completed by
)une 1980.
"We've canvassed a number of
leading institutions across the coun
try" to see what the response to the
rules has been and "we have de
veloped our own survey sheets
which indicate all the important
criteria — the presence of steps, the
difficulty of opening doors, the ac
cessibility of elevators and their con
trols, etc. — to determine the degree
of accessibility of each building on
campus," Kershner said.
After the survey is completed in
the next few weeks, "we will sit down
and assign priorities," listing "which
buildings are most in need of struc
tural changes," Kershner said.
