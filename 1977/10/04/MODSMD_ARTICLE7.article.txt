# Equal chance for all
## Bakke decision valid 
### 
Richard Fearon

Bakke v. University of California
has been going on so long that it's
beginning to approach the dimen
sions of an American saga.
It seems that this saga will finally be
resolved, though, when the U.S.
Supreme Court adjudicates the case
sometime in October.
The central issue in Bakke, as most
people are aware, is should the state
of California (as operator of the Uni
versity of California at Davis) be al
lowed to impose admissions quota
based on race? Assuming that gov
ernment has legitimate (moral) au
thority to operate educational in
stitutions — an assumption that I
deny, but which I'll accept for the
sake of discussion — one then must
define what the government's role
should be in these matters.
The California Supreme Court
overturned the lower court's deci
sion in the Bakke case on the basis of
the Fourteenth Amendment, which
insures that states provide their citi
zens equal protection. The court ar
gued that Davis' quotas (16 out of a
medical school class of 100 were re
served for "minority" students) dep
rived those better qualified applic
ants denied admission of their right
to an education.
That is, the Court argued that each
student should have an equal chance
to receive a state-subsidized educa
tion and that to reserve positions for
anyone (whether he be white, black,
or maroon) is, a fortiori, discriminat
ory.
It has been argued that an applic
ant to medical school need display
only so much potential to be recog
nized as probably a good doctor —
that above a certain "cutoff point" a
candidate's qualifications are not so
important.
These same proponents argue that
race should bean important criterion
in selecting candidates once a candi
date has surpassed the necessary
level of potential. Even if one grants
that this latter argument has validity,
it's not clear at what level this
"necessary potential" should be set.
Many fail bar
According to John H. Bunzel, pres
ident of San jose State University,
writing in Commentary, up to 60 per
cent of chicano and black law school
graduates admitted under the au
spices of special programs have
failed to pass the bar exam on their
first attempts — a figure far higher
than that for candidates admitted
under regular admissions. The
number of specially-admitted minor
ity students who fail the bar on their

second and third tries is also much
higher than the rate for whites.
And among the minorities who fail
to pass the bar are graduates of some
of the top law schools in America.
Assuming that the bar exam
gauges skills necessary to be a compe
tent lawyer, it appears that many
specially-admitted students fail to
acquire these skills. Thus, one can
argue that choosing students with
the best records insures that law and
medical graduates will have
adequate preparation.
Further reason
A further reason given by many for
supporting selection of the top can
didates — a reason subscribed to by
most liberals — is that top candidates
generally become top doctors,
thereby maximizing "society's" wel
fare.
On either of these above bases,
one can argue that the best candi
dates should be admitted over less
well-qualified applicants.
It has also been argued that MCATs
and other "objective" indices of po
tential are not so objective as they
seem.
But even if one admits that these
tests are biased, it remains to be
shown that poor whites are more un
fairly represented than poor blacks;
viz. in order to support admitting
minorities with significantly lower
qualifications, it must be shown that
these tests are culturally biased and
not economically biased.
Admit best students
Therefore, it seems that minorities
should be judged by the same stan
dards as everyone else, and that the
best students (those exhibiting the
most potential) should be admitted.
Arguments for redressing past
"discrimination" against blacks and
others are not relevant for a variety of
reasons, primary among which is that
it is unjust to penalize one for actions
he has no part in. (Thus, even if one
doesn't buy the argument that there
is not a level of potential above which
all students will probably be compe
tent doctors, it has not been shown
that race should be a factor in select
ing those exhibiting necessary po
tential.)
Application of a general standard
of fairness to private industry is quite
another matter, though. I disagree
that government has the right to dic
tate to the private sector that it must
not discriminate.
No explanations necessary
Allowing government to dictate on
such matters deprives one of his

most basic right: his right to freedom
of action. One should be able to hire
or fire, serve or refuse to serve any
one, with no explanations necessary.
If a store owner feels that his cus
tomers do not want to deal with a
black (or white, red, yellow, etc.)
waiter, he should have the right to
refuse to hire a black waiter.
Affirmative action in the private
sector, by its very nature, is an im
moral intercession of government
into private affairs. Thus, private uni
versities should be able to conduct
any type of discrimination they so
desire.
Aside from the philosophical case
against affirmative action programs,
these programs tend to be self
defeating. Writes Thomas Sowell, a
black economist: "What good is
going to come from lower standards
that will make 'black' equivalent to
'substandard' in the eyes of black
and white students alike? Can you
imagine that this is going to reduce
racism? (The Balancing Act, George
Roche III.)
The Bakke decision deserves to
stand, and other state universities
with similar programs should be
forced to conduct admission on a
non-discriminatory basis. Further
more, affirmative action programs
directed at private industry should
not be allowed to continue their in
vidious intrusion into the affairs of
private citizens.

According to John H. Bunzel, pres
ident of San jose State University,
writing in Commentary, up to 60 per
cent of chicano and black law school
graduates admitted under the au
spices of special programs have
failed to pass the bar exam on their
first attempts — a figure far higher
than that for candidates admitted
under regular admissions. The
number of specially-admitted minor
ity students who fail the bar on their

second and third tries is also much
higher than the rate for whites.
And among the minorities who fail
to pass the bar are graduates of some
of the top law schools in America.
Assuming that the bar exam
gauges skills necessary to be a compe
tent lawyer, it appears that many
specially-admitted students fail to
acquire these skills. Thus, one can
argue that choosing students with
the best records insures that law and
medical graduates will have
adequate preparation.
Further reason
A further reason given by many for
supporting selection of the top can
didates — a reason subscribed to by
most liberals — is that top candidates
generally become top doctors,
thereby maximizing "society's" wel
fare.
On either of these above bases,
one can argue that the best candi
dates should be admitted over less
well-qualified applicants.
It has also been argued that MCATs
and other "objective" indices of po
tential are not so objective as they
seem.
But even if one admits that these
tests are biased, it remains to be
shown that poor whites are more un
fairly represented than poor blacks;
viz. in order to support admitting
minorities with significantly lower
qualifications, it must be shown that
these tests are culturally biased and
not economically biased.
Admit best students
Therefore, it seems that minorities
should be judged by the same stan
dards as everyone else, and that the
best students (those exhibiting the
most potential) should be admitted.
Arguments for redressing past
"discrimination" against blacks and
others are not relevant for a variety of
reasons, primary among which is that
it is unjust to penalize one for actions
he has no part in. (Thus, even if one
doesn't buy the argument that there
is not a level of potential above which
all students will probably be compe
tent doctors, it has not been shown
that race should be a factor in select
ing those exhibiting necessary po
tential.)
Application of a general standard
of fairness to private industry is quite
another matter, though. I disagree
that government has the right to dic
tate to the private sector that it must
not discriminate.
No explanations necessary
Allowing government to dictate on
such matters deprives one of his

most basic right: his right to freedom
of action. One should be able to hire
or fire, serve or refuse to serve any
one, with no explanations necessary.
If a store owner feels that his cus
tomers do not want to deal with a
black (or white, red, yellow, etc.)
waiter, he should have the right to
refuse to hire a black waiter.
Affirmative action in the private
sector, by its very nature, is an im
moral intercession of government
into private affairs. Thus, private uni
versities should be able to conduct
any type of discrimination they so
desire.
Aside from the philosophical case
against affirmative action programs,
these programs tend to be self
defeating. Writes Thomas Sowell, a
black economist: "What good is
going to come from lower standards
that will make 'black' equivalent to
'substandard' in the eyes of black
and white students alike? Can you
imagine that this is going to reduce
racism? (The Balancing Act, George
Roche III.)
The Bakke decision deserves to
stand, and other state universities
with similar programs should be
forced to conduct admission on a
non-discriminatory basis. Further
more, affirmative action programs
directed at private industry should
not be allowed to continue their in
vidious intrusion into the affairs of
private citizens.

Bakke v. University of California
has been going on so long that it's
beginning to approach the dimen
sions of an American saga.
It seems that this saga will finally be
resolved, though, when the U.S.
Supreme Court adjudicates the case
sometime in October.
The central issue in Bakke, as most
people are aware, is should the state
of California (as operator of the Uni
versity of California at Davis) be al
lowed to impose admissions quota
based on race? Assuming that gov
ernment has legitimate (moral) au
thority to operate educational in
stitutions — an assumption that I
deny, but which I'll accept for the
sake of discussion — one then must
define what the government's role
should be in these matters.
The California Supreme Court
overturned the lower court's deci
sion in the Bakke case on the basis of
the Fourteenth Amendment, which
insures that states provide their citi
zens equal protection. The court ar
gued that Davis' quotas (16 out of a
medical school class of 100 were re
served for "minority" students) dep
rived those better qualified applic
ants denied admission of their right
to an education.
That is, the Court argued that each
student should have an equal chance
to receive a state-subsidized educa
tion and that to reserve positions for
anyone (whether he be white, black,
or maroon) is, a fortiori, discriminat
ory.
It has been argued that an applic
ant to medical school need display
only so much potential to be recog
nized as probably a good doctor —
that above a certain "cutoff point" a
candidate's qualifications are not so
important.
These same proponents argue that
race should bean important criterion
in selecting candidates once a candi
date has surpassed the necessary
level of potential. Even if one grants
that this latter argument has validity,
it's not clear at what level this
"necessary potential" should be set.

he has no part in. (Thus, even if one
doesn't buy the argument that there
is not a level of potential above which
all students will probably be compe
tent doctors, it has not been shown
that race should be a factor in select
ing those exhibiting necessary po
tential.)
Application of a general standard
of fairness to private industry is quite
another matter, though. I disagree
that government has the right to dic
tate to the private sector that it must
not discriminate.
No explanations necessary
Allowing government to dictate on
such matters deprives one of his

most basic right: his right to freedom
of action. One should be able to hire
or fire, serve or refuse to serve any
one, with no explanations necessary.
If a store owner feels that his cus
tomers do not want to deal with a
black (or white, red, yellow, etc.)
waiter, he should have the right to
refuse to hire a black waiter.
Affirmative action in the private
sector, by its very nature, is an im
moral intercession of government
into private affairs. Thus, private uni
versities should be able to conduct
any type of discrimination they so
desire.
Aside from the philosophical case
against affirmative action programs,
these programs tend to be self
defeating. Writes Thomas Sowell, a
black economist: "What good is
going to come from lower standards
that will make 'black' equivalent to
'substandard' in the eyes of black
and white students alike? Can you
imagine that this is going to reduce
racism? (The Balancing Act, George
Roche III.)
The Bakke decision deserves to
stand, and other state universities
with similar programs should be
forced to conduct admission on a
non-discriminatory basis. Further
more, affirmative action programs
directed at private industry should
not be allowed to continue their in
vidious intrusion into the affairs of
private citizens.

Bakke v. University of California
has been going on so long that it's
beginning to approach the dimen
sions of an American saga.
It seems that this saga will finally be
resolved, though, when the U.S.
Supreme Court adjudicates the case
sometime in October.
The central issue in Bakke, as most
people are aware, is should the state
of California (as operator of the Uni
versity of California at Davis) be al
lowed to impose admissions quota
based on race? Assuming that gov
ernment has legitimate (moral) au
thority to operate educational in
stitutions — an assumption that I
deny, but which I'll accept for the
sake of discussion — one then must
define what the government's role
should be in these matters.
The California Supreme Court
overturned the lower court's deci
sion in the Bakke case on the basis of
the Fourteenth Amendment, which
insures that states provide their citi
zens equal protection. The court ar
gued that Davis' quotas (16 out of a
medical school class of 100 were re
served for "minority" students) dep
rived those better qualified applic
ants denied admission of their right
to an education.
That is, the Court argued that each
student should have an equal chance
to receive a state-subsidized educa
tion and that to reserve positions for
anyone (whether he be white, black,
or maroon) is, a fortiori, discriminat
ory.
It has been argued that an applic
ant to medical school need display
only so much potential to be recog
nized as probably a good doctor —
that above a certain "cutoff point" a
candidate's qualifications are not so
important.
These same proponents argue that
race should bean important criterion
in selecting candidates once a candi
date has surpassed the necessary
level of potential. Even if one grants
that this latter argument has validity,
it's not clear at what level this
"necessary potential" should be set.
Many fail bar
According to John H. Bunzel, pres
ident of San jose State University,
writing in Commentary, up to 60 per
cent of chicano and black law school
graduates admitted under the au
spices of special programs have
failed to pass the bar exam on their
first attempts — a figure far higher
than that for candidates admitted
under regular admissions. The
number of specially-admitted minor
ity students who fail the bar on their

second and third tries is also much
higher than the rate for whites.
And among the minorities who fail
to pass the bar are graduates of some
of the top law schools in America.
Assuming that the bar exam
gauges skills necessary to be a compe
tent lawyer, it appears that many
specially-admitted students fail to
acquire these skills. Thus, one can
argue that choosing students with
the best records insures that law and
medical graduates will have
adequate preparation.
Further reason
A further reason given by many for
supporting selection of the top can
didates — a reason subscribed to by
most liberals — is that top candidates
generally become top doctors,
thereby maximizing "society's" wel
fare.
On either of these above bases,
one can argue that the best candi
dates should be admitted over less
well-qualified applicants.
It has also been argued that MCATs
and other "objective" indices of po
tential are not so objective as they
seem.
But even if one admits that these
tests are biased, it remains to be
shown that poor whites are more un
fairly represented than poor blacks;
viz. in order to support admitting
minorities with significantly lower
qualifications, it must be shown that
these tests are culturally biased and
not economically biased.
Admit best students
Therefore, it seems that minorities
should be judged by the same stan
dards as everyone else, and that the
best students (those exhibiting the
most potential) should be admitted.
Arguments for redressing past
"discrimination" against blacks and
others are not relevant for a variety of
reasons, primary among which is that
it is unjust to penalize one for actions
he has no part in. (Thus, even if one
doesn't buy the argument that there
is not a level of potential above which
all students will probably be compe
tent doctors, it has not been shown
that race should be a factor in select
ing those exhibiting necessary po
tential.)
