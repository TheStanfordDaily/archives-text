Cartoon racially vicious
Why did the Stanford Daily editors choose to print
such a racially vicious and tasteless editorial cartoon in
its Friday edition?
The editorial was unconnected to any story that has
appeared in the Daily this school year or to any current
news event.
The cartoon was a reprint from the Richmond News
Leader, a newspaper in Richmond, Virginia, well-known
for its bigoted approach to racial matters.
I only hope that this trashy cartoon was not motivated
by racism but simply reflects a woeful and glaring lack of
sensitivity on the part of the responsible editors.
It would be helpful to us all if the editors would
explain their rationale for selecting this particularly

race-baiting cartoon from the several editorial drawings
which they must have at their disposal daily.
