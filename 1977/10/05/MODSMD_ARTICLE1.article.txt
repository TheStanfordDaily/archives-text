# Watergate sentences shortened

Washington (AP) — U.S. District
Court judge John Sirica sharply re
duced the Watergate prison sen
tences of Richard Nixon's closest
White House aides yesterday, mak
ing one of them — John Ehrlichman
— eligible for parole at the end of this
month.
Sirica reduced the 2Vi-year to
8-year sentences of John Mitchell,
H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman
to a period of "not less than one nor
more than four years."
Ehrlichman, who went to prison
without waiting for the outcome of
his appeals, thus becomes eligible
for parole from his Watergate
cover-up conviction after Oct. 28.
He still is under a 20-month to
five-year sentence for his conviction
in the so-called Watergate plumbers
case but it was expected that the
judge in that case would reduce the
time to conform with that handed
out by Sirica. For Haldeman the
magic date is |une 21 next year and
for Mitchell, June 22.
Sirica made his decision after hear
ing tape recorded requests for le
niency by the three men,
Sirica was chief judge of the U.S.
District court in the District of Col
umbia when the seven Watergate
burglars were indicted on Sept. 15,
1972.
"I'm glad it's the last major deci
sion I'll have to render in this case,"
he told a reporter before entering
court. "It's a long, difficult case, in
many respects a sad case. I'm glad to
see the end of the tunnel."
Ehrlichman, 52, formerly domestic
counselor to Richard Nixon when he
was president, has been in the fed
eral prison camp at Safford, Ariz.,
since last Oct. 28. Mitchell, 64, who
was Nixon's attorney general, went
into prison at Maxwell Air Force Base
in Alabama on June 22 and Halde
man, the Nixon chief of staff, entered
the prison facility at Lompoc, Calif.,
the day before.
