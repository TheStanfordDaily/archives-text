# Canal issue: just U.S. imperialism

First of a two-part series
The Panama Canal treaty looms as
the hottest issue yet in the Carter
administration. It is the issue on
which Ronnie Reagan almost rode to
glory last year. What are the issues at
stake here?
In the first place, the Panama Canal
question is a splendid way in which
to look upon the face of the right
wing, in all of its pristine purity.
There is no question here of a
Soviet threat, no Culags, there is just
naked, unabashed American Im
perialism. And yet, or rather and

therefore, here is an issue to make
conservative juices flow. "Give up
sovereignty over the Canal? Never,
sir!" proclaims our home-grown
Colonel Blimp.
Not only does the Panama ques
tion strip away the anti-Communist
camouflage; but it also dispenses
with anti-socialism and anti-statism
as well. For defending the Panama
Canal Zone is defending — and does
the right-wing know this, I wonder?
— an enclave of pure socialism
within U.S. territory. In short, not
only is the Canal Zone owned by the

U.S. government, but virtually all
citizens there are employes of the
U.S. government owned and oper
ated Panama Canal Company.
So what the Conservatives want us
to die to the last man for is not only
naked American imperialism and
"sovereignty," but also an enclave of
American state socialism. We should
ask ourselves: why don't the conser
vatives care about that? The answer
evidently is that the conservatives are
old-fashioned Imperialists who don't
give a hoot about libertarian anti
statist concerns. One more striking
example of the fact that Reaganite
Conservatism is antithetical to lib
erty.
But isn't the Canal Zone "right
fully" the United States? Didn't we
buy it or something? The answer is
no. The U.S. stole it in an egregious
power grab by America's first openly
imperialist president, the evil Teddy
Roosevelt. T.R. engineered a phony
revolution in the Panama section of
Colombia, a "revolution" fought and
paid for by U.S. troops and
employes, after which our new pup
pet regime sold us the rights to the
Canal and the Zone.
Teddy engineered the coup be
cause the government of Colombia
wanted a $10 million cut from the $40
million which the U.S. government
had agreed to pay the old bankrupt
French Panama Canal Co. for its
rights to build the canal. The U.S.
wanted the Panama Canal Co. to get
the full $40 miiiion. When T.R. made
his massive intervention, he conned
the American public into believing
that he was saving the American tax
payers from an extra $10 million hol
dup by Colombia; instead, it was
simply a question of division of the

spoils.
Why was Teddy Roosevelt so wor
ried about the income going to the
French Panama Canal Co.? Because it
was no longer "French." It had sec
retly been bought up by a coalition of
Wall St. speculators, headed by J.P.
Morgan, and including Teddy's own
brother-in-law, Douglas E. Robin
son. The new canal company hired
the eminent Wall St. laywer, William
Cromwell, to get the American
money, and it was Cromwell, sitting
in the White House itself, who wrote
Roosevelt's dispatches and en
gineered the entire operation. After
the company got the $40 million,
much of it was funneled by Cromwell
into the eager hands of the New York
real estate investments of Teddy's
kinsman Douglas Robinson. Is this
the process that is supposed to
sanctify U.S. sovereignty of the
Panama Canal and the zone until
death do us part?
The Panamanians, understanda
bly, are familiar with the history of
the Panama grab even if we are not.
Hence the continuing agitation,
threat of uprising, etc. The liberta
rian policy on the canal is clear and
simple: to liquidate the U.S. gov
ernment operation in the form of the
Panama Canal Co., and to withdraw
U.S. troops from the Zone and U.S.
"sovereignty" over the zone. In
short, to get the heck out, and the
sooner the better.
