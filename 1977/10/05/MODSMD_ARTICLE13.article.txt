# SALT talks need compromise

The New York Times

The five-year "interim agreement"
between the United States and the
Soviet Union limiting offensive
strategic weapons expired on Oct. 3.
Negotiations for a new agreement
are stalled. The immediate obstacle
is a dispute over American cruise
missiles and Soviet heavy ballistic
missiles.
Yet lurking offstage is a more fun

damental question. Have the rival
strategic forces developed along
such divergent paths that real limita
tion agreements have become both
intellectually and politically impossi
ble?
There is no doubt that the paths
diverge. The Soviet Union prefers
very large land-based missiles; the
American land-based force depends
on lighter missiles with less destruc
tive but more accurate warheads.
The United States relies more on
missile-launching submarines,
which are less vulnerable to a Soviet
first strike. The Soviet Union has
poured resources into air defenses
while the United States has not.
While Soviet bombers can penetrate
American air space, the United States
has chosen to rely on cruise missiles
launched from bombers beyond the
reach of Soviet air defenses and cap
able of eluding them.
Comparisons of these forces must
take account of so many different
factors — accuracy, reliability, de
structive power, security of com
mand and control — that disagree
ments rage inside both Governments
as well as between them.
SALT is not only a forum for issues
of nuclear war but also a talisman for
the entire American-Soviet relation
ship. When SALT goes well, other ag
reements come easier, and the con
tinuing SALT process impels the top
leaders of both countries to remain
in touch.
The present impasse is not so
fundamental that it should threaten
the entire SALT process. Where is the
way out? Probably it lies in going
back toward the Ford-Brezhnev prin
ciples, which would limit each side to
2,400 long-range missiles or aircraft,
1,320 of which could carry multiple,
independently aimed warheads, cal
led MIRV's.
Cruise missiles
In January 1976, Secretary Kis
singer and Mr. Brezhnev agreed that
cruise missiles capable of interconti
nental flight would not be permitted
and that a bomber carrying cruise
missiles would be counted as a mis
sile with multiple warheads.
The Carter Administration rejects
this deal. It agrees that cruise mis
siles should not have intercontinen
tal ranges. But it contends that a
bomber laden with cruise missiles
can inflict no more damage than one
carrying "ordinary" nuclear bombs,
and that cruise missiles are necessary

only to penetrate Soviet air defenses.
It proposes a sepairate sub-ceiling
outside the MIRV limit, of about 250
cruise-missile carriers. But it also
wants to limit the very heavy Soviet
missiles to about 150. The Administ
ration is simultaneously seeking re
lease from one constraint to which its
predecessor had agreed, while seek
ing to impose a new constraint upon
Moscow.
There is, in fact, a logical basis for
both requests. Cruise missiles are
not really comparable to MIRVs.
They fly at subsonic speeds and can
not be used for a first strike. The
heavy Soviet missiles do pose a spe
cial problem because their large
payload enhances their utility for a
first strike. Thus, limiting Soviet
heavy missiles and not counting
American cruise missiles as MIRVs
would bring no unfair advantage to
the United States.
American strategic logic is not,
however, accepted in Moscow,
where the distinction between strik
ing first ai"l retaliating has never
been acknowledged. Instead, the
Administration's proposals are seen
as a reshuffling of the deck, in mid
play, to facilitate deployment of the
new cruise missile, whose potential
Soviet planners have not yet asses
sed.
These doubts, rooted in divergent
weapons development, only em
phasize the need for better under
standing through intensified SALT
discussions. To facilitate them, the
Carter Administration should be
prepared to compromise on its de
mands. Compromise would not
jeopardize this nation's security,
particularly in the few years to be co
vered by another agreement. Until
the early 1980's the United States will
still lead in such categories as accu
racy, reliability and numbers of de
liverable warheads. Given the high
proportion of those warheads on in
vulnerable submarines and quick
alert bombers, Moscow would be
foolhardy to attempt a first strike, its
large missiles notwithstanding.
What should be sought now is a
way to keep the two sides engaged in
the SALT process. There will be time
enough, following the next agree
ment, to test Soviet good faith and to
press for the real reductions in nuc
lear forces that the President rightly
seeks,

The five-year "interim agreement"
between the United States and the
Soviet Union limiting offensive
strategic weapons expired on Oct. 3.
Negotiations for a new agreement
are stalled. The immediate obstacle
is a dispute over American cruise
missiles and Soviet heavy ballistic
missiles.
Yet lurking offstage is a more fun

damental question. Have the rival
strategic forces developed along
such divergent paths that real limita
tion agreements have become both
intellectually and politically impossi
ble?
There is no doubt that the paths
diverge. The Soviet Union prefers
very large land-based missiles; the
American land-based force depends
on lighter missiles with less destruc
tive but more accurate warheads.
The United States relies more on
missile-launching submarines,
which are less vulnerable to a Soviet
first strike. The Soviet Union has
poured resources into air defenses
while the United States has not.
While Soviet bombers can penetrate
American air space, the United States
has chosen to rely on cruise missiles
launched from bombers beyond the
reach of Soviet air defenses and cap
able of eluding them.
Comparisons of these forces must
take account of so many different
factors — accuracy, reliability, de
structive power, security of com
mand and control — that disagree
ments rage inside both Governments
as well as between them.
SALT is not only a forum for issues
of nuclear war but also a talisman for
the entire American-Soviet relation
ship. When SALT goes well, other ag
reements come easier, and the con
tinuing SALT process impels the top
leaders of both countries to remain
in touch.
The present impasse is not so
fundamental that it should threaten
the entire SALT process. Where is the
way out? Probably it lies in going
back toward the Ford-Brezhnev prin
ciples, which would limit each side to
2,400 long-range missiles or aircraft,
1,320 of which could carry multiple,
independently aimed warheads, cal
led MIRV's.
Cruise missiles
In January 1976, Secretary Kis
singer and Mr. Brezhnev agreed that
cruise missiles capable of interconti
nental flight would not be permitted
and that a bomber carrying cruise
missiles would be counted as a mis
sile with multiple warheads.
The Carter Administration rejects
this deal. It agrees that cruise mis
siles should not have intercontinen
tal ranges. But it contends that a
bomber laden with cruise missiles
can inflict no more damage than one
carrying "ordinary" nuclear bombs,
and that cruise missiles are necessary

only to penetrate Soviet air defenses.
It proposes a sepairate sub-ceiling
outside the MIRV limit, of about 250
cruise-missile carriers. But it also
wants to limit the very heavy Soviet
missiles to about 150. The Administ
ration is simultaneously seeking re
lease from one constraint to which its
predecessor had agreed, while seek
ing to impose a new constraint upon
Moscow.
There is, in fact, a logical basis for
both requests. Cruise missiles are
not really comparable to MIRVs.
They fly at subsonic speeds and can
not be used for a first strike. The
heavy Soviet missiles do pose a spe
cial problem because their large
payload enhances their utility for a
first strike. Thus, limiting Soviet
heavy missiles and not counting
American cruise missiles as MIRVs
would bring no unfair advantage to
the United States.

the entire SALT process. Where is the
way out? Probably it lies in going
back toward the Ford-Brezhnev prin
ciples, which would limit each side to
2,400 long-range missiles or aircraft,
1,320 of which could carry multiple,
independently aimed warheads, cal
led MIRV's.
Cruise missiles
In January 1976, Secretary Kis
singer and Mr. Brezhnev agreed that
cruise missiles capable of interconti
nental flight would not be permitted
and that a bomber carrying cruise
missiles would be counted as a mis
sile with multiple warheads.
The Carter Administration rejects
this deal. It agrees that cruise mis
siles should not have intercontinen
tal ranges. But it contends that a
bomber laden with cruise missiles
can inflict no more damage than one
carrying "ordinary" nuclear bombs,
and that cruise missiles are necessary

only to penetrate Soviet air defenses.
It proposes a sepairate sub-ceiling
outside the MIRV limit, of about 250
cruise-missile carriers. But it also
wants to limit the very heavy Soviet
missiles to about 150. The Administ
ration is simultaneously seeking re
lease from one constraint to which its
predecessor had agreed, while seek
ing to impose a new constraint upon
Moscow.
There is, in fact, a logical basis for
both requests. Cruise missiles are
not really comparable to MIRVs.
They fly at subsonic speeds and can
not be used for a first strike. The
heavy Soviet missiles do pose a spe
cial problem because their large
payload enhances their utility for a
first strike. Thus, limiting Soviet
heavy missiles and not counting
American cruise missiles as MIRVs
would bring no unfair advantage to
the United States.
American strategic logic is not,
however, accepted in Moscow,
where the distinction between strik
ing first ai"l retaliating has never
been acknowledged. Instead, the
Administration's proposals are seen
as a reshuffling of the deck, in mid
play, to facilitate deployment of the
new cruise missile, whose potential
Soviet planners have not yet asses
sed.
These doubts, rooted in divergent
weapons development, only em
phasize the need for better under
standing through intensified SALT
discussions. To facilitate them, the
Carter Administration should be
prepared to compromise on its de
mands. Compromise would not
jeopardize this nation's security,
particularly in the few years to be co
vered by another agreement. Until
the early 1980's the United States will
still lead in such categories as accu
racy, reliability and numbers of de
liverable warheads. Given the high
proportion of those warheads on in
vulnerable submarines and quick
alert bombers, Moscow would be
foolhardy to attempt a first strike, its
large missiles notwithstanding.
What should be sought now is a
way to keep the two sides engaged in
the SALT process. There will be time
enough, following the next agree
ment, to test Soviet good faith and to
press for the real reductions in nuc
lear forces that the President rightly
seeks,
