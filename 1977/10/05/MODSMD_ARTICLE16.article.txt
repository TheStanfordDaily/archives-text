# After 27 years at Columbia
## Goode debuts as sociology prof here 
### Julie Muller 
There's someone new in the
sociology department. Prof.
William ). Goode has come to
Stanford after 27 years at Col
umbia University.
While Prof. Goode's list of
achievements in the field of
sociology is lengthy, and he
sounds properly formidable on
the telephone, one finds him a
casually dressed, charming
and easy individual to speak
with.

This quarter Goode is teach
ing a class entitled "Class,
Status and Power." This ties in
with a project he has been
working on for the past 20
years and is now getting ready
to put to press — a monograph
entitled "Celebration of
Heroes — Prestige as a Social
Control System."
Goode points out that the
whole industry of public rela
tions focuses on the concept of
manipulation of prestige. But
this idea does not stop with the
promotion of public image in
large corporations. The over
powering desire to obtain fame
and praise happens at all
levels.
Goode, who received his
bachelor's degree from the
University of Texas in 1938 and
Ph.D. from Penn State in 194b,
has won numerous awards for
his work on the family. He was
formerly President of the
American Sociological Associa
tion and Chairman of the De
partment of Sociology at Col
umbia.
Goode won the Burgess
Award as the outstanding
sociologist on the family in the
United States in 1969. Earlier, in
1965 he won the Mclver Award,
the most important prize in
sociology, for his "World Re
volution and Family Patterns."
Along with a great deal of
work on family behavior;
Goode has also been involved

with the women's liberation
movement. He is a personal
friend of both Betty Friedan
and Cynthia Epstein.
"I was there before they
were," he says."I wrote the
first important book — 'After
Divorce.' It is essentially writ
ten through the eyes of wo
men. I was an egalitarian when
I was a kid."
One would be hard pressed
to define sociology, according
to Goode.
"That is a journalistic ques
tion that can't be answered. If
you look in any text book you
can find a nonsensical defini
tion. You have to evaluate it by
the good work that it does,"
says Goode.
Being a member of the
(sociology) department doesn't
necessarily make a person a
good sociologist, either, says
Goode. "The importance is the
rigor and precision in the par
ticular theoretical inquiry that
you're making."
Goode admitted that many
persons here consider sociol
ogy a "fuzzy" subject.
"They're right — no ques
tion about that. That is our de
light and our despair. Delight
in the discovery of new insights
into human behavior and de
spair in making a tough and
rigorous proposition," he says.
Goode is presently ex
periencing all the hassles that

go with being in a new envi
ronment. He considers himself
to ' ' a New Yorker by temper
ament but came to California
because it presented a diffe
rent and interesting adventure.
"I mean that I am tempera
mentally at home in New
York," he says. Goode said that
he was born and reared in
Texas and has 150 years of an
cestors there and 300 years of
ancestors in Virginia.
"I enjoy its (New York's)
chaos and frenetic activity.
There are always more things
than I can handle, more ballet
and theater than I can go to;
more art than I can possibly
see.
"One is continually ex
periencing the best there is to
offer. You are always pretty
much at the edge of the most
creative thingthat is goingon,"
he says."The art in Californiais
incredibly bad," he added.
"Actually living there (New
York) is a terrible hassle, but
the other side is the delight.
One can get better smoked
salmon there; it rs a sneer at
the provincialism of the West
Coast where they have all the
salmon in the world," he says.
He came to California alone
and says right now his big local
hobby is trying to find the right
tennis partner.
Goode describes himself as
"sort of a nature boy and a
water-baby."

Goode won the Burgess
Award as the outstanding
sociologist on the family in the
United States in 1969. Earlier, in
1965 he won the Mclver Award,
the most important prize in
sociology, for his "World Re
volution and Family Patterns."
Along with a great deal of
work on family behavior;
Goode has also been involved

with the women's liberation
movement. He is a personal
friend of both Betty Friedan
and Cynthia Epstein.
"I was there before they
were," he says."I wrote the
first important book — 'After
Divorce.' It is essentially writ
ten through the eyes of wo
men. I was an egalitarian when
I was a kid."
One would be hard pressed
to define sociology, according
to Goode.
"That is a journalistic ques
tion that can't be answered. If
you look in any text book you
can find a nonsensical defini
tion. You have to evaluate it by
the good work that it does,"
says Goode.
Being a member of the
(sociology) department doesn't
necessarily make a person a
good sociologist, either, says
Goode. "The importance is the
rigor and precision in the par
ticular theoretical inquiry that
you're making."
Goode admitted that many
persons here consider sociol
ogy a "fuzzy" subject.
"They're right — no ques
tion about that. That is our de
light and our despair. Delight
in the discovery of new insights
into human behavior and de
spair in making a tough and
rigorous proposition," he says.
Goode is presently ex
periencing all the hassles that

go with being in a new envi
ronment. He considers himself
to ' ' a New Yorker by temper
ament but came to California
because it presented a diffe
rent and interesting adventure.
"I mean that I am tempera
mentally at home in New
York," he says. Goode said that
he was born and reared in
Texas and has 150 years of an
cestors there and 300 years of
ancestors in Virginia.
"I enjoy its (New York's)
chaos and frenetic activity.
There are always more things
than I can handle, more ballet
and theater than I can go to;
more art than I can possibly
see.
"One is continually ex
periencing the best there is to
offer. You are always pretty
much at the edge of the most
creative thingthat is goingon,"
he says."The art in Californiais
incredibly bad," he added.
"Actually living there (New
York) is a terrible hassle, but
the other side is the delight.
One can get better smoked
salmon there; it rs a sneer at
the provincialism of the West
Coast where they have all the
salmon in the world," he says.
He came to California alone
and says right now his big local
hobby is trying to find the right
tennis partner.
Goode describes himself as
"sort of a nature boy and a
water-baby."
There's someone new in the
sociology department. Prof.
William ). Goode has come to
Stanford after 27 years at Col
umbia University.
While Prof. Goode's list of
achievements in the field of
sociology is lengthy, and he
sounds properly formidable on
the telephone, one finds him a
casually dressed, charming
and easy individual to speak
with.

This quarter Goode is teach
ing a class entitled "Class,
Status and Power." This ties in
with a project he has been
working on for the past 20
years and is now getting ready
to put to press — a monograph
entitled "Celebration of
Heroes — Prestige as a Social
Control System."
Goode points out that the
whole industry of public rela
tions focuses on the concept of
manipulation of prestige. But
this idea does not stop with the
promotion of public image in
large corporations. The over
powering desire to obtain fame
and praise happens at all
levels.

bachelor's degree from the
University of Texas in 1938 and
