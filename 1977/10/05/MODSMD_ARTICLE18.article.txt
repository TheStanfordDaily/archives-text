# Children's Hospital at Stanford
## New outlook on life 
### David Theis 
Children's Hospital at Stan
ford, located across from the
Stanford Medical Center, is fil
led with colorful mobiles, com
ical posters, display cases of
dolls from the world over and
door signs such as "Ye Old Al
chemy Shoppe."
It is not immediately appa
rent that the hospital
specializes in children with
life-threatening diseases.
' Life-threatening disease" is
not an euphemism for terminal
illness. It represents an ap
proach taken in the care and
treatment of patients. Implicit
in this approach is a positive
regard and a realistic hope for
the patient's life shared by the
hospital doctors and nurses, as
well as the children and their
families.
Childhood cancer
The prevalence of childhood
cancer is staggering. More

Increasing success in treating
terminal diseases has created a
need to reorient a patient to
wards living again. As one staff
member said, 'At the hospital,
you never hear the word 'dy
ing'/

children die of cancer than of
any other children's disease.
Only accidents take more chil
dren's lives.
Despite these disturbing
facts, 50 per cent of the hospi
tal's cancer cases either enter
long-term remission or are
cured, which contrasts with
the almost inevitable death
faced by children with cancer
10 years ago.
Similar success in treating
other diseases once regarded
as "terminal" has created a
need to reorient child patients
toward living again. As one
staff member said, "At the
hospital, you never hear 'ter
minal,' you never hear 'dying,'
you never hear 'fatal.' "
Facing death
The abstract thought of
death is usually beyond a child
younger than 11 or 12 years.
Until then, a preoccupation
with daily pain and hospital

procedure substitutes for the
fear of death, according to
psychiatrist Gregory Fritz.
Children are anxious and
embarrassed about losing their
hair from radiation therapy.
They ask why they hurt and
they must confront the ques
tion "Why me?" at a tender
age.
Total treatment at Children's
Hospital at Stanford means
more than medical treatment.
It is treating each child indi
vidually and emphasizing the
value of his or her life is consi
dered an equal part of the
treatment.
Family life
This care and respect ex
tends to the patient's family as
well. Every effort is made to
preserve the integration of
family and child. Family and
friends are welcome at all
times. In addition, a bedside
cot is provided for a parent

who wishes to stay with his or
her child during the night.
Whenever possible, parents
are also encouraged to partici
pate in treatment. This can
mean holding the child's hand
during a painful therapy ses
sion or giving actual injections
while a doctor stands nearby.
In contrast to most hospitals,
parents have full access to the
medical charts on their child.
Treatment
Treatment is provided as
long as a chance for improve
ment exists. The goal in all
cases is to return the child to
his previous lifestyle in every
way possible.
Some patients cannot expect
a long life. Treatment at this
point is channeled towards
minimizing pain and keeping
the child comfortable. Suppor
tive care may mean bringing
the child into the security of his
home environment. The hospi

tal sometimes provides neces
sary medical equipment to the
family.
Public health nurses are re
quested to come to the child's
house in order to administer
medication and check equip
ment.
For the family, the child's
death can be shattering. But it
can also be a moment of draw
ing together in an intense
awareness and appreciation of
life. The hospital affords the
family the privacy and intimacy
for this experience.
Children's Hospital at Stan
ford handles specific critical
childhood diseases; pediatric
oncology (children's cancer),
arthritis and rheumatology, al
lergy and respiratory illnesses
(such as severe asthma and cys
tic fibrosis) and special or
thopedic and psychiatric prob
lems.
Any child afflicted with these
diseases becomes eligible for
care regardless of the family's
financial status. At least
$500,000 in donations comes
from an annual Campaign for
Children's Hospital at Stanford
to support families who cannot
afford hospital costs.
Various treatments
Primary medical treatment
includes chemical, radiation
and inhalation therapies. Sec
ondary or adjunctive care in
cludes daily occupational and
recreational therapy. In occu
pational therapy, handicrafts
can allow a child to gain some
control over his environment.
Recreational therapy pro
vides an important emotional
and physical means for chil
dren to develop a sense of con
trol over their bodies.
Touch
The hospital will soon
explore the use of "therapeutic
touch." Director of nursing
Lee Rasmussen described this
as a version of the "laying on of
hands." Rasmussen proposed
that through body contact, a
healthy nurse could transmit
energy forces to the depleted
energy supply of the child.
Rasmussen stressed that this
procedure would only be used
as supportive care and not as
direct medical treatment.
Psychiatric cases pose diffe
rent problems. The youngest
referral to the hospital was a
three-month-old baby. The pa
rents observed that their child
had temperament described

by Dr. Fritz as "failure to th
rive." Observation of the
mother-child bond is the first
step toward treatment, once
major biological causes have
been ruled out.
Outpatient services
The 60 beds in the hospital
are rarely filled. However, the
small number of children who
must remain at the hospital be
cause of their critical condition
does not begin to suggest the
overall number of patients
treated at the hospital. Close to
2500 outpatients are served
each month. Some children

are able to live at home and go
to school while they receive
regular supportive treatment
in the outpatient unit of the
hospital. This emphasis on
outpatient care is one more
sign of the positive and aggres
sive attitude of getting the
child out of the hospital.
Children's Hospital at Stan
ford has drawn national atten
tion as well as coverage in CBS'
"Sixty Minutes." The success
of the hospital more than any
thing else, said Rasmussen, is
due to the commitment of the
doctors and staff in helping
children appreciate their lives.
