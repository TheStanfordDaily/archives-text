Construction on the Outer Quad's Physiology Building has been proceeding somewhat slower than
expected, according to John Lerry, manager of construction and engineering. When the project is
completed, he said, only the original outside wall will remain.
The entire interior is being replaced, Lerry explained, and the delay has arisen because "particu
lar care was taken with the structural support."
The tentative occupation date for the building, located next to the Psychology Department, is
January 1979, Lerry said.
