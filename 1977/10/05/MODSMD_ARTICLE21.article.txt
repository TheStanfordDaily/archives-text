# Proposed UC admissions rules would have cut minority enrollment

Sacramento (AP) — The Uni
versity of California (UC) says
its proposed new under
graduate admissions standards
would have disqualified more
than eight per cent of all blacks
and about six per cent
Mexican-Americans who en
tered UC in 1976.
But a top UC official says the
university will do everything it
can to see that minority en
rollment doesn't drop if the
tougher new admissions stan
dards are adopted.

The standards will be consi
dered by the UC regents at
their Oct. 20-21 meeting. The
rules were presented to the re
gents once before, in July, and
met substantial opposition.
Eligibility for UC admission is
now based almost solely on
high school grade averages.
But recent years there have
been widespread reports of
"grade inflation," an increase
in grade averages while test
scores decline.

So the UC Academic Senate,
made up of faculty leaders, has
proposed placing somewhat
greater reliance on standar
dized test scores for applicants
at the lower range of eligibility,
starting in 1979. That proposal
has been attacked by
minorities.
Its effect would be to require
high school students with a B
average — 3.0 to 3.03 on a
4-point scale — to get a higher
score on the Scholastic Ap

titude Test (SAT) than they now
need to qualify for admission.
At the same time, students
with slightly lower grade aver
ages, in the 2.85 or 2.9 range,
could qualify with high SAT
scores, an avenue that isn't
open to them now.
