# Twenty years after Sputnik
## Soviet space effort exceeds US! 
### 
Moscow (AP) — When the
Soviet Union launched the
world's first artificial earth
satellite 20 years ago, not
everyone in the West profes
sed to be astounded.
Then-President Dwight D.
Eisenhower initially dismissed
Sputnik 1 as "one small ball in
the air."
Nonetheless, the Oct. 4,
1957, launching of Sputnik — a
185-pound silvery sphere
equipped with four whisker
like antennas — catapulted
both the Soviet Union and the
United States into an era of in
tense and expensive space ri
valty.
That single "ball in the air"
has led to hundreds of increas
ingly sophisticated satellites
whirling around the globe,
with missions ranging from
biological experiments to sec
ret military communications

and reconnaissance.
Another Soviet space first,
the orbital flight of cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin in 1961, com
pounded the mounting
Soviet-U.S. technological
competition with crash prog
rams to develop manned space
exploration.
The launching of a new
Soviet space station, Salyut 6,
last Thursday has increased
speculation among Western
observers that Moscow may be
planning a major space spec
tacular to mark not only the
Sputnik anniversary but also
the upcoming 60th anniversary
of the Bolshevik Revolution
next month.
Soviet officials, however,
have denied that any such
spectacular is in the offing.
Where does the Soviet space
program stand today, 20 years
after Sputnik?
Despite the Soviet failure to
achieve a manned moon land
ing, Western scientific obser
vers say the Soviets have
forged ahead with a space ef
fort that on balance is larger,
more diverse and better
funded than current U.S. space
activities.
More Soviet launches
According to an authorita
tive study compiled by the U.S.
Library of Congress in
Washington, the number of
successful Soviet space launch
ings in recent years has been
running at a level about three

times higher than American
launches.
The Soviet program has put
greater stress on military appli
cations of satellites and other
space technology.
Data from the Library of
Congress study show that from
1957 through 1975, the Soviets
conducted a total of 586
launchings for apparent milit
ary purposes, in contrast to
their 292 launches of civilian
space vehicles.
By comparison, during the
same period there were 326
U.S. military launches and 323
U.S. civilian space vehicles.
Vigor maintained
"The vigor of the Soviets'
military space program —
combining military satellites
and strategic missiles — has
been continually maintained,"
commented one Westerner in
Moscow who specializes in
watching Soviet military de
velopments.
The diplomatic and political
value of data gathered by the
extensive Soviet satellite re
connaissance network was il
lustrated in August by the in
ternational uproar over alleged
plans of South Africa to test a
nuclear bomb.
In that incident, Soviet satel
lite photo analysts reportedly
detected what appeared to be
facilities for a nuclear test
being built in South Africa's

Kalahari Desert.
This prompted Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev to send
an urgent personal message on
Aug. 6 to President Jimmy Car
ter warning that a South Afri
can test was imminent.
Bre/hnev message
Following the Brezhnev
message, Carter ordered
closer U.S. satellite observa
tion of the suspected test site,
and this was said to have con
firmed the Soviet findings.
The South African govern
ment subsequently declared it
had no intention of exploding a
nuclear device.
Aside from photographic re
connaissance, Soviet military
satellites are believed to per
form missions which include
early warning against missile
attack; navigational assistance
for Soviet missile submarines
and other naval vessels; elec
tronic eavesdropping on U.S.
and other Western telecom
munications, and ocean sur
veillance, using radar to pin
point ships at sea despite cloud
cover and radio silence.
In the civilian field, the
Soviet Union has landed un
manned Lunakbod test vehi
cles on the moon, sent probes
to Venus and Mars, as well as
orbited around the earth a
series of manned spacecraft
leading up to the latest Soyuz
and Salyut models.
