# Benjamin's knee improves
## But Card qb unlikely for this week's contest 
### Bruce Anderson 
The question on the mind of
every follower of Stanford
football is not how good is
UCLA, but how good is Guy
Benjamin's knee.
"There is no swelling and no
pain," said Benjamin, who was
at practice yesterday in street
clothes watching his team
mates practice for Saturday's
meeting with the UCLA Bruins.
"It is getting quite a bit better
every day. Each day I can feel a
noticeable difference."
And while the star quarter
back walked seemingly unaf
fected by the half-tear in the
ligament of his left knee> it is
almost certain he will not play
Saturday.
"The X-rays have proven
negative, and the knee looks
more and more stable," said
Dr. Fred Behling, the team
physician, Monday. "I don't
think he'll need surgery but he
will have to be restricted in his
activities for at least one week.
He won't practice this week

and it's very, very unlikely that
he'll play against UCLA." •
"I have no guesses as to
when I'll be back," Benjamin
said. "It's more a mental thing
than a physical thing. I'll be
back when I'm mentally confi
dent in my physical condition.
It's not worth it, if you're not
mentally confident. You're
better off up in the stands."
In addition to attending
practices, Benjamin said he's
been lifting weights and doing
everything he normally does.
• The Stanford offense also
expects to do what it normally
does when it meets the Brums
Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
"We'll prepare for the game
exactly as we would have with
Benjamin," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said. "This can happen
to any team, and we're not
going to make an issue of it."
Replacing Benjamin at the
helm of the Stanford offense
will be Steve Dils, the second
team quarterback who led the
Cardinals to a fourth-quarter
touchdown in his first series
last week against Oregon. His
previous experience for the
Cards was limited to one play
last year against Washington
State.
"We have confidence in
Steve Dils," Walsh told
sportswriters Monday."
Bruin coach Terry Donohue
also said that, notwithstanding
Benjamin's absence, UCLA
won't change its approach to
the game.
"We have to prepare for a
team, not an individual,"
Donohue said, "much the way
Stanford has to prepare for
UCLAwhetherwe haveTheotis
Brown or not." (Brown is the
star UCLA halfback who will
miss this weekend's game with
an injury sustained early in the
season.)
Ticket notes . . . Individual
student tickets for the Big
Game will go on sale again this,
morning at 8:30 a.m. at the
Maples Pavilion ticket booth.
The NCAA placed the Uni
versity Of Houston on one-year
probation yesterday for re
cruiting violations. ABC has
been considering the
Houston-Texas Tech and the
Stanford-California games for
its nationally televised broad
cast Nov. 19. The probation,
which also includes a ban on
post-season bowl appearances
this year, may lean the network
toward selecting the Big Game
contest.

Guy Benjamin sets up to throw in Stanford's 37-24 victory over
Illinois in which the Cardinal signal-caller completed 30 of 41 passes.
Benjamin, the leading passer in the Pacific-8, will almost certainly
miss Saturday's game against UCLA because of a knee injury suffered
Saturday against Oregon.
