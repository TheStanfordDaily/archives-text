San Francisco — Stanford's
floundering soccer team drop
ped a 2-1 overtime decision to
San Francisco State Monday to
lower its season's record to
1-5-1.
Stanford trailed the Gators
1-0 after a first-period goal by
SFS until Paul Kozachenko
drove the ball into the net with
only 27 seconds remaining in
:he game.

The fired-up play which
characterized the contest con
tinued into the overtime
period until a well-executed
cross and shot on goal by SFS
gave the home team the win.
On route to the lockerroom
after the game, Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge remarked,
"From a coaching standpoint
we did very well. We played
the 4-2-4 just right and kept
pressure on the keeper. I feel

good about the goal with 27
seconds to go."
Louis Sagamini, assistant
coach for the Gators, said,
"The game went very well. I
like the strength between the
two teams — hard fought, yet
friendly.
"I have seen better teams
from Stanford," Sagamini said,
"but this one's young. The
coach (Lodge) had good years
at Hayward, and will have good
years at Stanford."
While the shortage of cros
ses and give-and-go situations
hurt the Cardinals' offense, the
defense held with key plays by
Greg Delgado and Jon Hecht.
"We are tough only when we
need it, and then it's too late,"
said Lodge. "As coach, I have
to change the inexperienced
naiveness. We're still- finding
ourselves. Intensity and desire
creates a give-and-go situa
tion."
Card assistant coach Phil
Wright concurred with Lodge's
assessment. "The team is com
ing alopg strong in the end,"
Wright said. "Oregon, Seattle
Pacific and today's game —
these are three games lost to
inexperience. We must play in
tensely to play well."
