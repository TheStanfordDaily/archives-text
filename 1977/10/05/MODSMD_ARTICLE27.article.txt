# Cardinal sins
## The 						color of life is red? 
### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford students shudder to hear their be
loved institution called the "Harvard of the
West" but never hesitate to tag their Ivy
League conterpart the "Stanford of the East."
Students on the Farm dislike and laugh off
charges that the University is an imitation of
its Cambridge-based predecessor. All that
notwithstanding, Stanford has been using a
poorly disguised facsimile of the Harvard
nickname for nearly 90 years.
When confusion beset the Cambridge
campus in 1875 about whether the school
color was magenta or crimson-, the student
body passed an act making crimson the offi
cial school color. Harvard teams have been
called the Crimson for more than a hundred
years now. •
Stanford in a bold and imagina
tive move, adopted 1 cardinal as the school
color shortly before the first Big Game in
1892-.
Crimson, Webster's says, is deep red.
Cardinal, on the other hand, is defined as
bright red.
A courageous difference.
Stanford students who populated the
campus when the sandstone was freshly cut
apparently could not shake the influence of
Ivy League forebears.

Actually, the Stanford student body had
originally voted in the fail of 1891 to make
gold the School color. • • •
But backers of cardinal won acceptance of
their favorite at a poorly attended meeting of
the student body in early 1892. Besides, the
misguided collegiates on the other side of
the Bay already used gold.
A headline in one of the San Francisco
newspapers after the first Big Game
screamed "CARDINAL BEATS BLUE & GOLD"
and resolved the school color issue.
If only the mascot issue could be resolved
so easily.
As if part of.the cycle of nature, the mascot
issue arrives at campus on the autumn wind
with the falling of the leaves and the shorten
ing of the days. .
If September means the beginning of
school and the opening of football season, it
also means a renewal of the controversy
rooted in a five-year-old decision by Presi
dent Richard Lyman to eliminate Use of In
dians as the Stanford mascot.

For many alums, casting aside the Indian
mas.cot wasi an irresponsible act worse than
eliminating the undergraduate engineering
program or razing the School of Medicine.
No one seemed satisfied with the Athletic
Department's decision to return to the Car
dinals as the official nickname.
support of Robber Ba
rons, TtitmderChickens, Trees and Griffins,
but no group has been as loud as those who
demand the return of the Indian,

For the past two Saturdays pamphlets dec
laring that "Old-Stanford Indians Never Die
— nor do they fade away" have been distri
buted by the New Founders League to spec
tators attending the football games at Stan
ford Stadium.
The New Founders League is a conserva
tive alumni group which fc rmed primarily to
return the Indian and ROTC to the campus.
One absurd claim the New Founders
League pamphlet makes is that if today's stu
dent body were allowed to choose its own
mas.cot, "they would enthusiastically choose
the Stanford Indians."
A student plebiscite two years ago showed
thait only 31 per cent of those voting would
have the school return to using the Indian as
a mascot. Hardly "enthusiastic" support.
* * *
But the same plebiscite did not show that
students desired no mascot at all — which is
what the Athletic Department has left us
with. (Some will say the mascot issue is ger
mane only to old alums and sportswriters. So
be it.)
Cardinal.
Is it a bird? No, the Athletic Department
sdys.
Is it a religious personage? No, the Athletic
Department reiterates.
Is it a number? A sin? No. A thousand
times, no.
It's a color. •
The multiple meanings of cardinal have
obscured its intended usage as a nickname.'
A color as a nickname presents inherent
problems. It gives you a tag, but no mascot.
If Stanford was going to mimic Ivy League
schools by using a color as a nickname, it
could have done a better job.
Pennsylvania (Red & Blue), Dartmouth (Big
Green), Cornell (Big Red) and Harvard all use
colors as nicknames but none are arVibigoous
and all go by the single form.
