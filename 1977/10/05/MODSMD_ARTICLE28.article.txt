# Spikers blast UOP
## 
### Bill Burger 
Stanford overcame a slow start to defeat the
University of Pacific 15-10, 15-10, 15-7 in a wo
men's volleyball match last night in Maples.
The Cards appeared flat at the start of the
game. Coach Art Lambert blamed the slow start
on the fact that Stanford had defeated UOP just
last Saturday on the Cards' way to winning the
San Jose State Tournament.
"It's hard to get up after just beating a team,"
Lambert said. "We were extremely flat tonight.
We played better Saturday."
UOP jumped to a 10-5 lead in the first game
before the Card spikers woke up and scored 10-
straight points to win.
Freshman Chris Anderson led the Cards
throughout the night, finding holes in the Tigers
defense with sharp spikes and accurate serves.
Stanford managed to keep the second game
somewhat closer, pulling away from a 8-§ deficit
to match the opening game's score, 15-10.
"We didn't block well until fhe middle of the
second game," said Lambert after the match.
The third game vvas never much of a contest
with Stanford never falling behind in the 15-7
win.
Lambert, who was hardly elated with the vic
tory, expressed his feeling about the match:
"I'm happy we played crappy and won."
A disappointed UOP coach, Taras Liskevych,
said Stanford's young team has a lot of talent but
warned, "We'll beat Stanford in two years."
The Cards next match is against UC-lrvine
Thursday at 8 p.m. in Maples Pavilion. Lambert
said Irvine is "one of those tough southern
California teams," but promised that the en
counter will be "a hell of a match."
