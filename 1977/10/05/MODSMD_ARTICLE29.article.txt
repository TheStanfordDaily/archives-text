# Terror under Amin
## Ugandan refugee tells his saga 
### 
Nairobi, Kenya (AP) â€” Jacob
Mugisha is a 36-year-old Ugan
dan refugee now living in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
There is little to mark him out
from the thousands of other
Ugandans who have sought
sanctuary in Kenya to escape
the tyranny of the rule of Idi
Amin.
But Mugisha says that until
the end of his days he will carry
a burden of guilt from which
there is no escape.
Two and a half years ago he
spent more than one month in
one of Amin's prisons, he says,
and there he was forced to bat
ter to death more than 20 of his
fellow prisoners, one of them a
friend.
Mugisha was brought into
contact with The Associated
Press by another Ugandan re
fugee. He produced a written
account of his experiences and
this was expanded upon by
him orally during questioning.
Terror stories
Travel to Uganda by news
correspondents is sharply re
stricted and thus independent
confirmation of his account is
not available. Nor could the
exact details of prison life in
Uganda be confirmed through
other Ugandan refugees here.
But Mugisha's story is consis
tent with the stories of terror
told by many other Ugandans
who have fled.
Various international human
rights agencies have estimated
that as many as 100,000 or more
Ugandans have been brutally
killed since Amin seized power
in a military coup in January
1971. There have been persis
tent reports that one common
method of execution is for
Amin's police and security men
to force prisoners to kill each
other.
Nobody knows how many
Ugandans have died in this
manner. But Mugisha says that
at the prison of Amin's much
feared Public Safety Unit (PSU)
on the Kampala-Jinja road,
about three miles from the cap
ital of Kampala, it is the most
favored form of execution.
Kakwa tribe
The PSU, the military police
and Amin's secret police, the
State Research Bureau, are the
three organizations of terror
through which Amin maintains
his power. They are staffed al
most entirely by Moslems from
the southern Sudan and
Amin's own minority Kakwa
tribe.

Mugisha said he was ar
rested by the PSU on April 20,
1975, while on vacation from
his job as a clerk at Barclay's
Bank in Kampala. He said he
was accused of helping to steal
100,000 shillings (about
$20,000) from the bank.
He said he was taken to the
PSU "death camp" at Naguru
and put in a cell in the block
where he claimed the killings
are carried out. He described
the block as an oblong, black
building with acourtyard in the
middle, surrounded by a com
pound cut off from the rest of
the prison by a wire fence.
After being taken to the cell,
Mugisha said, he was then
beaten to unconsciousness.
Two days later, he said, he was
selected to be killed that night
along with three other prison
ers. He named them as Fred
Musoke, Tom Galabuzi and a
Mr. Luttmanga.
The camp killer
"One of the cells in the block

is reserved for those who have
been chosen to die," he said.
"We were taken to the cell and
at about 9:30 p.m. the camp
killer Cpl. Nyanzi came with
two policemen. They started
calling us out one by one into
the courtyard and then the
compound. Musoke was the
first to be called. Then they cal
led my name.
"I went out and was told I
had been called to kill Musoke
with a heavy, thick iron bar. I
looked round and saw police
with machine guns guarding
us. I was shocked to see that I
was going to have to kill my
friend.
"I was ordered by the killer
in a loud voice to beat him on
the head. That's what I did. I
beat him to death. Then they
told me to put him in a Land
Rover.
"Then they brought
Galabuzi who was employed
by the Ministry of Works. I did
the same thing to him and put

him in the Land Rover. After
that they also brought
Lutymanga and I also killed
him," he said.
Each of the men, he said, had
his hands tied behind his back
and his legs bound together.
"Before I left Naguru on May
24, 1975, I killed more than 20
people," Mugisha said. "Every
night I was killing one or two
people. There were other pris
oners doing the same job. But I
did the most.
"Nobody can know what it is
to have the choice of either kil
ling or being killed. I hate to
think what I have done."
