# Lyman tells of report's delay
## 
### Craig Dennis 
President Richard Lyman said last
night on KZSU's Campus Confer
ence that the University's stock di
vestiture report will not be finished
until early November.
He also said, in the interview
broadcast live from Branner, that the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR) report will not be com
pleted for presentation at
November's Board of Trustees meet
ing.
The University's divestiture report,
which will discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of Stanford selling
its mure than $90 million of stock in
companies with investments in
South Africa, had originally been
slated for release on Oct. 1.
"We wanted very much," Lyman
said, "and I think everybody con
cerned including the critics of the
University's investment policy
wanted the report done this fall, well
in advance of the time when the fresh
wave of proxy votes will have to be
made so that we wouldn't get these
issues all tangled together."
Lyman said the CIR has worked

slowly on its report with "a lot of
disagreement on it as I can see by
reading the minutes." He said the
committee is going clause-by-clause
and sentence-by-sentence.
Lyman said there is no way to
evade the "difficult" question of di
vestiture, even by abstaining. But he
also added a note of caution when he
said, "If the University begins to de
vote significant resources and time
and energy to try to be an agent of
political change, it's going to lose out
on its primary mission which is edu
cational."
On another topic, Lyman said the
CIA is "reserving the right to deal
with individuals, whetner they work
for the University or not, in their
spare time and as private individuals
without necessarily informing them.
"There's no way to know whether
the CIA is involved in a consulting
relationship with a person who is af
filiated with the University."
In responding to a question of why
Stanford recently released informa
tion on the ClA's MK-ULTRA project
here, Lyman said, "I feel personally
that it is in keeping with the general

spirit of the University to have as
much openness as possible.
"That to receive material from the
CIA and then to say we are very sorry,
you cannot see it, is simply to feed
people's darkest suspicions and to
give advantage to nobody."
Lyman said when the CIA informed
him of the MK-ULTRA project, "It
was all news to me." He said he
asked the CIA if the same type of
research could happen today with
out University administrators know
ing about, and he was told, " 'No, it
could not happen.' "
