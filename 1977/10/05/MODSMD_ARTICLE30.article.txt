# BART hailed as quake predictor

### Kathy Andrews 
Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) may be capable of
more than public transpor
tation. Acgording to Geol
ogy Prof. Anthony Fraser-
Smith, it can also predict
earthquakes.
Fraser-Smith and his col
leagues made their discov
ery while recording ultra
low frequency waves which
originate in the ionosphere.
They first encountered
changes in the ionosphere
during 1971, when the BART
lines were first being used.
Fraser-Smith noted soon
after that the changes coin
cided with BART's regular

schedule. The correlation
between BART's schedule
and the changes in the at
mosphere was obvious, he
said.
"BART has hundreds of
miles of track with a power
ful electric current provided
by a long conductor... we
never used to have any such
level of waves," Fraser-
Smith explained.
BART creates ultra low
frequency waves which
"penetrate deeply into the
earth and seawater,"
Fraser-Smith said. They re
flect like radar off ir
regularities in the earth, in
cluding faults. Reflections

of the waves grow smaller as
stress mounts along the
fault prior to the ear
thquake, he said.
Fraser-Smith said he be
lieves that by setting up de
tecting equipment on the
San Andreas fault,
geophysicists could
monitor it for changes.
The system would be cap
able of detecting signals
over an area extending from
Monterey to Marin County,
and probably over the Sierra
Nevada Mountains. The
exact signal output could be
obtained from the compu
ter running the BART sys
tem.
