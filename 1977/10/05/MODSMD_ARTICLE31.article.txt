Gandhi released after violence
New Delhi, India — A judge freed Indira Gandhi
yesterday after 16 hours in police custody and she
promptly resumed her political comeback cam
paign. But the government appealed to a higher
court and said it would press for her trial on cor
ruption charges.
Demonstrations erupted in more than a dozen
cities as supporters of the 59-year-old former
prime minister protested her arrest.
Tear gas fumes penetrated the packed cour
troom in Delhi as police battled pro- and anti-
Gandhi demonstrators outside.
Police reported 111 arrests and more than 15
injuries at the Parliament Street courthouse and
another violent protest outside the home of Prime
Minister Morarji Desai.
Scattered violence and hundreds of arrests were
reported in other cities.
One of the largest demonstrations was in Cal
cutta, where a leader of Gandhi's Congress party
urged 3000 supporters to launch a campaign of
civil disobedience. He later was detained by
police.
At Madras, authorities halted a demonstration
by taking 1500 Congress party workers into protec
tive custody.
A government source said the ruling political
leadership had pressed for Gandhi's arrest despite
warnings from India's Central Bureau of Investiga
tion that charges and evidence were not ready.
Carter says arms pact close
United Nations, N.Y. — President )immy Carter
told the United Nations yesterday that a new
strategic arms limitation agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union is in sight.
He also said the United States will be willing in
some future treaty tocutits nucleararsenal in half.
"Peace will not be assured until the weapons of
war are put away," the president said.
Cartel had said only last week that there was no
immediate prospect for a new weapons treaty with
the Russians despite "some further progress." The
president also had said after a White House meet
ing last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko that he wouldn't be "optimistic" about
an early settlement.
U.S. officials said some major differences had
been resolved in talks which Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance held here with Gromyko. But they
said there are other differences remaining to be
resolved by negotiations in Geneva.

Soviets have satellite weapon
Washington — The Soviet Union has developed
a satellite-killing weapon that could attack some
U.S. satellites in outer space, Defense Secretary
Harold Brown said yesterday. He said the United
States lacks a similar capability.
Brown's disclosure at a news conference came
as a surprise because U.S. intelligence analysts
have rated most Soviet antisatellite tests as unsuc
cessful since the Russians resumed work on their
system last year.
However, it was learned that in a significant test
on June 17 a Soviet hunter-killer satellite in an
elliptical orbit intercepted a Russian target satellite
for the first time. Experts said this indicates a high
degree of technical sophistication.
Saying the Soviet ability to attack some satellites
is "somewhat troubling," Brown told reporters, "I
hope we can keep space from becoming an area of
active hostilities."
The United States has accelerated research on a
possible satellite-killer system since the Russians
resumed their experiments last year after a five
year lapse.
Poll favors national health plan
Chicago — A pollster who advises President
Jimmy Carter says there is only one program for
which the American public is willing to have its
taxes raised — national health care.
Patrick Caddell said yesterday that support
nationwide for raising taxes for a federal health
care program has increased from 46 per cent in
1975 to 51 per cent in 1977. He said only 16 per cent
favor the current health care delivery system.
Speaking before a symposium on National
Health Care sponsored by Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, Caddell said, "Health care is the exception
to the rule that the public's perception is that the
government is not working well, that it is spending
inefficiently."
Caddell, Carter's official pollster during the
campaign and now an unofficial Carter adviser,
said he expects the president will use data from his
survey to develop a plan that will expand the gov
ernment's role in health care and insurance.
"National health care is perceived by the public
as the last great initiative on the social agenda,"
said Caddell, who is president of Cambridge Sur
vey Research Inc.
Senate ends gas price controls
Washington — The Senate voted yesterday to lift
price controls from newly discovered natural gas,
rejecting President Carter's proposal for con

tinued regulation.
Breaking a 2Vi-week deadlock, the Senate ap
proved the deregulation proposal by a 50 to 46
vote, then went on to pass the overall natural gas
bill by voice vote.
A House-Senate conference committee now
must decide the final form the bill will take. The
House passed a similar measure containing the
president's proposal tor continued price controls.
President )immy Carter previously had said he
would veto a deregulation bill like the one passed
by the Senate.
Deregulation would increase gas prices, with
the cost of immediately deregulated gas rising at a
faster rate than that remaining under federal price
controls. The Senate bill contains a clause that
would require gas pipelines to give homeowners
the first chance to buy the cheaper gas still under
government price controls.
The Senate's action was a major setback to Pres
ident Carter s energy program. But it was expected
after three previous trial votes showed deregula
tion forces had the upper hand.
The vote came a day after a filibuster against
deregulation collapsed. Leaders of the filibuster
accused the White House of abandoning them.
Cal demonstrators acquitted
Berkeley — Eight demonstrators charged with
trespassing in connection with a June sit-in at the
University of California were acquitted yesterday.
A Berkeley Municipal Court jury deliberated
one-hour at the end of a seven-day trial before
acquitting the eight, who were among 56 arrested
in Sproul Hall while protesting university invest
ments in South Africa.
The trial of the 10 other demonstrators ended in
a hung jury Sept. 21. A retrial is scheduled for late
November and three other batches of young
people are still awaiting trial.
Defense attorney Luke Ellis said yesterday he
will move to dismiss all remaining charges.
Defense attorneys argued the demonstrators
had a right to peacefully assemble at Sproul Hall
because they were addressing university business.
The prosecution contended the sit-in was an un
lawful disruption of university activities.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except fog or low clouds
with chance of local drizzle along the coast extend
ing inland night and morning. Cooler days. Lows
in the upper 40s to midsos. Highs both days in the
60s near the coast and 70s to low 80s inland.

Defense attorney Luke Ellis said yesterday he
will move to dismiss all remaining charges.
Defense attorneys argued the demonstrators
had a right to peacefully assemble at Sproul Hall
because they were addressing university business.
The prosecution contended the sit-in was an un
lawful disruption of university activities.
Today's weather

Gandhi released after violence
New Delhi, India — A judge freed Indira Gandhi
yesterday after 16 hours in police custody and she
promptly resumed her political comeback cam
paign. But the government appealed to a higher
court and said it would press for her trial on cor
ruption charges.
Demonstrations erupted in more than a dozen
cities as supporters of the 59-year-old former
prime minister protested her arrest.
Tear gas fumes penetrated the packed cour
troom in Delhi as police battled pro- and anti-
Gandhi demonstrators outside.
Police reported 111 arrests and more than 15
injuries at the Parliament Street courthouse and
another violent protest outside the home of Prime
Minister Morarji Desai.
Scattered violence and hundreds of arrests were
reported in other cities.
One of the largest demonstrations was in Cal
cutta, where a leader of Gandhi's Congress party
urged 3000 supporters to launch a campaign of
civil disobedience. He later was detained by
police.
At Madras, authorities halted a demonstration
by taking 1500 Congress party workers into protec
tive custody.
A government source said the ruling political
leadership had pressed for Gandhi's arrest despite
warnings from India's Central Bureau of Investiga
tion that charges and evidence were not ready.
Carter says arms pact close
United Nations, N.Y. — President )immy Carter
told the United Nations yesterday that a new
strategic arms limitation agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union is in sight.
He also said the United States will be willing in
some future treaty tocutits nucleararsenal in half.
"Peace will not be assured until the weapons of
war are put away," the president said.
Cartel had said only last week that there was no
immediate prospect for a new weapons treaty with
the Russians despite "some further progress." The
president also had said after a White House meet
ing last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko that he wouldn't be "optimistic" about
an early settlement.
U.S. officials said some major differences had
been resolved in talks which Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance held here with Gromyko. But they
said there are other differences remaining to be
resolved by negotiations in Geneva.

Soviets have satellite weapon
Washington — The Soviet Union has developed
a satellite-killing weapon that could attack some
U.S. satellites in outer space, Defense Secretary
Harold Brown said yesterday. He said the United
States lacks a similar capability.
Brown's disclosure at a news conference came
as a surprise because U.S. intelligence analysts
have rated most Soviet antisatellite tests as unsuc
cessful since the Russians resumed work on their
system last year.
However, it was learned that in a significant test
on June 17 a Soviet hunter-killer satellite in an
elliptical orbit intercepted a Russian target satellite
for the first time. Experts said this indicates a high
degree of technical sophistication.
Saying the Soviet ability to attack some satellites
is "somewhat troubling," Brown told reporters, "I
hope we can keep space from becoming an area of
active hostilities."
The United States has accelerated research on a
possible satellite-killer system since the Russians
resumed their experiments last year after a five
year lapse.
Poll favors national health plan
Chicago — A pollster who advises President
Jimmy Carter says there is only one program for
which the American public is willing to have its
taxes raised — national health care.
Patrick Caddell said yesterday that support
nationwide for raising taxes for a federal health
care program has increased from 46 per cent in
1975 to 51 per cent in 1977. He said only 16 per cent
favor the current health care delivery system.
Speaking before a symposium on National
Health Care sponsored by Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, Caddell said, "Health care is the exception
to the rule that the public's perception is that the
government is not working well, that it is spending
inefficiently."
Caddell, Carter's official pollster during the
campaign and now an unofficial Carter adviser,
said he expects the president will use data from his
survey to develop a plan that will expand the gov
ernment's role in health care and insurance.
"National health care is perceived by the public
as the last great initiative on the social agenda,"
said Caddell, who is president of Cambridge Sur

Senate ends gas price controls
Washington — The Senate voted yesterday to lift
price controls from newly discovered natural gas,
rejecting President Carter's proposal for con

tinued regulation.
Breaking a 2Vi-week deadlock, the Senate ap
proved the deregulation proposal by a 50 to 46
vote, then went on to pass the overall natural gas
bill by voice vote.
A House-Senate conference committee now
must decide the final form the bill will take. The
House passed a similar measure containing the
president's proposal tor continued price controls.
President )immy Carter previously had said he
would veto a deregulation bill like the one passed
by the Senate.
Deregulation would increase gas prices, with
the cost of immediately deregulated gas rising at a
faster rate than that remaining under federal price
controls. The Senate bill contains a clause that
would require gas pipelines to give homeowners
the first chance to buy the cheaper gas still under
government price controls.
The Senate's action was a major setback to Pres
ident Carter s energy program. But it was expected
after three previous trial votes showed deregula
tion forces had the upper hand.
The vote came a day after a filibuster against
deregulation collapsed. Leaders of the filibuster
accused the White House of abandoning them.
Cal demonstrators acquitted
Berkeley — Eight demonstrators charged with
trespassing in connection with a June sit-in at the
University of California were acquitted yesterday.
A Berkeley Municipal Court jury deliberated
one-hour at the end of a seven-day trial before
acquitting the eight, who were among 56 arrested
in Sproul Hall while protesting university invest
ments in South Africa.
The trial of the 10 other demonstrators ended in
a hung jury Sept. 21. A retrial is scheduled for late
November and three other batches of young
people are still awaiting trial.
Defense attorney Luke Ellis said yesterday he
will move to dismiss all remaining charges.

Cal demonstrators acquitted
Berkeley — Eight demonstrators charged with
trespassing in connection with a June sit-in at the
University of California were acquitted yesterday.
A Berkeley Municipal Court jury deliberated
one-hour at the end of a seven-day trial before
acquitting the eight, who were among 56 arrested
in Sproul Hall while protesting university invest
ments in South Africa.
The trial of the 10 other demonstrators ended in
a hung jury Sept. 21. A retrial is scheduled for late
November and three other batches of young
people are still awaiting trial.
Defense attorney Luke Ellis said yesterday he
will move to dismiss all remaining charges.
Defense attorneys argued the demonstrators
had a right to peacefully assemble at Sproul Hall
because they were addressing university business.
The prosecution contended the sit-in was an un
lawful disruption of university activities.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except fog or low clouds
with chance of local drizzle along the coast extend
ing inland night and morning. Cooler days. Lows
in the upper 40s to midsos. Highs both days in the
60s near the coast and 70s to low 80s inland.
Gandhi released after violence
New Delhi, India — A judge freed Indira Gandhi
yesterday after 16 hours in police custody and she
promptly resumed her political comeback cam
paign. But the government appealed to a higher
court and said it would press for her trial on cor
ruption charges.
Demonstrations erupted in more than a dozen
cities as supporters of the 59-year-old former
prime minister protested her arrest.
Tear gas fumes penetrated the packed cour
troom in Delhi as police battled pro- and anti-
Gandhi demonstrators outside.
Police reported 111 arrests and more than 15
injuries at the Parliament Street courthouse and
another violent protest outside the home of Prime
Minister Morarji Desai.
Scattered violence and hundreds of arrests were
reported in other cities.
One of the largest demonstrations was in Cal
cutta, where a leader of Gandhi's Congress party
urged 3000 supporters to launch a campaign of
civil disobedience. He later was detained by
police.
At Madras, authorities halted a demonstration
by taking 1500 Congress party workers into protec
tive custody.
A government source said the ruling political
leadership had pressed for Gandhi's arrest despite
warnings from India's Central Bureau of Investiga
tion that charges and evidence were not ready.
Carter says arms pact close
United Nations, N.Y. — President )immy Carter
told the United Nations yesterday that a new
strategic arms limitation agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union is in sight.
He also said the United States will be willing in
some future treaty tocutits nucleararsenal in half.
"Peace will not be assured until the weapons of
war are put away," the president said.
Cartel had said only last week that there was no
immediate prospect for a new weapons treaty with
the Russians despite "some further progress." The
president also had said after a White House meet
ing last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko that he wouldn't be "optimistic" about
an early settlement.
U.S. officials said some major differences had
been resolved in talks which Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance held here with Gromyko. But they
said there are other differences remaining to be
resolved by negotiations in Geneva.

Soviets have satellite weapon
Washington — The Soviet Union has developed
a satellite-killing weapon that could attack some
U.S. satellites in outer space, Defense Secretary
Harold Brown said yesterday. He said the United
States lacks a similar capability.
Brown's disclosure at a news conference came
as a surprise because U.S. intelligence analysts
have rated most Soviet antisatellite tests as unsuc
cessful since the Russians resumed work on their
system last year.
However, it was learned that in a significant test
on June 17 a Soviet hunter-killer satellite in an
elliptical orbit intercepted a Russian target satellite
for the first time. Experts said this indicates a high
degree of technical sophistication.
Saying the Soviet ability to attack some satellites
is "somewhat troubling," Brown told reporters, "I
hope we can keep space from becoming an area of
active hostilities."
The United States has accelerated research on a
possible satellite-killer system since the Russians
resumed their experiments last year after a five
year lapse.
Poll favors national health plan
Chicago — A pollster who advises President
Jimmy Carter says there is only one program for
which the American public is willing to have its
taxes raised — national health care.
Patrick Caddell said yesterday that support
nationwide for raising taxes for a federal health
care program has increased from 46 per cent in
1975 to 51 per cent in 1977. He said only 16 per cent
favor the current health care delivery system.
Speaking before a symposium on National
Health Care sponsored by Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, Caddell said, "Health care is the exception
to the rule that the public's perception is that the
government is not working well, that it is spending
inefficiently."
Caddell, Carter's official pollster during the
campaign and now an unofficial Carter adviser,
said he expects the president will use data from his
survey to develop a plan that will expand the gov
ernment's role in health care and insurance.
"National health care is perceived by the public
as the last great initiative on the social agenda,"
said Caddell, who is president of Cambridge Sur
vey Research Inc.
Senate ends gas price controls
Washington — The Senate voted yesterday to lift
price controls from newly discovered natural gas,
rejecting President Carter's proposal for con

tinued regulation.
Breaking a 2Vi-week deadlock, the Senate ap
proved the deregulation proposal by a 50 to 46
vote, then went on to pass the overall natural gas
bill by voice vote.
A House-Senate conference committee now
must decide the final form the bill will take. The
House passed a similar measure containing the
president's proposal tor continued price controls.
President )immy Carter previously had said he
would veto a deregulation bill like the one passed
by the Senate.
Deregulation would increase gas prices, with
the cost of immediately deregulated gas rising at a
faster rate than that remaining under federal price
controls. The Senate bill contains a clause that
would require gas pipelines to give homeowners
the first chance to buy the cheaper gas still under
government price controls.
The Senate's action was a major setback to Pres
ident Carter s energy program. But it was expected
after three previous trial votes showed deregula
tion forces had the upper hand.
The vote came a day after a filibuster against
deregulation collapsed. Leaders of the filibuster
accused the White House of abandoning them.
