Three social science departments
will probably have to stiffen theii
bachelor's degree requirements this
quarter to conform to Faculty Senate
guidelines, according to Halsey
Royden, dean of humanities and sci
ences.
The Daily reported on Sept. 30 that
the Economics Department had al
ready tightened up its degree re
quirements. Royden said, though,
that political science, psychology
and sociology will probably also be
affected by the Faculty Senate stan
dards.
