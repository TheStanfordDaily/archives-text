# Frat, co-op rent hike viewed

Fraternities and co-ops are paying increased room
rental rates this year as a result of a University decision
made last spring to use room fees for financing residen
tial education programs.
The increased rate of $108 annually per person per
house is intended to cover the cost for house associates
(RAs) and the Row Housing Office.
The feeling at several fraternities, though, is that RAs
are not really necessary.
"It's a different subject in the fraternities because RAs
don't perform the same functions as they do in a dorm,"
said Reed Butler, president of the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil (IFC).
"We have our own officers to take care of most of the
activities that RAs in dorms would normally handle. The
RA is basically just a liaison between the frat and the
University," Butler added.
Dan Livingston, a member of Sigma Chi fraternity,
voiced a similar opinion.
"We've always felt that the president of the house is
responsible, so we can't understand why we have to pay
room and board for a second person to be responsible.

We're paying for the same thing twice," he remarked.
According to Richard Highfield, assistant to the direc
tor of University housing, the fact that frats do not have
the same need for residential education programs was
"taken into consideration" when the rate increase was
discussed.
"The basic rationale," explained Highfield, "is that it
costs more to give residential education to freshmen
and we spend more per student in his freshman year."
To be fair, he said, "we charge everyone the same
amount for their three years of guaranteed housing so
the cost averages out over the three years."
Highfield added that this policy is in agreement with
"the idea of freedom of choice within this University.
Students shouldn't have to select a place to live based on
how much it will cost."
Money for the residential education programs used to
come out of a general fund from tuition, said Highfield.
Within the last couple of years the University has
changed this policy.
Officials believe that only those students who live in
University housing and benefit from the residential edu
cation programs should be paying for them.
