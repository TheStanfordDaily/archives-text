# Maddy runs for governor's post
## 
### Ali Webb 
"The Republican Party is looking
for a Ronald Reagan to ride in off the
plains and they aren't sure that any of
the present primary candidates can
do the job," stated Ken Maddy, a
new face in the 1978 gubernatorial
race. Maddy spoke to a small group
at the Oak Creek Club House in Palo
Alto yesterday.
Maddy, a virtual unknown at this
point in the primary race, is a 43 year
old, fourth-term Republican assemb
lyman from a 68 per cent Democratic
district in the Fresno area.
Maddy calls himself a moderate
Republican. His opposition to the
Briggs initiative that would mandate
the firing of all known or suspected
homosexual teachers is reflective of
his relatively liberal voting record.
"I feel that we have sufficient laws
on the books to protect our children
against homosexual or heterosexual
attacks," he stated.
Evelle Younger will be the candi
date to beat because of his wide ex
posure to the voters, Maddy said.
Maddy faces three other contenders
for the nomination: Los Angeles

Police Chief Ed Davis, San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson and State Senator
John Briggs of Fullerton.
In order to wage the most effective
primary campaign, Maddy has en
gaged a media consultant firm from
Washington, D.C.
"If you are running against the
odds, you make it up with hard
work," Maddy stated.
He admitted he is facing an uphill
race based on lack of public recogni
tion of his name. "I expect to rank
near the bottom in the next poll on
name recognition but the poll should
also show a high degree of accepta
bility to those individuals that know
my name," he explained.
In an effort to close this gap,
Maddy has already raised $600,000,
largely from agricultural interests.
"We expect to raise one million by
Jan. 1," Maddy said.
"The party is looking for a winner
who can attract Democratic voters,
stand up to Jerry Brown and also ad
dress the issues that Californians
deem pressing," said Maddy. His
campaign slogan, 'Ken Maddy — A

Winning Republican' expresses his
confidence in filling the party's bill.
"When I was first elected to the
Assembly, there were 37 Republi
cans. Now there are 23. All the Re
publicans could go home and it
would not have any effect on the
working of the legislature," Maddy
commented when asked his motiva
tion for running.
In response to questions, Maddy
spoke at length about Jerry Brown's
performance as governor.
"Jerry's problems are twofold: his
own lack of experience and his fai
lure to seek out expertise in his ap
pointments. Jerry is most vulnerable
on the issue of the economy," he
said.
"There is a basic attitudinal change
in Californian politics with regard to
Jerry Brown. The mystique is gone,"
he observed. Maddy said the public
is looking for a return to normalcy
and is no longer interested in leaders
who sleep on the floor and drive
Plymouths.
"Yes I would live in the mansion,"
he said.

In an effort to close this gap,
Maddy has already raised $600,000,
largely from agricultural interests.
"We expect to raise one million by
Jan. 1," Maddy said.
"The party is looking for a winner
who can attract Democratic voters,
stand up to Jerry Brown and also ad
dress the issues that Californians
deem pressing," said Maddy. His
campaign slogan, 'Ken Maddy — A

Winning Republican' expresses his
confidence in filling the party's bill.
"When I was first elected to the
Assembly, there were 37 Republi
cans. Now there are 23. All the Re
publicans could go home and it
would not have any effect on the
working of the legislature," Maddy
commented when asked his motiva
tion for running.
In response to questions, Maddy
spoke at length about Jerry Brown's
performance as governor.
"Jerry's problems are twofold: his
own lack of experience and his fai
lure to seek out expertise in his ap
pointments. Jerry is most vulnerable
on the issue of the economy," he
said.
"There is a basic attitudinal change
in Californian politics with regard to
Jerry Brown. The mystique is gone,"
he observed. Maddy said the public
is looking for a return to normalcy
and is no longer interested in leaders
who sleep on the floor and drive
Plymouths.
"Yes I would live in the mansion,"
he said.

Ken Maddy, a Republican assemblyman running for the 1978 Republican guber
natorial nomination, spoke yesterday in Palo Alto. Maddy voiced bis opposition to
the Briggs initiative, which is directed against gay teachers.
"The Republican Party is looking
for a Ronald Reagan to ride in off the
plains and they aren't sure that any of
the present primary candidates can
do the job," stated Ken Maddy, a
new face in the 1978 gubernatorial
race. Maddy spoke to a small group
at the Oak Creek Club House in Palo
Alto yesterday.
Maddy, a virtual unknown at this
point in the primary race, is a 43 year
old, fourth-term Republican assemb
lyman from a 68 per cent Democratic
district in the Fresno area.
Maddy calls himself a moderate
Republican. His opposition to the
Briggs initiative that would mandate
the firing of all known or suspected
homosexual teachers is reflective of
his relatively liberal voting record.
"I feel that we have sufficient laws
on the books to protect our children
against homosexual or heterosexual
attacks," he stated.
Evelle Younger will be the candi
date to beat because of his wide ex
posure to the voters, Maddy said.
Maddy faces three other contenders
for the nomination: Los Angeles

Police Chief Ed Davis, San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson and State Senator
John Briggs of Fullerton.
In order to wage the most effective
primary campaign, Maddy has en
gaged a media consultant firm from
Washington, D.C.
"If you are running against the
odds, you make it up with hard
work," Maddy stated.
He admitted he is facing an uphill
race based on lack of public recogni
tion of his name. "I expect to rank
near the bottom in the next poll on
name recognition but the poll should
also show a high degree of accepta
bility to those individuals that know
my name," he explained.
