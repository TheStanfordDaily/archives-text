# University wins decision in USE membership case
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) recently ruled in favor
of the University in two separate
labor relations cases brought before
it this past summer.
The University was notified last
week that an NLRB board backed a
decision handed down in June by an
administrative law judge who or
dered United Stanford Employees
(USE) to "cease and desist" in its ef
forts to force Stanford workers to be
come full USE members.
In a second case the NLRB found
that the University "acted lawfully"
in reclassifying certain computer
operators as computer operator
leaders.
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy said he was
"pleased" with the NLRB's ruling.
USE President Anne Schlagenhaft
was not available for comment last
night.
In Judge Herrold Shapiro's original
ruling, USE was found guilty of dis
tributing notices to newly hired

employes, demanding that they join
the union, and of filing a lawsuit
against three other employes who re
fused to join the union.
Both actions violate a section of
the National Labor Relations Act,
ruled Shapiro.
The case came before Shapiro as a
result of the filing of an unfair labor
practice charge against USE by the
University in spring 1976.
The seven-man NLRB affirmed
Shapiro's decision as well as addi
tional grounds alleging unlawful ac
tivity filed against USE by the regional
office of the NLRB during its original
investigatipn.
"The implied threat of job loss if
employes withdraw from full mem
bership in (USE) constitutes as great a
restraint on employes' exercise of
statutory rights as the implied threat
of job loss if the employes do not
become full members," the board
said.
"In either case, the threat of ad
verse job action is implicit in the
statement that full membership is a
condition of employment."
The NLRB ordered USE to post
notices at its business offices and
elsewhere for a period of 60 days stat
ing that workers are not required to
sign membership applications or
take an oath of membership "or that
they are required to perform any ob
ligation of union membership other
than the tender of periodic dues and
initiation fees."
The notices further state that USE
cannot refuse to accept the resigna
tions of employes "on the grounds
thatfull membershipinourunion isa
condition of employment."
In the second case, the NLRB re
fused to issue a complaint against the
University, concluding that Stanford
"acted lawfully" in reclassifying cer

tain computer operators as compu
ter employes.
In a letter to the University and
USE, NLRB regional director Michael
Taylor said the collective bargaining
agreement "gives the employer the
right to make such reclassifications
subject only to review by the classifi
cation committee, a body created by
the agreement, and ultimately the
grievance and arbitration proce
dures."
"Inasmuch as the employer's ac
tions were in accord with the agree
ment, the burden of establishing a
refusal to bargain in good faith with
the union could not be met."
"Moreover, there is basis for con
cluding that the employer attempted
to negotiate directly with employes
over the issue. I am therefore refus
ing to issue a complaint in this mat
ter."
Three USE members were sus
pended for a total of four days in July
for refusing to accept the reclassifica
tion, according to Jim Berk, former
USE president.
Operations at Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and the Stanford
Center for Information Processing,
where the reclassifications took
place, have proceeded normally
since the "initial difficulties," ac
cording to Priscilla Wheeler, assis
tant staff counsel in the office of the
vice-president of business and fi
nance.
It is not known whether USE in
tends to appeal the decision before
an Oct. 5 deadline.
USE filed a suit against the Univer
sity Sept. 14 alleging a breach of the
collective bargaining agreement by
the reclassification of computer
operators.
