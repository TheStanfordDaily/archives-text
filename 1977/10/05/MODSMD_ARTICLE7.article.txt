# After five requests, trustees have yet to include a student
## 
### Peter Brett News Analysis 
On a Tuesday afternoon last April,
more than 100 demonstrators
gathered outside a handcuffed door
of the Center for Educational Re
search at Stanford, asking to send
representatives into a Board of Trus
tees meeting in the building.
Administrators refused the de
mand, offering instead to deliver
messages to the trustees.
That same month, students at
othe r campuses had another way to
deliver messages to their trustees.
They could vote at board meetings —
one of these schools' trustees was a
student.
The idea of a student trustee is no
thing new here. According to Steve
Westly, ASSU co-president, five
proposals have been submitted in
the last 10 years which called for a
student trustee. All have been re
jected.
Rejections
Westly said he is considering mak
ing a sixth proposal this year. Such a
move would come after the intense
campus interest sparked last spring
by the way trustees made certain in
vestment decisions for the Univer
sity.

Westly said he believed past plans
for a student trustee here have been
rejected for several reasons. First, he
said he has been told confidential
matters are often discussed in the
executive meetings which the board
members might not want generally
known.
Second, he remarked, students
are said to have an inherent conflict
of interests. The students are too in
volved in the school now, and would
not tend to be so long-sighted as the
trustees. Furthermore, he said, it is
claimed that students' views tend to
be more temporal — radical some
years and conservative others. Fi
nally, Westly said he has been told
that if the board lets in a student, it
might have to let in a faculty member
and then representatives of all seg
ments of the school in a never
ending progression.
Westly has given serious thought
to submitting his own proposition to
get a student on the board of trus
tees, he said. Westly said he has
talked to Peter Bing, chairman of the
board, who said he should consider
presenting his proposition, and to
President Richard Lyman and provost
William Miller, both of whom felt he
should not submit his proposal,

Westly said.
Westly added, "If I see enough
student support of a proposition to
get students on the board of trus
tees, such as a lot of phone calls, I
will submit the proposal."
Different league
While there are no students on the
board of trustees here, several stu
dents serve on various trustee com
mittees. This is hardly on a league
with student representation at other
schools, though.
According to a survey of about 80
schools by john McDaniel, student
body vice president at the University
of Cincinnati and one of the two un
dergraduate representatives, one
fourth of the schools have students
who vote on the boards of trustees,
one-half have non-voting students
on the boards, and about one-fourth
have no representation.
At Oregon State University, for
example, two students serve on the
State Board of Higher Education.
Each of the seven institutions in the
state system nominates one student
for every 5000 students. The list of
nominees is then submitted to the
governor for appointment.
This system came about in 1973 by
legislative action in Oregon. Accord
ing to Stan McCehee, Oregon State
student body president, several in
stitutions lobbied for the bill. The
main reasoning was that
businessmen on the State Board of
Higher Education had a conflict of
interests, he said. "Students are the
biggest part of their education; they
should decide where their money is
spent," said McCehee.
Active students
The present system is working
"very well," according to McGehee.
"The students are taking an active
role and using their full rights. There
are no problems with the board
members, and the students are
treated well."
McCehee also said he feels that
two students out of a total of 11
members is enough representation.
Not all universities are content
with even a full voting student on the
board, however. The University of
Massachusetts at Amherst elects two
co-presidents; one is the acting pres
ident and the other serves as a trus
tee.
But Brian DeLima, the Speaker of
the 123-member student senate,
says,"The (student) trustees are not
worthwhile. The students must have
an independent role from the uni
versity. That's the only way to have
control over services, our academic
programs and our lives."
DeLima adds, "What we have here
is not a real government. They give
us representation on the board of
trustees, but not the ability to decide
anything. Having student trustees
doesn't change much. We need to
change the structure. One vote
doesn't change the power relation
ship."
Cincinnati
A large number of universities
have students who are allowed to sit
on the board of trustees, but the stu
dents are not given the right to vote.
Each year at the University of Cincin
nati, the newly-elected president
and vice president of the student
body automatically become non
voting members of the board.
The program was initiated six years
ago when there was a major re
organization of the student govern
ment. Now two undergraduates, one
graduate student and one faculty
member sit on the board with the
nine regular trustees.
McDaniel said, "We actively re
flect student concerns, although
there are some segments of the stu
dent population that wouldn't agree
with this."

An example of significant student
input on the board was in the area of
the budget, he said. At the University
of Cincinnati the organization in
charge of student affairs was facing a
budget cut by one-half on the julv 1
budget proposal, he said.
The student representatives
helped redesign the budget and
pushed through approval of most of
the areas that they felt should not be
cut.

will submit the proposal."
Different league
While there are no students on the
board of trustees here, several stu
dents serve on various trustee com
mittees. This is hardly on a league
with student representation at other
schools, though.
According to a survey of about 80
schools by john McDaniel, student
body vice president at the University
of Cincinnati and one of the two un
dergraduate representatives, one
fourth of the schools have students
who vote on the boards of trustees,
one-half have non-voting students
on the boards, and about one-fourth
have no representation.
At Oregon State University, for
example, two students serve on the
State Board of Higher Education.
Each of the seven institutions in the
state system nominates one student
for every 5000 students. The list of
nominees is then submitted to the
governor for appointment.
This system came about in 1973 by
legislative action in Oregon. Accord
ing to Stan McCehee, Oregon State
student body president, several in
stitutions lobbied for the bill. The
main reasoning was that
businessmen on the State Board of
Higher Education had a conflict of
interests, he said. "Students are the
biggest part of their education; they
should decide where their money is
spent," said McCehee.
Active students
The present system is working
"very well," according to McGehee.
"The students are taking an active
role and using their full rights. There
are no problems with the board
members, and the students are
treated well."
McCehee also said he feels that
two students out of a total of 11
members is enough representation.
Not all universities are content
with even a full voting student on the
board, however. The University of
Massachusetts at Amherst elects two
co-presidents; one is the acting pres
ident and the other serves as a trus
tee.
But Brian DeLima, the Speaker of
the 123-member student senate,
says,"The (student) trustees are not
worthwhile. The students must have
an independent role from the uni
versity. That's the only way to have
control over services, our academic
programs and our lives."
DeLima adds, "What we have here
is not a real government. They give
us representation on the board of
trustees, but not the ability to decide
anything. Having student trustees
doesn't change much. We need to
change the structure. One vote
doesn't change the power relation
ship."
Cincinnati
A large number of universities
have students who are allowed to sit
on the board of trustees, but the stu
dents are not given the right to vote.
Each year at the University of Cincin
nati, the newly-elected president
and vice president of the student
body automatically become non
voting members of the board.
The program was initiated six years
ago when there was a major re
organization of the student govern
ment. Now two undergraduates, one
graduate student and one faculty
member sit on the board with the
nine regular trustees.
McDaniel said, "We actively re
flect student concerns, although
there are some segments of the stu
dent population that wouldn't agree
with this."

An example of significant student
input on the board was in the area of
the budget, he said. At the University
of Cincinnati the organization in
charge of student affairs was facing a
budget cut by one-half on the julv 1
budget proposal, he said.
The student representatives
helped redesign the budget and
pushed through approval of most of
the areas that they felt should not be
cut.
On a Tuesday afternoon last April,
more than 100 demonstrators
gathered outside a handcuffed door
of the Center for Educational Re
search at Stanford, asking to send
representatives into a Board of Trus
tees meeting in the building.
Administrators refused the de
mand, offering instead to deliver
messages to the trustees.
That same month, students at
othe r campuses had another way to
deliver messages to their trustees.
They could vote at board meetings —
one of these schools' trustees was a
student.
The idea of a student trustee is no
thing new here. According to Steve
Westly, ASSU co-president, five
proposals have been submitted in
the last 10 years which called for a
student trustee. All have been re
jected.
Rejections
Westly said he is considering mak
ing a sixth proposal this year. Such a
move would come after the intense
campus interest sparked last spring
by the way trustees made certain in
vestment decisions for the Univer
sity.

Westly said he believed past plans
for a student trustee here have been
rejected for several reasons. First, he
said he has been told confidential
matters are often discussed in the
executive meetings which the board
members might not want generally
known.
Second, he remarked, students
are said to have an inherent conflict
of interests. The students are too in
volved in the school now, and would
not tend to be so long-sighted as the
trustees. Furthermore, he said, it is
claimed that students' views tend to
be more temporal — radical some
years and conservative others. Fi
nally, Westly said he has been told
that if the board lets in a student, it
might have to let in a faculty member
and then representatives of all seg
ments of the school in a never
ending progression.
Westly has given serious thought
to submitting his own proposition to
get a student on the board of trus
tees, he said. Westly said he has
talked to Peter Bing, chairman of the
board, who said he should consider
presenting his proposition, and to
President Richard Lyman and provost
William Miller, both of whom felt he
should not submit his proposal,

Westly said.
Westly added, "If I see enough
student support of a proposition to
get students on the board of trus

will submit the proposal."

anything. Having student trustees
doesn't change much. We need to
change the structure. One vote
doesn't change the power relation
ship."
Cincinnati
A large number of universities
have students who are allowed to sit
on the board of trustees, but the stu
dents are not given the right to vote.
Each year at the University of Cincin
nati, the newly-elected president
and vice president of the student
body automatically become non
voting members of the board.
The program was initiated six years
ago when there was a major re
organization of the student govern
ment. Now two undergraduates, one
graduate student and one faculty
member sit on the board with the
nine regular trustees.
McDaniel said, "We actively re
flect student concerns, although
there are some segments of the stu
dent population that wouldn't agree
with this."

An example of significant student
input on the board was in the area of
the budget, he said. At the University
of Cincinnati the organization in
charge of student affairs was facing a
budget cut by one-half on the julv 1
budget proposal, he said.
The student representatives
helped redesign the budget and
pushed through approval of most of
the areas that they felt should not be
cut.
On a Tuesday afternoon last April,
more than 100 demonstrators
gathered outside a handcuffed door
of the Center for Educational Re
search at Stanford, asking to send
representatives into a Board of Trus
tees meeting in the building.
Administrators refused the de
mand, offering instead to deliver
messages to the trustees.
That same month, students at
othe r campuses had another way to
deliver messages to their trustees.
They could vote at board meetings —
one of these schools' trustees was a
student.
The idea of a student trustee is no
thing new here. According to Steve
Westly, ASSU co-president, five
proposals have been submitted in
the last 10 years which called for a
student trustee. All have been re
jected.
Rejections
Westly said he is considering mak
ing a sixth proposal this year. Such a
move would come after the intense
campus interest sparked last spring
by the way trustees made certain in
vestment decisions for the Univer
sity.

Westly said he believed past plans
for a student trustee here have been
rejected for several reasons. First, he
said he has been told confidential
matters are often discussed in the
executive meetings which the board
members might not want generally
known.
Second, he remarked, students
are said to have an inherent conflict
of interests. The students are too in
volved in the school now, and would
not tend to be so long-sighted as the
trustees. Furthermore, he said, it is
claimed that students' views tend to
be more temporal — radical some
years and conservative others. Fi
nally, Westly said he has been told
that if the board lets in a student, it
might have to let in a faculty member
and then representatives of all seg
ments of the school in a never
ending progression.
Westly has given serious thought
to submitting his own proposition to
get a student on the board of trus
tees, he said. Westly said he has
talked to Peter Bing, chairman of the
board, who said he should consider
presenting his proposition, and to
President Richard Lyman and provost
William Miller, both of whom felt he
should not submit his proposal,

Westly said.
Westly added, "If I see enough
student support of a proposition to
get students on the board of trus
tees, such as a lot of phone calls, I
will submit the proposal."
Different league
While there are no students on the
board of trustees here, several stu
dents serve on various trustee com
mittees. This is hardly on a league
with student representation at other
schools, though.
According to a survey of about 80
schools by john McDaniel, student
body vice president at the University
of Cincinnati and one of the two un
dergraduate representatives, one
fourth of the schools have students
who vote on the boards of trustees,
one-half have non-voting students
on the boards, and about one-fourth
have no representation.
At Oregon State University, for
example, two students serve on the
State Board of Higher Education.
Each of the seven institutions in the
state system nominates one student
for every 5000 students. The list of
nominees is then submitted to the
governor for appointment.
This system came about in 1973 by
legislative action in Oregon. Accord
ing to Stan McCehee, Oregon State
student body president, several in
stitutions lobbied for the bill. The
main reasoning was that
businessmen on the State Board of
Higher Education had a conflict of
interests, he said. "Students are the
biggest part of their education; they
should decide where their money is
spent," said McCehee.
Active students
The present system is working
"very well," according to McGehee.
"The students are taking an active
role and using their full rights. There
are no problems with the board
members, and the students are
treated well."
McCehee also said he feels that
two students out of a total of 11
members is enough representation.
Not all universities are content
with even a full voting student on the
board, however. The University of
Massachusetts at Amherst elects two
co-presidents; one is the acting pres
ident and the other serves as a trus
tee.
But Brian DeLima, the Speaker of
the 123-member student senate,
says,"The (student) trustees are not
worthwhile. The students must have
an independent role from the uni
versity. That's the only way to have
control over services, our academic
programs and our lives."
DeLima adds, "What we have here
is not a real government. They give
us representation on the board of
trustees, but not the ability to decide
anything. Having student trustees
doesn't change much. We need to
change the structure. One vote
doesn't change the power relation
ship."
