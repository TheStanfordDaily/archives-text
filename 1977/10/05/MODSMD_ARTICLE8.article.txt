# Research in severe trouble

"Smith slowly pushed the door open. The dust swirled
into miniature gray clouds sweeping along the old panel
floor. Through the gloom Smith thought he saw little
creatures, alarmed by his presence, scurrying for cover.
The only light in the room came from a small single
window, almost opaque with grime and soot. His eyes
adjusting to the murk, Smith looked around and found
an amazing assortment of objects dotting the walls:
there were dinosaur bones, shrunken heads, stuffed
koala bears, stacks of insects, and rock collections. In
the middle of the room there was a long, cluttered table.
The table and the objects on it were too covered with
dust to be distinct in color or shape. Slumped over the
table, with a thin coat of dust upon him, lay a man
wearing the emblem of his trade: a white lab coat.
" 'Ah,' said Smith, 'this must be the research depart
ment."
Sadly, research, and particularly basic research, is in
severe trouble. Federal expenditures for basic research
has declined (in real terms) steadily for the past decade:
the period 1970-7f> saw a drop of almost 22 per cent.
Industry has not done its part either. At one time,
basic research was comparatively well supported in in
dustry; however, according to those involved, there has
been a sharp decrease in long-term support of funda
mental work.
This is unfortunate. While it may not seem like basic
research projects such as discovering what sort of lice
inhabit bats' armpits, or a study of lunar petrology, will
affect any of directly, historically it seems we never have
been able to predict what sort of discoveries could be
useful. Indeed, it seems to me that most of the more
significant discoveries have been totally accidental
(radioactivity, x-rays, penicillin, etc.). Put concisely, I
suppose one could say much great discovery is seren-

dipitous.
"Ah, but that was oh, so long ago. Surely because we
are ever so modern in 1977, that sort of discovery is no
longer needed. Why spend money on something
nebulous, when you can spend it on more specific
applied research?" ask the less Socratic of the readers.
Well, perhaps we are still in need of basic building
blocks of knowledge. Several members of Carter's
Council of Economic Advisors have related the decline
of American productivity since 1953 to the decreased
emphasis on basic research. Many others feel that this
underemphasis is causing an erosion of the United
States' lead in high technology products.
Thus, it would seem from the miniscule amount I have
looked into the subject that perhaps more emphasis
(such as dollars) is due. I add that this does not mean
government dollars. Government funding has been
fairly destructive in the past. As one Mr. Abelson, editor
of Science magazine, has had occasion to observe,
federal support has been remarkably erratic — wiping
out projects as interest lags, smothering others with
money and demands for results as they grow fashiona
ble. This has also hurt private research and the morale
and recruiting of talent.
The solution? Well, I, unlike many others, know the
answer: Wipe out the federal government. Exterminate
it! Hang all politicans and bureaucrats from the nearest
AT&T telephone pole. Revolution in the street!(tantrum
continues for a short while. . . .)
In any event, consensus does seem to be to let private
business take care of the problem by giving tax breaks.
This seems reasonable and ought to insure some con
tinuity. It also has the advantage of making research less
political, perhaps even more productive.

floor. Through the gloom Smith thought he saw little
creatures, alarmed by his presence, scurrying for cover.
The only light in the room came from a small single
window, almost opaque with grime and soot. His eyes
adjusting to the murk, Smith looked around and found
an amazing assortment of objects dotting the walls:
there were dinosaur bones, shrunken heads, stuffed
koala bears, stacks of insects, and rock collections. In
the middle of the room there was a long, cluttered table.
The table and the objects on it were too covered with
dust to be distinct in color or shape. Slumped over the
table, with a thin coat of dust upon him, lay a man
wearing the emblem of his trade: a white lab coat.
" 'Ah,' said Smith, 'this must be the research depart
ment."
Sadly, research, and particularly basic research, is in
severe trouble. Federal expenditures for basic research
has declined (in real terms) steadily for the past decade:
the period 1970-7f> saw a drop of almost 22 per cent.
Industry has not done its part either. At one time,
basic research was comparatively well supported in in
dustry; however, according to those involved, there has
been a sharp decrease in long-term support of funda
mental work.
This is unfortunate. While it may not seem like basic
research projects such as discovering what sort of lice
inhabit bats' armpits, or a study of lunar petrology, will
affect any of directly, historically it seems we never have
been able to predict what sort of discoveries could be
useful. Indeed, it seems to me that most of the more
significant discoveries have been totally accidental
(radioactivity, x-rays, penicillin, etc.). Put concisely, I
suppose one could say much great discovery is seren-

dipitous.
"Ah, but that was oh, so long ago. Surely because we
are ever so modern in 1977, that sort of discovery is no
longer needed. Why spend money on something
nebulous, when you can spend it on more specific
applied research?" ask the less Socratic of the readers.
Well, perhaps we are still in need of basic building
blocks of knowledge. Several members of Carter's
Council of Economic Advisors have related the decline
of American productivity since 1953 to the decreased
emphasis on basic research. Many others feel that this
underemphasis is causing an erosion of the United
States' lead in high technology products.
Thus, it would seem from the miniscule amount I have
looked into the subject that perhaps more emphasis
(such as dollars) is due. I add that this does not mean
government dollars. Government funding has been
fairly destructive in the past. As one Mr. Abelson, editor
of Science magazine, has had occasion to observe,
federal support has been remarkably erratic — wiping
out projects as interest lags, smothering others with
money and demands for results as they grow fashiona
ble. This has also hurt private research and the morale
and recruiting of talent.
The solution? Well, I, unlike many others, know the
answer: Wipe out the federal government. Exterminate
it! Hang all politicans and bureaucrats from the nearest
AT&T telephone pole. Revolution in the street!(tantrum
continues for a short while. . . .)
In any event, consensus does seem to be to let private
business take care of the problem by giving tax breaks.
This seems reasonable and ought to insure some con
tinuity. It also has the advantage of making research less
political, perhaps even more productive.
