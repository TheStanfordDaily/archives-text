# 'Palestine Policy': what does it mean?

Sami Suleiman

For the first time in 30 years,
the United States now has a
"Palestine Policy." President
Carter, speaking at the U.N.
General Assembly, told the
world representatives that Is
rael must recognize the legiti
mate rights of the Palestinian
people. If it sounds easy to say,
the history of the U.S. position
towards the Palestinian people
was not that easy. The Carter
Administration's acknow
ledgment that the Palestinian

What does the much
flaunted concept of a "Palesti
nian homeland" mean? Will it
be an independent state in its
own right, equal in sovereignty
to all other states: Or will it be
somewhere in between? The
universal declaration of human
rights proclaims uncondition
ally the right of everyone to re
turn to his country. Its much
publicized commitment to the
cause of human rights will not
be fully credible or truly non

be an offense against the prin
ciples of elemental justice if
these innocent victims of the
conflict were denied the right
to return to their homes while
Jewish immigrants flow into
Palestine, and, indeed, at least
offer the threat of permanent
replacement of the Arab re
fugees who have been rooted
in the land for centuries."
Far from being a forgotten,
abandoned or obsolete deci
sion, that 1948 resolution has
been reaffirmed — with near
unanimity — every year, in
cluding 1976, and in the face of
the Arab Oil "Cartel" and its
alleged influence in the U.N.
Four wars took place in the
past 29 years between Israel
and the Arab States. The argu
ments are strong, on both
sides, as to who, why, when
. . ~ etc. But, the facts remain
unchanged. Dr. Judah Magnes
in "The Decadence of Judaism
in Our Time" says, "We seem

to have thought of everything
except the Arabs. ... If we
have a just cause, so have they.
If promises were made to us,
so were they made to the
Arabs. If we love the land and
have a historical connection
with it, so too the Arabs ... If
we wish to live in this living
space, we must live with Arabs,
try to make peace with
them. . I.F. Stone, in his in
troduction to Fouzi El-Asmar's
"To Be An Arab in Israel"
wrote, "If the first step toward
peace is to look at ourselves,
the second is to look at the
Arab. This also takes courage.
It means forcing ourselves to
see that, like us, he is — sur
prisingly — human. . . This is
the path toward peace: this is
the path of the prophets ... I
like to believe that this means
Israel can secure its future by
reconciliation, by recom
pense, by recognizing the
Palestinian Arab as a person

and a nation."
Those who support Israel,
including a large number of
Jewish intellectuals, see this as
the path Israel should pursue,
for her own protection. The
world saw this before. Only Is
rael and the United States re
fused to see or recognize the
legitimate rights of the Palesti
nians and their representa
tives, the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
Why does the United States
insist that it would not deal
with the P.L.O. until the
P.L.O. recognizes Israel's
right to exist as a Jewish State?
What is the P.L.O. and does it
really represent the Palestinian
people? Why doesn't Israel
recognize the legitimate rights
of the Palestinians and insist
that a third state cannot exist
between Israel and Jordan?
How should the Palestinian
State be formed?

have a just cause, so have they.
If promises were made to us,
so were they made to the
Arabs. If we love the land and
have a historical connection
with it, so too the Arabs ... If
we wish to live in this living
space, we must live with Arabs,
try to make peace with
them. . I.F. Stone, in his in
troduction to Fouzi El-Asmar's
"To Be An Arab in Israel"
wrote, "If the first step toward
peace is to look at ourselves,
the second is to look at the
Arab. This also takes courage.
It means forcing ourselves to
see that, like us, he is — sur
prisingly — human. . . This is
the path toward peace: this is
the path of the prophets ... I
like to believe that this means
Israel can secure its future by
reconciliation, by recom
pense, by recognizing the
Palestinian Arab as a person

and a nation."
Those who support Israel,
including a large number of
Jewish intellectuals, see this as
the path Israel should pursue,
for her own protection. The
world saw this before. Only Is
rael and the United States re
fused to see or recognize the
legitimate rights of the Palesti
nians and their representa

Organization.
Why does the United States
insist that it would not deal
with the P.L.O. until the
P.L.O. recognizes Israel's
right to exist as a Jewish State?
What is the P.L.O. and does it
really represent the Palestinian
people? Why doesn't Israel
recognize the legitimate rights
of the Palestinians and insist
that a third state cannot exist
between Israel and Jordan?
How should the Palestinian
State be formed?

For the first time in 30 years,
the United States now has a
"Palestine Policy." President
Carter, speaking at the U.N.
General Assembly, told the
world representatives that Is
rael must recognize the legiti
mate rights of the Palestinian
people. If it sounds easy to say,
the history of the U.S. position
towards the Palestinian people
was not that easy. The Carter
Administration's acknow
ledgment that the Palestinian

What does the much
flaunted concept of a "Palesti
nian homeland" mean? Will it
be an independent state in its
own right, equal in sovereignty
to all other states: Or will it be
somewhere in between? The
universal declaration of human
rights proclaims uncondition
ally the right of everyone to re
turn to his country. Its much
publicized commitment to the
cause of human rights will not
be fully credible or truly non

be an offense against the prin
ciples of elemental justice if
these innocent victims of the
conflict were denied the right
to return to their homes while
Jewish immigrants flow into
Palestine, and, indeed, at least
offer the threat of permanent
replacement of the Arab re
fugees who have been rooted
in the land for centuries."
Far from being a forgotten,
abandoned or obsolete deci
sion, that 1948 resolution has
been reaffirmed — with near
unanimity — every year, in

the Arab Oil "Cartel" and its
alleged influence in the U.N.
Four wars took place in the
past 29 years between Israel
and the Arab States. The argu

in "The Decadence of Judaism
