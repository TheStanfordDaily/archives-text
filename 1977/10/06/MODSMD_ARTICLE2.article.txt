Senate may ax electricity plan
Washington — The Senate, having rejected Presi
dent jimmy Carter's proposal for natural gas price
controls, is now aiming a blow at his electricity pric
ing plan.
The Senate was expected to go along with the re
commendation of its Energy Committee to scrap en
tirely the electric rate overhaul proposed by Carter
and approved by the House.
Carter asked Congress to give the government the
power to order electric utilities to revise their rate
structures.
The step would make electricity cheaper if con
sumed at night or during other off-peak times while
banning utilities from continuing to sell cheap power
to industries who use a lot of it.
But Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), floor manager
for the bill, said yesterday the administration plan
goes too far. The federal government should not try
to dictate electric rates, a power that should remain
with state governments, at least for the time being, he
said.
"We're not saying no to utility rate reform, we're
just saying we're not ready for it," Johnston said.
Court to view pregnancy benefits
Washington — The Supreme Court was asked yes
terday to decide whether pregnant workers may be
denied sick leave benefits and whether their bosses
can tell them when to begin unpaid maternity leave.
In a pair of sex discrimination cases that could
affect millions of working women, the justices also
must consider whether a company can force a woman
to forfeit some seniority benefits because she has
taken maternity leave.
The individual women in both cases who argued
before the court yesterday won in the lower courts
when their employers' policies were found to violate

the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Last December, however, the Supreme Court ruled
in a case involving the General Electric Co. that an
employerdoes not have to include pregnancy disabil
ity payments in a health insurance program offering
protection for numerous other disabilities.
Carter sees ruins of N.Y. blackout
New York — President Jimmy Carter made a sur
prise visit to the South Bronx yesterday and saw for
himself block after block of burned out buildings, a
desolate wasteland remindful of European cities shat
tered by World War II bombs.
"Get a map of the whole area and show me what
should be done," the president directed atone point,
addressing Secretary of Housing and Urban De
velopment Patricia Harris, who accompanied the
party.
At another point, as he discussed possible recon
struction of blighted areas, Carter warned that "we
couldn't expect federal money to do it all." However,
the president added that with city and state coopera
tion, "we could turn this whole area around."
Also accompanying the president was lame-duck
Mayor Abraham Beame, who was offered a job by
Carter as chairman of the Commission on Inter
governmental Administration after he leaves City Hall
Jan.l.
United Mine Workers begin talks
Washington — The United Mine Workers (UMW)
union, wracked by internal dissent and wildcat
strikes, begins negotiations today on a new labor
contract with a nationwide coal strike likely in 60
days.
Fear of a long and crippling strike has eased in
recent weeks and government officials now believe a

walkout would have little impact on the nation's
energy needs this winter.
At a time of rising coal production, the UMW's
170,000 members are producing only 58 per cent of
the nation's coal, down from nearly 70 per cent just
three years ago when the current contract was
signed.
Investment protection called for
Washington — The savings and loan industry
opened a campaign yesterday to protect its massive
inner-city mortgage investment with a call for the
federal government to offer partial insurance for
home improvement loans made in some urban areas.
The U.S. League of Savings Associations also urged
a tax exemption for profits on rehabilitation invest
ments in city neighborhoods.
Investors arid the federal government should stop
concentrating on costly new home construction and
spend more money on rehabilitation, the league re
commended.
The league's report disputed the claim that the
mortgage industry is to blame for urban housing
problems.

Carter sees ruins of N.Y. blackout
New York — President Jimmy Carter made a sur
prise visit to the South Bronx yesterday and saw for
himself block after block of burned out buildings, a
desolate wasteland remindful of European cities shat
tered by World War II bombs.
"Get a map of the whole area and show me what
should be done," the president directed atone point,
addressing Secretary of Housing and Urban De
velopment Patricia Harris, who accompanied the
party.
At another point, as he discussed possible recon
struction of blighted areas, Carter warned that "we
couldn't expect federal money to do it all." However,
the president added that with city and state coopera
tion, "we could turn this whole area around."
Also accompanying the president was lame-duck
Mayor Abraham Beame, who was offered a job by
Carter as chairman of the Commission on Inter
governmental Administration after he leaves City Hall
Jan.l.
United Mine Workers begin talks
Washington — The United Mine Workers (UMW)
union, wracked by internal dissent and wildcat
strikes, begins negotiations today on a new labor
contract with a nationwide coal strike likely in 60
days.
Fear of a long and crippling strike has eased in
recent weeks and government officials now believe a

walkout would have little impact on the nation's
energy needs this winter.
At a time of rising coal production, the UMW's
170,000 members are producing only 58 per cent of
the nation's coal, down from nearly 70 per cent just
three years ago when the current contract was
signed.
Investment protection called for
Washington — The savings and loan industry
opened a campaign yesterday to protect its massive
inner-city mortgage investment with a call for the
federal government to offer partial insurance for
home improvement loans made in some urban areas.
The U.S. League of Savings Associations also urged
a tax exemption for profits on rehabilitation invest
ments in city neighborhoods.
Investors arid the federal government should stop
concentrating on costly new home construction and
spend more money on rehabilitation, the league re
commended.
The league's report disputed the claim that the
mortgage industry is to blame for urban housing
problems.

Senate may ax electricity plan
Washington — The Senate, having rejected Presi
dent jimmy Carter's proposal for natural gas price
controls, is now aiming a blow at his electricity pric
ing plan.
The Senate was expected to go along with the re
commendation of its Energy Committee to scrap en
tirely the electric rate overhaul proposed by Carter
and approved by the House.
Carter asked Congress to give the government the
power to order electric utilities to revise their rate
structures.
The step would make electricity cheaper if con
sumed at night or during other off-peak times while
banning utilities from continuing to sell cheap power
to industries who use a lot of it.
But Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), floor manager
for the bill, said yesterday the administration plan
goes too far. The federal government should not try
to dictate electric rates, a power that should remain
with state governments, at least for the time being, he
said.
"We're not saying no to utility rate reform, we're
just saying we're not ready for it," Johnston said.
Court to view pregnancy benefits
Washington — The Supreme Court was asked yes

denied sick leave benefits and whether their bosses
can tell them when to begin unpaid maternity leave.
In a pair of sex discrimination cases that could
affect millions of working women, the justices also
must consider whether a company can force a woman
to forfeit some seniority benefits because she has
taken maternity leave.
The individual women in both cases who argued
before the court yesterday won in the lower courts
when their employers' policies were found to violate

the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Last December, however, the Supreme Court ruled
in a case involving the General Electric Co. that an
employerdoes not have to include pregnancy disabil
