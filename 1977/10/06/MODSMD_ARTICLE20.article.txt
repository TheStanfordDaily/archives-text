## 'Personal journeys to places unknown'; painting & traveling down roads not taken Renee Winick, highway artist 
### 
Renee Winick is an artistwho
doesn't like to drive. That's not
unusual in itself, even in
mobile California, except that
the recurring images in her
work are the freeway and the
visual pattern it makes on the
landscape. Sweeping slashes
of roads, bridges and inter
changes swirl across her
three-dimensional canvases
and collages in graphic expres
sions of "going and being" in
space.
Winick says her own works
are "personal journeys to
places unknown and yet are
recreations of deeply felt im
pressions." Those impressions

are primarily of space and time,
portrayed as infinite and eleg
antly simple.
A native of New York and a
graduate of Pratt Institute,
Winick has "always been an ar
tist" and has worked steadily
while raising three children,
(One daughter is a Stanford art
major.) Her current show at
Gallery House, with photo
grapher Julia Siebel, is her
third in the Bay Area this year.
The obvious assumption is
that Winick has been influ
enced by the omnipresent
freeway, since arriving in
California with her family four
years ago. Vet her fascination
with the patterns and shapes of
roads developed much earlier,
while she was still on the East
Coast.
During 14 years in Greater
Boston, Winick concentrated
on printmaking and explored
visual expressions of time and
space. Her familiarity with the
beautiful papers of printmak
ing, with their subtle nuances
of shade and texture, promp
ted her to make collages. Using
the papers and bits of her own
prints, she produced second
generation works from essen
tially the same creative
sources. At the same time, she

developed her style of
"sculpture painting" in which
the shape of the canvas is as
important as the paints and ob
jects put on it.
Concentrating on painting
and collage making, Winick
sometimes starts with photo
graphs of roads and overpasses
and produces sketches that
serve as the foundations for
her imaginary landscapes. She
feels a "sense of distance" and
tries to convey that sense
through the visual effect of
freeway-like shapes set in
space.
Not at all rigid about the in
terpretation of her work,
Winick welcomes reaction.
"It's a real turn-on to have
people relate to your work."
Her style is becoming in
creasingly refined and simple,
which makes her an artist "on
the line, and I like that." The
important thing, she says, is
"to do something that is totally
yours."
Renee Winick's landscapes,
along with the photographs of
Julia Siebel, are at Gallery
House, 538 Ramona St., Palo
Alto, through Oct. 29
(Monday-Saturday), 11 a.m. to
5 p.m.

Renee Winick
Renee Winick is an artistwho
doesn't like to drive. That's not
unusual in itself, even in
mobile California, except that
the recurring images in her
work are the freeway and the
visual pattern it makes on the
landscape. Sweeping slashes
of roads, bridges and inter
changes swirl across her
three-dimensional canvases
and collages in graphic expres
sions of "going and being" in
space.
Winick says her own works
are "personal journeys to
places unknown and yet are
recreations of deeply felt im
pressions." Those impressions

are primarily of space and time,
portrayed as infinite and eleg
antly simple.
A native of New York and a
graduate of Pratt Institute,
Winick has "always been an ar
tist" and has worked steadily
while raising three children,
(One daughter is a Stanford art
major.) Her current show at
Gallery House, with photo
grapher Julia Siebel, is her
third in the Bay Area this year.
The obvious assumption is
that Winick has been influ
enced by the omnipresent
freeway, since arriving in
California with her family four
years ago. Vet her fascination
with the patterns and shapes of
roads developed much earlier,
while she was still on the East
Coast.
During 14 years in Greater
Boston, Winick concentrated
on printmaking and explored
visual expressions of time and
space. Her familiarity with the
beautiful papers of printmak
ing, with their subtle nuances
of shade and texture, promp
ted her to make collages. Using
the papers and bits of her own
prints, she produced second
generation works from essen
tially the same creative
sources. At the same time, she

developed her style of
"sculpture painting" in which
the shape of the canvas is as
important as the paints and ob
jects put on it.
Concentrating on painting
and collage making, Winick
sometimes starts with photo
graphs of roads and overpasses
and produces sketches that
serve as the foundations for
her imaginary landscapes. She
feels a "sense of distance" and
tries to convey that sense
through the visual effect of
freeway-like shapes set in
space.
Not at all rigid about the in
terpretation of her work,
Winick welcomes reaction.
"It's a real turn-on to have
people relate to your work."
Her style is becoming in
creasingly refined and simple,
which makes her an artist "on
the line, and I like that." The
important thing, she says, is
"to do something that is totally
yours."

along with the photographs of
Julia Siebel, are at Gallery
