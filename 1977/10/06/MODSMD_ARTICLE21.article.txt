## Landscapes, in & out of focus 
### 
Two one-woman shows at the De Young
Museum deal with landscape very differently.
San Francisco photographer Linda Connor,
known as the "one who does those out of focus
things" has a number of surprises in store for
adherents of sharp-focus, purist photography.
Painter Patricia Tobacco Forrester, also a San
Franciscan, ironically renders super-sharp, de
tailed works in a most unlikely medium —
watercolor.
Connor approaches a wide range of subjects
in a neo-Pictorialist style, using an Bxlo inch
camera with special lens made in 1902, the era of
Pictorialism, a romantic and painterly style. To
increase the lyricism of the soft focus, Connor
uses the lens wide open, creating little depth of
field, only suggesting focus on the main subject.
The magenta-toned prints look rich because
contact printing of the large negatives removes
any awareness of film or paper grain. The images
seem sharp, and fuzzy.
Connor's landscapes stand out. The shimmer
created with the special camera and the vibrant
plant life complement each other. She also
shows striking portraits, still life and building
studies. Several works seem totally enigmatic
but delightful for meditation.
Meditation, light and fecundity of nature were
also themes of Forrester's mammoth water
colors. The artist has spent most of the past
decade using Golden Gate Park as her studio.
Because of the demands of watercolor and

One woman shows at De Young

outdoor work, the artist has to piece together
sheets of paper about two by four feet. Many
appeared to be exact equivalents in scale of the
plant or tree painted. The two to four sheets for
each painting are used simultaneously, with
only minimal pencil marks on the edges to main
tain continuity. Freedom and precision exists in
these works.
Golden Gate Park, with everything from damp
fogs to brilliant sun, prompts "The frustration
and accidents of outdoor painting which force
me to be an urgent inventor, a role to struggle
with," Forrester said.
Her paintings are vibrant, because of the
paint's translucence, use of the paper as high
light, and because of equally intense attention
to detail. They are carefully composed and
coherent.
Forrester paints the colors of light rather than
of the object. She surprises the viewer with un
expected hues; bright orange on a white birch
branch, or a green strip on a red manzanita. But
each work is true to a sense of light and seems
realistic.
Textures range from smooth grass to shaggy
Coulter pine bark. Delicate flowers, and carpets
of grass, needles, and roots fill out the wild
tangle of branches.
The Connor and Forrester shows will be at the
De Young Museum in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park through November.

things" has a number of surprises in store for
adherents of sharp-focus, purist photography.
Painter Patricia Tobacco Forrester, also a San
Franciscan, ironically renders super-sharp, de
tailed works in a most unlikely medium —
watercolor.
Connor approaches a wide range of subjects
in a neo-Pictorialist style, using an Bxlo inch
camera with special lens made in 1902, the era of
Pictorialism, a romantic and painterly style. To
increase the lyricism of the soft focus, Connor
uses the lens wide open, creating little depth of
field, only suggesting focus on the main subject.
The magenta-toned prints look rich because
contact printing of the large negatives removes
any awareness of film or paper grain. The images
seem sharp, and fuzzy.
Connor's landscapes stand out. The shimmer
created with the special camera and the vibrant
plant life complement each other. She also
shows striking portraits, still life and building
studies. Several works seem totally enigmatic
but delightful for meditation.
Meditation, light and fecundity of nature were
also themes of Forrester's mammoth water
colors. The artist has spent most of the past
decade using Golden Gate Park as her studio.
Because of the demands of watercolor and

outdoor work, the artist has to piece together
sheets of paper about two by four feet. Many
appeared to be exact equivalents in scale of the
plant or tree painted. The two to four sheets for
each painting are used simultaneously, with
only minimal pencil marks on the edges to main
tain continuity. Freedom and precision exists in
these works.
Golden Gate Park, with everything from damp
fogs to brilliant sun, prompts "The frustration
and accidents of outdoor painting which force
me to be an urgent inventor, a role to struggle
with," Forrester said.
Her paintings are vibrant, because of the
paint's translucence, use of the paper as high
light, and because of equally intense attention
to detail. They are carefully composed and
coherent.
Forrester paints the colors of light rather than
of the object. She surprises the viewer with un
expected hues; bright orange on a white birch
branch, or a green strip on a red manzanita. But
each work is true to a sense of light and seems
realistic.
Textures range from smooth grass to shaggy
Coulter pine bark. Delicate flowers, and carpets
of grass, needles, and roots fill out the wild
tangle of branches.
The Connor and Forrester shows will be at the
De Young Museum in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park through November.

Two one-woman shows at the De Young
Museum deal with landscape very differently.
San Francisco photographer Linda Connor,
known as the "one who does those out of focus
things" has a number of surprises in store for
