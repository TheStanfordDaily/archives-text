# Sahl in Berkeley
## 
### 
Mort Sahl, the groundbreak
ing comedian, plays Zellerbach
Auditorium next Tuesday.
The political satirist will
tackle the Bakke case, the
Lance decision and other cur
rent hot spots in the news.
Sahl is the first comedian to
win a Grammy, the first to put
out a comedy album, and the
first to use the "coffeehouse"
style of comedy delivery.
He originated the "daily
newspaper" routine in an off
the-cuff gig where he picked
up the paper and read aloud
annotated versions of the front
page, sports and fashion sec
tions and the classified ads.
Long a Bay Area favorite,
Sahl will play with acoustic
guitarist Tom Chapin.
Along with his comedy
routines, Sahl wrote speeches
for the John Kennedy cam
paign. He doesn't play favo
rites, though, because he
satirizes his old boss as well as
Eisenhower, Nixon and Lyn
don Johnson.
Tickets for the 8 p.m. prog
ram are sold by UC-Berkeley.
