## ROSIE 
### 
Rosie s new album, Last Dance," is but another example,
thankfully in this case, of the fact that you can't judge an album by
its cover. Though the cover hints of an immature punk rock
group, the music is actually pleasantly tame, quite in the style of
Boz Scaggs.
Three young singers, David Lasley, Lynn Pitney and Lana Mar
rano, make up "Rosie," and display a degree of polish not often
found in new groups. In addition to singing, Lasley and Marrano
wrote all the tunes for this album, with the exception of "I See
Home," which was co-written by Allee Willis.
The album's first track, "The Words Don't Matter," is a soulful
tune, but with an upbeat touch. Unfortunately, the title accu
rately forebodes the lyrics of the entire album which, for the most
part, are truly trite and forgettable. "Back on the Street Again"
continues in the mellow vein of "The Words Don't Matter," and is
highly reminiscent of the new Bee Gees. Good orchestration
makes this tune a possible single.
There's a Song in it Somewhere," a slightly upbeat number, is
the album s best track. It owes its roots to "The Fifth Dimension's
Aquarius" period.
The album's most interesting track, is "Out of Pawn," which
showcases Marrano. Marrano's voice is appealing, lacking the
unpleasant raspy quality of other female singers. The other im
portant voice on this track is James Taylor's, who does
background vocals (very apparent near the end of the tune).
Along with Taylor, Henry Gross ("Shannon"), and Mac Reben
nack ("Dr. John") perform on this album. Rebennack's kinky
piano salvages "Mississippi Baby," a tune which is otherwise not
much more than a bad imitation of background music from a
1940s movie.
"I See Home" is a pretty ballad, enhanced by David Spinozza's
melodic guitar solo and a good arrangement. The remainder of
the album consists of "Missin' " (which would be a good dancing
number were the percussion stronger); "The Last Dance of
Summer (a mediocre song, saved by David Sanborn's sax play
ing), "Dancin' on Rivers" (Sanborn's sax playing is the highlight
of this song as well), and"Run that Movie Back" (the album's
most obvious single, and a tune which sounds like an offspring of
Stevie Wonder's "Superstitious").
