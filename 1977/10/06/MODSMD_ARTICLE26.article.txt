# 'Journey' at the Waldorf
## 
### 
The now renowned group
"journey" returned to the Bay
Area this weekend not as a
extravaganza at a
high watt amphitheater, but as
an unpretentiously intimate
megaband. Unlike this year's
Winterland concerts the vol
ume was appreciably adjusted
for crystaline instrumentalism.
Playing five SRO concerts at
the Old Waldorf, "Journey"
assembles a dramatically pre
cise two-hour performance of
songs from its albums and
promulgates an encore of
three unreleased songs, intro
ducing new vocalist Steve
Perry.
"journey" is Aynsley Dun
bar, Greg Rolle, Neal Schon
and Ross Valory. Rolle is
keyboards and lead vocals,
Schon is lead guitar; both were
formerly with "Santana." Rolle
and Schon weave stylistic tex
ture into the sounds of their
instruments. The potential cir
cumscription for degeneration
into a splinter of "Santana" is
neatly avoided, however, by
Dunbar's insistent rhythms and
distinguishing subtleties.

Dunbar's self-demanding
technical perfectionism has
been drilled loudly with Nils
Lofgren and pneumatically
under Zappa's exacting whip.
During his polyrhythmic solo,
Dunbar splits his bass and
snare drumming into a flailing
conversation, snaring his bass
with his battery rolls.
Bassist Ross Valory
heightened contact with the
audience with his back-up voc
als to "You're On Your Own,"
harmonizing with Rolle and
Schon. While Schon rapes his
guitar pushing for an inten
sified climax, Valory comes on
like the acid harlequin of the
Magical Mystery Tour. He is
partly hampered by the segue
nature of the set which re
veals his bass lines to be simi
lar if not identical in different
numbers.
Dressed in black, playing the
buttons of his orgasmitron,
Greg Rolle's stage presence
draws the most crowd reac
tion. His tasteful keyboard
licks coupled with his maturing
vocals transmits a unifying
mood sensitivity.

"Journey's" opener, "Of A
Lifetime," keynotes its lyrical
and visual qualities with . .
countless visions that are drift
ing. . . The lighting group
increases the dynamics of the
show with osmotic lights syn
chronized and colored to the
music.
Crooning through his beak
Steve Perry whines up and
greases down to the notes, in
congruous to the succinct riffs
and trills of the rest of the
band. His expansive muscle
control activating his nostrils
and anus conferred upon him
the status of nose-hose.
Without Perry's attempts to
plug "Journey's" former vocal
weakness (which Rolle has al
ready corked unassisted) his
counterparts coordinate so
tightly that their music is an ar
rangement of simultaneous
solos.
The Old Waldorf has re
cently been enlisting name ta
lent; minors are admitted,
there is a two drink minimum.
It is located at 444 Battery St. off
the Broadway/Washington exit
in San Francisco.

audience with his back-up voc
als to "You're On Your Own,"
harmonizing with Rolle and
Schon. While Schon rapes his
guitar pushing for an inten
sified climax, Valory comes on
like the acid harlequin of the
Magical Mystery Tour. He is
partly hampered by the segue
nature of the set which re
veals his bass lines to be simi
lar if not identical in different
numbers.
Dressed in black, playing the
buttons of his orgasmitron,
Greg Rolle's stage presence
draws the most crowd reac
tion. His tasteful keyboard
licks coupled with his maturing
vocals transmits a unifying
mood sensitivity.

"Journey's" opener, "Of A
Lifetime," keynotes its lyrical
and visual qualities with . .
countless visions that are drift
ing. . . The lighting group
increases the dynamics of the
show with osmotic lights syn
chronized and colored to the
music.
Crooning through his beak
Steve Perry whines up and
greases down to the notes, in
congruous to the succinct riffs
and trills of the rest of the
band. His expansive muscle
control activating his nostrils
and anus conferred upon him
the status of nose-hose.
Without Perry's attempts to
plug "Journey's" former vocal
weakness (which Rolle has al
ready corked unassisted) his
counterparts coordinate so
tightly that their music is an ar
rangement of simultaneous
solos.
The Old Waldorf has re

there is a two drink minimum.
It is located at 444 Battery St. off
the Broadway/Washington exit

The now renowned group
"journey" returned to the Bay
Area this weekend not as a
extravaganza at a
high watt amphitheater, but as
an unpretentiously intimate
megaband. Unlike this year's
Winterland concerts the vol
ume was appreciably adjusted
for crystaline instrumentalism.
Playing five SRO concerts at
the Old Waldorf, "Journey"
assembles a dramatically pre
cise two-hour performance of
songs from its albums and
promulgates an encore of
three unreleased songs, intro
ducing new vocalist Steve
Perry.
"journey" is Aynsley Dun
bar, Greg Rolle, Neal Schon
and Ross Valory. Rolle is
keyboards and lead vocals,
Schon is lead guitar; both were
formerly with "Santana." Rolle
and Schon weave stylistic tex
ture into the sounds of their
instruments. The potential cir
cumscription for degeneration
into a splinter of "Santana" is
neatly avoided, however, by
Dunbar's insistent rhythms and
distinguishing subtleties.

Dunbar's self-demanding
technical perfectionism has
been drilled loudly with Nils
Lofgren and pneumatically
under Zappa's exacting whip.
During his polyrhythmic solo,
Dunbar splits his bass and
snare drumming into a flailing
conversation, snaring his bass
with his battery rolls.
Bassist Ross Valory
heightened contact with the
audience with his back-up voc
als to "You're On Your Own,"
harmonizing with Rolle and
Schon. While Schon rapes his
guitar pushing for an inten
sified climax, Valory comes on
