Cerf
Random House. 306 pages. $12.95.
He attended PS 10 in Man
hattan with playwright Howard
Dietz and composer Richard
Rodgers. At Columbia Univer
sity, he joined Phi Lambda Pi
fraternity, whose president
then was Oscar Hammerstein.
There, too, was Dick Simon (la
ter of Simon & Schuster) and a
freshman named Donald
Klopfer, "one of the nicest
men that ever lived," who be
came his partner when, in
1925, they bought the Modern
Library. Following his divorce
from the actress Sylvia Sidney,
he married the cousin of
Ginger Rogers, Phyllis Fraser,
and that marriage was "glori
ous, just about perfect." He
had two sons, Jonathan and
Christopher. At Random
House, he published the works
of W.H. Auden, Gertrude
Stein, Robert Penn Warren,
Budd Schulberg, William
Faulkner, John O'Hara and Dr.
Seuss.
All of this astounded Bennett
Cerf.
He was an operator, a wang
ler. Without much study, he
managed two undergraduate
degrees from Columbia and
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa
his junior year. He joined the
brokerage house of Sartorious,
Smith and Loewi and simul
taneously wrote an "Advice to
the Investor" column in the
New York Tribune. When he
heard that the publishers Boni
and Liveright were on the
skids, he bought the position
of vice president with them for
a $25,000 loan, one-fifth of the
fortune left in trust to him at 16
with the death of his grand
father, a tobacco distributor.

Liveright, Cerf and Donald
Klopfer bought the firm's most
profitable holding, the Mod
ern Library, 108 classic titles,
for $215,000, an investment
they paid off within three years
and which was the basis for a
publishing house that would
select its new authors "at ran
dom"; a corporation that was
sold to RCA in 1967 for $40 mill
ion.
This too Bennett Cerf found
amazing.
He was a salesman, editor,
best-selling author, raconteur;
a collector and anthologizer of
jokes and puns and publishing
gossip; a popular college lec
turer; a Sunday night panelist
on What's My Line? for nearly
17 years. But he never lost his
love for books, his schoolboy
awe of writers. "O'Neill fasci
nated me. This was the life I
had chosen for myself, and
when he was talking about

himself and his plays, I was in
heaven."
He opened a 1934 radio in
terview with Gertrude Stein by
remarking, "I'm very proud to
be your publisher, Miss Stein,
but as I've always told you, I
don't understand very much of
what you're saying.
"She replied promptly,
'Well, I've always told you,
Bennett, you're a very nice boy
but you're rather stupid.'
"On a coast-to-coast hook
up! The studio audience let out
a howl, and believe me, I didn't
kid around with Gertrude for
the rest of the interview."
"At Random" is based on
diaries, scrapbooks, and 21
tape-recorded interviews
which are part of the Columbia
Oral History program, so each
page is alive with Bennett's
familiarvoice.
It's a name-laden publisher's
lunch of a book; a conversa
tional reminiscence rich with
Bennett Cerf's zest and humor
and love for people and his
profession. Near the end he
says, "I've had a very happy
life. I've been as lucky as can
be," and "At Random" reads
very much that way: a conge
nial book, a windfall.

"At Random" is based on

It's a name-laden publisher's
lunch of a book; a conversa

Bennett Cerf's zest and humor

He attended PS 10 in Man
hattan with playwright Howard
Dietz and composer Richard
Rodgers. At Columbia Univer
sity, he joined Phi Lambda Pi
fraternity, whose president
then was Oscar Hammerstein.
There, too, was Dick Simon (la
ter of Simon & Schuster) and a
freshman named Donald
Klopfer, "one of the nicest
men that ever lived," who be
came his partner when, in
1925, they bought the Modern
Library. Following his divorce
from the actress Sylvia Sidney,
he married the cousin of
Ginger Rogers, Phyllis Fraser,
and that marriage was "glori
ous, just about perfect." He
had two sons, Jonathan and
Christopher. At Random
House, he published the works
of W.H. Auden, Gertrude
Stein, Robert Penn Warren,
Budd Schulberg, William
Faulkner, John O'Hara and Dr.
Seuss.
All of this astounded Bennett
Cerf.
He was an operator, a wang
ler. Without much study, he
managed two undergraduate
degrees from Columbia and
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa
his junior year. He joined the
brokerage house of Sartorious,
Smith and Loewi and simul
taneously wrote an "Advice to
the Investor" column in the
New York Tribune. When he
heard that the publishers Boni
and Liveright were on the
skids, he bought the position
of vice president with them for
a $25,000 loan, one-fifth of the
fortune left in trust to him at 16
with the death of his grand
father, a tobacco distributor.

Liveright, Cerf and Donald
Klopfer bought the firm's most
profitable holding, the Mod
ern Library, 108 classic titles,
for $215,000, an investment
they paid off within three years
and which was the basis for a
publishing house that would
select its new authors "at ran
dom"; a corporation that was
sold to RCA in 1967 for $40 mill
ion.
This too Bennett Cerf found
amazing.
He was a salesman, editor,
best-selling author, raconteur;
a collector and anthologizer of
jokes and puns and publishing
gossip; a popular college lec
turer; a Sunday night panelist
on What's My Line? for nearly
17 years. But he never lost his
love for books, his schoolboy
awe of writers. "O'Neill fasci
nated me. This was the life I
had chosen for myself, and
when he was talking about

himself and his plays, I was in
heaven."
