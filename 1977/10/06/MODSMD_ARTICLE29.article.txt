# Oct. 7-9, Berkeley's Greek Theatre

Mimi Farina talks softly about her career in
her Mill Valley office, a short distance away
from Berkeley's Greek Theatre, where she
will perform in the "Bread and Roses" Festi
val of acoustic music this weekend.
"What irritated me most was the business
end of 'show biz,' so I wanted to find a place
where the business didn't have to exist and
where . . . the performer flourished or was
nourished or encouraged without money."
Since 1974, folksinger Farina, founder and
executive director of non-profit "Bread and
Roses," has provided that atmosphere. Her
latest venture is the festival, for which she
has gathered over 20 musicians ranging from
traditionalists Pete Seeger and Ramblin' Jack
Elliot to the more contemporary Jackson
Browne and Jesse Colin Young.
Though the festival is her immediate con
cern, she has returned to the studio after six
years, recording her debut solo album on
the Wolfgang label, a Columbia Records
subsidiary.
For an artist who is not "big name," re
cording often poses a major problem. "They
(record companies) want to sell albums.
They want to make money. I want to make
music."

But simple acoustic tunes like hers cannot
compete with the mass-produced pop music
that blares daily from the radio.
"The music industry has changed a great
deal in the last 10 years," she says."The
radio has so saturated our ears with sounds
that we're used to now that just a voice and a
guitar coming over the radio sounds very
measly — and in order to make albums, you
have to be able to get them on the radio in
order to sell them."
So, she must compromise her music.
While her albums may not sound like the
overdone productions, it will sound much
slicker than she would prefer.
Why did she choose to record for a large
company, where she knew this situation
would arise?
"I just didn't see carrying around my al
bums on my back to festivals and selling
them. I've got enough to do. It's a com
promise and politically it feels strange, but I
decided to go with a big company and . . .
say as much as I could from the inside."
She certainly does have more than
enough to do. Besides her work with "Bread
and Roses," which produces some 20 to 30
free shows a month in the Bay Area accord

ing to festival promoter Rick Foster, she
plans to do a promotional tour after the
album is finished.
But, as has been chronicled so many times
before, the life of a musician on the road is a
most difficult one. Farina has toured the club
circuit by herself, but is more interested in
doing concerts now.
Though she admits that. . it makes a lot
of sense for places like that (clubs) to exist
for people who are working all day to go and
have a drink and relax . . she finds them to
be less than enjoyable places in which to
play.
"Clubs to me are ugly ... I like fancy."
But to play the "fancy," larger halls, one
has to sell records. And to sell records, an
artist like Mimi Farina who has not yet
proven herself to be a lucrative commodity
to a company, has to compromise. Yet one
can only compromise so much. What would
she do if she ever became so big that it was
necessary to perform in basketball arenas
and football stadiums? "I don't ever want to
be that big," she replies. . . the music
would be lost."
