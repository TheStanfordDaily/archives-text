# 'Allegro non troppo'
## An offbeat 'Fantasia' 
### 
"Allegro non troppo" gets its
West Coast premiere with the
Chaparral film series showing
this Saturday.
The film is considered to be
an offbeat "Fantasia" and has
received critical acclaim for its
"gorgeous send up ... as re
verent toward the classics as
Disney was overly devout."
"Allegro non troppo" uses
music from Debussy ("Prelude
to Afternoon of a Fawn"),
Dvorak ("Slave Dance No. 7"),
Ravel ("Bolero"), Sibelius
("Valse Triste"), Vivaldi ("Con
certo in C Minor"), and
Stravinsky ("The Firebird").
Scenarios include a man who
marches to a different drum
mer turning around to see
everyone else marching to the
same drummer . . . evolution

beginning with a drop of coke
bottle fizz . . . the Garden of
Eden, Adam and Eve not too
tempted because the snake
eats the apple and gets a jump
on mankind.
Creator Bruno Bozetto has
animated children's cartoons
and features with satiric bites
on life.
Critics have called "Allegro
non troppo" a masterwork of
animation and imagination.
Time hailed the "sardonic
. . . ironic nature . . . (which)
aspires to do for modern audi
ences what 'Fantasia' did in its
day: demonstrate the state of
the animator's art as it now
exists and lightly suggest its
many and varied possibilities
as a medium for serious ex

pression. In this regard, it is
quite successful."
The movie is irreverent and
irrelevant, according to Boz
zetto, but something "all must
see if they are to enjoy any
thing ever again."
The Italian filmmaker
worked "long and occasionally
hard" to coordinate a studioful
of orchestras and singers with
"psychedelic artistry" and
"impish delight."
Bozzetto glories in "my Bol
ero â€” Disney's Rite of Spring
done up in mock." Other favo
rites include the "Valse Triste"
sequence where a forlorn cat
remembers the comforts of
home in a warm kitchen with
overstuffed chairs and lots of
time for sitting pretty.
Another high spot, Bozzetto
says, is the "Concerto in C
Minor" which follows a hon
eybee's summer day ruined by
a human couple's amorous and
ridiculously passionate affair.
The finale, which the
filmmaker will not reveal, is
"complete with ogre and THE
END in big letters."
Though "Allegro non
troppo" may upset the classic
connoisseurs of music, Disney
and "Fantasia," it cannot be
left out of any review of the
year's most important movies.
