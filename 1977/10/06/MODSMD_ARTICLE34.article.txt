'Portrait of The Artist . . .

Joseph Strick's film of James
loyce's "A Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man" follows a
pathetically ill-equipped stu
dent who leaves school with
out a familiarity with Stephen
Dedalus and his nets.
But Strick, who brought
"Ulysses" to the screen about
10 years ago, once again seems
to be wrestling with material
that effectively masters him.
Strick stands in awe of Joyce,
and refuses to take the neces
sary initiative to translate a
literary medium into a cinema.
"Portrait" attempts to dupli
cate the novel rather than to
augment or interpret it. Much
of the trouble arises from the
screenplay by former Stanford

student Judith Rascoe, who
preserves Joyce's prose to a
fault.
From the opening scene with
the moo cow, "Portrait" re
mains mired in the literal.
The intellectual and spiritual
tension in the second halt of
the novel is basically cerebral
and internal, not visual and
dramatic. Talk does not make
good theater, as Henry lames
discovered in his playwriting.
In the film, we simply hear
Stephen (played by Bosco Ho
gan, who resembles Hunter S.
Thompson and William Chace
more than the young Joyce)
declaim to his friends.
Strick asks us to accept
Stephen's genius without con-

vincing us that it really exists.
Hogan's healthy and placid
demeanor and his monoton
ous delivery approach the
soporific.
Everything is too clean. This
movie should not make one
thing of "Elvira Madigan," but
it does. Joyce's stormy 6/7
dungsroman becomes a tran
quil romance.
The film is in color, the Irish
countryside is lushly verdant
and even the Dublin prosti
tutes look fragrant, fresh, and
kind. Where is the squalor and
venereal disease? Given
Strick's depiction of Ireland,
one wonders why Stephen
goes into exile.
Though inadequate and un

adventurous, "Portrait" is
nonetheless a visually beauti
ful film. Also, John Cielgud's
sermon on hell is worth the
price of admission. Putrefac
tion and burning brimstone
have seldom had a more
eloquent spokesman.
Lines from loyce's novel re
main intact and can at least
bring a reminiscent pleasure to
those familiar with the text.
Strick was understandably re

luctant to take liberties with
Joyce's book, but a dash of
noble daring would have been
more Joycean in spirit than so
much reverence arid reticence.
"A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man" had its American
premiere at UC-Berkeley this
week. According to CAL films
director Ken Stutz, the 16mm
(in 35mm blowup) will proba
bly resurface next year.
