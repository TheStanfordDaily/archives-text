Originally scheduled for completion this month,
the new Tanner Fountain remains a construction
site. The $250,000 project will be finished by the
end of the quarter, according to Associate Provost
Edward Shaw, after additional utility work in the

streets delayed work on the project. The fountain,
which occupies the space of Serra Street between
Hoover Tower and Memorial Auditorium, will not
be activated until the drought ends, Shaw said.
