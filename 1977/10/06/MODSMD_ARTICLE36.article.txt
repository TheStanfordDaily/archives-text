## 
### Andrea lames 
Current laws requiring U.S.
medical schools to accept
American students now study
ing abroad "must be
changed," Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) said last week.
Former president Gerald
Ford last year signed a bill
which required medical
schools to waive their own ad
mission standards when admit
ting students formerly enrolled
in foreign schools.
Speaking in New York City
last Tuesday, Kennedy told the
American Medical Writers As
sociation that the Health Man
power Act is "a bad law which
must be changed. It will be
changed and changed soon

and it should never have been
enacted."
He called it "an unwarranted
intrusion by the federal gov
ernment into medicine."
Stanford School of Medicine
officials have indicated they
would rather not receive
$410,000 in federal grants as
sociated with the act than ac
cept students who don't meet
Stanford's admission stan
dards.
Requirements for students
in the program include passing
one section of the national
board examinations, complet
ing two years of medical school
and beingenrolled in a medical
school prior to Oct. 12, 1976,
the date of the law's passage.

Although 828 names are on
the list, Ruth Johnson, a
spokesperson for Department
of Health, Education and Wel
fare (HEW), stressed that not all
will necessarily transfer to
American schools.
"Schools can still refuse ad
mission on standards other
than academic qualifications
and geographic residence,"
Johnson said. "Admission de
nials can still be made on low
ratings in personality and
character, communications
skills, and other categories."
Johnson added that both
schools and students can list
their preferences of enroll
ment. A "matching program"
is scheduled for March, 1978.
"Students still go through
the entire admissions process
with schools," she said.
"Schools are also given the
opportunity to request a
waiver until Dec. 1, in case too
many apportionments are
given to a certain facility."
Rep. Paul Rogers (D-Fla.),
who proposed the act, has now
introduced a bill amending his
own law.
Rogers' proposal would re
quire schools to expand their
third-year enrollments by 12
per cent over two years.
Kennedy, chairman of the
Senate subcommittee on
health and scientific research,
has proposed a bill as well,
which would request a one
year, five per cent enrollment
increase.
Spyros Andreopoulos, in
formation officer for the Medi
cal Center, says the purpose of
the original act was to provide
better education for the stu
dents.
"Apparently there is some
general agreement that (medi
cal students overseas) aren't
receiving adequate clinical
training," Andreopoulos said.
HEW has taken no position
on Kennedy's bill, but its offi
cials have stated that they do
favor Rogers' proposed
change.

given to a certain facility."
Rep. Paul Rogers (D-Fla.),
who proposed the act, has now
introduced a bill amending his
own law.
Rogers' proposal would re
quire schools to expand their
third-year enrollments by 12
per cent over two years.
Kennedy, chairman of the
Senate subcommittee on
health and scientific research,
has proposed a bill as well,
which would request a one
year, five per cent enrollment
increase.
Spyros Andreopoulos, in
formation officer for the Medi
cal Center, says the purpose of
the original act was to provide
better education for the stu
dents.
"Apparently there is some
general agreement that (medi
cal students overseas) aren't
receiving adequate clinical
training," Andreopoulos said.
HEW has taken no position
on Kennedy's bill, but its offi
cials have stated that they do
favor Rogers' proposed
change.
Current laws requiring U.S.
medical schools to accept
American students now study
ing abroad "must be
changed," Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) said last week.
Former president Gerald
Ford last year signed a bill
which required medical
schools to waive their own ad
mission standards when admit
ting students formerly enrolled
in foreign schools.
Speaking in New York City
last Tuesday, Kennedy told the
American Medical Writers As
sociation that the Health Man
power Act is "a bad law which
must be changed. It will be
changed and changed soon

and it should never have been
enacted."
He called it "an unwarranted
intrusion by the federal gov
ernment into medicine."
Stanford School of Medicine
officials have indicated they
would rather not receive
$410,000 in federal grants as
sociated with the act than ac
cept students who don't meet
Stanford's admission stan
dards.
Requirements for students
in the program include passing
one section of the national
board examinations, complet
ing two years of medical school
and beingenrolled in a medical
school prior to Oct. 12, 1976,
the date of the law's passage.

Although 828 names are on
the list, Ruth Johnson, a
spokesperson for Department
of Health, Education and Wel
fare (HEW), stressed that not all
will necessarily transfer to
American schools.
"Schools can still refuse ad
mission on standards other
than academic qualifications
and geographic residence,"
Johnson said. "Admission de
nials can still be made on low
ratings in personality and
character, communications
skills, and other categories."
Johnson added that both
schools and students can list
their preferences of enroll
ment. A "matching program"
is scheduled for March, 1978.
"Students still go through
the entire admissions process
with schools," she said.
"Schools are also given the
opportunity to request a
waiver until Dec. 1, in case too
many apportionments are
given to a certain facility."
