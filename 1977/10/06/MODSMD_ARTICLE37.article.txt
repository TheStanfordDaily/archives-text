sponsored by the ASSU on a
non-profit basis.

pairing your Bug or sipping
Rose? A new collection of
non-credit classes, sponsored

ASSU Assistant Financial
Manager Julie Gavin, says,
"The general response has
been excellent. I get three or
four calls daily inquiring about
the program."
Because of the enthusiasm
displayed, there is a good pos
sibility for expansion of the
prog-am. The ASSU is open to
suggestion for new classes
and plans to continue the pre
sent course offerings.
Those offered this quarter
include Auto Mechanics, Car
diopulmonary Resuscitation,
Enology and Frisbee.
Auto mechanics is taught by
Kevin Ohlson, who has been a
mechanic for 10 years, and last
year taught a SWOPSI course
in consumer awareness of the
automobile industry.

Ohlson's objective is to give
students a clearer understand
ing of mechanics so that they
can fix minor problems them
selves, and so that they don't
get taken when a mechanic is
needed. Two of the five ses
sions will be "under the hood"
experience, and the other
three will utilize books and lec
tures for a background in con
sumer awareness and practical
application of mechanics.
