## President's trip: questions of why 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
jimmy Carter's eight-nation
trip next month raises several
questions, not least among
them: is he trying to make pol
icy or change the subject?
This is a bad season for Car
ter in Washington, and one
way to look good at home is
with a successful mission ab
road.
At home, he faces:
—Senate attacks on his
energy policy. A mounting
conservative drive against his
Panama Canal treaty, jews
upset about his moves in the
Middle East. Blacks complain
ing that he's not doing enough
about jobs. Criticism of his
program to reform welfare.
Opposition to some of his op
tions on taxes — even before
he's decided which to try.
And there are echoes of the
Lance affair.
There are other questions
about the trip:
Why?
—Why go at all?
—Why visit such countries as
Brazil, Nigeria, Iran and Po
land? They're hardly the center
stage of world affairs.
—Why honor Brazil and Iran
with a state visit? Their records
are less than exemplary on
human rights — one of the
President's biggest concerns.
—Why go now? Carter al
ready has been abroad once.
Before he was inaugurated, he
said he expected to do little or
no traveling overseas this year.
Why not wait until next year?
The president's national
security adviser, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, responded to these
questions a few days ago. Dur
ing a rare appearance at a
White House news briefing, he
provided a glimpse into the

administration's global think
ing.
First, he denied Carter is try
ing to change the subject.
"We are trying really to re
spond to some very fundamen
tal changes that are taking
place in the world . .
Brzezinski said. "He (Carter) is
really trying to show that our
foreign policy . . .is very much
concerned with renovating the
international system, with in
creasing the scope of interna
tional participation, with giving
the emerging powers a positive
and constructive role to play.
That, in a general sense, exp
lains why wewant to talk tothe
Brazilians, the Iranians, Nige
rians and others. . . .
As he did two weeks ago
when he announced the trip,
which also will include Ven
ezuela, India, France and Bel
gium, Brzezinski said the ad
ministration is not making
human rights a condition for
dealing with other govern
ments.
If Carter isn't making human
rights the centerpiece of rela
tions with Brazil and Iran, why
is he making it the key to U.S.
relations with South Africa?
"I think in a way that is not
only a difficult question to
raise, but a very good one,"
Brzezinski said.
As for timing, Brzezinski
gave this account:
"It was somewhere back in
March that the president said
to me that after one year has
passed from the date of the
election he would like to . . .
take a trip ... to more gener
ally symbolize the kind of
foreign policy he wishes this
country to adopt in relation
ships to the emerging global
problems. . . ."

tions with Brazil and Iran, why
is he making it the key to U.S.
relations with South Africa?
"I think in a way that is not
only a difficult question to
raise, but a very good one,"
Brzezinski said.
As for timing, Brzezinski
gave this account:
"It was somewhere back in
March that the president said
to me that after one year has
passed from the date of the
election he would like to . . .
take a trip ... to more gener
ally symbolize the kind of
foreign policy he wishes this
country to adopt in relation
ships to the emerging global
problems. . . ."
Washington (AP) — President
jimmy Carter's eight-nation
trip next month raises several
questions, not least among
them: is he trying to make pol
icy or change the subject?
This is a bad season for Car
ter in Washington, and one
way to look good at home is
with a successful mission ab
road.
At home, he faces:
—Senate attacks on his
energy policy. A mounting
conservative drive against his
Panama Canal treaty, jews
upset about his moves in the
Middle East. Blacks complain
ing that he's not doing enough
about jobs. Criticism of his
program to reform welfare.
Opposition to some of his op
tions on taxes — even before
he's decided which to try.
And there are echoes of the
Lance affair.
There are other questions
about the trip:
Why?
—Why go at all?
—Why visit such countries as
Brazil, Nigeria, Iran and Po
land? They're hardly the center
stage of world affairs.
—Why honor Brazil and Iran
with a state visit? Their records
are less than exemplary on
human rights — one of the
President's biggest concerns.
—Why go now? Carter al
ready has been abroad once.
Before he was inaugurated, he
said he expected to do little or
no traveling overseas this year.
Why not wait until next year?
The president's national
security adviser, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, responded to these
questions a few days ago. Dur
ing a rare appearance at a
White House news briefing, he
provided a glimpse into the

administration's global think
ing.
First, he denied Carter is try
ing to change the subject.
"We are trying really to re
spond to some very fundamen
tal changes that are taking
place in the world . .
Brzezinski said. "He (Carter) is
really trying to show that our
foreign policy . . .is very much
concerned with renovating the
international system, with in
creasing the scope of interna
tional participation, with giving
the emerging powers a positive
and constructive role to play.
That, in a general sense, exp
lains why wewant to talk tothe
Brazilians, the Iranians, Nige
rians and others. . . .
As he did two weeks ago
when he announced the trip,
which also will include Ven
ezuela, India, France and Bel
gium, Brzezinski said the ad
ministration is not making
human rights a condition for
dealing with other govern
ments.
If Carter isn't making human
rights the centerpiece of rela
tions with Brazil and Iran, why
is he making it the key to U.S.
relations with South Africa?
