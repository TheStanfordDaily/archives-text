# Loans available via new state bill
## 
### Lesile Boies 
A $2 million appropriation to
ensure the availability of loans
to low- and middle-income
students has been signed into
law, the governor's office re
ported Sunday.
The bill, AB 647 by Assemb
lyman John Vasconcellos
(D-San Jose), sets up the State
Guaranteed Loan Program to
operate in conjunction with
the Federal Guaranteed Stu
dent Loan Program.
Vasconcellos said he is "de
lighted" by the passage of his
bill as he has been working on
it for a year now, trying to
"bring together students and
lending institutions to create a
major student aid bill."
According to John Brown, a
lobbyist for the Independent
Association of California Col
leges and Universities, the
purpose of the bill is to "in
duce private lenders to lend to
students." In California, the
Student Aid Commission will
serve as loan agent.
The state will be the initial
guarantor of the loans, with the
federal government reinsuring
the loans at 100 per cent for up
to five years. Since "state gov

ernments are generally better
than the federal government at
collecting payments," said
Brown, both the banks and the
students will benefit by the bill.
Governor Jerry Brown's of
fice reported that in states
where legislation similar to AB
M 7 is in effect, loans to stu
dents by banks have increased
by $70 billion.
Larry Horton, asst. director
of government relations here,
said he believes the bill is a very
good one. He is "quite suppor
tive" of it.
However, there will proba
bly be "no basic change as far
as the University's operations
are concerned," said Robert
Huff, director of financial aids
and a member of the task force
convened by the Student Aid
Commission in 197f> to study
the bill's recommendations.
"The hope is that with the
state acting as the guarantor,
loans will generally be more
available and obtainable to
students who need them,
especially freshmen. It does
not appropriate more money
for loans by the University as
loans will continue to be made
by the banks."
