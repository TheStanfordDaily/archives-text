# Exploring the meaning of the word 'nerd'
## 
### 
A certain tribe of north-
Canadian eskimos has
more than 40 different designa
tions for the various forms of
frozen water; the agrarian
jungle-dwellers of a certain re
gion of the Amazon Basin have
a scheme of botanical nomenc
lature rivaling in complexity
ourown Latin binomial system.
Such linguistic oddities have
often been cited in support of
the idea that a language re
flects the peculiar preoccupa
tions of the particular group of
humans who use it;
If an anthropologist needed
evidence that the Stanford
community is an entity
sociologically distinct in some
measure from the surrounding
environs, hecouldfinditinour
unique use of the word
"nerd." Not listed in any dic
tionary, the word is unques
tionably pure slang. For the
rest of the English-speaking
world, it has uniformly nega
tive connotations. Examples of
its current usage are given fre
quently on the television show
Happy Days ("It means anyone
besides Fonzie," according to
one would-be lexicographer.)
At Stanford, however, it has a
much more exact significance.
I started to develop an intui
tive grasp of the word's local
meaning when midterm time
came around during my first
quarter here. I happened to go
to Meyer Library late one even
ing to check a reference book
and I could scarcely find a
place to sit. I first made the ac
quaintance of my next-door
neighbor in my dorm when she
asked me to turn my stereo off
(not down, she said, OFF). In
order to be sure that I would
not be late for my first midterm
— scheduled at eight in the
morning — I woke up 15 mi
nutes early and arrived at the
classroom with 10 minutes to
spare. When I entered, I was
immediately demoralized. It

was not so much the fact that
the room was already filled to
overflowing; rather, it was the
extraordinary number of
bleary eyes betraying a general
lack of sleep and, by implica
tion, a higher degree of pre
paredness than I possessed.
I continued to refine my un
derstanding of the term as the
year wore on: I met two or
three people who were taking
science and math courses exc
lusively, claimed to be doing
well and, most surprising,
were proud of it. I had one par
ticularly unpleasant experi
ence when I stood for 25 mi
nutes after getting a midterm
back waiting to ask the teach
ing assistant about what
seemed to be a 25 point error in
my test grade. A steady stream
of my classmates came up and
interposed themselves bet
ween the TA and myself — by
physical force, if it seemed
necessary. This culminated in a
10 minute haggle by one ex
tremely persistent zealot who
manifested a disproportionate
sense of persecution when he
was denied two points of par
tial credit for what appeared to
be an obviously wrong answer.
Every member of the com
munity has his own ideas about
what is "nerdish" and the rela
tive number of students who
deserve this label. The only
points on which there is any
thing close to agreement is that
the phenomenon of "ner
dism" does exist and that it is
one of the most unpleasant as
pects of studying at Stanford.
Several weeks ago, I spoke
with Dr. David Dorosin,
head of Cowell Counseling
Services, to find out what he
believes are the causes of
"nerdishness." While I was on
my way to Houston House, a
comfortable, barely converted
residence on Salvatierra Street,
I tried to frame the questions I
would ask without employing

the word "nerd." As useful and
direct as the term is, I doubted
that Dorosin would have
exactly the same conception of
it as I do. After I was ushered
into Dorosin's spacious office,
I broached the topic using such
terms as "excessive competi
tion" and "unreasonable
academic intensity." Despite
the inexactness of these de
scriptions, Dorosin seemed to
know exactly what I was talking
about and started to answer
the question in terms of my
word "unreasonable."
"It all hinges on the defini
tion of reasonable, I guess," he
said. "People are very goal
oriented and highly striving
here. The kind of people who
come here have high expec
tancies for themselves and
usually have been treated by
their families and their schools
as people who have special
abilities and special expecta
tions.
"But I guess it all hinges on
reasonable. What is reasona
ble? I think the reality which is
seen by many people at Stan
ford is that they live in a very
competitive environment. To
come to a Stanford of itself is
not insurance for a meaningful
role in American society. That
is to say that people are more
career-oriented. They see their
undergraduate experience as
not very leisurely. It's an op
portunity to distinguish them
selves so that they can get into
professional school or
graduate school. But it's cer
tainly not a place to get gent
lemen's Cs and go back to the
family business."
As Dorosin spoke, he ex
tracted a cigarette from a pack
in his pocket and gestured with
it, unlit. After pausing to light a
match, he returned to the
question of reasonableness.
"But is it reasonable? That's
the question. We certainly see
people here in whom we think

it's a bit unreasonable. There's
no balance in their life. Just a
complete focus ... a kind of
feeling like unless I achieve a
certain kind of academic stan
dard, I'm nobody. Where a
person feels that he has always
been the top of something and
if he feels that he isn't the top
he isn't anybody. And he just
won't exist almost. That prob
ably is unreasonable.
"There is a great emphasis
placed on individualism now.
It's like a force that can get out
of hand. The psychoanalyst
would argue that in every indi
vidual is some grandiosity and
whether it's the reciprocal of
some inadequacy feelings or a
primary drive — it's a great de
bate among the
psychoanalysts. The technical
term is narcissism. We often
find such a heightened desire
to be distinctive in the people
we see here that they are
somewhat isolated from other
human beings. It can be a de
sire to excel, which leads to iso
lation and, paradoxically, often
this desire is in some way
coupled with the desire for this
distinctiveness to be a means
to relationships with others —
when in fact it's kind of self
defeating.
"We do live in an upwardly
mobile society where the
stress is on the individual and
individual achievement and
accomplishment. The Univer
sity certainly emphasizes that.
And there's no doubt that most
of the people who are here are
going to continue to live in
worlds similar to here, where
there is great value placed on
individual accomplishment. If
you look at the roles in society
that people at Stanford are
going to fill 10, 20 years hence,
you'll see many negative things
that seem to go along with
them — high incidences of al
coholism, of marital discord, of
smoking. Nineteen per cent of
the American people took Val
ium last year. There are just a
whole lot of indices that point
to the fact that there is a whole
lot of anxiety. There is some
evidence that suggests that
more competitive kinds of

lifestyles lead to this. This is
more conjectural, though.
"I do think there are many
advantages to our kind of soci
ety and its value system, I'm
not criticizing it, I'm just saying
that whatever the strategy,
whatever the basic orientation
of one's life, there's a cost. I
think the kinds of people we
attract and the kind of institu
tion it is has a cost. In indi
vidual lives. But there are gains
too, to keep the ledger
straight.
"I do think the economic
situation has got to be an influ
ence. With the liberal arts
graduate not being guaranteed
a job and feeling like he's got to
have a skill to sell. And this is
the message to people from
high school on. I think we've
always taken for granted that
with education came flexibil
ity, opportunity. But in the last
five or 10 years, we've seen
highly skilled people out of
jobs. So its not taken for
granted anymore that if you
learn to think you'll find a job.
"Another thing, I think, is
that we live in a more secular
society than in the past. I think
at one time religion was
another possibility. Where
man's relationship with God
was another way of defining
himself. But in a secular soci
ety, there are not many games
in town. Out of the 1000 or so
people we see a year — about
eight or nine per cent of the
student body — we do see
people who put all their eggs in
one basket and at some point
rebel or get so tightened up
they are paralyzed. To keep it
in perspective, there are many
people we don't see — who th
rive. Is it the environment? Is it
the individual? Is it some com
bination? It's hard to say.
As director of the Career
Planning and Placement
Center, Ralph Keller comes in
contact with dozens of stu
dents who are trying to make
the transition from the smaller
society of Stanford to the larger
society beyond. When I spoke
with him a few days after my
conversation with Dr. Dorosin,
he was quick to point out that
regardless of what is com
monly believed about the diffi
culty of finding a job, "grade
grabbing" does little to im
prove the situation.

was not so much the fact that
the room was already filled to
overflowing; rather, it was the
extraordinary number of
bleary eyes betraying a general
lack of sleep and, by implica
tion, a higher degree of pre
paredness than I possessed.
I continued to refine my un
derstanding of the term as the
year wore on: I met two or
three people who were taking
science and math courses exc
lusively, claimed to be doing
well and, most surprising,
were proud of it. I had one par
ticularly unpleasant experi
ence when I stood for 25 mi
nutes after getting a midterm
back waiting to ask the teach
ing assistant about what
seemed to be a 25 point error in
my test grade. A steady stream
of my classmates came up and
interposed themselves bet
ween the TA and myself — by
physical force, if it seemed
necessary. This culminated in a
10 minute haggle by one ex
tremely persistent zealot who
manifested a disproportionate
sense of persecution when he
was denied two points of par
tial credit for what appeared to
be an obviously wrong answer.
Every member of the com
munity has his own ideas about
what is "nerdish" and the rela
tive number of students who
deserve this label. The only
points on which there is any
thing close to agreement is that
the phenomenon of "ner
dism" does exist and that it is
one of the most unpleasant as
pects of studying at Stanford.
Several weeks ago, I spoke
with Dr. David Dorosin,
head of Cowell Counseling
Services, to find out what he
believes are the causes of
"nerdishness." While I was on
my way to Houston House, a
comfortable, barely converted
residence on Salvatierra Street,
I tried to frame the questions I
would ask without employing

the word "nerd." As useful and
direct as the term is, I doubted
that Dorosin would have
exactly the same conception of
it as I do. After I was ushered
into Dorosin's spacious office,
I broached the topic using such
terms as "excessive competi
tion" and "unreasonable
academic intensity." Despite
the inexactness of these de
scriptions, Dorosin seemed to
know exactly what I was talking
about and started to answer
the question in terms of my
word "unreasonable."
"It all hinges on the defini
tion of reasonable, I guess," he
said. "People are very goal
oriented and highly striving
here. The kind of people who
come here have high expec
tancies for themselves and
usually have been treated by
their families and their schools
as people who have special
abilities and special expecta
tions.
"But I guess it all hinges on
reasonable. What is reasona
ble? I think the reality which is
seen by many people at Stan
ford is that they live in a very
competitive environment. To
come to a Stanford of itself is
not insurance for a meaningful
role in American society. That
is to say that people are more
career-oriented. They see their
undergraduate experience as
not very leisurely. It's an op
portunity to distinguish them
selves so that they can get into
professional school or
graduate school. But it's cer
tainly not a place to get gent
lemen's Cs and go back to the
family business."
As Dorosin spoke, he ex
tracted a cigarette from a pack
in his pocket and gestured with
it, unlit. After pausing to light a
match, he returned to the
question of reasonableness.
"But is it reasonable? That's
the question. We certainly see
people here in whom we think

it's a bit unreasonable. There's
no balance in their life. Just a
complete focus ... a kind of
feeling like unless I achieve a
certain kind of academic stan
dard, I'm nobody. Where a
person feels that he has always
been the top of something and
if he feels that he isn't the top
he isn't anybody. And he just
won't exist almost. That prob
ably is unreasonable.
"There is a great emphasis
placed on individualism now.
It's like a force that can get out
of hand. The psychoanalyst
would argue that in every indi
vidual is some grandiosity and
whether it's the reciprocal of
some inadequacy feelings or a
primary drive — it's a great de
bate among the
psychoanalysts. The technical
term is narcissism. We often
find such a heightened desire
to be distinctive in the people
we see here that they are
somewhat isolated from other
human beings. It can be a de
sire to excel, which leads to iso
lation and, paradoxically, often
this desire is in some way
coupled with the desire for this
distinctiveness to be a means
to relationships with others —
when in fact it's kind of self
defeating.
"We do live in an upwardly
mobile society where the
stress is on the individual and
individual achievement and
accomplishment. The Univer
sity certainly emphasizes that.
And there's no doubt that most
of the people who are here are
going to continue to live in
worlds similar to here, where
there is great value placed on
individual accomplishment. If
you look at the roles in society
that people at Stanford are
going to fill 10, 20 years hence,
you'll see many negative things
that seem to go along with
them — high incidences of al
coholism, of marital discord, of
smoking. Nineteen per cent of
the American people took Val
ium last year. There are just a
whole lot of indices that point
to the fact that there is a whole
lot of anxiety. There is some
evidence that suggests that
more competitive kinds of

lifestyles lead to this. This is
more conjectural, though.
"I do think there are many
advantages to our kind of soci
ety and its value system, I'm
not criticizing it, I'm just saying
that whatever the strategy,
whatever the basic orientation
of one's life, there's a cost. I
think the kinds of people we
attract and the kind of institu
tion it is has a cost. In indi
vidual lives. But there are gains
too, to keep the ledger
straight.
"I do think the economic
situation has got to be an influ
ence. With the liberal arts
graduate not being guaranteed
a job and feeling like he's got to
have a skill to sell. And this is
the message to people from
high school on. I think we've
always taken for granted that
with education came flexibil
ity, opportunity. But in the last
five or 10 years, we've seen
highly skilled people out of
jobs. So its not taken for
granted anymore that if you
learn to think you'll find a job.
"Another thing, I think, is
that we live in a more secular
society than in the past. I think
at one time religion was
another possibility. Where
man's relationship with God
was another way of defining
himself. But in a secular soci
ety, there are not many games
in town. Out of the 1000 or so
people we see a year — about
eight or nine per cent of the
student body — we do see
people who put all their eggs in
one basket and at some point
rebel or get so tightened up
they are paralyzed. To keep it
in perspective, there are many
people we don't see — who th
rive. Is it the environment? Is it
the individual? Is it some com
bination? It's hard to say.

with him a few days after my
conversation with Dr. Dorosin,
he was quick to point out that
regardless of what is com
monly believed about the diffi
culty of finding a job, "grade
grabbing" does little to im
prove the situation.

the word "nerd." As useful and
direct as the term is, I doubted
that Dorosin would have
exactly the same conception of
it as I do. After I was ushered
into Dorosin's spacious office,
I broached the topic using such
terms as "excessive competi
tion" and "unreasonable
academic intensity." Despite
the inexactness of these de
scriptions, Dorosin seemed to
know exactly what I was talking
about and started to answer
the question in terms of my
word "unreasonable."
"It all hinges on the defini
tion of reasonable, I guess," he
said. "People are very goal
oriented and highly striving
here. The kind of people who
come here have high expec
tancies for themselves and
usually have been treated by
their families and their schools
as people who have special
abilities and special expecta
tions.
"But I guess it all hinges on
reasonable. What is reasona
ble? I think the reality which is
seen by many people at Stan
ford is that they live in a very
competitive environment. To
come to a Stanford of itself is
not insurance for a meaningful
role in American society. That
is to say that people are more
career-oriented. They see their
undergraduate experience as
not very leisurely. It's an op
portunity to distinguish them
selves so that they can get into
professional school or
graduate school. But it's cer
tainly not a place to get gent
lemen's Cs and go back to the
family business."
As Dorosin spoke, he ex
tracted a cigarette from a pack
in his pocket and gestured with
it, unlit. After pausing to light a
match, he returned to the
question of reasonableness.
"But is it reasonable? That's
the question. We certainly see
people here in whom we think

it's a bit unreasonable. There's
no balance in their life. Just a
complete focus ... a kind of
feeling like unless I achieve a
certain kind of academic stan
dard, I'm nobody. Where a
person feels that he has always
been the top of something and
if he feels that he isn't the top
he isn't anybody. And he just
won't exist almost. That prob
ably is unreasonable.
"There is a great emphasis
placed on individualism now.
It's like a force that can get out
of hand. The psychoanalyst
would argue that in every indi
vidual is some grandiosity and
whether it's the reciprocal of
some inadequacy feelings or a
primary drive — it's a great de
bate among the
psychoanalysts. The technical
term is narcissism. We often
find such a heightened desire
to be distinctive in the people
we see here that they are
somewhat isolated from other
human beings. It can be a de
sire to excel, which leads to iso
lation and, paradoxically, often
this desire is in some way
coupled with the desire for this
distinctiveness to be a means
to relationships with others —
when in fact it's kind of self
defeating.
"We do live in an upwardly
mobile society where the
stress is on the individual and
individual achievement and
accomplishment. The Univer
sity certainly emphasizes that.
And there's no doubt that most
of the people who are here are
going to continue to live in
worlds similar to here, where
there is great value placed on
individual accomplishment. If
you look at the roles in society
that people at Stanford are
going to fill 10, 20 years hence,
you'll see many negative things
that seem to go along with
them — high incidences of al
coholism, of marital discord, of
smoking. Nineteen per cent of
the American people took Val
ium last year. There are just a
whole lot of indices that point
to the fact that there is a whole
lot of anxiety. There is some
evidence that suggests that
more competitive kinds of

lifestyles lead to this. This is
more conjectural, though.
"I do think there are many
advantages to our kind of soci
ety and its value system, I'm
not criticizing it, I'm just saying
that whatever the strategy,
whatever the basic orientation
of one's life, there's a cost. I
think the kinds of people we
attract and the kind of institu
tion it is has a cost. In indi
vidual lives. But there are gains
too, to keep the ledger
straight.
"I do think the economic
situation has got to be an influ
ence. With the liberal arts
graduate not being guaranteed
a job and feeling like he's got to
have a skill to sell. And this is
the message to people from
high school on. I think we've
always taken for granted that
with education came flexibil
ity, opportunity. But in the last
five or 10 years, we've seen
highly skilled people out of
jobs. So its not taken for
granted anymore that if you
learn to think you'll find a job.
"Another thing, I think, is
that we live in a more secular
society than in the past. I think
at one time religion was
another possibility. Where
man's relationship with God
was another way of defining
himself. But in a secular soci
ety, there are not many games
in town. Out of the 1000 or so
people we see a year — about
eight or nine per cent of the
student body — we do see
people who put all their eggs in
one basket and at some point
rebel or get so tightened up
they are paralyzed. To keep it
in perspective, there are many
people we don't see — who th
rive. Is it the environment? Is it
the individual? Is it some com
bination? It's hard to say.
As director of the Career
Planning and Placement
Center, Ralph Keller comes in
contact with dozens of stu
dents who are trying to make
the transition from the smaller
society of Stanford to the larger
society beyond. When I spoke
with him a few days after my
conversation with Dr. Dorosin,
he was quick to point out that
regardless of what is com
monly believed about the diffi
culty of finding a job, "grade
grabbing" does little to im
prove the situation.

A certain tribe of north-

If an anthropologist needed
evidence that the Stanford
community is an entity

unique use of the word
"nerd." Not listed in any dic
tionary, the word is unques
tionably pure slang. For the
rest of the English-speaking
world, it has uniformly nega
tive connotations. Examples of
its current usage are given fre
quently on the television show
Happy Days ("It means anyone
besides Fonzie," according to
one would-be lexicographer.)
At Stanford, however, it has a
much more exact significance.
I started to develop an intui
tive grasp of the word's local
meaning when midterm time
came around during my first
quarter here. I happened to go
to Meyer Library late one even
ing to check a reference book
and I could scarcely find a
place to sit. I first made the ac
quaintance of my next-door
neighbor in my dorm when she
asked me to turn my stereo off
(not down, she said, OFF). In
order to be sure that I would
not be late for my first midterm
— scheduled at eight in the
morning — I woke up 15 mi
nutes early and arrived at the
classroom with 10 minutes to
spare. When I entered, I was
immediately demoralized. It

was not so much the fact that
the room was already filled to
overflowing; rather, it was the
extraordinary number of
bleary eyes betraying a general
lack of sleep and, by implica
tion, a higher degree of pre
paredness than I possessed.
I continued to refine my un
derstanding of the term as the
year wore on: I met two or
three people who were taking
science and math courses exc
lusively, claimed to be doing
well and, most surprising,
were proud of it. I had one par
ticularly unpleasant experi
ence when I stood for 25 mi
nutes after getting a midterm
back waiting to ask the teach
ing assistant about what
seemed to be a 25 point error in
my test grade. A steady stream
of my classmates came up and
interposed themselves bet
ween the TA and myself — by
physical force, if it seemed
necessary. This culminated in a
10 minute haggle by one ex
tremely persistent zealot who
manifested a disproportionate
sense of persecution when he
was denied two points of par
tial credit for what appeared to
be an obviously wrong answer.
Every member of the com
munity has his own ideas about
what is "nerdish" and the rela

deserve this label. The only
points on which there is any
thing close to agreement is that
the phenomenon of "ner
dism" does exist and that it is
one of the most unpleasant as
pects of studying at Stanford.
Several weeks ago, I spoke
with Dr. David Dorosin,
head of Cowell Counseling
Services, to find out what he
believes are the causes of
"nerdishness." While I was on
my way to Houston House, a
comfortable, barely converted
residence on Salvatierra Street,
I tried to frame the questions I
would ask without employing

the word "nerd." As useful and
direct as the term is, I doubted
that Dorosin would have
exactly the same conception of
it as I do. After I was ushered

it's a bit unreasonable. There's
no balance in their life. Just a
complete focus ... a kind of
feeling like unless I achieve a
certain kind of academic stan
dard, I'm nobody. Where a
person feels that he has always
been the top of something and
if he feels that he isn't the top
he isn't anybody. And he just
won't exist almost. That prob
ably is unreasonable.
"There is a great emphasis
placed on individualism now.
It's like a force that can get out
of hand. The psychoanalyst
would argue that in every indi
vidual is some grandiosity and
whether it's the reciprocal of
some inadequacy feelings or a
primary drive — it's a great de
bate among the
psychoanalysts. The technical
term is narcissism. We often
find such a heightened desire
to be distinctive in the people
we see here that they are
somewhat isolated from other
human beings. It can be a de
sire to excel, which leads to iso
lation and, paradoxically, often
this desire is in some way
coupled with the desire for this
distinctiveness to be a means
to relationships with others —
when in fact it's kind of self
defeating.
"We do live in an upwardly
mobile society where the
stress is on the individual and
individual achievement and
accomplishment. The Univer

And there's no doubt that most
of the people who are here are
going to continue to live in
worlds similar to here, where
there is great value placed on
individual accomplishment. If
you look at the roles in society
that people at Stanford are
going to fill 10, 20 years hence,
you'll see many negative things
that seem to go along with
them — high incidences of al
coholism, of marital discord, of
smoking. Nineteen per cent of
the American people took Val

whole lot of indices that point
to the fact that there is a whole

more competitive kinds of

more conjectural, though.
"I do think there are many
advantages to our kind of soci
ety and its value system, I'm
not criticizing it, I'm just saying
that whatever the strategy,
whatever the basic orientation
of one's life, there's a cost. I
think the kinds of people we
attract and the kind of institu

vidual lives. But there are gains
too, to keep the ledger
straight.
"I do think the economic
situation has got to be an influ

a job and feeling like he's got to
have a skill to sell. And this is
the message to people from
high school on. I think we've
always taken for granted that
with education came flexibil

five or 10 years, we've seen
highly skilled people out of
jobs. So its not taken for
granted anymore that if you
learn to think you'll find a job.
"Another thing, I think, is
that we live in a more secular
society than in the past. I think
at one time religion was
another possibility. Where
man's relationship with God
was another way of defining
himself. But in a secular soci
ety, there are not many games
in town. Out of the 1000 or so
people we see a year — about
eight or nine per cent of the
student body — we do see
people who put all their eggs in
one basket and at some point
rebel or get so tightened up
they are paralyzed. To keep it
in perspective, there are many
people we don't see — who th

the individual? Is it some com

As director of the Career

Center, Ralph Keller comes in
contact with dozens of stu

the transition from the smaller

with him a few days after my
conversation with Dr. Dorosin,
he was quick to point out that
regardless of what is com
monly believed about the diffi
culty of finding a job, "grade
grabbing" does little to im
prove the situation.

If an anthropologist needed

unique use of the word
"nerd." Not listed in any dic

rest of the English-speaking
world, it has uniformly nega
tive connotations. Examples of
its current usage are given fre
quently on the television show
Happy Days ("It means anyone
besides Fonzie," according to
one would-be lexicographer.)
At Stanford, however, it has a
much more exact significance.
I started to develop an intui
tive grasp of the word's local
meaning when midterm time
came around during my first
quarter here. I happened to go
to Meyer Library late one even
ing to check a reference book
and I could scarcely find a
place to sit. I first made the ac
quaintance of my next-door
neighbor in my dorm when she
asked me to turn my stereo off
(not down, she said, OFF). In
order to be sure that I would
not be late for my first midterm
— scheduled at eight in the
morning — I woke up 15 mi
nutes early and arrived at the
classroom with 10 minutes to
spare. When I entered, I was
immediately demoralized. It

was not so much the fact that
the room was already filled to
overflowing; rather, it was the
extraordinary number of
bleary eyes betraying a general
lack of sleep and, by implica
tion, a higher degree of pre
paredness than I possessed.
I continued to refine my un
derstanding of the term as the
year wore on: I met two or
three people who were taking
science and math courses exc
lusively, claimed to be doing
well and, most surprising,
were proud of it. I had one par
ticularly unpleasant experi
ence when I stood for 25 mi
nutes after getting a midterm
back waiting to ask the teach
ing assistant about what
seemed to be a 25 point error in
my test grade. A steady stream
of my classmates came up and
interposed themselves bet
ween the TA and myself — by
physical force, if it seemed
necessary. This culminated in a
10 minute haggle by one ex
tremely persistent zealot who
manifested a disproportionate
sense of persecution when he
was denied two points of par
tial credit for what appeared to
be an obviously wrong answer.
Every member of the com
munity has his own ideas about
what is "nerdish" and the rela
tive number of students who
deserve this label. The only
points on which there is any
thing close to agreement is that
the phenomenon of "ner
dism" does exist and that it is
one of the most unpleasant as
pects of studying at Stanford.
Several weeks ago, I spoke
with Dr. David Dorosin,
head of Cowell Counseling
Services, to find out what he
believes are the causes of
"nerdishness." While I was on
my way to Houston House, a
comfortable, barely converted
residence on Salvatierra Street,
I tried to frame the questions I
would ask without employing

the word "nerd." As useful and
direct as the term is, I doubted
that Dorosin would have
exactly the same conception of
it as I do. After I was ushered
into Dorosin's spacious office,
I broached the topic using such
terms as "excessive competi
tion" and "unreasonable
academic intensity." Despite
the inexactness of these de
scriptions, Dorosin seemed to
know exactly what I was talking
about and started to answer
the question in terms of my
word "unreasonable."
"It all hinges on the defini
tion of reasonable, I guess," he
said. "People are very goal
oriented and highly striving
here. The kind of people who
come here have high expec
tancies for themselves and
usually have been treated by
their families and their schools
as people who have special
abilities and special expecta
tions.
"But I guess it all hinges on
reasonable. What is reasona
ble? I think the reality which is
seen by many people at Stan
ford is that they live in a very
competitive environment. To
come to a Stanford of itself is
not insurance for a meaningful
role in American society. That
is to say that people are more
career-oriented. They see their
undergraduate experience as
not very leisurely. It's an op
portunity to distinguish them
selves so that they can get into
professional school or
graduate school. But it's cer
tainly not a place to get gent
lemen's Cs and go back to the
family business."
As Dorosin spoke, he ex
tracted a cigarette from a pack
in his pocket and gestured with
it, unlit. After pausing to light a
match, he returned to the
question of reasonableness.
"But is it reasonable? That's
the question. We certainly see
people here in whom we think

it's a bit unreasonable. There's
no balance in their life. Just a

smoking. Nineteen per cent of
the American people took Val

whole lot of indices that point
to the fact that there is a whole
lot of anxiety. There is some
evidence that suggests that
more competitive kinds of

more conjectural, though.

people we see a year — about
eight or nine per cent of the
student body — we do see
people who put all their eggs in

rebel or get so tightened up

in perspective, there are many
people we don't see — who th

As director of the Career
Planning and Placement
Center, Ralph Keller comes in
contact with dozens of stu
dents who are trying to make
the transition from the smaller
society of Stanford to the larger
society beyond. When I spoke
with him a few days after my
conversation with Dr. Dorosin,
he was quick to point out that
regardless of what is com
monly believed about the diffi
culty of finding a job, "grade
grabbing" does little to im
prove the situation.

A certain tribe of north-
Canadian eskimos has
more than 40 different designa
tions for the various forms of
frozen water; the agrarian
jungle-dwellers of a certain re
gion of the Amazon Basin have
a scheme of botanical nomenc
lature rivaling in complexity
ourown Latin binomial system.
Such linguistic oddities have
often been cited in support of
the idea that a language re
flects the peculiar preoccupa
tions of the particular group of
humans who use it;
If an anthropologist needed
evidence that the Stanford
community is an entity
sociologically distinct in some
measure from the surrounding
environs, hecouldfinditinour
unique use of the word
"nerd." Not listed in any dic
tionary, the word is unques
tionably pure slang. For the
rest of the English-speaking
world, it has uniformly nega
tive connotations. Examples of
its current usage are given fre
quently on the television show
Happy Days ("It means anyone
besides Fonzie," according to
one would-be lexicographer.)
At Stanford, however, it has a
much more exact significance.
I started to develop an intui
tive grasp of the word's local
meaning when midterm time
came around during my first
quarter here. I happened to go
to Meyer Library late one even
ing to check a reference book
and I could scarcely find a
place to sit. I first made the ac
quaintance of my next-door
neighbor in my dorm when she
asked me to turn my stereo off
(not down, she said, OFF). In
order to be sure that I would
not be late for my first midterm
— scheduled at eight in the
morning — I woke up 15 mi
nutes early and arrived at the
classroom with 10 minutes to
spare. When I entered, I was
immediately demoralized. It

was not so much the fact that
the room was already filled to
overflowing; rather, it was the
extraordinary number of
bleary eyes betraying a general
lack of sleep and, by implica
tion, a higher degree of pre
paredness than I possessed.
I continued to refine my un
derstanding of the term as the
year wore on: I met two or
three people who were taking
science and math courses exc
lusively, claimed to be doing
well and, most surprising,
were proud of it. I had one par
ticularly unpleasant experi
ence when I stood for 25 mi
nutes after getting a midterm
back waiting to ask the teach
ing assistant about what
seemed to be a 25 point error in
my test grade. A steady stream
of my classmates came up and
interposed themselves bet
ween the TA and myself — by
physical force, if it seemed
necessary. This culminated in a
10 minute haggle by one ex
tremely persistent zealot who
manifested a disproportionate
sense of persecution when he
was denied two points of par
tial credit for what appeared to
be an obviously wrong answer.
Every member of the com
munity has his own ideas about
what is "nerdish" and the rela
tive number of students who
deserve this label. The only
points on which there is any
thing close to agreement is that
the phenomenon of "ner
dism" does exist and that it is
one of the most unpleasant as
pects of studying at Stanford.
Several weeks ago, I spoke
with Dr. David Dorosin,
head of Cowell Counseling
Services, to find out what he
believes are the causes of
"nerdishness." While I was on
my way to Houston House, a
comfortable, barely converted
residence on Salvatierra Street,
I tried to frame the questions I
would ask without employing

the word "nerd." As useful and
direct as the term is, I doubted
that Dorosin would have
exactly the same conception of
it as I do. After I was ushered
into Dorosin's spacious office,
I broached the topic using such
terms as "excessive competi
tion" and "unreasonable
academic intensity." Despite
the inexactness of these de
scriptions, Dorosin seemed to
know exactly what I was talking
about and started to answer
the question in terms of my
word "unreasonable."
"It all hinges on the defini
tion of reasonable, I guess," he
said. "People are very goal
oriented and highly striving
here. The kind of people who
come here have high expec
tancies for themselves and
usually have been treated by
their families and their schools
as people who have special
abilities and special expecta
tions.
"But I guess it all hinges on
reasonable. What is reasona
ble? I think the reality which is
seen by many people at Stan
ford is that they live in a very
competitive environment. To
come to a Stanford of itself is
not insurance for a meaningful
role in American society. That
is to say that people are more
career-oriented. They see their
undergraduate experience as
not very leisurely. It's an op
portunity to distinguish them
selves so that they can get into
professional school or
graduate school. But it's cer
tainly not a place to get gent
lemen's Cs and go back to the
family business."
As Dorosin spoke, he ex
tracted a cigarette from a pack
in his pocket and gestured with
it, unlit. After pausing to light a
match, he returned to the
question of reasonableness.
"But is it reasonable? That's
the question. We certainly see
people here in whom we think

it's a bit unreasonable. There's
no balance in their life. Just a
complete focus ... a kind of
feeling like unless I achieve a
certain kind of academic stan
dard, I'm nobody. Where a
person feels that he has always
been the top of something and
if he feels that he isn't the top
he isn't anybody. And he just
won't exist almost. That prob
ably is unreasonable.
"There is a great emphasis
placed on individualism now.
It's like a force that can get out
of hand. The psychoanalyst
would argue that in every indi
vidual is some grandiosity and
whether it's the reciprocal of
some inadequacy feelings or a
primary drive — it's a great de
bate among the
psychoanalysts. The technical
term is narcissism. We often
find such a heightened desire
to be distinctive in the people
we see here that they are
somewhat isolated from other
human beings. It can be a de
sire to excel, which leads to iso
lation and, paradoxically, often
this desire is in some way
coupled with the desire for this
distinctiveness to be a means
to relationships with others —
when in fact it's kind of self
defeating.
"We do live in an upwardly
mobile society where the
stress is on the individual and
individual achievement and
accomplishment. The Univer
sity certainly emphasizes that.
And there's no doubt that most
of the people who are here are
going to continue to live in
worlds similar to here, where
there is great value placed on
individual accomplishment. If
you look at the roles in society
that people at Stanford are
going to fill 10, 20 years hence,
you'll see many negative things
that seem to go along with
them — high incidences of al
coholism, of marital discord, of
smoking. Nineteen per cent of
the American people took Val
ium last year. There are just a
whole lot of indices that point
to the fact that there is a whole
lot of anxiety. There is some
