"I suspect Dr. Dorosin is
right," he said. "Students do
compete because they are
concerned about jobs. But if
they think their grades are a
factor in gaining employment
— that is just not the case. I
think it is the nature of the per
son more than his competence
that employers are interested
in. I mean, most students here

have more than enough com
petence. They just need the
opportunity to succeed. I think
the record will show that it's
not the people who get the
highest grades who get the
best jobs, it's the imaginative,
highly creative, highly moti
vated ones.
"It is pretty hard to know
what is cause and effect in this
situation. The effect that
people compete is obvious.
But the cause for that is not ob
vious at all. Whether it is the
expectations of their parents or
a fear of failure, I don't know."
Because of his busy
schedule, I was not able to
speak with University Presi
dent Richard Lyman in person,
but he did find time to respond
to my inquiries in writing. "I
suspect that it isn't so much
'the perceived lack of jobs' (the
phraseology of my question) as
the 'perceived competitive
ness of admissions to the bet
ter graduate and professional
schools,' " he wrote.

Nonetheless, in his annual
address to the incoming
freshman class, Lyman noted
"the falling off of the number
who see the University as the
logical springboard for the re
volution and the increase in
the number who, even as they
start college, are already think
ing about how to make a living
when they get through."
Lyman is by no means the
only educator to have ob
served that students are now
pursuing their own individual
ends in conventional society
with all the zeal they once de
voted to attaining a collective
goal by trying to change the
world.
Norm Robinson, currently
acting associate dean of stu
dent affairs — a job which con
sists largely of overseeing the
residential education program
— was a graduate student here
from 1968 until 1971. "That was
when the protest movement
was at its strongest," he told
me a few days after my discus
sion with Keller. "There wasn't
that obsession with 'What am I
going to do when I get out of
here.' I think people were, at
least outwardly, less con

cerned about their own per
sonal futures and people
thought in larger terms —
'What kind of position is the
world in?' 'What are we going
to leave to the next genera
tion?' 'Is there going to be a
next generation?'
"Clearly it's moved away
from that now. People really
are much more — I don't want
to say self-centered, because I
don't mean it in a selfish way —
but they're much more con
cerned with their own personal
futures. Why it's hard to tell."
I asked Robinson whether
the atmosphere of "nerdish
ness" ever manifested itself to
him and other administrators
and he quickly replied in the
affirmative.
"One place where we see it
is in the residences. Even
though I personally don't live
in an undergraduate resi-

dence, I hear RAs and resident
fellows talking about it fre
quently. How much people
study. How much more dif
ficult it is to get people in the
residences to participate in any
kind of program or activity
which they don't see as directly
beneficial in terms of grades."
"One problem which is re
lated to this is that there seems
to be an increasing unwilling
ness on the part of students to
be sensitive to or be accepting
of, or willing to learn from
people whose values, lifestyles
or whatever differ from what's
seen as the norm here. And
that's troubling because one of
the benefits of a place like
Stanford is that you can learn
from people who are different
— provided you are willing to
learn from them."
Another manifestation of ex
cessive grade-consciousness,
he said, is found in students
who see the University only as
one rung on the ladder to suc
cess. "I'm always intrigued by

people who come out of an
exam and say 'Boy, did I ever
over-study for that,' — because
it conveys the idea that people
were studying for that particu
lar exam. I know that goes on
— I did it myself when I was in
school. But there is something
odd about the notion 'I learned
too much. I didn't get a chance
to show everything I knew,
therefore, why did I have to
know it?' It would be nice if we
could somehow instill in
people the idea that it's impos
sible to know too much.

sists largely of overseeing the
residential education program
— was a graduate student here
from 1968 until 1971. "That was
when the protest movement
was at its strongest," he told
me a few days after my discus
sion with Keller. "There wasn't
that obsession with 'What am I
going to do when I get out of
here.' I think people were, at
least outwardly, less con

cerned about their own per
sonal futures and people
thought in larger terms —
'What kind of position is the
world in?' 'What are we going
to leave to the next genera
tion?' 'Is there going to be a
next generation?'
"Clearly it's moved away
from that now. People really
are much more — I don't want
to say self-centered, because I
don't mean it in a selfish way —
but they're much more con
cerned with their own personal
futures. Why it's hard to tell."
I asked Robinson whether
the atmosphere of "nerdish
ness" ever manifested itself to
him and other administrators
and he quickly replied in the
affirmative.
"One place where we see it
is in the residences. Even
though I personally don't live
in an undergraduate resi-

dence, I hear RAs and resident
fellows talking about it fre
quently. How much people
study. How much more dif
ficult it is to get people in the
residences to participate in any
kind of program or activity
which they don't see as directly
beneficial in terms of grades."
"One problem which is re
lated to this is that there seems
to be an increasing unwilling
ness on the part of students to
be sensitive to or be accepting
of, or willing to learn from
people whose values, lifestyles
or whatever differ from what's
seen as the norm here. And
that's troubling because one of
the benefits of a place like
Stanford is that you can learn
from people who are different
— provided you are willing to
learn from them."
Another manifestation of ex
cessive grade-consciousness,
he said, is found in students
who see the University only as
one rung on the ladder to suc
cess. "I'm always intrigued by

people who come out of an
exam and say 'Boy, did I ever
over-study for that,' — because
it conveys the idea that people
were studying for that particu
lar exam. I know that goes on
— I did it myself when I was in
school. But there is something
odd about the notion 'I learned
too much. I didn't get a chance
to show everything I knew,
therefore, why did I have to
know it?' It would be nice if we
could somehow instill in
people the idea that it's impos
sible to know too much.

"I suspect Dr. Dorosin is
right," he said. "Students do
compete because they are
concerned about jobs. But if
they think their grades are a
factor in gaining employment
— that is just not the case. I
think it is the nature of the per
son more than his competence
that employers are interested
in. I mean, most students here

have more than enough com
petence. They just need the
opportunity to succeed. I think
the record will show that it's
not the people who get the
highest grades who get the
best jobs, it's the imaginative,
highly creative, highly moti
vated ones.
"It is pretty hard to know
what is cause and effect in this
situation. The effect that
people compete is obvious.
But the cause for that is not ob
vious at all. Whether it is the
expectations of their parents or
a fear of failure, I don't know."
Because of his busy
schedule, I was not able to
speak with University Presi
dent Richard Lyman in person,
but he did find time to respond
to my inquiries in writing. "I
suspect that it isn't so much
'the perceived lack of jobs' (the
phraseology of my question) as
the 'perceived competitive
ness of admissions to the bet
ter graduate and professional
schools,' " he wrote.

Nonetheless, in his annual
address to the incoming
freshman class, Lyman noted
"the falling off of the number
who see the University as the
logical springboard for the re
volution and the increase in
the number who, even as they
start college, are already think
ing about how to make a living
when they get through."
Lyman is by no means the
only educator to have ob
served that students are now
pursuing their own individual
ends in conventional society
with all the zeal they once de
voted to attaining a collective
goal by trying to change the
world.

Another manifestation of ex
cessive grade-consciousness,
he said, is found in students
who see the University only as
one rung on the ladder to suc
cess. "I'm always intrigued by

people who come out of an
exam and say 'Boy, did I ever
over-study for that,' — because
it conveys the idea that people
were studying for that particu
lar exam. I know that goes on
— I did it myself when I was in
school. But there is something
odd about the notion 'I learned
too much. I didn't get a chance
to show everything I knew,
therefore, why did I have to
know it?' It would be nice if we
could somehow instill in
people the idea that it's impos
sible to know too much.

"I suspect Dr. Dorosin is
right," he said. "Students do
compete because they are
concerned about jobs. But if
they think their grades are a
factor in gaining employment
— that is just not the case. I
think it is the nature of the per
son more than his competence
that employers are interested
in. I mean, most students here

have more than enough com
petence. They just need the
opportunity to succeed. I think
the record will show that it's
not the people who get the
highest grades who get the
best jobs, it's the imaginative,
highly creative, highly moti
vated ones.
"It is pretty hard to know
what is cause and effect in this
situation. The effect that
people compete is obvious.
But the cause for that is not ob
vious at all. Whether it is the
expectations of their parents or
a fear of failure, I don't know."
Because of his busy
schedule, I was not able to
speak with University Presi
dent Richard Lyman in person,
but he did find time to respond
to my inquiries in writing. "I
suspect that it isn't so much
'the perceived lack of jobs' (the
phraseology of my question) as
the 'perceived competitive
ness of admissions to the bet
ter graduate and professional
schools,' " he wrote.

Nonetheless, in his annual
address to the incoming
freshman class, Lyman noted
"the falling off of the number
who see the University as the
logical springboard for the re
volution and the increase in
the number who, even as they
start college, are already think
ing about how to make a living
when they get through."
Lyman is by no means the
only educator to have ob
served that students are now
pursuing their own individual
ends in conventional society
with all the zeal they once de
voted to attaining a collective
goal by trying to change the
world.
Norm Robinson, currently
acting associate dean of stu
dent affairs — a job which con
sists largely of overseeing the
residential education program
— was a graduate student here
from 1968 until 1971. "That was
when the protest movement
was at its strongest," he told
me a few days after my discus
sion with Keller. "There wasn't
that obsession with 'What am I
going to do when I get out of
here.' I think people were, at
least outwardly, less con

cerned about their own per
sonal futures and people
thought in larger terms —
'What kind of position is the
world in?' 'What are we going
to leave to the next genera
tion?' 'Is there going to be a
next generation?'
"Clearly it's moved away
from that now. People really
are much more — I don't want
to say self-centered, because I
don't mean it in a selfish way —
but they're much more con
cerned with their own personal
futures. Why it's hard to tell."
I asked Robinson whether
the atmosphere of "nerdish
ness" ever manifested itself to
him and other administrators
and he quickly replied in the
affirmative.
"One place where we see it
is in the residences. Even
though I personally don't live
in an undergraduate resi-

dence, I hear RAs and resident
fellows talking about it fre
quently. How much people
study. How much more dif
ficult it is to get people in the
residences to participate in any
kind of program or activity
which they don't see as directly
beneficial in terms of grades."
"One problem which is re
lated to this is that there seems
to be an increasing unwilling
ness on the part of students to
be sensitive to or be accepting
of, or willing to learn from
people whose values, lifestyles
or whatever differ from what's
seen as the norm here. And
that's troubling because one of
the benefits of a place like
Stanford is that you can learn
from people who are different
— provided you are willing to
learn from them."
