next step. Those kind of
people are always oriented to a
very specific goal. When they
were in high school, they
wanted to go to Stanford.
When they're at Stanford they
want to go to law school. And
what they do on one step is
designed to get them onto the
next step up the ladder."
After thinking for a moment,
Robinson returned to the
question of the shift in campus
mood over the last several
years. "I'm not sure which has
been the prevailing mode on
campus. I wonder whether
what we saw in the late '60s was
an exception to what has been
a more traditional way of doing
things — which is what we're
seeing now. I think what we are
seeing now is not that much of
a change from the way things
were in the early '60s and the
'50s and so on. What kind of
effect that will have on people
when they get out is hard to
say. It's really hard to measure
the lasting effect of the Univer
sity experience. People may
not seem to change while they
are here, but it's hard to tell
what effect it's had when they
get out. I mean, some things
sink in and we don't think they
have. Vet it's inescapably evi
dent that there has been some
effect once they've been out
for several years."

The National Heart and Lung
Institute recently awarded
Dr. Meyer Friedman, of Mt.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco,
three quarters of a million dol
lars to conduct a five year in
quiry into the role of behavior
in heart disease. The sheer size
of the grant is enough to finally
legitimize the hypotheses con
tained in Friedman's book,
"Type A Behavior and your
Heart."
First published in 1974, the
book caused a sizable stir
among the lay public while it
received a dubious reception
from many members of the
medical profession. Its central
thesis is as simple as it is diffe
rent from the prevailing
thought regarding heart dis-

ease. "We believe (that) the
major cause of premature
coronary heart disease ... is
the specific behavior pattern
that we have designated Type
A. In the absence of Type A
Behavior Pattern, coronary
heart disease almost never oc
curs before 70 years of age, re
gardless of the fatty foods
eaten, the cigarettes smoked,
or the lack of exercise. But
when this behavior pattern is
present, corona y heart dis
ease can easily erupt in one's
30s or 405."

Two aspects of this theory
are especially interesting: one
is Friedman's estimate, based
on extensive demographic
sampling, that 50 per cent of
this country's population
exhibits Type A behavior, and
the other is his delineation of
the specific behavior patterns
which he feels indicate the
Type A personality. The most
significant one, he says, "is the
Type A man's 'habitual sense of
time urgency or hurry sick
ness.' " The main cause of
"hurry sickness," he says, is
that the inflicted person "in
cessantly strives to accomplish
too much or to participate in
too many events in the amount
of time he allots for these pur
poses." One of the many de
leterious effects which results,
if this "ever-increasing
harassment by a sense of time
urgency is not checked (is that)
eventually the Type A subject
begins to indulge in a
phenomenon that can and only

too often does, subvert his
creative and judgmental attri
butes. This phenomenon is
stereotyped thinking and ac
tion."
Other, more subtle, Type A
symptoms include an "increas
ing and ineluctable" committ
ment to "translating and
evaluating" the events of life in
terms of "numbers"; (" 'Last
year my company grossed a
profit before taxes of
$5,000,000,' the Type A
businessman proudly states.
Last year I performed 150 ap
pendectomies,' the Type A
surgeon just as proudly an
nounces. 'Last year my

laboratory published 18 arti
cles,' the Type A scientist even
more proudly announces.");
"certain characteristic gestures
or nervous tics," such as toe
tapping; a lack of interest in
the "broader satisfactions of
life and human culture," such
as "drama, philosophy, his
tory, science."
I spoke with Friedman sev
eral days ago with a view to de
termining whether there is any
correlation between Type A
behavior and "nerdism." I
asked him if taking on heavy
loads of difficult courses could
lead to "hurry sickness," if try
ing to learn too much in a li
mited space of time such as a
10-wpek quarter was one form
of striving "to accomplish too
much ... in the amount of
time (allotted)." I asked him
whether the observations on
the part people like Robinson
of "an increasing unwilling

ness ... to learn trom people
whose values . . . differ from
what's seen to be the norm,"
could in some way be related
to the Type A phenomenon of
"stereotyped thinking and ac
tion." And lasked himwhether
a preoccupation with grades
was one form of "translating
and evaluating" the events of
life in terms *112 numbers.
Friedman answered my
questions largely in the affir
mative, although he qualified
his response by saying that
those things are "part of going
to college." With respect to
grades, for example, he said,
"students are almost legiti-

mately preoccupied. They
have to be. It's unfortunate but
that's the way it is today."
I asked him whether Type A
habits might actually form in
college. "I think they begin
even earlier than in college,"
he said. "They probably begin
at least in high school."
Finally I asked him whether
the college environment, par
ticularly the environment at
Stanford, might tend to per
petuate Type A habits.
"Yes, I think the milieu at
Stanford is dreadful," he
answered. "It's too competi
tive. Not only the students but
the professors. It's contagious

— like a hothouse. Everything
breeds ambition. I don't know
quite for what — for careers I
guess."
Perhaps Friedman's most
significant conclusion in "Type
A Behavior and Your FHeart" is
his assertion that Type A be
havior "is not a psychosis or a
complex of worries or fears or
obsessions, but a socially ac
ceptable — indeed often
praised — form of conflict. . . .
The Type A pattern has until
quite recently been consi
dered — certainly in its less in
tensely developed state — not
only a perfectly normal Ameri
can way of thinking and living,
but an ideal state toward which
every young man and woman
should strive."

symptoms include an "increas
ing and ineluctable" committ
ment to "translating and
evaluating" the events of life in
terms of "numbers"; (" 'Last
year my company grossed a
profit before taxes of
$5,000,000,' the Type A
businessman proudly states.
Last year I performed 150 ap
pendectomies,' the Type A
surgeon just as proudly an
nounces. 'Last year my

laboratory published 18 arti
cles,' the Type A scientist even
more proudly announces.");
"certain characteristic gestures
or nervous tics," such as toe
tapping; a lack of interest in
the "broader satisfactions of
life and human culture," such
as "drama, philosophy, his
tory, science."
I spoke with Friedman sev
eral days ago with a view to de
termining whether there is any
correlation between Type A
behavior and "nerdism." I
asked him if taking on heavy
loads of difficult courses could
lead to "hurry sickness," if try
ing to learn too much in a li
mited space of time such as a
10-wpek quarter was one form
of striving "to accomplish too
much ... in the amount of
time (allotted)." I asked him
whether the observations on
the part people like Robinson
of "an increasing unwilling

ness ... to learn trom people
whose values . . . differ from
what's seen to be the norm,"
could in some way be related
to the Type A phenomenon of
"stereotyped thinking and ac
tion." And lasked himwhether
a preoccupation with grades
was one form of "translating
and evaluating" the events of
life in terms *112 numbers.
Friedman answered my
questions largely in the affir
mative, although he qualified
his response by saying that
those things are "part of going
to college." With respect to
grades, for example, he said,
"students are almost legiti-

mately preoccupied. They
have to be. It's unfortunate but
that's the way it is today."
I asked him whether Type A
habits might actually form in
college. "I think they begin
even earlier than in college,"
he said. "They probably begin
at least in high school."
Finally I asked him whether
the college environment, par
ticularly the environment at
Stanford, might tend to per
petuate Type A habits.
"Yes, I think the milieu at
Stanford is dreadful," he
answered. "It's too competi
tive. Not only the students but
the professors. It's contagious

— like a hothouse. Everything
breeds ambition. I don't know
quite for what — for careers I
guess."
Perhaps Friedman's most
significant conclusion in "Type
A Behavior and Your FHeart" is
his assertion that Type A be
havior "is not a psychosis or a
complex of worries or fears or
obsessions, but a socially ac
ceptable — indeed often
praised — form of conflict. . . .
The Type A pattern has until
quite recently been consi
dered — certainly in its less in
tensely developed state — not
only a perfectly normal Ameri
can way of thinking and living,
but an ideal state toward which
every young man and woman
should strive."

next step. Those kind of
people are always oriented to a
very specific goal. When they
were in high school, they
wanted to go to Stanford.
When they're at Stanford they
want to go to law school. And
what they do on one step is
designed to get them onto the
next step up the ladder."
After thinking for a moment,
Robinson returned to the
question of the shift in campus
mood over the last several
years. "I'm not sure which has
been the prevailing mode on
campus. I wonder whether
what we saw in the late '60s was
an exception to what has been
a more traditional way of doing
things — which is what we're
seeing now. I think what we are
seeing now is not that much of
a change from the way things
were in the early '60s and the
'50s and so on. What kind of
effect that will have on people
when they get out is hard to
say. It's really hard to measure
the lasting effect of the Univer
sity experience. People may
not seem to change while they
are here, but it's hard to tell
what effect it's had when they
get out. I mean, some things
sink in and we don't think they
have. Vet it's inescapably evi
dent that there has been some
effect once they've been out
for several years."

The National Heart and Lung
Institute recently awarded
Dr. Meyer Friedman, of Mt.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco,
three quarters of a million dol
lars to conduct a five year in
quiry into the role of behavior
in heart disease. The sheer size
of the grant is enough to finally
legitimize the hypotheses con
tained in Friedman's book,
"Type A Behavior and your
Heart."
First published in 1974, the
book caused a sizable stir
among the lay public while it
received a dubious reception
from many members of the
medical profession. Its central
thesis is as simple as it is diffe
rent from the prevailing
thought regarding heart dis-

ease. "We believe (that) the
major cause of premature
coronary heart disease ... is
the specific behavior pattern
that we have designated Type
A. In the absence of Type A
Behavior Pattern, coronary
heart disease almost never oc
curs before 70 years of age, re
gardless of the fatty foods
eaten, the cigarettes smoked,
or the lack of exercise. But
when this behavior pattern is
present, corona y heart dis
ease can easily erupt in one's
30s or 405."

Two aspects of this theory
are especially interesting: one
is Friedman's estimate, based
on extensive demographic
sampling, that 50 per cent of
this country's population
exhibits Type A behavior, and
the other is his delineation of
the specific behavior patterns
which he feels indicate the
Type A personality. The most
significant one, he says, "is the
Type A man's 'habitual sense of
time urgency or hurry sick
ness.' " The main cause of
"hurry sickness," he says, is
that the inflicted person "in
cessantly strives to accomplish
too much or to participate in
too many events in the amount
of time he allots for these pur
poses." One of the many de
leterious effects which results,
if this "ever-increasing
harassment by a sense of time
urgency is not checked (is that)
eventually the Type A subject
begins to indulge in a
phenomenon that can and only

too often does, subvert his
creative and judgmental attri
butes. This phenomenon is
stereotyped thinking and ac
tion."

question of the shift in campus
mood over the last several
years. "I'm not sure which has
been the prevailing mode on
campus. I wonder whether
what we saw in the late '60s was
an exception to what has been
a more traditional way of doing
things — which is what we're
seeing now. I think what we are
seeing now is not that much of
a change from the way things
were in the early '60s and the
'50s and so on. What kind of
effect that will have on people
when they get out is hard to
say. It's really hard to measure
the lasting effect of the Univer
sity experience. People may
not seem to change while they
are here, but it's hard to tell
what effect it's had when they
get out. I mean, some things
sink in and we don't think they
have. Vet it's inescapably evi
dent that there has been some
effect once they've been out
for several years."

The National Heart and Lung
Institute recently awarded
Dr. Meyer Friedman, of Mt.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco,
three quarters of a million dol
lars to conduct a five year in
quiry into the role of behavior
in heart disease. The sheer size
of the grant is enough to finally
legitimize the hypotheses con
tained in Friedman's book,
"Type A Behavior and your
Heart."
First published in 1974, the
book caused a sizable stir
among the lay public while it
received a dubious reception
from many members of the
medical profession. Its central
thesis is as simple as it is diffe
rent from the prevailing
thought regarding heart dis-

ease. "We believe (that) the
major cause of premature
coronary heart disease ... is
the specific behavior pattern
that we have designated Type
A. In the absence of Type A
Behavior Pattern, coronary
heart disease almost never oc
curs before 70 years of age, re
gardless of the fatty foods
eaten, the cigarettes smoked,
or the lack of exercise. But
when this behavior pattern is
present, corona y heart dis
ease can easily erupt in one's
30s or 405."

Two aspects of this theory
are especially interesting: one
is Friedman's estimate, based
on extensive demographic
sampling, that 50 per cent of
this country's population
exhibits Type A behavior, and
the other is his delineation of
the specific behavior patterns
which he feels indicate the
Type A personality. The most
significant one, he says, "is the
Type A man's 'habitual sense of
time urgency or hurry sick
ness.' " The main cause of
"hurry sickness," he says, is
that the inflicted person "in
cessantly strives to accomplish
too much or to participate in
too many events in the amount
of time he allots for these pur
poses." One of the many de
leterious effects which results,
if this "ever-increasing
harassment by a sense of time
urgency is not checked (is that)
eventually the Type A subject
begins to indulge in a
phenomenon that can and only

too often does, subvert his
creative and judgmental attri
butes. This phenomenon is
stereotyped thinking and ac
tion."
Other, more subtle, Type A
symptoms include an "increas
ing and ineluctable" committ
ment to "translating and
evaluating" the events of life in
terms of "numbers"; (" 'Last
year my company grossed a
profit before taxes of
$5,000,000,' the Type A
businessman proudly states.
Last year I performed 150 ap
pendectomies,' the Type A
surgeon just as proudly an
nounces. 'Last year my

laboratory published 18 arti
cles,' the Type A scientist even
more proudly announces.");
"certain characteristic gestures
or nervous tics," such as toe
tapping; a lack of interest in
the "broader satisfactions of
life and human culture," such
as "drama, philosophy, his
tory, science."
I spoke with Friedman sev
eral days ago with a view to de
termining whether there is any
correlation between Type A
behavior and "nerdism." I
asked him if taking on heavy
loads of difficult courses could
lead to "hurry sickness," if try
ing to learn too much in a li
mited space of time such as a
10-wpek quarter was one form
of striving "to accomplish too
much ... in the amount of
time (allotted)." I asked him
whether the observations on
the part people like Robinson
of "an increasing unwilling

ness ... to learn trom people
whose values . . . differ from
what's seen to be the norm,"
could in some way be related
to the Type A phenomenon of
"stereotyped thinking and ac
tion." And lasked himwhether
a preoccupation with grades
was one form of "translating
and evaluating" the events of
life in terms *112 numbers.
Friedman answered my
questions largely in the affir
mative, although he qualified
his response by saying that
those things are "part of going
to college." With respect to
grades, for example, he said,
"students are almost legiti-

mately preoccupied. They
have to be. It's unfortunate but
that's the way it is today."
I asked him whether Type A
habits might actually form in
college. "I think they begin
even earlier than in college,"
he said. "They probably begin
at least in high school."
Finally I asked him whether
the college environment, par
ticularly the environment at
Stanford, might tend to per
petuate Type A habits.
"Yes, I think the milieu at
Stanford is dreadful," he
answered. "It's too competi
tive. Not only the students but
the professors. It's contagious

— like a hothouse. Everything
breeds ambition. I don't know
quite for what — for careers I
guess."
Perhaps Friedman's most
significant conclusion in "Type
A Behavior and Your FHeart" is
his assertion that Type A be
havior "is not a psychosis or a
complex of worries or fears or
obsessions, but a socially ac
ceptable — indeed often
praised — form of conflict. . . .
The Type A pattern has until
quite recently been consi
dered — certainly in its less in
tensely developed state — not
only a perfectly normal Ameri
can way of thinking and living,
but an ideal state toward which
every young man and woman
should strive."

next step. Those kind of
people are always oriented to a
very specific goal. When they
were in high school, they
wanted to go to Stanford.
When they're at Stanford they
want to go to law school. And
what they do on one step is
designed to get them onto the
next step up the ladder."

"certain characteristic gestures
or nervous tics," such as toe
tapping; a lack of interest in
the "broader satisfactions of
life and human culture," such
as "drama, philosophy, his
tory, science."
I spoke with Friedman sev
eral days ago with a view to de
termining whether there is any
correlation between Type A
behavior and "nerdism." I
asked him if taking on heavy
loads of difficult courses could
lead to "hurry sickness," if try
ing to learn too much in a li
mited space of time such as a
10-wpek quarter was one form
of striving "to accomplish too
much ... in the amount of
time (allotted)." I asked him
whether the observations on
the part people like Robinson
of "an increasing unwilling

ness ... to learn trom people
whose values . . . differ from
what's seen to be the norm,"
could in some way be related
to the Type A phenomenon of
"stereotyped thinking and ac
tion." And lasked himwhether
a preoccupation with grades
was one form of "translating
and evaluating" the events of
life in terms *112 numbers.
Friedman answered my
questions largely in the affir
mative, although he qualified
his response by saying that
those things are "part of going
to college." With respect to
grades, for example, he said,
"students are almost legiti-

mately preoccupied. They
have to be. It's unfortunate but
that's the way it is today."
I asked him whether Type A
habits might actually form in
college. "I think they begin
even earlier than in college,"
he said. "They probably begin
at least in high school."
Finally I asked him whether
the college environment, par
ticularly the environment at
Stanford, might tend to per
petuate Type A habits.
"Yes, I think the milieu at
Stanford is dreadful," he
answered. "It's too competi
tive. Not only the students but
the professors. It's contagious

— like a hothouse. Everything
breeds ambition. I don't know
quite for what — for careers I
guess."
Perhaps Friedman's most
significant conclusion in "Type
A Behavior and Your FHeart" is
his assertion that Type A be
havior "is not a psychosis or a
complex of worries or fears or
obsessions, but a socially ac
ceptable — indeed often
praised — form of conflict. . . .
The Type A pattern has until
quite recently been consi
dered — certainly in its less in
tensely developed state — not
only a perfectly normal Ameri
can way of thinking and living,
but an ideal state toward which
every young man and woman
should strive."
