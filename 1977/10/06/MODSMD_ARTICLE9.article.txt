# On Western Culture: what fills the bill?
## 
### 
Western Culture Task Force

In December of 1976, the
Academic Senate instituted a
requirement in the study of
western culture for students
entering Stanford in the Au
tumn of 1978 and after, but not
for students already enrolled.
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies then created
our small task force to propose
and develop ways of satisfying
the requirement. We made our
first report to the university
community in the Daily, May 26
1977. We have met throughout
the summer and had the first of
what we hope will be many
conversations about our ideas
with Stanford students,
teachers and administrators,
and with teachers from other
universities and colleges which
have a similar requirement.
As a result of that first report
and our conversations, we
have received much useful ad
vice. This is our second report
to the community. We hope it
will elicit more responses from

you that can help shape our
thinking in the Autumn quar
ter, a crucial time for us be
cause we must make at least
preliminary recommendations
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and the
Academic Senate before
Christmas.
Considerations
Several considerations have
led us to agree, at least tenta
tively, on the kind of course we
would like to see satisfy the re
quirement. From the begin
ning we have assumed that the
Senate instituted the require
ment to ensure that all Stan
ford undergraduates would
study some of the important
works of western culture —
governmental and societal in
stitutions; writings of
philosophers, theologians,
scientists, historians, poets,
playwrights, and novelists; pic
tures, statues, buildings and
musical compositions — and
would be aware of their tem

poral relationship to each
other and would also under
stand some of their political,
social and economic contexts.
We also quickly agreed that
the study of the same works by
all of the students would have
great advantages. The vast
sweep of western culture
could yield a list — admittedly
just one of many — of intrinsi
cally interesting works. The
shared study of the same works
could bring a new vitality to the
intellectual life of students and
faculty.
In advanced courses the fa
culty could assume the stu
dents' knowledge of certain
works and build on that know
ledge. And the faculty, in work
ing together to prepare to
teach the works, would be en
couraged to think in ways that
transcend the boundaries bet
ween disciplines, an act of in
tellectual integration that we
believe useful.
Excellent instruction
We also assumed that the
Senate wanted the instruction
in the course to be excellent.
Most of the students with
whom we have talked, espe
cially those who look back on
their earlier education here
from the perspective of their
junior or senior year, argue
that excellent instruction usu
ally means small classes taught
by regular members of the fa
culty or very experienced
graduate students who have
completed or almost com
pleted their degrees. We think
they are right.
We realize that large lectures
provide an opportunity for ex
pert and often exciting
teachers to illuminate a subject
for many students; they also
cost less than small classes. But
their very size, in our view, en
courages an intellectual passiv
ity in their audience which
cannot easily be remedied by
discussion sections with teach
ing assistants.
It is also our impression that
freshmen and sophomores
have many, perhaps too many,
courses involving large lec
tures and sections. We prefer
small classes taught by mem
bers of the faculty or their near
equivalents because they make
possible an intellectually active
encounter with a work and also
with other persons' views of it.
Our preference for small
classes entails our acceptance
of the fact that most of the
teachers in the course would
not be experts in all the mate
rial they teach; the University
cannot afford enough experts
in every relevant field to teach
80 or 85 classes each quarter.
But the lack of specific ex
pertise does not worry us be
cause we think an intelligent,
educated non-expert can help
other intelligent people
achieve a serious understand
ing of a work and some of its
contexts. We also see no major
obstacle to non-experts being
further educated by their col
leagues with expertise in order
to improve their teaching of
the works.
Preferred model
These views of the desirable
content of a course satisfying
the requirement, and of the
best way to teach that course,
have led us to our preferred
model. At its core would be a
common list of works to be
studied and common examina
tions of them. Limited varia
tions in the works and exami
nations might accommodate
the special interests of the
teachers. The list would have
varying degrees of intensity
and superficiality; it might, for
example, emphasize works
from fifth-century B.C.

Greece, seventeenth-century
Europe and nineteenth and
twentieth century Europe and
America.
Students would study these
works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit clas
ses, with no more than 20 stu
dents in each class. Regular
members of the faculty would
teach as many as these classes
as possible. Post-doctoral pre
ceptors, hired especially for
this course, would teach the
others.
Lectures given by experts
would supplement the small
classes to deepen the students'
understanding of contexts,
exemplify different discipli
nary approaches to the works,
clarify particularly difficult
works, and help fill gaps bet
ween emphasized periods. But
there would be no more than
one lecture each week, and the
small classes would be at the
heart of the course.
Limitations
We think we are aware of
most of the limitations of this
model. It would be an expen
sive course to teach because of
its small classes. The choice of
periods to be emphasized and
works to be studied would leave
no one entirely happy — a fact
that is coming home to us
forcefully as we are preparing
sample syllabi for each quarter.
Western culture is in fact a
set of related cultures —
Jewish, Christian, northern
European, Mediterranean,
high, middle, and low, to men
tion only a few — and works on
the list could not do justice to
all of them. Although works
would be studied in some of
their intellectual, political, so
cial, and economic contexts,
limited time would make it im
possible in most instances to
acquire the historian's sense of
the work as a part of an entire
society.
Nevertheless, we think that
the study of some great works,
though not a course in history,
would create a sense of both
the continuities and discon
tinuities with the past that is
the basis of humanistic
thought and a sound, if li
mited, starting point for un
derstanding, appreciating and
criticizing western culture.
The task force has consi
dered other models, at least
two of which should be de
scribed here because they de
part radicallyfrom the first. The
second model would retain the
instruction in small classes,
supplemented by occasional
lectures. But instead of study
ing the same works, students
would choose a three-quarter
course, for a total of 15 units,
from a group of tracks on diffe
rent subjects such as the his
tory of institutions, intellectual
and literary history, or the his
tory of the performing arts.
Possibly more than one course
would be offered within each
track.
Large lectures
The third model would in
volve a similar choice of a
course from a group of tracks
but replace the small classes
with large lectures,
supplemented by sections
taught by teaching assistants or
post-doctoral preceptors. For
example, within a track that
emphasized the history of in
stitutions, History 1,2, and 3or
some modifications of that
series might satisfy the re
quirement. Within a track that
emphasized intellectual and
literary history, the Humanities
60 series might satisfy the re
quirement. This model is es
sentially the one recom
mended by the Committee on
Reform and Renewal of Liberal

Education at Stanford whose
work initiated the considera
tion of a requirement in west
ern culture several years ago.
Both the second and third
models offer choice from
among several courses, as op
posed to the first model's
common course for all stud
ents. We recognize the value
of choice, but we think it is
outweighed by the value of the
shared experience that the first
model offers. Separate tracks
would inevitably tend, we sus
pect, to become the provinces
of separate departments, and
an opportunity to encourage
the faculty as well as the stu
dents to think across discipli
nary lines would be lost.
Another reason we do not
favor the third model is its
great reliance on large lec
tures.
First year
Whichever model the Senate
ultimately adopts, we think the
requirement should be satis
fied in the first year whenever
possible and no later than the
second year. We continue to
assume that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the re
quirement. -
Because the first model
would be a complex and major
innovation, we think it should
not be finally required for all
students until it has been
tested in a pilot program with
students who volunteer to take
the course. A pilot program
would also make it possible to
move to one of the models in
volving multiple tracks if the
first model begins to appear
unsuccessful.
Those of you who read our
article of May 26 will remember
that we considered requiring
as many as three courses in ad
dition to and intimately related
to the common core, with
these courses satisfying three
of the existing six distribution
requirements in the
humanities or social sciences,
depending on their discipli
nary approach. We have not
reached an agreement on the
number or content of these
courses, although there seems
a movement within the task
force towards requiring at least
one additional course chosen
from a limited range of sub
jects, such as the history of sci
ence, the relationship between
technology and society, the
encounter of western culture
with a non-western culture, or
European and American im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America.
Taking shape
On this issue, as on our pre
ference for the first model, we
are still tentative in our think
ing and open to your views. But
our ideas are beginning to take
shape and the time for reach
ing preliminary decisions is fast
approaching, so we urge you
to express your opinions soon.
The student members of the
task force are Andy Brown and
Jon Reider; the faculty mem
bers are John Perry
(Philosophy), Nan Keohane
(Political Science), Paul Seaver
(History), and Ronald Rebholz
(English).
We will hold public forums
and speak in residences in late
October and November. If you
wish to have more details
about our proposals, to state
your opinions, to offer sugges
tions, or to arrange for meet
ings with members of the task
force, please write or phone

Because the first model

not be finally required for all
students until it has been
tested in a pilot program with
students who volunteer to take
the course. A pilot program
would also make it possible to
move to one of the models in

first model begins to appear
unsuccessful.
Those of you who read our
article of May 26 will remember
that we considered requiring
as many as three courses in ad
dition to and intimately related
to the common core, with
these courses satisfying three
of the existing six distribution
requirements in the
humanities or social sciences,
depending on their discipli
nary approach. We have not
reached an agreement on the
number or content of these
courses, although there seems
a movement within the task
force towards requiring at least
one additional course chosen
from a limited range of sub
jects, such as the history of sci
ence, the relationship between
technology and society, the
encounter of western culture
with a non-western culture, or
European and American im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America.
Taking shape
On this issue, as on our pre

Western Culture Task Force

In December of 1976, the
Academic Senate instituted a
requirement in the study of
western culture for students
entering Stanford in the Au
tumn of 1978 and after, but not
for students already enrolled.
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies then created
our small task force to propose
and develop ways of satisfying
the requirement. We made our
first report to the university
community in the Daily, May 26
1977. We have met throughout
the summer and had the first of
what we hope will be many
conversations about our ideas
with Stanford students,
teachers and administrators,
and with teachers from other
universities and colleges which
have a similar requirement.
As a result of that first report
and our conversations, we
have received much useful ad
vice. This is our second report
to the community. We hope it
will elicit more responses from

you that can help shape our
thinking in the Autumn quar
ter, a crucial time for us be
cause we must make at least
preliminary recommendations
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and the
Academic Senate before
Christmas.
Considerations
Several considerations have
led us to agree, at least tenta
tively, on the kind of course we
would like to see satisfy the re
quirement. From the begin
ning we have assumed that the
Senate instituted the require
ment to ensure that all Stan
ford undergraduates would
study some of the important
works of western culture —
governmental and societal in
stitutions; writings of
philosophers, theologians,
scientists, historians, poets,
playwrights, and novelists; pic
tures, statues, buildings and
musical compositions — and
would be aware of their tem

poral relationship to each
other and would also under
stand some of their political,
social and economic contexts.
We also quickly agreed that
the study of the same works by
all of the students would have
great advantages. The vast
sweep of western culture
could yield a list — admittedly
just one of many — of intrinsi
cally interesting works. The
shared study of the same works
could bring a new vitality to the
intellectual life of students and
faculty.
In advanced courses the fa
culty could assume the stu
dents' knowledge of certain
works and build on that know
ledge. And the faculty, in work
ing together to prepare to
teach the works, would be en
couraged to think in ways that
transcend the boundaries bet
ween disciplines, an act of in
tellectual integration that we
believe useful.
Excellent instruction
We also assumed that the
Senate wanted the instruction
in the course to be excellent.
Most of the students with
whom we have talked, espe
cially those who look back on
their earlier education here
from the perspective of their
junior or senior year, argue
that excellent instruction usu
ally means small classes taught
by regular members of the fa
culty or very experienced
graduate students who have
completed or almost com
pleted their degrees. We think
they are right.
We realize that large lectures
provide an opportunity for ex
pert and often exciting
teachers to illuminate a subject
for many students; they also
cost less than small classes. But
their very size, in our view, en
courages an intellectual passiv
ity in their audience which
cannot easily be remedied by
discussion sections with teach
ing assistants.
It is also our impression that
freshmen and sophomores
have many, perhaps too many,
courses involving large lec
tures and sections. We prefer
small classes taught by mem
bers of the faculty or their near
equivalents because they make
possible an intellectually active
encounter with a work and also
with other persons' views of it.
Our preference for small
classes entails our acceptance
of the fact that most of the
teachers in the course would
not be experts in all the mate
rial they teach; the University
cannot afford enough experts
in every relevant field to teach
80 or 85 classes each quarter.
But the lack of specific ex
pertise does not worry us be
cause we think an intelligent,
educated non-expert can help
other intelligent people
achieve a serious understand
ing of a work and some of its
contexts. We also see no major
obstacle to non-experts being
further educated by their col
leagues with expertise in order
to improve their teaching of
the works.
Preferred model
These views of the desirable
content of a course satisfying
the requirement, and of the
best way to teach that course,
have led us to our preferred
model. At its core would be a
common list of works to be
studied and common examina
tions of them. Limited varia
tions in the works and exami
nations might accommodate
the special interests of the
teachers. The list would have
varying degrees of intensity
and superficiality; it might, for
example, emphasize works
from fifth-century B.C.

Greece, seventeenth-century
Europe and nineteenth and
twentieth century Europe and
America.
Students would study these
works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit clas
ses, with no more than 20 stu
dents in each class. Regular
members of the faculty would
teach as many as these classes
as possible. Post-doctoral pre
ceptors, hired especially for
this course, would teach the
others.
Lectures given by experts
would supplement the small
classes to deepen the students'
understanding of contexts,
exemplify different discipli
nary approaches to the works,
clarify particularly difficult
works, and help fill gaps bet
ween emphasized periods. But
there would be no more than
one lecture each week, and the
small classes would be at the
heart of the course.
Limitations
We think we are aware of
most of the limitations of this
model. It would be an expen
sive course to teach because of
its small classes. The choice of
periods to be emphasized and
works to be studied would leave
no one entirely happy — a fact
that is coming home to us
forcefully as we are preparing
sample syllabi for each quarter.
Western culture is in fact a
set of related cultures —
Jewish, Christian, northern
European, Mediterranean,
high, middle, and low, to men
tion only a few — and works on
the list could not do justice to
all of them. Although works
would be studied in some of
their intellectual, political, so
cial, and economic contexts,
limited time would make it im
possible in most instances to
acquire the historian's sense of
the work as a part of an entire
society.
Nevertheless, we think that
the study of some great works,
though not a course in history,
would create a sense of both
the continuities and discon
tinuities with the past that is
the basis of humanistic
thought and a sound, if li
mited, starting point for un
derstanding, appreciating and
criticizing western culture.
The task force has consi
dered other models, at least
two of which should be de
scribed here because they de
part radicallyfrom the first. The
second model would retain the
instruction in small classes,
supplemented by occasional
lectures. But instead of study
ing the same works, students
would choose a three-quarter
course, for a total of 15 units,
from a group of tracks on diffe
rent subjects such as the his
tory of institutions, intellectual
and literary history, or the his
tory of the performing arts.
Possibly more than one course
would be offered within each
track.
Large lectures
The third model would in
volve a similar choice of a
course from a group of tracks
but replace the small classes
with large lectures,
supplemented by sections
taught by teaching assistants or
post-doctoral preceptors. For
example, within a track that
emphasized the history of in
stitutions, History 1,2, and 3or
some modifications of that
series might satisfy the re
quirement. Within a track that
emphasized intellectual and
literary history, the Humanities
60 series might satisfy the re
quirement. This model is es
sentially the one recom
mended by the Committee on
Reform and Renewal of Liberal

Education at Stanford whose
work initiated the considera
tion of a requirement in west
ern culture several years ago.
Both the second and third
models offer choice from
among several courses, as op
posed to the first model's
common course for all stud
ents. We recognize the value
of choice, but we think it is
outweighed by the value of the
shared experience that the first
model offers. Separate tracks
would inevitably tend, we sus
pect, to become the provinces
of separate departments, and
an opportunity to encourage
the faculty as well as the stu
dents to think across discipli
nary lines would be lost.
Another reason we do not
favor the third model is its
great reliance on large lec
tures.
First year
Whichever model the Senate
ultimately adopts, we think the
requirement should be satis
fied in the first year whenever
possible and no later than the
second year. We continue to
assume that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the re
quirement. -
Because the first model
would be a complex and major
innovation, we think it should
not be finally required for all

the basis of humanistic
thought and a sound, if li
mited, starting point for un
derstanding, appreciating and
criticizing western culture.
The task force has consi
dered other models, at least
two of which should be de
scribed here because they de
part radicallyfrom the first. The
second model would retain the
instruction in small classes,
supplemented by occasional
lectures. But instead of study
ing the same works, students
would choose a three-quarter
course, for a total of 15 units,
from a group of tracks on diffe
rent subjects such as the his
tory of institutions, intellectual
and literary history, or the his
tory of the performing arts.
Possibly more than one course
would be offered within each
track.
Large lectures
The third model would in
volve a similar choice of a
course from a group of tracks
but replace the small classes
with large lectures,
supplemented by sections
taught by teaching assistants or
post-doctoral preceptors. For
example, within a track that
emphasized the history of in
stitutions, History 1,2, and 3or
some modifications of that
series might satisfy the re
quirement. Within a track that
emphasized intellectual and
literary history, the Humanities
60 series might satisfy the re
quirement. This model is es
sentially the one recom
mended by the Committee on
Reform and Renewal of Liberal

Education at Stanford whose
work initiated the considera
tion of a requirement in west
ern culture several years ago.
Both the second and third
models offer choice from
among several courses, as op
posed to the first model's
common course for all stud
ents. We recognize the value
of choice, but we think it is
outweighed by the value of the
shared experience that the first
model offers. Separate tracks
would inevitably tend, we sus
pect, to become the provinces
of separate departments, and
an opportunity to encourage
the faculty as well as the stu
dents to think across discipli
nary lines would be lost.
Another reason we do not
favor the third model is its
great reliance on large lec
tures.
First year
Whichever model the Senate
ultimately adopts, we think the
requirement should be satis
fied in the first year whenever
possible and no later than the
second year. We continue to
assume that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the re
quirement. -
Because the first model
would be a complex and major
innovation, we think it should
not be finally required for all
students until it has been
tested in a pilot program with
students who volunteer to take
the course. A pilot program
would also make it possible to
move to one of the models in
volving multiple tracks if the
first model begins to appear
unsuccessful.
Those of you who read our
article of May 26 will remember
that we considered requiring
as many as three courses in ad
dition to and intimately related
to the common core, with
these courses satisfying three
of the existing six distribution
requirements in the
humanities or social sciences,
depending on their discipli
nary approach. We have not
reached an agreement on the
number or content of these
courses, although there seems
a movement within the task
force towards requiring at least
one additional course chosen
from a limited range of sub
jects, such as the history of sci
ence, the relationship between
technology and society, the
encounter of western culture
with a non-western culture, or
European and American im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America.
Taking shape
On this issue, as on our pre
ference for the first model, we
are still tentative in our think
ing and open to your views. But
our ideas are beginning to take
shape and the time for reach
ing preliminary decisions is fast
approaching, so we urge you
to express your opinions soon.

Western Culture Task Force

In December of 1976, the
Academic Senate instituted a
requirement in the study of
western culture for students
entering Stanford in the Au
tumn of 1978 and after, but not
for students already enrolled.
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies then created
our small task force to propose
and develop ways of satisfying
the requirement. We made our
first report to the university
community in the Daily, May 26
1977. We have met throughout
the summer and had the first of
what we hope will be many
conversations about our ideas
with Stanford students,
teachers and administrators,
and with teachers from other
universities and colleges which
have a similar requirement.
As a result of that first report
and our conversations, we
have received much useful ad
vice. This is our second report
to the community. We hope it
will elicit more responses from

you that can help shape our
thinking in the Autumn quar
ter, a crucial time for us be
cause we must make at least
preliminary recommendations
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and the
Academic Senate before
Christmas.
Considerations
Several considerations have
led us to agree, at least tenta
tively, on the kind of course we
would like to see satisfy the re
quirement. From the begin
ning we have assumed that the
Senate instituted the require
ment to ensure that all Stan
ford undergraduates would
study some of the important
works of western culture —
governmental and societal in
stitutions; writings of
philosophers, theologians,
scientists, historians, poets,
playwrights, and novelists; pic
tures, statues, buildings and
musical compositions — and
would be aware of their tem

poral relationship to each
other and would also under
stand some of their political,
social and economic contexts.
We also quickly agreed that
the study of the same works by
all of the students would have
great advantages. The vast
sweep of western culture
could yield a list — admittedly
just one of many — of intrinsi
cally interesting works. The
shared study of the same works
could bring a new vitality to the
intellectual life of students and
faculty.
In advanced courses the fa
culty could assume the stu
dents' knowledge of certain
works and build on that know
ledge. And the faculty, in work
ing together to prepare to
teach the works, would be en
couraged to think in ways that
transcend the boundaries bet
ween disciplines, an act of in
tellectual integration that we
believe useful.
Excellent instruction
We also assumed that the
Senate wanted the instruction
in the course to be excellent.
Most of the students with
whom we have talked, espe
cially those who look back on
their earlier education here
from the perspective of their
junior or senior year, argue
that excellent instruction usu
ally means small classes taught
by regular members of the fa
culty or very experienced
graduate students who have
completed or almost com
pleted their degrees. We think
they are right.
We realize that large lectures
provide an opportunity for ex
pert and often exciting
teachers to illuminate a subject
for many students; they also
cost less than small classes. But
their very size, in our view, en
courages an intellectual passiv
ity in their audience which
cannot easily be remedied by
discussion sections with teach
ing assistants.
It is also our impression that
freshmen and sophomores
have many, perhaps too many,
courses involving large lec
tures and sections. We prefer
small classes taught by mem
bers of the faculty or their near
equivalents because they make
possible an intellectually active
encounter with a work and also
with other persons' views of it.
Our preference for small
classes entails our acceptance
of the fact that most of the
teachers in the course would
not be experts in all the mate
rial they teach; the University
cannot afford enough experts
in every relevant field to teach
80 or 85 classes each quarter.
But the lack of specific ex
pertise does not worry us be
cause we think an intelligent,
educated non-expert can help
other intelligent people
achieve a serious understand
ing of a work and some of its
contexts. We also see no major
obstacle to non-experts being
further educated by their col
leagues with expertise in order
to improve their teaching of
the works.
Preferred model
These views of the desirable
content of a course satisfying
the requirement, and of the
best way to teach that course,
have led us to our preferred
model. At its core would be a
common list of works to be
studied and common examina
tions of them. Limited varia
tions in the works and exami
nations might accommodate
the special interests of the
teachers. The list would have
varying degrees of intensity
and superficiality; it might, for
example, emphasize works
from fifth-century B.C.

Greece, seventeenth-century
Europe and nineteenth and
twentieth century Europe and
America.
Students would study these
works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit clas
ses, with no more than 20 stu
dents in each class. Regular
members of the faculty would
teach as many as these classes
as possible. Post-doctoral pre
ceptors, hired especially for
this course, would teach the
others.
Lectures given by experts
would supplement the small
classes to deepen the students'
understanding of contexts,
exemplify different discipli
nary approaches to the works,
clarify particularly difficult
works, and help fill gaps bet
ween emphasized periods. But
there would be no more than
one lecture each week, and the
small classes would be at the
heart of the course.
Limitations
We think we are aware of
most of the limitations of this
model. It would be an expen
sive course to teach because of
its small classes. The choice of
periods to be emphasized and
works to be studied would leave
no one entirely happy — a fact
that is coming home to us
forcefully as we are preparing
sample syllabi for each quarter.
Western culture is in fact a
set of related cultures —
Jewish, Christian, northern
European, Mediterranean,
high, middle, and low, to men
tion only a few — and works on
the list could not do justice to
all of them. Although works
would be studied in some of
their intellectual, political, so
cial, and economic contexts,
limited time would make it im
possible in most instances to
acquire the historian's sense of
the work as a part of an entire
society.
Nevertheless, we think that
the study of some great works,
though not a course in history,
would create a sense of both
the continuities and discon
tinuities with the past that is
the basis of humanistic
thought and a sound, if li
mited, starting point for un
derstanding, appreciating and
criticizing western culture.
The task force has consi
dered other models, at least
two of which should be de

best way to teach that course,
have led us to our preferred
model. At its core would be a
common list of works to be
studied and common examina
tions of them. Limited varia
tions in the works and exami
nations might accommodate
the special interests of the
teachers. The list would have
varying degrees of intensity
and superficiality; it might, for
example, emphasize works
from fifth-century B.C.

Greece, seventeenth-century
Europe and nineteenth and
twentieth century Europe and
America.
Students would study these
works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit clas
ses, with no more than 20 stu
dents in each class. Regular
members of the faculty would
teach as many as these classes
as possible. Post-doctoral pre
ceptors, hired especially for
this course, would teach the
others.
Lectures given by experts
would supplement the small
classes to deepen the students'
understanding of contexts,
exemplify different discipli
nary approaches to the works,
clarify particularly difficult
works, and help fill gaps bet
ween emphasized periods. But
there would be no more than
one lecture each week, and the
small classes would be at the
heart of the course.
Limitations
We think we are aware of
most of the limitations of this
model. It would be an expen
sive course to teach because of
its small classes. The choice of
periods to be emphasized and
works to be studied would leave
no one entirely happy — a fact
that is coming home to us
forcefully as we are preparing
sample syllabi for each quarter.
Western culture is in fact a
set of related cultures —
Jewish, Christian, northern
European, Mediterranean,
high, middle, and low, to men
tion only a few — and works on
the list could not do justice to
all of them. Although works
would be studied in some of
their intellectual, political, so
cial, and economic contexts,
limited time would make it im
possible in most instances to
acquire the historian's sense of
the work as a part of an entire
society.
Nevertheless, we think that
the study of some great works,
though not a course in history,
would create a sense of both
the continuities and discon
tinuities with the past that is
the basis of humanistic
thought and a sound, if li
mited, starting point for un
derstanding, appreciating and
criticizing western culture.
The task force has consi
dered other models, at least
two of which should be de
scribed here because they de
part radicallyfrom the first. The
second model would retain the
instruction in small classes,
supplemented by occasional
lectures. But instead of study
ing the same works, students
would choose a three-quarter
course, for a total of 15 units,
from a group of tracks on diffe
rent subjects such as the his
tory of institutions, intellectual
and literary history, or the his
tory of the performing arts.
Possibly more than one course
would be offered within each
track.
Large lectures
The third model would in
volve a similar choice of a
course from a group of tracks
but replace the small classes
with large lectures,
supplemented by sections
taught by teaching assistants or
post-doctoral preceptors. For
example, within a track that
emphasized the history of in
stitutions, History 1,2, and 3or
some modifications of that
series might satisfy the re
quirement. Within a track that
emphasized intellectual and
literary history, the Humanities
60 series might satisfy the re
quirement. This model is es
sentially the one recom
mended by the Committee on
Reform and Renewal of Liberal

Education at Stanford whose
work initiated the considera
tion of a requirement in west
ern culture several years ago.
Both the second and third
models offer choice from
among several courses, as op
posed to the first model's
common course for all stud
ents. We recognize the value
of choice, but we think it is
outweighed by the value of the
shared experience that the first
model offers. Separate tracks
would inevitably tend, we sus
pect, to become the provinces
of separate departments, and
an opportunity to encourage
the faculty as well as the stu
dents to think across discipli
nary lines would be lost.
Another reason we do not
favor the third model is its
great reliance on large lec
tures.
First year
Whichever model the Senate
ultimately adopts, we think the
requirement should be satis
fied in the first year whenever
possible and no later than the
second year. We continue to
assume that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the re
quirement. -
Because the first model
would be a complex and major
innovation, we think it should
not be finally required for all
students until it has been
tested in a pilot program with
students who volunteer to take
the course. A pilot program
would also make it possible to
move to one of the models in
volving multiple tracks if the
first model begins to appear
unsuccessful.
Those of you who read our
article of May 26 will remember
that we considered requiring
as many as three courses in ad
dition to and intimately related
to the common core, with
these courses satisfying three
of the existing six distribution
requirements in the
humanities or social sciences,
depending on their discipli
nary approach. We have not
reached an agreement on the
number or content of these
courses, although there seems
a movement within the task
force towards requiring at least
one additional course chosen
from a limited range of sub
jects, such as the history of sci
ence, the relationship between
technology and society, the
encounter of western culture
with a non-western culture, or
European and American im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America.
Taking shape
On this issue, as on our pre
ference for the first model, we
are still tentative in our think
ing and open to your views. But
our ideas are beginning to take
shape and the time for reach
ing preliminary decisions is fast
approaching, so we urge you
to express your opinions soon.

Western Culture Task Force

In December of 1976, the
Academic Senate instituted a
requirement in the study of
western culture for students
entering Stanford in the Au
tumn of 1978 and after, but not
for students already enrolled.
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies then created
our small task force to propose
and develop ways of satisfying
the requirement. We made our
first report to the university
community in the Daily, May 26
1977. We have met throughout
the summer and had the first of
what we hope will be many
conversations about our ideas
with Stanford students,
teachers and administrators,
and with teachers from other
universities and colleges which
have a similar requirement.
As a result of that first report
and our conversations, we
have received much useful ad
vice. This is our second report
to the community. We hope it
will elicit more responses from

you that can help shape our
thinking in the Autumn quar
ter, a crucial time for us be
cause we must make at least
preliminary recommendations
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and the
Academic Senate before
Christmas.
Considerations
Several considerations have
led us to agree, at least tenta
tively, on the kind of course we
would like to see satisfy the re
quirement. From the begin
ning we have assumed that the
Senate instituted the require
ment to ensure that all Stan
ford undergraduates would
study some of the important
works of western culture —
governmental and societal in
stitutions; writings of
philosophers, theologians,
scientists, historians, poets,
playwrights, and novelists; pic
tures, statues, buildings and
musical compositions — and
would be aware of their tem

poral relationship to each
other and would also under
stand some of their political,
social and economic contexts.
We also quickly agreed that
the study of the same works by
all of the students would have
great advantages. The vast
sweep of western culture
could yield a list — admittedly
just one of many — of intrinsi
cally interesting works. The
shared study of the same works
could bring a new vitality to the
intellectual life of students and
faculty.
In advanced courses the fa
culty could assume the stu
dents' knowledge of certain
works and build on that know
ledge. And the faculty, in work
ing together to prepare to
teach the works, would be en
couraged to think in ways that
transcend the boundaries bet
ween disciplines, an act of in
tellectual integration that we
believe useful.
Excellent instruction
We also assumed that the
Senate wanted the instruction
in the course to be excellent.
Most of the students with
whom we have talked, espe
cially those who look back on
their earlier education here
from the perspective of their
junior or senior year, argue
that excellent instruction usu
ally means small classes taught
by regular members of the fa
culty or very experienced
graduate students who have
completed or almost com
pleted their degrees. We think
they are right.
We realize that large lectures
provide an opportunity for ex
pert and often exciting
teachers to illuminate a subject
for many students; they also
cost less than small classes. But
their very size, in our view, en
courages an intellectual passiv
ity in their audience which
cannot easily be remedied by
discussion sections with teach
ing assistants.
It is also our impression that
freshmen and sophomores
have many, perhaps too many,
courses involving large lec
tures and sections. We prefer
small classes taught by mem
bers of the faculty or their near
equivalents because they make
possible an intellectually active
encounter with a work and also
with other persons' views of it.
Our preference for small
classes entails our acceptance
of the fact that most of the
teachers in the course would
not be experts in all the mate
rial they teach; the University
cannot afford enough experts
in every relevant field to teach
80 or 85 classes each quarter.
But the lack of specific ex
pertise does not worry us be
cause we think an intelligent,
educated non-expert can help
other intelligent people
achieve a serious understand
ing of a work and some of its
contexts. We also see no major
obstacle to non-experts being
further educated by their col
leagues with expertise in order
to improve their teaching of
the works.
Preferred model
These views of the desirable
content of a course satisfying
the requirement, and of the
best way to teach that course,
have led us to our preferred
model. At its core would be a
common list of works to be
studied and common examina
tions of them. Limited varia

nations might accommodate

In advanced courses the fa
culty could assume the stu
dents' knowledge of certain
works and build on that know
ledge. And the faculty, in work
ing together to prepare to
teach the works, would be en
couraged to think in ways that
transcend the boundaries bet
ween disciplines, an act of in
tellectual integration that we
believe useful.
Excellent instruction
We also assumed that the
Senate wanted the instruction
in the course to be excellent.
Most of the students with
whom we have talked, espe
cially those who look back on
their earlier education here
from the perspective of their
junior or senior year, argue
that excellent instruction usu
ally means small classes taught
by regular members of the fa
culty or very experienced
graduate students who have
completed or almost com
pleted their degrees. We think
they are right.
We realize that large lectures
provide an opportunity for ex
pert and often exciting
teachers to illuminate a subject
for many students; they also
cost less than small classes. But
their very size, in our view, en
courages an intellectual passiv
ity in their audience which
cannot easily be remedied by
discussion sections with teach
ing assistants.
It is also our impression that
freshmen and sophomores
have many, perhaps too many,
courses involving large lec
tures and sections. We prefer
small classes taught by mem
bers of the faculty or their near
equivalents because they make
possible an intellectually active
encounter with a work and also
with other persons' views of it.
Our preference for small
classes entails our acceptance
of the fact that most of the
teachers in the course would
not be experts in all the mate
rial they teach; the University
cannot afford enough experts
in every relevant field to teach
80 or 85 classes each quarter.
But the lack of specific ex
pertise does not worry us be
cause we think an intelligent,
educated non-expert can help
other intelligent people
achieve a serious understand
ing of a work and some of its
contexts. We also see no major
obstacle to non-experts being
further educated by their col
leagues with expertise in order
to improve their teaching of
the works.
Preferred model
These views of the desirable
content of a course satisfying
the requirement, and of the
best way to teach that course,
have led us to our preferred
model. At its core would be a
common list of works to be
studied and common examina
tions of them. Limited varia
tions in the works and exami
nations might accommodate
the special interests of the
teachers. The list would have
varying degrees of intensity
and superficiality; it might, for
example, emphasize works
from fifth-century B.C.

Greece, seventeenth-century
Europe and nineteenth and
twentieth century Europe and
America.
Students would study these
works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit clas
ses, with no more than 20 stu
dents in each class. Regular
members of the faculty would
teach as many as these classes
as possible. Post-doctoral pre
ceptors, hired especially for
this course, would teach the
others.
Lectures given by experts
would supplement the small
classes to deepen the students'
understanding of contexts,
exemplify different discipli
nary approaches to the works,
clarify particularly difficult
works, and help fill gaps bet
ween emphasized periods. But
there would be no more than
one lecture each week, and the
small classes would be at the
heart of the course.
Limitations
We think we are aware of
most of the limitations of this
model. It would be an expen
sive course to teach because of
its small classes. The choice of
periods to be emphasized and
works to be studied would leave
no one entirely happy — a fact
that is coming home to us
forcefully as we are preparing
sample syllabi for each quarter.
Western culture is in fact a
set of related cultures —
Jewish, Christian, northern
European, Mediterranean,
high, middle, and low, to men
tion only a few — and works on
the list could not do justice to
all of them. Although works
would be studied in some of
their intellectual, political, so
cial, and economic contexts,
limited time would make it im
possible in most instances to
acquire the historian's sense of
the work as a part of an entire
society.
Nevertheless, we think that
the study of some great works,
though not a course in history,
would create a sense of both
the continuities and discon
tinuities with the past that is
the basis of humanistic
thought and a sound, if li
mited, starting point for un
derstanding, appreciating and
criticizing western culture.
The task force has consi
dered other models, at least
two of which should be de
scribed here because they de
part radicallyfrom the first. The
second model would retain the
instruction in small classes,
supplemented by occasional
lectures. But instead of study
ing the same works, students
would choose a three-quarter
course, for a total of 15 units,
from a group of tracks on diffe
rent subjects such as the his
tory of institutions, intellectual
and literary history, or the his
tory of the performing arts.
Possibly more than one course
would be offered within each
track.
Large lectures
The third model would in
volve a similar choice of a
course from a group of tracks
but replace the small classes
with large lectures,
supplemented by sections
taught by teaching assistants or
post-doctoral preceptors. For
example, within a track that
emphasized the history of in
stitutions, History 1,2, and 3or
some modifications of that
series might satisfy the re
quirement. Within a track that
emphasized intellectual and
literary history, the Humanities
60 series might satisfy the re
quirement. This model is es
sentially the one recom
mended by the Committee on
Reform and Renewal of Liberal

Education at Stanford whose
work initiated the considera
tion of a requirement in west
ern culture several years ago.
Both the second and third
models offer choice from
among several courses, as op
posed to the first model's
common course for all stud
ents. We recognize the value
of choice, but we think it is
outweighed by the value of the
shared experience that the first
model offers. Separate tracks
would inevitably tend, we sus
pect, to become the provinces
of separate departments, and
an opportunity to encourage
the faculty as well as the stu
dents to think across discipli
nary lines would be lost.
Another reason we do not
favor the third model is its
great reliance on large lec
tures.
First year
Whichever model the Senate
ultimately adopts, we think the
requirement should be satis
fied in the first year whenever
possible and no later than the
second year. We continue to
assume that students with
especially good preparation
could design their own prog
rams for satisfying the re
quirement. -
Because the first model
would be a complex and major
innovation, we think it should
not be finally required for all
students until it has been
tested in a pilot program with
students who volunteer to take
the course. A pilot program
would also make it possible to
move to one of the models in
volving multiple tracks if the
first model begins to appear
unsuccessful.
Those of you who read our
article of May 26 will remember
that we considered requiring
as many as three courses in ad
dition to and intimately related
to the common core, with
these courses satisfying three
of the existing six distribution
requirements in the
humanities or social sciences,
depending on their discipli
nary approach. We have not
reached an agreement on the
number or content of these
courses, although there seems
a movement within the task
force towards requiring at least
one additional course chosen
from a limited range of sub
jects, such as the history of sci
ence, the relationship between
technology and society, the
encounter of western culture
with a non-western culture, or
European and American im
perialism in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America.
Taking shape
On this issue, as on our pre
ference for the first model, we
are still tentative in our think
ing and open to your views. But
our ideas are beginning to take
shape and the time for reach
ing preliminary decisions is fast
approaching, so we urge you
to express your opinions soon.

Western Culture Task Force

In December of 1976, the
Academic Senate instituted a
requirement in the study of
western culture for students
entering Stanford in the Au
tumn of 1978 and after, but not
for students already enrolled.
The Committee on Under
graduate Studies then created
our small task force to propose
and develop ways of satisfying
the requirement. We made our
first report to the university
community in the Daily, May 26
1977. We have met throughout
the summer and had the first of
what we hope will be many
conversations about our ideas
with Stanford students,
teachers and administrators,
and with teachers from other
universities and colleges which
have a similar requirement.
As a result of that first report
and our conversations, we
have received much useful ad
vice. This is our second report
to the community. We hope it
will elicit more responses from

you that can help shape our
thinking in the Autumn quar
ter, a crucial time for us be
cause we must make at least
preliminary recommendations
to the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and the
Academic Senate before
Christmas.
Considerations
Several considerations have
led us to agree, at least tenta
tively, on the kind of course we
would like to see satisfy the re
quirement. From the begin
ning we have assumed that the
Senate instituted the require
ment to ensure that all Stan
ford undergraduates would
study some of the important
works of western culture —
governmental and societal in
stitutions; writings of
philosophers, theologians,
scientists, historians, poets,
playwrights, and novelists; pic
tures, statues, buildings and
musical compositions — and
would be aware of their tem

poral relationship to each
other and would also under
stand some of their political,
social and economic contexts.
We also quickly agreed that
the study of the same works by
all of the students would have
great advantages. The vast
sweep of western culture
could yield a list — admittedly
just one of many — of intrinsi
cally interesting works. The
shared study of the same works
could bring a new vitality to the
intellectual life of students and
faculty.
In advanced courses the fa
culty could assume the stu
dents' knowledge of certain
works and build on that know
ledge. And the faculty, in work
ing together to prepare to
teach the works, would be en
