If you want to go on paying cruel and unusual prices for new
books, there's not much we can do about it. But what if you
suddenly realized you could get the same books for half of

be a good idea to have a place where you could trade in the
records and books >'Ou don't want for the ones you do? We're
at 405 Kipling, corner of Lytton, 329-9217, and we've been
doing this seven days a week for seven years. See you
