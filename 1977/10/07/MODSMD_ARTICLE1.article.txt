# Frederick Terman-a living Bay Area legend

His step is slower now. Ex
pressive hands, wrinkled with
age, clasp together then tall
apart as he speaks. A mellow
voice enunciates in low,
well-measured tones.
Alert eyes peer through his
bifocals, commanding atten
tion. Frederick Emmons Ter
man, at 77, is a living legend in
the Bay Area.
Fortune magazine has cre
dited Terman with almost
single-handedly making the
mid-Peninsula into the
"world's largest hothouse of
high technology."
"It was a matter of self
defense," said Terman. "My
very best students were being
forced to go back East for jobs
equal to their abilities. I took
some initiative and leadership
in involving local industries
with the University."
Terman points to the
graduate work he did at Mas
sachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) as his first
exposure to the kind of benefi
cial relationship business and a
university can enjoy.
"There was a lot of Yankee

manufacturing going on
around MIT and local people
often sent their sons or
daughters to college in the
area," he recalled.
"Professors just naturally
became involved with indust
rial problems closely related to
their own work. No one pro
moted it, but the situation
evolved on its own into a high
research environment," said
Terman.
MIT offered Terman a teach
ing post upon his graduation
which he accepted. He had
been home in California for a
few weeks when tragedy
struck. He came down with a
severe case of miliary tuber
culosis.
Two doctors gave up on his
case; two others fought to save
him. He spent the year in bed
with sand bags on his chest.
Terman's bout with tuber
culosis was to affect him in
many ways all his life. Despite
14-hour work days, he always
slept'and ate regularly. He
downed custard every night.
Obscure attic
The following year, 1926,
Terman began teaching full

time at Stanford. He estab
lished the first radio laboratory
on campus in an obscure attic.
"The roof of this attic leaked
and there was no money to re
pair it,"he recalled.
"We built big wooden trays
and lined them with tar paper
and tar. As the trays filled, we
walked around them. Our
morale didn't suffer. But then
one winter Bill Hewlett added a
homey touch by stocking them
with goldfish," he said.
Terman's teaching days were
coming to an end. When
World War II broke out he was
called to Boston to head a radio
research project staffed by
more than 850 persons.
Their efforts began in Feb
ruary of 1942. By the end of that
year their reconnaissance
equipment was being used at
the principal theaters of the
war. Prof. Oswald Villard of the
School of Engineering was on
Terman's staff. He said, "Ter
man brought together an in
credible diversity of people.

vidualists trying to do a com
mon project. Terman was great
at making them avoid feather
ruffling. He ran into terrible
political problems during the
war with admirals and such. He
saw them coming and handled
them brilliantly."
After the war, Terman began
again to work on building the
University. "I knew I was com
ing back to Stanford after the
war as dean of engineering so I
took the opportunity to find
out how and why Harvard was
greater than the other Ivy
League schools.

"It was no accident; it was
better management," Terman
explained. With his charac
teristic thoroughness, Terman
set out to discover insights into
managing a university more ef
ficiently.
Terman returned to Stanford
in 1946 with a reputation as an
"egghead hero" of the war.
With a firm belief that spon
sored research was in the best
interests of national defense,
Terman sought out govern
ment money to build up Stan
ford's prestige.
"My next step was to link the
University with industry," said

Terman. "We emerged from
World War II as an under
privileged institution. But we
had a chance to achieve a
strong national position."
Boosterism was unabashed
and Fred Terman became the
best booster of hir, time. With
the opening of 700-acre Stan
ford Industrial Park on land
owned by the University,
high-technology industries
began to cluster around cam
pus like bees swarming on a
patch of clover. Soon elec
tronics firms were springing up
all over Santa Clara County.
Terman kept on boosting. "I

used to go around and give
talks to people in industry. My
theme was always that the Uni
versity is a real asset if you
make useof it — industrial use.
"And then I would come
back and beat on the backs of
the professors to get out and
get acquainted with those
companies that were related to
their research," he said.
Breeding success
As original companies pros
pered, new ones moved in.
"Nothing breeds success like
success," said Terman.
What is the formula for this
success? "In education there is
no substitute for faculty qual
ity. The reputation of a school
depends almost solely on the
caliber of its faculty," Terman
said.
Terman became University
provost in 1955 and vice presi
dent in 1959. Until he retired in
1965 his influence extended
well beyond his original do

main in engineering.
Terman passed |udgment on
all sorts of faculty recruiting
decisions and professors who
left duringthis era were said to
have been "Termanated."
"Terman was patient about
waiting to snare the best
people," said Ernest Hilgard,
emeritus professor of psychol
ogy and an old friend of Ter
man's. "He always had a plan
right at his fingertips. He kept
personal files on tenure and
promotions."
Terman Tech
"His contribution to select
ing personnel was tremend
ous. Although some joked that
Stanford was becoming Ter
man Tech, he was concerned
with all aspects of the Univer
sity," continued Hilgard.
Terman's ability to recognize
the productive people was sig
nificant. "Every student has a
track record," Terman said.
"You can look at that and guess
pretty accurately who the really
bright ones are, although some
real odd balls do come along
now and then."
He also showed an uncanny
insight into the technology
race between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. Thirty years ago he
admonished his country not to
underestimate the Soviets.
"They realized the West had
an advanced technology and if
they were going to be able to
compete for power they could
only succeed by developing
their own physical science and
engineering technology to a

comparable level," said Ter
man.
Not disturbed
Terman said he isn't dis
turbed by recent reports that
the CIA had secretly-backed
research projects on campus.
He sees them as a logical pur
suit of national defense.
Today, Fred Terman still lives
in a gracious home on campus.
The house is decorated with
many beautiful Asian art ob
jects which he and his wife
have collected over the years.
His study is lined with pic
tures, awards, and honorary
degrees spanning 40 years.
Terman has slowed some but
he still maintains an office on
campus and drives to work
every day.
And if you ask him whether,
in retrospect, he'd do it all over
again, he'll give you an unwav
ering answer.
"Sure," he says, "Look what
it's done for Stanford."



His step is slower now. Ex

The house is decorated with
many beautiful Asian art ob
jects which he and his wife
have collected over the years.
His study is lined with pic
tures, awards, and honorary
degrees spanning 40 years.
Terman has slowed some but
he still maintains an office on
campus and drives to work
every day.
And if you ask him whether,
in retrospect, he'd do it all over
again, he'll give you an unwav
ering answer.
"Sure," he says, "Look what
it's done for Stanford."



His step is slower now. Ex
pressive hands, wrinkled with
age, clasp together then tall
apart as he speaks. A mellow
voice enunciates in low,
well-measured tones.
Alert eyes peer through his
bifocals, commanding atten
tion. Frederick Emmons Ter
man, at 77, is a living legend in
the Bay Area.
Fortune magazine has cre
dited Terman with almost
single-handedly making the
mid-Peninsula into the
"world's largest hothouse of
high technology."
"It was a matter of self
defense," said Terman. "My
very best students were being
forced to go back East for jobs
equal to their abilities. I took
some initiative and leadership
in involving local industries
with the University."
Terman points to the
graduate work he did at Mas
sachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) as his first
exposure to the kind of benefi
cial relationship business and a
university can enjoy.
"There was a lot of Yankee

manufacturing going on
around MIT and local people
often sent their sons or
daughters to college in the
area," he recalled.
"Professors just naturally
became involved with indust
rial problems closely related to
their own work. No one pro
moted it, but the situation
evolved on its own into a high
research environment," said
Terman.
MIT offered Terman a teach
ing post upon his graduation
which he accepted. He had
been home in California for a
few weeks when tragedy
struck. He came down with a
severe case of miliary tuber
culosis.
Two doctors gave up on his
case; two others fought to save
him. He spent the year in bed
with sand bags on his chest.
Terman's bout with tuber
culosis was to affect him in
many ways all his life. Despite
14-hour work days, he always
slept'and ate regularly. He
downed custard every night.
Obscure attic
The following year, 1926,
Terman began teaching full

time at Stanford. He estab
lished the first radio laboratory
on campus in an obscure attic.
"The roof of this attic leaked
and there was no money to re
pair it,"he recalled.
"We built big wooden trays
and lined them with tar paper
and tar. As the trays filled, we
walked around them. Our
morale didn't suffer. But then
one winter Bill Hewlett added a
homey touch by stocking them
with goldfish," he said.
Terman's teaching days were
coming to an end. When
World War II broke out he was
called to Boston to head a radio
research project staffed by
more than 850 persons.
Their efforts began in Feb
ruary of 1942. By the end of that
year their reconnaissance
equipment was being used at
the principal theaters of the
war. Prof. Oswald Villard of the
School of Engineering was on
Terman's staff. He said, "Ter
man brought together an in
credible diversity of people.

vidualists trying to do a com

at making them avoid feather
ruffling. He ran into terrible
political problems during the
war with admirals and such. He
saw them coming and handled
them brilliantly."
After the war, Terman began
again to work on building the
University. "I knew I was com
ing back to Stanford after the
war as dean of engineering so I
took the opportunity to find
out how and why Harvard was
greater than the other Ivy
League schools.

"It was no accident; it was
better management," Terman
explained. With his charac
teristic thoroughness, Terman
set out to discover insights into
managing a university more ef
ficiently.
Terman returned to Stanford
in 1946 with a reputation as an
"egghead hero" of the war.
With a firm belief that spon
sored research was in the best
interests of national defense,
Terman sought out govern
ment money to build up Stan
ford's prestige.
"My next step was to link the
University with industry," said

Terman. "We emerged from
World War II as an under
privileged institution. But we
had a chance to achieve a
strong national position."
Boosterism was unabashed
and Fred Terman became the
best booster of hir, time. With
the opening of 700-acre Stan
ford Industrial Park on land
owned by the University,
high-technology industries
began to cluster around cam
pus like bees swarming on a
patch of clover. Soon elec
tronics firms were springing up
all over Santa Clara County.
Terman kept on boosting. "I

used to go around and give
talks to people in industry. My
theme was always that the Uni
versity is a real asset if you
make useof it — industrial use.
"And then I would come
back and beat on the backs of
the professors to get out and
get acquainted with those
companies that were related to
their research," he said.
Breeding success
As original companies pros
pered, new ones moved in.
"Nothing breeds success like
success," said Terman.
What is the formula for this
success? "In education there is
no substitute for faculty qual
ity. The reputation of a school
depends almost solely on the
caliber of its faculty," Terman
said.
Terman became University
provost in 1955 and vice presi
dent in 1959. Until he retired in
1965 his influence extended
well beyond his original do

main in engineering.
Terman passed |udgment on
all sorts of faculty recruiting
decisions and professors who
left duringthis era were said to
have been "Termanated."
"Terman was patient about
waiting to snare the best
people," said Ernest Hilgard,
emeritus professor of psychol
ogy and an old friend of Ter
man's. "He always had a plan
right at his fingertips. He kept
personal files on tenure and
promotions."

"His contribution to select

Stanford was becoming Ter

sity," continued Hilgard.
Terman's ability to recognize
the productive people was sig
nificant. "Every student has a
track record," Terman said.
"You can look at that and guess
pretty accurately who the really
bright ones are, although some
real odd balls do come along
now and then."
He also showed an uncanny
insight into the technology
race between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. Thirty years ago he
admonished his country not to
underestimate the Soviets.
"They realized the West had
an advanced technology and if
they were going to be able to
compete for power they could
only succeed by developing
their own physical science and
engineering technology to a

comparable level," said Ter
man.

Terman said he isn't dis

Fortune magazine has cre

single-handedly making the
mid-Peninsula into the
"world's largest hothouse of
high technology."
"It was a matter of self
defense," said Terman. "My
very best students were being
forced to go back East for jobs
equal to their abilities. I took
some initiative and leadership
in involving local industries
with the University."
Terman points to the
graduate work he did at Mas
sachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) as his first
exposure to the kind of benefi
cial relationship business and a
university can enjoy.
"There was a lot of Yankee

manufacturing going on
around MIT and local people
often sent their sons or
daughters to college in the
area," he recalled.
"Professors just naturally
became involved with indust
rial problems closely related to
their own work. No one pro
moted it, but the situation
evolved on its own into a high
research environment," said
Terman.
MIT offered Terman a teach
ing post upon his graduation
which he accepted. He had
been home in California for a
few weeks when tragedy
struck. He came down with a
severe case of miliary tuber
culosis.
Two doctors gave up on his
case; two others fought to save
him. He spent the year in bed
with sand bags on his chest.
Terman's bout with tuber
culosis was to affect him in
many ways all his life. Despite
14-hour work days, he always
slept'and ate regularly. He
downed custard every night.
Obscure attic
The following year, 1926,
Terman began teaching full

time at Stanford. He estab
lished the first radio laboratory
on campus in an obscure attic.
"The roof of this attic leaked
and there was no money to re
pair it,"he recalled.
"We built big wooden trays
and lined them with tar paper
and tar. As the trays filled, we
walked around them. Our
morale didn't suffer. But then
one winter Bill Hewlett added a
homey touch by stocking them
with goldfish," he said.
Terman's teaching days were
coming to an end. When
World War II broke out he was
called to Boston to head a radio
research project staffed by
more than 850 persons.
Their efforts began in Feb
ruary of 1942. By the end of that
year their reconnaissance
equipment was being used at
the principal theaters of the
war. Prof. Oswald Villard of the
School of Engineering was on

After the war, Terman began

Terman returned to Stanford

"egghead hero" of the war.
With a firm belief that spon

Terman sought out govern

"My next step was to link the
University with industry," said

Terman. "We emerged from
World War II as an under
privileged institution. But we
had a chance to achieve a

Boosterism was unabashed

best booster of hir, time. With
the opening of 700-acre Stan
ford Industrial Park on land
owned by the University,
high-technology industries
began to cluster around cam

patch of clover. Soon elec

Terman kept on boosting. "I

"And then I would come

"Terman was patient about

"His contribution to select

Terman's ability to recognize

ous. Although some joked that
Stanford was becoming Ter
man Tech, he was concerned
with all aspects of the Univer
sity," continued Hilgard.
Terman's ability to recognize
the productive people was sig
nificant. "Every student has a
track record," Terman said.
"You can look at that and guess
pretty accurately who the really
bright ones are, although some
real odd balls do come along
now and then."
He also showed an uncanny
insight into the technology
race between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. Thirty years ago he
admonished his country not to
underestimate the Soviets.
"They realized the West had
an advanced technology and if
they were going to be able to
compete for power they could
only succeed by developing
their own physical science and
engineering technology to a

comparable level," said Ter
man.
Not disturbed
Terman said he isn't dis
turbed by recent reports that
the CIA had secretly-backed
research projects on campus.
He sees them as a logical pur
suit of national defense.
Today, Fred Terman still lives
in a gracious home on campus.
The house is decorated with
many beautiful Asian art ob
jects which he and his wife
have collected over the years.
His study is lined with pic
tures, awards, and honorary
degrees spanning 40 years.
Terman has slowed some but
he still maintains an office on
campus and drives to work
every day.
And if you ask him whether,
in retrospect, he'd do it all over
again, he'll give you an unwav
ering answer.
"Sure," he says, "Look what
it's done for Stanford."



His step is slower now. Ex
pressive hands, wrinkled with
age, clasp together then tall
apart as he speaks. A mellow
voice enunciates in low,
well-measured tones.
Alert eyes peer through his
bifocals, commanding atten
tion. Frederick Emmons Ter
man, at 77, is a living legend in
the Bay Area.
Fortune magazine has cre
dited Terman with almost
single-handedly making the
mid-Peninsula into the
"world's largest hothouse of
high technology."
"It was a matter of self
defense," said Terman. "My
very best students were being
forced to go back East for jobs
equal to their abilities. I took
some initiative and leadership
in involving local industries
with the University."
Terman points to the
graduate work he did at Mas
sachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) as his first
exposure to the kind of benefi
cial relationship business and a
university can enjoy.
"There was a lot of Yankee

manufacturing going on
around MIT and local people
often sent their sons or
daughters to college in the
area," he recalled.
"Professors just naturally
became involved with indust
rial problems closely related to
their own work. No one pro
moted it, but the situation
evolved on its own into a high
research environment," said
Terman.
MIT offered Terman a teach
ing post upon his graduation
which he accepted. He had
been home in California for a
few weeks when tragedy
struck. He came down with a
severe case of miliary tuber
culosis.
Two doctors gave up on his
case; two others fought to save
him. He spent the year in bed
with sand bags on his chest.
Terman's bout with tuber
culosis was to affect him in
many ways all his life. Despite
14-hour work days, he always
slept'and ate regularly. He
downed custard every night.
Obscure attic
The following year, 1926,
Terman began teaching full

time at Stanford. He estab
lished the first radio laboratory
on campus in an obscure attic.
"The roof of this attic leaked
and there was no money to re
pair it,"he recalled.
"We built big wooden trays
and lined them with tar paper
and tar. As the trays filled, we
walked around them. Our
morale didn't suffer. But then
one winter Bill Hewlett added a
homey touch by stocking them
with goldfish," he said.
Terman's teaching days were
coming to an end. When
World War II broke out he was
called to Boston to head a radio
research project staffed by
more than 850 persons.
Their efforts began in Feb
ruary of 1942. By the end of that
year their reconnaissance
equipment was being used at
the principal theaters of the
war. Prof. Oswald Villard of the
School of Engineering was on
Terman's staff. He said, "Ter
man brought together an in
credible diversity of people.

vidualists trying to do a com
mon project. Terman was great
at making them avoid feather
ruffling. He ran into terrible
political problems during the
war with admirals and such. He
saw them coming and handled
them brilliantly."
After the war, Terman began
again to work on building the
University. "I knew I was com
ing back to Stanford after the
war as dean of engineering so I
took the opportunity to find
out how and why Harvard was
greater than the other Ivy
League schools.

"It was no accident; it was
better management," Terman
explained. With his charac
teristic thoroughness, Terman
set out to discover insights into
managing a university more ef
ficiently.
Terman returned to Stanford
in 1946 with a reputation as an
"egghead hero" of the war.
With a firm belief that spon
sored research was in the best
interests of national defense,
Terman sought out govern
ment money to build up Stan
ford's prestige.
"My next step was to link the
University with industry," said

Terman. "We emerged from
World War II as an under
privileged institution. But we
had a chance to achieve a
strong national position."
Boosterism was unabashed
and Fred Terman became the
best booster of hir, time. With
the opening of 700-acre Stan
ford Industrial Park on land
owned by the University,
high-technology industries
began to cluster around cam
pus like bees swarming on a
patch of clover. Soon elec
tronics firms were springing up
all over Santa Clara County.
Terman kept on boosting. "I

used to go around and give
talks to people in industry. My
theme was always that the Uni
versity is a real asset if you
make useof it — industrial use.
"And then I would come
back and beat on the backs of
the professors to get out and
get acquainted with those
companies that were related to
their research," he said.
Breeding success
As original companies pros
pered, new ones moved in.
"Nothing breeds success like
success," said Terman.
What is the formula for this
success? "In education there is
no substitute for faculty qual
ity. The reputation of a school
depends almost solely on the
caliber of its faculty," Terman
said.
Terman became University
provost in 1955 and vice presi
dent in 1959. Until he retired in
1965 his influence extended
well beyond his original do

main in engineering.
Terman passed |udgment on
all sorts of faculty recruiting
decisions and professors who
left duringthis era were said to
have been "Termanated."
"Terman was patient about
waiting to snare the best
people," said Ernest Hilgard,
emeritus professor of psychol
ogy and an old friend of Ter
man's. "He always had a plan
right at his fingertips. He kept
personal files on tenure and
promotions."
