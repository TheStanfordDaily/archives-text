# Frederick Terman-a living Bay Area legend

His step is slower now. Ex
pressive hands, wrinkled with
age, clasp together then tall
apart as he speaks. A mellow
voice enunciates in low,
well-measured tones.
Alert eyes peer through his
bifocals, commanding atten
tion. Frederick Emmons Ter
man, at 77, is a living legend in
the Bay Area.
Fortune magazine has cre
dited Terman with almost
single-handedly making the
mid-Peninsula into the
"world's largest hothouse of
high technology."
"It was a matter of self
defense," said Terman. "My
very best students were being
forced to go back East for jobs
equal to their abilities. I took
some initiative and leadership
in involving local industries
with the University."
Terman points to the
graduate work he did at Mas
sachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) as his first
exposure to the kind of benefi
cial relationship business and a
university can enjoy.
"There was a lot of Yankee

manufacturing going on
around MIT and local people
often sent their sons or
daughters to college in the
area," he recalled.
"Professors just naturally
became involved with indust
rial problems closely related to
their own work. No one pro
moted it, but the situation
evolved on its own into a high
research environment," said
Terman.
MIT offered Terman a teach
ing post upon his graduation
which he accepted. He had
been home in California for a
few weeks when tragedy
struck. He came down with a
severe case of miliary tuber
culosis.
Two doctors gave up on his
case; two others fought to save
him. He spent the year in bed
with sand bags on his chest.
Terman's bout with tuber
culosis was to affect him in
many ways all his life. Despite
14-hour work days, he always
slept'and ate regularly. He
downed custard every night.
Obscure attic
The following year, 1926,
Terman began teaching full

time at Stanford. He estab
lished the first radio laboratory
on campus in an obscure attic.
"The roof of this attic leaked
and there was no money to re
pair it,"he recalled.
"We built big wooden trays
and lined them with tar paper
and tar. As the trays filled, we
walked around them. Our
morale didn't suffer. But then
one winter Bill Hewlett added a
homey touch by stocking them
with goldfish," he said.
Terman's teaching days were
coming to an end. When
World War II broke out he was
called to Boston to head a radio
research project staffed by
more than 850 persons.
Their efforts began in Feb
ruary of 1942. By the end of that
year their reconnaissance
equipment was being used at
the principal theaters of the
war. Prof. Oswald Villard of the
School of Engineering was on
Terman's staff. He said, "Ter
man brought together an in
credible diversity of people.

U.S. but they were indi-
