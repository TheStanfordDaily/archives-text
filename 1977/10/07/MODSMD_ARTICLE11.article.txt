# Thailand: another Vietnam?
## 
### 
Randy Stross, et at.

A year ago last October, a bloody
seizure of power by a military junta
destroyed Thailand's democracy. On
the day of the coup, students at
Thammasat University were at
tacked by military, policy, and right
ist gangster forces. The grisly fate
met by the students made the event
newsworthy in the U.S., and our
morning paper that week showed
Thai students who had been garroted
or beaten to death, with their hands
cut off and their eyes gouged out.

Three hundred died that day and five
thousand were arrested.
But since that week events in Thai
land have been given scant attention
here in the U.S. A turbulent future
for-Thailand — with costly U.S. en
tanglement — seems a certainty due
to this past year's events. Yet we re
main poorly informed about the on
going war in Thailand and past, pre
sent and future U.S. involvement.
The unfolding history includes the
following features: a southeast Asian

country, ruled by a foreign-armed,
anti-Communist clique; strategic
hamlets and defoliation programs in
the countryside; and a total ban on
any union activities in the cities. Not
surprisingly, revolutionary in
surgency has been growing steadily
and so, of course, have the military
needs of the Thai regime to combat
the threat.
The U.S. has long been the main
supplier of arms and advisors and
shows no signs of hesitation in sup
plying record amounts of arms for
the upcoming fiscal year. Presently,
no less than two-thirds of the coun
try's provinces are considered
Communist "contested zones" by
the Thai military. And coupled with
the loss of much popular support
among even the urban population in
Bangkok, the regime's existence is
propped solely upon continued (and
ever-increasing) foreign counter
insurgency aid. Doesn't this all
sound uncomfortably familiar?
The war against rural insurgents in
Thailand did not just begin last year,
but it did enter a new period of esca
lation. The urban intellectuals and
students, who had been viewed as a
"middle force" between the right
and the left, were so alienated by this
new regime that they left the cities
and have joined the Communists in
the countryside. Their departure
signaled a critical shift in the war's
momentum, a shift that the U.S. gov
ernment seems intent upon ignor
ing.
Even recent public exposure of
gross violations of human rights by
the junta, such as torture of suspects,
has not changed the U.S. position of
unqualified support. Without a re
evaluation of U.S. aid to the Thai re
gime, we are condemned to backing
not only the least popular, most rep
ressive side in the Thai civil war, but
the losing side as well.

A year ago last October, a bloody
seizure of power by a military junta
destroyed Thailand's democracy. On
the day of the coup, students at
Thammasat University were at
tacked by military, policy, and right
ist gangster forces. The grisly fate
met by the students made the event
newsworthy in the U.S., and our
morning paper that week showed
Thai students who had been garroted
or beaten to death, with their hands
cut off and their eyes gouged out.

Three hundred died that day and five
thousand were arrested.
But since that week events in Thai
land have been given scant attention
here in the U.S. A turbulent future
for-Thailand — with costly U.S. en
tanglement — seems a certainty due
to this past year's events. Yet we re
main poorly informed about the on
going war in Thailand and past, pre
sent and future U.S. involvement.
The unfolding history includes the
following features: a southeast Asian

country, ruled by a foreign-armed,
anti-Communist clique; strategic
hamlets and defoliation programs in
the countryside; and a total ban on
any union activities in the cities. Not
surprisingly, revolutionary in
surgency has been growing steadily
and so, of course, have the military
needs of the Thai regime to combat
the threat.
The U.S. has long been the main
supplier of arms and advisors and
shows no signs of hesitation in sup
plying record amounts of arms for
the upcoming fiscal year. Presently,
no less than two-thirds of the coun
try's provinces are considered
Communist "contested zones" by
the Thai military. And coupled with
the loss of much popular support
among even the urban population in
Bangkok, the regime's existence is
propped solely upon continued (and
ever-increasing) foreign counter
insurgency aid. Doesn't this all
sound uncomfortably familiar?
The war against rural insurgents in
Thailand did not just begin last year,
but it did enter a new period of esca
lation. The urban intellectuals and
students, who had been viewed as a
"middle force" between the right
and the left, were so alienated by this
new regime that they left the cities
and have joined the Communists in
the countryside. Their departure
signaled a critical shift in the war's
momentum, a shift that the U.S. gov
ernment seems intent upon ignor
ing.
Even recent public exposure of
gross violations of human rights by
the junta, such as torture of suspects,
has not changed the U.S. position of
unqualified support. Without a re
evaluation of U.S. aid to the Thai re
gime, we are condemned to backing
not only the least popular, most rep
ressive side in the Thai civil war, but
the losing side as well.
