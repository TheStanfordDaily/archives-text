The New Left weekly, In These
Times, correctly taunts the conserva
tives on the socialism of the Canal
Zone:
"Right-wingers are lionizing Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt, who
had no use for their neanderthal
'tree market' ideology. . . . They
are less vocal in noting that the
Canal represents everything they
denounce as 'socialism' and 'wel
fare statism.' The canal's construc
tion was and remains the largest
single public works ever underta
ken by the American govern
ment. . . . Private enterprise is
prohibited from the Canal /one;
and the American residents be
nefit trom subsidized housing,
public transportation, publicly
owned retail stores, and
'socialized' medicine: Success and
a high standard of living without
the profit motive. No wonder the
American canal zone residents
don't want to come home to
capitalist America. They're very
happy with their 'socialist' col
ony." (In These Times, August
24-30, 1977.)
New Leftists
Of course, the shoe is also on the
New Leftists' toot; lor according to
their own ideology, these /onians
are imperialist and militarist — in
short, socialist — exploiters ot the

American public as well as of the
Panamanians. But we all should be
able to agree: Get the /onians oft
our backs!
In contrast to the conservatives,
the Libertarian Party Plattorm tor
1977-78 is clear and unequivocal —
and libertarian — on the Panama
Canal issue: "The United States
should liquidate its government-run
canal operation in Panama and with
draw all U.S. troops from the Canal
/one." At the beginning ot the new
"colonialism" plank in which this
sentence appears, we now have:
"United States colonialism has left a
legacy ot property confiscation,
economic manipulation, and over
extended defense boundaries. . . .
Land seized by the U.S. government
should be returned to its righttul
owners."
Libertarian stand
In the light of these principles,
where should libertarians stand on
the hot issue ol the Carter treaty?
Does it really "surrender" the canal
and the zone to the Panamanians?
Unfortunately, it does not. The
treaty is a cunning and cratty way ot
adjusting imperialism to the current
world, ol preserving imperialism
while recognizing "that continued
naked American occupation ot the
Canal /one and control of the canal
serve as a testering sore, poisoning

American diplomatic relations
throughout Latin America." (Michael
Baumann, "The New Theft ot the
Panama Canal," Intercontinental
Press, Aug. 29, 1977.)
In fact, the only thing the U.S.
gives up is tormal sovereignty over
the Canal Zone and its seemingly
perpetual ownership ot the canal.
The sovereignty over the Canal /one
the U.S. relinquishes in three years,
it is true, but we still retain extra
territoriality in violation ot interna
tional law: Americans retain U.S.
legal rights in Panamanian courts,
and Americans sentenced to jail
terms will serve them in the U.S.
Beyond this, we give up next to no
thing.
Full control
The U.S. gets to keep lull control
ot the canal until the year 2000, and it
gets to maintain its military lorce in
Panama until the year 2000 as well.
But, evena/'fer theyear2ooo, the U.S.
retains the permanent right to inter
vene militarily in Panama to preserve
the continued operation and the
"neutrality" of the canal, and it gets
to decide when that "neutrality" is
being threatened.
In short, the Panama treaty does
not at all abandon U.S. imperialism;
instead, this imperialism retreats
trom the naked and offensive older
form, to a more sophisticated and

hence more effective modern variety
of "neo-imperialism." The form of
imperialism is abandoned, but the
content is as rabid as ever. To soften
the blow to Panamanian dictator
General Torrijos, the U.S. sweetens
the pot by paying $50-$6O million a
year until 2000 — a big increase trom
the $2 million per annum we pay
now; plus $300 million in U.S. gov
ernment aids and credits, and the
U.S. will "tacilitate" $1 billion ot
U.S. investments and loans in
Panama.
Right wing
We hate to hand the right-wing
any victories in foreign affairs, even n
tor totally wrong reasons; but we
have to reluctantly but iirmlv con
clude that the Panama treaty should
be defeated. It is true that hall a loaf
is better than none; but this treaty
would not be halt a loat; it would not
halfway dismantle American im
perialism in Panama; it would simply
be providing a figleat (to mix a
metaphor) for continued and even
increased U.S. domination mote that
we now get Panamanian agreement
to the permanent U.S. right of milit
ary intervention to get what we want
in the canal.)
But most revealing of all is the
editorial support for the Panama tre
aty by National Review (NRi. NR be
gins by hailing the history ot the
canal, claiming that it was not im
perialism because the canal com
pany did not make a profit (ignoring
the big payment to the Morgan
speculators and their quick resale ot
stock to the U.S. government canal
company at double the value ot their
investment.)
Better defense
But then, NR says, we should
realize that "our own military men
support the treaty on the ground that
the canal can be better defended
with the treaty than without it."
Why? Because Panama agrees to U.S.
detense ot the canal. Either by air
and sea against any external attack;
or, the more important gOerrilla at
tack trom within Panama is now less
likely because a defense "could be
done tar better together with Panama
than without it; or worse, against it."
lust as we, as libertarians, should
be worried about unwisely defusing
anti-imperialist sentiments through
out the world on the Panama issue if
the treaty were ratified, National Re
view gives such defusion as one ot its
major arguments for support ot the
treaty:
"Let us suppose that the treaty is
defeated in Congress — as well it
might be. What then? We hardly
need Ambassador Bunker to re
mind us of the predictable con
sequences in Panama, in Latin
America, in the United Nations, in
the world. Arewe readv to hold the

Canal against all possible assaults,
political, military, in the guerrilla
minefield, in the media, the OAS,
and the UN?"
And so, given these realities, NR
concludes that taking up arms in
stead ot accepting the treaty is un
necessary:
"Based on the outline ot the prop
osed treaty there seems to be no
necessary reason to sound the call
to arms. We retain what is essential
until 2000 A.D. and even then will
play an important part as well as
some contingent delense role.
. . .And what is more important,
we would almost surely be in a
stronger position to act at some
later time in response to an actual
threat or violation ol the treaty
than we would be now in detense
ot our own refusal to ratify."
(National Review, September 2,
1977.)
Once again, as it has done so many
times in matters of military and
loreign policy, National Review pro
vides a kind ol negative touchstone
for libertarians. The Panama treaty
should be rejected. Libertarians, in
opposing the treaty, must of course
make clear our diametrically op
posed perspective to the Reaganites
and Birchers on this matter.

The New Left weekly, In These
Times, correctly taunts the conserva
tives on the socialism of the Canal
Zone:
"Right-wingers are lionizing Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt, who
had no use for their neanderthal
'tree market' ideology. . . . They
are less vocal in noting that the
Canal represents everything they
denounce as 'socialism' and 'wel
fare statism.' The canal's construc
tion was and remains the largest
single public works ever underta
ken by the American govern
ment. . . . Private enterprise is
prohibited from the Canal /one;
and the American residents be

public transportation, publicly
owned retail stores, and
'socialized' medicine: Success and
a high standard of living without
the profit motive. No wonder the
American canal zone residents
don't want to come home to
capitalist America. They're very
happy with their 'socialist' col
ony." (In These Times, August
24-30, 1977.)
New Leftists
Of course, the shoe is also on the
New Leftists' toot; lor according to
their own ideology, these /onians
are imperialist and militarist — in
short, socialist — exploiters ot the

American public as well as of the
Panamanians. But we all should be
able to agree: Get the /onians oft
our backs!
In contrast to the conservatives,
the Libertarian Party Plattorm tor
1977-78 is clear and unequivocal —
and libertarian — on the Panama
Canal issue: "The United States
should liquidate its government-run
canal operation in Panama and with
draw all U.S. troops from the Canal
/one." At the beginning ot the new
"colonialism" plank in which this
sentence appears, we now have:
"United States colonialism has left a
legacy ot property confiscation,
economic manipulation, and over
extended defense boundaries. . . .
Land seized by the U.S. government
should be returned to its righttul
owners."
Libertarian stand
In the light of these principles,
where should libertarians stand on
the hot issue ol the Carter treaty?
Does it really "surrender" the canal
and the zone to the Panamanians?
Unfortunately, it does not. The
treaty is a cunning and cratty way ot
adjusting imperialism to the current
world, ol preserving imperialism
while recognizing "that continued
naked American occupation ot the
Canal /one and control of the canal
serve as a testering sore, poisoning

American diplomatic relations
throughout Latin America." (Michael
Baumann, "The New Theft ot the
Panama Canal," Intercontinental
Press, Aug. 29, 1977.)
In fact, the only thing the U.S.
gives up is tormal sovereignty over
the Canal Zone and its seemingly
perpetual ownership ot the canal.
The sovereignty over the Canal /one
the U.S. relinquishes in three years,
it is true, but we still retain extra
territoriality in violation ot interna
tional law: Americans retain U.S.
legal rights in Panamanian courts,
and Americans sentenced to jail
terms will serve them in the U.S.
Beyond this, we give up next to no
thing.
Full control
The U.S. gets to keep lull control
ot the canal until the year 2000, and it
gets to maintain its military lorce in
Panama until the year 2000 as well.
But, evena/'fer theyear2ooo, the U.S.
retains the permanent right to inter
vene militarily in Panama to preserve
the continued operation and the
"neutrality" of the canal, and it gets
to decide when that "neutrality" is
being threatened.
In short, the Panama treaty does
not at all abandon U.S. imperialism;
instead, this imperialism retreats
trom the naked and offensive older
form, to a more sophisticated and

hence more effective modern variety
of "neo-imperialism." The form of
imperialism is abandoned, but the
content is as rabid as ever. To soften
the blow to Panamanian dictator
General Torrijos, the U.S. sweetens
the pot by paying $50-$6O million a
year until 2000 — a big increase trom
the $2 million per annum we pay
now; plus $300 million in U.S. gov
ernment aids and credits, and the
U.S. will "tacilitate" $1 billion ot
U.S. investments and loans in
Panama.
Right wing
We hate to hand the right-wing
any victories in foreign affairs, even n
tor totally wrong reasons; but we
have to reluctantly but iirmlv con
clude that the Panama treaty should
be defeated. It is true that hall a loaf
is better than none; but this treaty
would not be halt a loat; it would not
halfway dismantle American im
perialism in Panama; it would simply
be providing a figleat (to mix a
metaphor) for continued and even
increased U.S. domination mote that
we now get Panamanian agreement
to the permanent U.S. right of milit
ary intervention to get what we want
in the canal.)
But most revealing of all is the
editorial support for the Panama tre
aty by National Review (NRi. NR be
gins by hailing the history ot the
canal, claiming that it was not im
perialism because the canal com
pany did not make a profit (ignoring
the big payment to the Morgan
speculators and their quick resale ot
stock to the U.S. government canal
company at double the value ot their
investment.)
Better defense
But then, NR says, we should
realize that "our own military men
support the treaty on the ground that
the canal can be better defended
with the treaty than without it."
Why? Because Panama agrees to U.S.
detense ot the canal. Either by air
and sea against any external attack;
or, the more important gOerrilla at
tack trom within Panama is now less
likely because a defense "could be
done tar better together with Panama
than without it; or worse, against it."
lust as we, as libertarians, should
be worried about unwisely defusing
anti-imperialist sentiments through
out the world on the Panama issue if
the treaty were ratified, National Re
view gives such defusion as one ot its
major arguments for support ot the
treaty:
"Let us suppose that the treaty is
defeated in Congress — as well it
might be. What then? We hardly
need Ambassador Bunker to re

sequences in Panama, in Latin
America, in the United Nations, in
the world. Arewe readv to hold the

Canal against all possible assaults,
political, military, in the guerrilla
minefield, in the media, the OAS,
and the UN?"
And so, given these realities, NR
concludes that taking up arms in
stead ot accepting the treaty is un
necessary:
"Based on the outline ot the prop
osed treaty there seems to be no
necessary reason to sound the call
to arms. We retain what is essential
until 2000 A.D. and even then will
play an important part as well as
some contingent delense role.

we would almost surely be in a

"Right-wingers are lionizing Presi

had no use for their neanderthal
'tree market' ideology. . . . They
are less vocal in noting that the
Canal represents everything they
denounce as 'socialism' and 'wel

New Leftists
Of course, the shoe is also on the
New Leftists' toot; lor according to
their own ideology, these /onians
are imperialist and militarist — in

American public as well as of the
Panamanians. But we all should be
able to agree: Get the /onians oft
our backs!
In contrast to the conservatives,
the Libertarian Party Plattorm tor
1977-78 is clear and unequivocal —
and libertarian — on the Panama
Canal issue: "The United States
should liquidate its government-run
canal operation in Panama and with
draw all U.S. troops from the Canal
/one." At the beginning ot the new
"colonialism" plank in which this
sentence appears, we now have:
"United States colonialism has left a
legacy ot property confiscation,
economic manipulation, and over
extended defense boundaries. . . .
Land seized by the U.S. government
should be returned to its righttul
owners."
Libertarian stand
In the light of these principles,
where should libertarians stand on
the hot issue ol the Carter treaty?
Does it really "surrender" the canal
and the zone to the Panamanians?
Unfortunately, it does not. The
treaty is a cunning and cratty way ot
adjusting imperialism to the current
world, ol preserving imperialism
while recognizing "that continued
naked American occupation ot the
Canal /one and control of the canal
serve as a testering sore, poisoning

American diplomatic relations
throughout Latin America." (Michael
Baumann, "The New Theft ot the
Panama Canal," Intercontinental
Press, Aug. 29, 1977.)
In fact, the only thing the U.S.
gives up is tormal sovereignty over
the Canal Zone and its seemingly
perpetual ownership ot the canal.
The sovereignty over the Canal /one
the U.S. relinquishes in three years,
it is true, but we still retain extra
territoriality in violation ot interna
tional law: Americans retain U.S.
legal rights in Panamanian courts,
and Americans sentenced to jail
terms will serve them in the U.S.
Beyond this, we give up next to no
thing.
Full control
The U.S. gets to keep lull control
ot the canal until the year 2000, and it
gets to maintain its military lorce in
Panama until the year 2000 as well.
But, evena/'fer theyear2ooo, the U.S.
retains the permanent right to inter
vene militarily in Panama to preserve
the continued operation and the
"neutrality" of the canal, and it gets
to decide when that "neutrality" is
being threatened.
In short, the Panama treaty does
not at all abandon U.S. imperialism;
instead, this imperialism retreats
trom the naked and offensive older
form, to a more sophisticated and

hence more effective modern variety
of "neo-imperialism." The form of
imperialism is abandoned, but the
content is as rabid as ever. To soften
the blow to Panamanian dictator
General Torrijos, the U.S. sweetens
the pot by paying $50-$6O million a
year until 2000 — a big increase trom
the $2 million per annum we pay
now; plus $300 million in U.S. gov
ernment aids and credits, and the
U.S. will "tacilitate" $1 billion ot
U.S. investments and loans in
Panama.
Right wing
We hate to hand the right-wing

tor totally wrong reasons; but we
have to reluctantly but iirmlv con
clude that the Panama treaty should

would not be halt a loat; it would not
halfway dismantle American im
perialism in Panama; it would simply
be providing a figleat (to mix a
metaphor) for continued and even
increased U.S. domination mote that
we now get Panamanian agreement
to the permanent U.S. right of milit
ary intervention to get what we want

But most revealing of all is the
editorial support for the Panama tre

Better defense
But then, NR says, we should
realize that "our own military men
support the treaty on the ground that
the canal can be better defended
with the treaty than without it."
Why? Because Panama agrees to U.S.
detense ot the canal. Either by air
and sea against any external attack;
or, the more important gOerrilla at

done tar better together with Panama

lust as we, as libertarians, should
be worried about unwisely defusing
anti-imperialist sentiments through

the treaty were ratified, National Re

lust as we, as libertarians, should
be worried about unwisely defusing
anti-imperialist sentiments through
out the world on the Panama issue if
the treaty were ratified, National Re
view gives such defusion as one ot its
major arguments for support ot the
treaty:
"Let us suppose that the treaty is
defeated in Congress — as well it
might be. What then? We hardly
need Ambassador Bunker to re
mind us of the predictable con
sequences in Panama, in Latin
America, in the United Nations, in

minefield, in the media, the OAS,

concludes that taking up arms in

necessary:
"Based on the outline ot the prop
osed treaty there seems to be no

Murray Rothbard

The New Left weekly, In These
Times, correctly taunts the conserva
tives on the socialism of the Canal
Zone:
"Right-wingers are lionizing Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt, who
had no use for their neanderthal
'tree market' ideology. . . . They
are less vocal in noting that the
Canal represents everything they
denounce as 'socialism' and 'wel
fare statism.' The canal's construc
tion was and remains the largest
single public works ever underta
ken by the American govern
ment. . . . Private enterprise is
prohibited from the Canal /one;
and the American residents be
nefit trom subsidized housing,
public transportation, publicly
owned retail stores, and
'socialized' medicine: Success and
a high standard of living without
the profit motive. No wonder the
American canal zone residents
don't want to come home to
capitalist America. They're very
happy with their 'socialist' col
ony." (In These Times, August
24-30, 1977.)
New Leftists
Of course, the shoe is also on the
New Leftists' toot; lor according to
their own ideology, these /onians
are imperialist and militarist — in
short, socialist — exploiters ot the

American public as well as of the
Panamanians. But we all should be
able to agree: Get the /onians oft
our backs!
In contrast to the conservatives,
the Libertarian Party Plattorm tor
1977-78 is clear and unequivocal —
and libertarian — on the Panama
Canal issue: "The United States
should liquidate its government-run
canal operation in Panama and with
draw all U.S. troops from the Canal
/one." At the beginning ot the new
"colonialism" plank in which this
sentence appears, we now have:
"United States colonialism has left a
legacy ot property confiscation,
economic manipulation, and over
extended defense boundaries. . . .
Land seized by the U.S. government
should be returned to its righttul
owners."
Libertarian stand
In the light of these principles,
where should libertarians stand on
the hot issue ol the Carter treaty?
Does it really "surrender" the canal
and the zone to the Panamanians?
Unfortunately, it does not. The
treaty is a cunning and cratty way ot
adjusting imperialism to the current
world, ol preserving imperialism
while recognizing "that continued
naked American occupation ot the
Canal /one and control of the canal
serve as a testering sore, poisoning

American diplomatic relations
throughout Latin America." (Michael
Baumann, "The New Theft ot the
Panama Canal," Intercontinental
Press, Aug. 29, 1977.)
In fact, the only thing the U.S.
gives up is tormal sovereignty over
the Canal Zone and its seemingly
perpetual ownership ot the canal.
The sovereignty over the Canal /one
the U.S. relinquishes in three years,
it is true, but we still retain extra
territoriality in violation ot interna
tional law: Americans retain U.S.
legal rights in Panamanian courts,
and Americans sentenced to jail
terms will serve them in the U.S.
Beyond this, we give up next to no
thing.
Full control
The U.S. gets to keep lull control
ot the canal until the year 2000, and it
gets to maintain its military lorce in
Panama until the year 2000 as well.
But, evena/'fer theyear2ooo, the U.S.
retains the permanent right to inter
vene militarily in Panama to preserve
the continued operation and the
"neutrality" of the canal, and it gets
to decide when that "neutrality" is
being threatened.
In short, the Panama treaty does
not at all abandon U.S. imperialism;
instead, this imperialism retreats
trom the naked and offensive older
form, to a more sophisticated and

hence more effective modern variety
of "neo-imperialism." The form of
imperialism is abandoned, but the
content is as rabid as ever. To soften
the blow to Panamanian dictator
General Torrijos, the U.S. sweetens
the pot by paying $50-$6O million a
year until 2000 — a big increase trom
the $2 million per annum we pay
now; plus $300 million in U.S. gov
ernment aids and credits, and the
U.S. will "tacilitate" $1 billion ot
U.S. investments and loans in
Panama.
Right wing
We hate to hand the right-wing
any victories in foreign affairs, even n
tor totally wrong reasons; but we
have to reluctantly but iirmlv con
clude that the Panama treaty should
be defeated. It is true that hall a loaf
is better than none; but this treaty
would not be halt a loat; it would not
halfway dismantle American im
perialism in Panama; it would simply
be providing a figleat (to mix a
metaphor) for continued and even
increased U.S. domination mote that
we now get Panamanian agreement
to the permanent U.S. right of milit
ary intervention to get what we want
in the canal.)
But most revealing of all is the
editorial support for the Panama tre
aty by National Review (NRi. NR be
gins by hailing the history ot the
canal, claiming that it was not im
perialism because the canal com
pany did not make a profit (ignoring
the big payment to the Morgan
speculators and their quick resale ot
stock to the U.S. government canal
company at double the value ot their
investment.)
Better defense
But then, NR says, we should
realize that "our own military men
support the treaty on the ground that
the canal can be better defended
with the treaty than without it."
Why? Because Panama agrees to U.S.
detense ot the canal. Either by air
and sea against any external attack;
or, the more important gOerrilla at
tack trom within Panama is now less
likely because a defense "could be
done tar better together with Panama
than without it; or worse, against it."
lust as we, as libertarians, should
be worried about unwisely defusing
