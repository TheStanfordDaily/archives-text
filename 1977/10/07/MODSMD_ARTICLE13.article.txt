Kadivar column questioned
I would appreciate an opportunity to correct some of
the errors contained in Saeed Kadivar's column
(Daily, Oct. 4) concerning the National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT) contract, particularly those concern
ing Dr. D.E. Djawan's research.
Dr. Djawan entered Stanford's Industrial Engineering
Department in Autumn 1973. He studied Iranian rural
development during his first year, before I had met him
and before there was any Iran contract. For the next two
years, early 1975 to early 1977, he worked with us on the
NIRT contract, completing his thesis research. Thus. h,s
research required from two to three years, not less than
one, as stated by Mr. Kadivar.
Dr. Djawan went through the normal Ph.D. qualifying
procedures, the oral defense of his thesis, and the thesis
review. There were, however, two somewhat unusual
aspects of his research. First, the research contract ena
bled Dr. Djawan to gather information important to his
thesis from many Iranian agricultural experts and from
other experts in Rome, London and the United States.
Second, the research results are receiving immediate
review by the Iranian agencies that can make use of
them. The orals committee, Stanford's Iran review
panel, and the NIRT reviewers, have all recognized the
high quality and contribution of this work. This was not
one of the reports affected by early termination of the
contract. If Mr. Kadivar would read beyond the introduc
tion of the thesis, I would be happy to discuss the con
tent with him,
Dr. D|awan was not and is not a member of NIRT. He

was one of the Iranian students at Stanford who took
advantage of our research program to make his thesis
relevant to his country's development needs.Mv
programs involve students from over ten different coun
tries and I try always to make their research relevant to
potential applications in their countries.
Two other comments. First, the financial problems on
the Iran contract were not related to Iran's budget prob
lems. Second, delay is a common strategy in negotiating
contract settlements in any country, especially when the
money in question is in the hands of the party doing the
delaying.

Proposals for Albers' Wall
Members of the Stanford Alpine Club would like to
propose the following changes in the Albers' Wall:
1. That it be 155 feet high and nine feet long.
2. That small, vertical cracks be used as the textural
relief medium instead of steel tubing.
I. That bolts and hangers be used as an additional
relief medium along free climbs and the top of the wall.
4. That pitons, mashies, and copperheads be prohi
bited on aid climbs whose cracks are wider than one
quarter of an inch and on all free climbs in order to
uphold the finest clean climbing ethics and to preserve
the wall for future generations of climbers.
