### Doug Yoshida 
I would like to know the name of Quick Draw
McCraw's pet dog (not Baba-Looey). The answer
to this enigmatic query has eluded even the
most avid of media freaks.

Thanks to the many Bug-Me readers who sent
in notes, the answer to this "enigmatic query"
has been found. Here are a few of the letters:
I believe that the name of Quick Draw
McCraw's pet dog was "Snuffles."
-DW
The dog's name you are refering to is "Snuf
fles." He is the one who whirls around while
embracing himself, makes ecstatic noises and
floats in the air when given a dog biscuit.
-JL
"Snuffles" was the unanimous choice. Thanks
again readers for all your help.

We know that in order to become a true Stan
ford woman, a Stanford coed must be kissed
beneath a full moon in the Quad. This tradition
is fine and dandy,but we feel that this progressive

day and age calls for something a bit more sig
nificant. To this end, my girlfriend and I have
started what we believe to be a great new tradi
tion.
Recently, while some romantics fulfilled
lifelong ambitions of becoming Stanford wo
men, an empty Stanford Stadium was witness to
a performance surpassing even the Band's crea
tive endeavors. Let's just say that our technique
results in a much more satisfied Stanford wo
man.
We would like to know if there is a precedent
for this, or if we can consider ourselves founders
of the "50-yard-line club."
-KA and LN
Well, I'm not extremely certain — but this is
the first I've ever heard of such a practice.
Maybe you could apply for club-sport status?
