# Hospital seeks aides
## 
### 
Suzie is chatting on the
phone, giving instructions
about the care and feeding of a
pet rabbit. Kevin and Jim are
shooting pool in the game
room. Cathy is busily asking
everybody about suggestions
for an upcoming Halloween
party.
This doesn't seem unusual
until one realizes that this is the
pediatrics ward at Stanford
Hospital.
Suzie and Kevin are both
teenage patients. Jim Harris
and Cathy Argus are co
chairmen of the Stanford

Aides, a group of 25 University
students who volunteer one
evening a week to work with
pediatric ward patients.
The main goal, said Harris is
to "alleviate the boredom
which so often accompanies a
prolonged stay in the hospital.
"Most important, however,
is to get the patient thinking
positively about his illness and
to get him back to their normal
routine. Too often, an adoles
cent patient will brood about
his situation, only adding to his
anxieties," said Harris.
"We do whatever they (the

patients) want to do, and un
like most of their visitors, we
are not constantly asking "How
do you feel?," added Argus.
At6p.m., seven daysaweek,
three aides arrive for a three
hour visit. Harris said during
those three hours, the volun
teer can "talk to or play pool
with the kids who can get up,
orsimply watch T.V. with those
who can't. We have home
made ice-cream and cakes for
birthdays, plan special parties,
and bring in any talent we can
dig up, like guitar-playing
friends."
The Stanford Aides program
was modeled after a similar
program at Yale two years ago.
Pediatrics Assistant Recrea
tion Director Martha Jenkins
emphasizes that the aides are
"non-uniformed peer coun
selors, here strictly as friends
to provide an enjoyable at
mosphere."
"So far, the student-run
program has met with few if
any problems," said Jenkins.
"We're very pleased with the
program" Jenkins said. "Pa
tients, parents, and the staff all
appreciate it."
Interviews for those in
terested in the program will be
held Tuesday and Wednesday
