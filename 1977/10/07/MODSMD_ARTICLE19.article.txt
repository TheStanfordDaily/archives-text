# Stanford Youth Program
## Being a friend indeed 
### Chris Haft 
Many students here have
come equipped with a certain
self-assurance developed from
years of success in junior high
and high schools.
Vet many youngsters do not
enjoy their secondary school
years, nor do they lead particu
larly fruitful lives outside of
school.
The Stanford Youth Prog
ram, about to begin its ninth
year of public service, gives
necessary guidance to over 60
young people in the three Palo
Alto Unified School District
junior high schools.
Very similar to the more
familiar "Big Brother" organi
zation, the program enlists
Stanford students, primarily
athletes, to spend time with
these youngsters to provide
them with a positive example,
help them with their personal
problems and improve their
self-esteem.
First of its kind
Initiated by the Athletic De
partment in 1969, the Stanford
Youth Program was an instant
success. Three years ago, rep
resentatives from the program
traveled to major universities
across the nation in an attempt
to popularize their project.
Several schools decided to fol
low Stanford's example includ
ing Harvard, Yale, Northwest
ern, Southern Methodist and
Duke universities.
However, finances became a
serious problem for some
programs. Chris Avery and
Duff Sumheim of the Stanford
program proposed setting up a
national directorship based at
the National Collegiate Athle
tic Association (NCAA) head
quarters in Kansas City.

Student/athletes lend a hand
to help Palo Alto youths
through the often confusing
adolescent years.

With the help of Stanford
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz,
Avery and Sumheim convinced
the NCAA in 1977 to sponsor
the program on a national
basis. Thus, each program is
jointly sponsored by a school's
athletic department and the
NCAA.
The Stanford Youth Program
is assisted by Dr. Stan Fis
chman, a child psychiatrist,
Ruetz and Ray Young; with
fund raising efforts given a
boost by U.S. Representative
Pete McCloskey and Palo Alto

attorney Skip Crist.
The Stanford Youth Program
is involved with Terman, Jor
dan, and Wilbur Junior High
Schools in Palo Alto. The prog
ram contacts the counseling
staff of each school, which in
turn gives the program the
names of students who could
use a student/athlete's gui
dance.
The program is by no means a

clinic for mentally retarded
children or a rehabilitation ser
vice for juvenile delinquents,
says Men's Director and senior
John Kirst. Those accepted,
says Kirst are "not difficult
cases — they're children who
are having the ail-too severe
problems of growing up: a
broken home, trouble relating
to their peers or lack of self
confidence."
"Athletes, of course, are
looked up to, especially a Stan
ford athlete in this community.
For these kids, having a big

brother or sister who is a Stan
ford athlete, would increase
their self-esteem while being
with these very accomplished
people." Kirst claims that lack
of self-esteem is the most
common problem among
youths.
Brother, sister
The student/athlete must
feel close to the child under his
or her care. The word "coun
selor" is scorned.
The ideal situation is to have
a student/athlete begin with a
young friend during the
youngster's freshman or
sophomore year and continue
with the youth until either the
studeiii/cithiete graduates or
the youth matures sufficiently,
says Kirst.
The big brothers and sisters
must be willing to give a pro
found effort for no pay; they
are compensated only for their
out-of-pocket expenses.
There are no rules governing
the amount of time a student/
athlete must spend with the
youth, but it is recommended
that they get together for at
least several hours a week.
"It is a real commitment,"
says Kirst, "and that's one of
the things we stress when
we're talking about the prog
ram. If you're not faithful once
you establish a relationship
with one of these kids, they

might take it personally, and
thus more harm is done than
good."
Broadening experience
Kirst points out that helping
a youth can be a broadening
experience.
"At Stanford, you're spend
ing a lot of time worrying about
your 'own thing' and your own
goals. It's nice to get outside of
the Stanford community, to
see some of the real world, and
help some people who are not
as fortunate as you," he says.
Kirst himself enjoys a warm
relationship with his "little
brother," Mark Chase.
Kirst has taken Mark to Creat
America and the Winchester
Mystery House, among other
places; they also do the things
that friends do, such as swim
ming, bicycle riding, studying
together, or watching TV.
Kirst, a native of Philadel
phia, has acquired a special
feeling for Mark and the Ch
ases. "Since I'm so far away
from home, they're like a sec
ond family to me," he says.
