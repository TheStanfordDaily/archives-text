# Engineering center receives dedication
## 
### Heidi Hedlund 
A standing-room-only crowd wel
comed Frederick Emmons Terman
with an ovation yesterday at the de
dication of the $9.2 million Terman
Engineering Center.
In his keynote speech, the 77 year
old former dean of engineering
commented on his proverbial wor
diness. "I'm overwhelmed by this
occasion and the presence of so
many of my friends," he said. "Not
so overwhelmed that I m speechless,
though."
The building, located opposite the
Daily offices, houses the depart
ments of Civil Engineering, Industrial
Engineering, Engineering-Economic
Systems, Operations Research and
the Design Division of Mechanical
Engineering.
Laboratories, offices, conference
rooms and classrooms are com
plemented by a 260 seat lecture hall,
the entire engineering library and a
computing room with 31 terminals.
Students are assets
Referring to a familiar saying that
universities are great except for the
students, Terman countered, "Stu
dents are the greatest asset the
School of Engineering has."
Albert Bowker, Chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley,
said he agreed. "Ered's success lies
partly in what he has done, and partly
in what his students have done."
Two of Terman's most successful
students are William Hewlett and
David Packard, founders of a multi
million dollar electronics industry.
The two engineering students
started their business in a garage, in
what one of the speakers termed as
"the greatest garage sale in history."

Both Hewlett and Packard attribute
much of their success to Terman's
guidance and personal interest iti
them. "Before I took Fred's class, I
didn't know a vacuum tube from the
inside of a light bulb," Ftewlett
commented.
The president and chief executive
officer of the Hewlett-Packard Co.
also fondly recalled Terman's sense
of humor. "We were walking out of
the old engineering building one
day," Hewlett said, "and he (Terrnan)
said he was looking forward to the
day when I give my first million dol
lars to this laboratory. I remember
this, because at the time I thought it
was so incredible!"
Joseph Petit, co-author of one of
Terman's books, said he "had no
trouble at all" thinkingof a speech to
honor Terman. "A student is fortu
nate indeed if his mentor has a mind
like Fred's," Petit continued.
Century of service
William Kays, dean of the School of
Engineering, cited the unique and
functional architecture of the
L-shaped Terman memorial. The
building was made possible by dona
tions from Hewlett and Packard and
may be used for 100 years or more.
President Richard Lyman remem
bered Terman's skill in university
administration. "I remember viv
idly," he said, "the experience of
being one of the associate deans of
one of the schools whose budgetary
requests Fred reviewed as Provost.—
the quaking in the boots, the sinking
feeling that no matter how much one
prepared, one would surely find that
Fred knew more about our financial
picture than we did ourselves. . .

dents are the greatest asset the
School of Engineering has."
Albert Bowker, Chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley,
said he agreed. "Ered's success lies
partly in what he has done, and partly
in what his students have done."
Two of Terman's most successful
students are William Hewlett and
David Packard, founders of a multi
million dollar electronics industry.
The two engineering students
started their business in a garage, in
what one of the speakers termed as
"the greatest garage sale in history."

Both Hewlett and Packard attribute
much of their success to Terman's
guidance and personal interest iti
them. "Before I took Fred's class, I
didn't know a vacuum tube from the
inside of a light bulb," Ftewlett
commented.
The president and chief executive
officer of the Hewlett-Packard Co.
also fondly recalled Terman's sense
of humor. "We were walking out of
the old engineering building one
day," Hewlett said, "and he (Terrnan)
said he was looking forward to the
day when I give my first million dol
lars to this laboratory. I remember
this, because at the time I thought it
was so incredible!"
Joseph Petit, co-author of one of
Terman's books, said he "had no
trouble at all" thinkingof a speech to
honor Terman. "A student is fortu
nate indeed if his mentor has a mind
like Fred's," Petit continued.
Century of service
William Kays, dean of the School of
Engineering, cited the unique and
functional architecture of the
L-shaped Terman memorial. The
building was made possible by dona
tions from Hewlett and Packard and
may be used for 100 years or more.
President Richard Lyman remem
bered Terman's skill in university
administration. "I remember viv
idly," he said, "the experience of
being one of the associate deans of
one of the schools whose budgetary
requests Fred reviewed as Provost.—
the quaking in the boots, the sinking
feeling that no matter how much one
prepared, one would surely find that
Fred knew more about our financial
picture than we did ourselves. . .
A standing-room-only crowd wel
comed Frederick Emmons Terman
with an ovation yesterday at the de
dication of the $9.2 million Terman
Engineering Center.
In his keynote speech, the 77 year
old former dean of engineering
commented on his proverbial wor
diness. "I'm overwhelmed by this
occasion and the presence of so
many of my friends," he said. "Not
so overwhelmed that I m speechless,
though."
The building, located opposite the
Daily offices, houses the depart
ments of Civil Engineering, Industrial
Engineering, Engineering-Economic
Systems, Operations Research and
the Design Division of Mechanical
Engineering.
Laboratories, offices, conference
rooms and classrooms are com
plemented by a 260 seat lecture hall,
the entire engineering library and a
computing room with 31 terminals.
Students are assets
Referring to a familiar saying that
universities are great except for the
students, Terman countered, "Stu
dents are the greatest asset the
School of Engineering has."
