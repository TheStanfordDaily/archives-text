# Do them a favor-
## Be kind to vendors 
### Jeff Elder 
There are many jobs in which
the meeting and studying of
people is inevitable. Being an
elevator operator is one. So is
being a professor. And
likewise being a vendor at a
Stanford football game.
I recently tried my luck at the
latter and learned something
about the job and about
people, especially Stanford
students.
"Hey, you boy," came a yell.
Looking up from my position
along the bottom aisle of the
stadium, my eyes scanned the
first few rows of cheering hu
manity until finally coming to
rest upon my future customer.
He was standing along the wall
at the top of the stadium.
Ups ...
I ran, lugging my forty
pounds of Pepsis and root
beers up the formidable stairs.
What one does for a first cus
tomer is amazing.
"What can I get for you, sir?"
I panted when I reached the
dizzying heights of the
stadium.
He was intensely studying
the metal tray of beverages
hanging from the strap around
my neck.
"Hey, you don't have any dry

ice," he said, staring at mean
grily.
"No sir, I don't."
"I was going to get some dry
ice from you to put in my
beer." He gave me a look that
told me I had unthinkingly let
him down. "Next time, get
some dry ice," he growled.
. . . and downs
"I'll have a strawberry mar
garita," a woman said, keeping
her eyes fixed straight ahead of
her. «
Her friends were amazed at
her wit.
"Did you hear that? A mar
garita," they tittered. The
woman seemed to be very
pleased with herself.
"Hey Elder, gimme one of
those things," cried several
thirsty spectators.
"Hey man, leave him alone.
What's wrong with you?" yel
led someone else in the crowd,
staring at the others in the dis
gust.
"I know your neck hurts. Just
take it easy for a while," the
friend said comfortingly. He
then looked at me earnestly.
"Say, Jeff. . . you couldn't just
give one of those away, could
you?"
As my slow trek down the
stairs took its course, I came

face to face with an obstacle.
The man must have been at
least 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds. I
had plenty of time to study him
as I waited for him to move. He
stood two feet in front of me,
focusing his camera.
Deciding that he would not
be moving before the return of
the Ice Age, I took a careful
step.
"Aw shit, son, you ruined
the picture!"
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to,"
I mumbled, hurrying away.
The cheering continued to
assault my ears. Business was
brisk.
"I never wanted a soft
drink," said a lady I had passed
45 minutes ago. She handed
back an unopened can.
I stared at her in disbelief.
Forty five minutes in the hot
sun without drinking a drop
. . . incredible.
By the end of the day, I had
sold 233 cans, talked to hun
dreds of spectators and
studied thousands more.
My one consolation for the
sore neck and arms was that
both Darrin Nelson and I had
run to please the same crowd.
