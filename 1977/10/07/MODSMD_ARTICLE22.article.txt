# McEnroe thrives on antics
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
John McEnroe is just like any
other freshman here. He's a
good pupil, a nice guy and. like
most Stanford students, he has
a special talent.
Walking through White Plaza
in a pair of jeans, his longish
hair blowing in the wind and
just a trace of a grin accenting
his face, McEnroe, super ten
nis sensation, is hardly distin
guishable from others on cam
pus.
But put McEnroe on a tennis
court and look out. . . .
Some persons have said his
court behavior seems to be tai
lored after an Hie "Nasty" Nas
tase style.
McEnroe's court antics vary
from match to match, but he
has several pet pranks that pre
vail. Of these, the most pre
dominant is vocal confronta
tion.
He often questions the
linesmen, bickers with um
pires and calls out to oppo
nents. Verbal abuse aimed at
himself like "You stink!" can
be heard when he misses a
shot. He sometimes tells the
audience to shut up.
McEnroe's face alone could
show everyone his inner feel
ings as he charges through a
match. He stomps on the court
and sometimes gestures to the
spectators and officials.
Of his court behavior, McEn
roe says, "Because I'm so
competitive, I'm very intense
on the court. Little things can
become annoying. Like when I
think a line has been called
wrong. I usually ask the lines
man if he's sure of his call, but I
try not to say anything bad to
him or about him. That just
makes things worse for me.
"Normally, I just ask once,
and if there's no change, I give
up on that point. Sometimes it
upsets me, though," he says.
On several occasions McEn
roe has been compared to
Jimmy Connors. McEnroe
shrugs, "I like to be thought of
as myself, but I guess when
people see bad behavior they
compare it to previous exam
ples of the same type of thing.
I've been trying to act better
the last seven weeks, but still,
it's tough to live down a reputa
tion.
"Other than that, the only
similarity I see is that we're
both lefties. Connors hits the

ball harder than anyone, and I
really play my own game, so
unless I get aggravated on the
court, there's not much com
parison," he says.
Still, McEnroe does get ag
gravated on the court. Often
his antics trigger audience
reaction. Because McEnroe,
18, is young to be playing in the
big leagues, the audience cat
calls are aimed at his youth.
Cries of "Hey, John, didn't you
get your nap today?" and"It
must be your feeding time,
huh, John?" may be heard at
McEnroe's matches.
Although he tries not to let
his feelings about the calls
show outwardly, McEnroe ad
mits "When the audience yells
those things, it makes me feel
like a baby. I don't think their
calls are justified so I try not to
let them bother me, especially
when the audience doesn't
realize what's going on. Still
sometimes they can get to
you."
"John is totally confident
about everything he does, yet
on the court his confidence
comes across as cockiness," a
teammate commented. "Every
point is a war to John because
he's so intense."
Apparently, intensity is a key
to winning, even though its
side effects may be unattrac
tive. After viewing many of
McEnroe's matches, one ten
nis enthusiast concluded, "Al
though John's court behavior
leaves a bit to be desired, I've
never seen him fight for a point
he didn't deserve."

his antics trigger audience
reaction. Because McEnroe,
18, is young to be playing in the
big leagues, the audience cat
calls are aimed at his youth.
Cries of "Hey, John, didn't you
get your nap today?" and"It
must be your feeding time,
huh, John?" may be heard at
McEnroe's matches.
Although he tries not to let
his feelings about the calls
show outwardly, McEnroe ad
mits "When the audience yells
those things, it makes me feel
like a baby. I don't think their
calls are justified so I try not to
let them bother me, especially
when the audience doesn't
realize what's going on. Still
sometimes they can get to
you."
"John is totally confident
about everything he does, yet
on the court his confidence
comes across as cockiness," a
teammate commented. "Every
point is a war to John because
he's so intense."
Apparently, intensity is a key
to winning, even though its
side effects may be unattrac
tive. After viewing many of
McEnroe's matches, one ten
nis enthusiast concluded, "Al
though John's court behavior
leaves a bit to be desired, I've
never seen him fight for a point
he didn't deserve."

Several hours before going up to San Francisco last week to play in a
tennis tournament, frosh net sensation |ohn McEnroe demonstrated
his shots while inside his Wilbur double. Instead of a conventional
warmup jacket, McEnroe opted for a sport coat.
John McEnroe is just like any
other freshman here. He's a
good pupil, a nice guy and. like
most Stanford students, he has
a special talent.
Walking through White Plaza
in a pair of jeans, his longish
hair blowing in the wind and
just a trace of a grin accenting
his face, McEnroe, super ten
nis sensation, is hardly distin
guishable from others on cam
pus.
But put McEnroe on a tennis
court and look out. . . .
Some persons have said his
court behavior seems to be tai
lored after an Hie "Nasty" Nas
tase style.
McEnroe's court antics vary
from match to match, but he
has several pet pranks that pre
vail. Of these, the most pre
dominant is vocal confronta
tion.
He often questions the
linesmen, bickers with um
pires and calls out to oppo
nents. Verbal abuse aimed at
himself like "You stink!" can
be heard when he misses a
shot. He sometimes tells the
audience to shut up.
McEnroe's face alone could
show everyone his inner feel
ings as he charges through a
match. He stomps on the court
and sometimes gestures to the
spectators and officials.
Of his court behavior, McEn
roe says, "Because I'm so
competitive, I'm very intense
on the court. Little things can
become annoying. Like when I
think a line has been called
wrong. I usually ask the lines
man if he's sure of his call, but I
try not to say anything bad to
him or about him. That just
makes things worse for me.
"Normally, I just ask once,
and if there's no change, I give
up on that point. Sometimes it
upsets me, though," he says.
On several occasions McEn
roe has been compared to
Jimmy Connors. McEnroe
shrugs, "I like to be thought of
as myself, but I guess when
people see bad behavior they
compare it to previous exam
ples of the same type of thing.
I've been trying to act better
the last seven weeks, but still,
it's tough to live down a reputa
tion.
"Other than that, the only
similarity I see is that we're
both lefties. Connors hits the

ball harder than anyone, and I
really play my own game, so
unless I get aggravated on the
court, there's not much com
parison," he says.
Still, McEnroe does get ag
gravated on the court. Often
his antics trigger audience
reaction. Because McEnroe,
18, is young to be playing in the
big leagues, the audience cat
