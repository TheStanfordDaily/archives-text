# Season mark drops to 1-6-1
## Booters fall to UCLA, 3-0 
### Dean Eyre 
me Stanford soccer team,
failing to capitalize on oppor
tunities and suffering from
"mental breakdowns," lost to
UCLA, No. 1-rated team in the
West, 3-0. Wednesday's loss
dropped the Cardinals' record
to 1-6-1.
Mike Callan scored UCLA's
first goal on a 35-yard kick 25
minutes into the game. The
Cards' offense didn't capitalize
on several scoring oppor
tunities and repeatedly drove
against the Bruins' strong side
instead of switching fields.
Defensively, Stanford was
under tiring pressure to keep
the game within reach. The
Cards contained UCLA for 65
minutes until Ole Mikkelsen
scored twice within the final
two minutes. Both goals came
with assists from Tim Ngubeni,
as the Bruins beat the weary
Card defense.
Commenting on Stanford's
"mental breakdown," head
coach Nelson Lodge said, "I'd
attribute the loss to not
capitalizing on their weakness
which was their outside
fullbacks. I think we should
have switched the ball and we
did not. We had Jon Hecht in a
one-on-one situation which is
the kind of situation you want
in soccer. We didn't switch —
that's what upsets me as a
coach."
One of the basic problems
for the Cards was ball control.
Lodge explained that the team
would "go through (the strong
side) instead of drawing the
UCLA defenders. There are a
lot of things we're doing wrong
even basically, fundamentally
— like trapping. The trapping
was atrocious. It (the ball) was
getting away and they were
countering off our poor trap."
Regarding the missed scor
ing attempts, one of which
came right after the game be
gan, Lodge felt that if the team
"could have gotten a goal in

the first 40 seconds it would
have been an entirely different
game. Then, the pressure
would have been different,"
he said.
Assistant coach Phil Wright
pointed out the demanding
situation the defenders had.
"The offense got no penetra
tion, therefore they put in
tense pressure on the defense
all game," he said. Again, ball
handling was mentioned as a
key problem.
Wright said, "Practically
every game, goals have come
because as we try to move the
ball upfield, we make the
wrong type of pass and lose the
ball. I thought )im Melamed
(midfielder) had a very good
game."
Mark Triska, junior fullback
said, "We could keep the ball
out, but we had trouble getting
the ball through. We were out
played. We didn't have the of
fense push — the strength to
keep the ball down on UCLA's
side. We don't have enough
skill to dribble through."
The defense gave the Bruin
forwards close coverage, until
they were worn out near the
end of the game. The forwards
were unmarked, and got free
to get the scores.
Triska added, "Once we
gave them that first goal, we
didn't give them anything else
except for the last three mi
nutes. We let down I guess, the
defense let down."
Greg Delgado, sophomore
fullback, also expressed
thoughts on the weakness in
passing. "We're having a hard
time booting the ball out to the
wings. We're not talented
enough to control (through
midfield)," he said. There was
a breakdown in the goalie area
— we weren't marking. There
should have been switching.
The defense was being intimi
dated — we're not putting it all
together."
Delgado added, "It was hard

for the defense to keep up
when there was no score.
Psychologically, it's very
weakening."
Steve Cay, head coach for
UCLA, commented that while
the Stanford defense was
doing well, the Bruin offense
was struggling, especially in
the first half. "They (Stanford)
frustrated us by not letting us
score. I think that our team did
not play well the first half. Stan
ford was frustrating us, but we
were our own problem," said
Cay.
Analyzing the Cardinal's
shortcomings, Cay also cited a
lack of passing which stifled
the offense. "They're an ag
gressive, hard team — I just
don't think they have any
punch up front. Their difficulty
was not having connection be
tween the half line and the
forward line. I'm very glad to
get out of the game alive," he
said.

Analyzing the Cardinal's
shortcomings, Cay also cited a
lack of passing which stifled
the offense. "They're an ag
gressive, hard team — I just
don't think they have any

me Stanford soccer team,
failing to capitalize on oppor
tunities and suffering from
"mental breakdowns," lost to
UCLA, No. 1-rated team in the
West, 3-0. Wednesday's loss
dropped the Cardinals' record
to 1-6-1.
Mike Callan scored UCLA's
first goal on a 35-yard kick 25
minutes into the game. The
Cards' offense didn't capitalize
on several scoring oppor
tunities and repeatedly drove
against the Bruins' strong side
instead of switching fields.
Defensively, Stanford was
under tiring pressure to keep
the game within reach. The
Cards contained UCLA for 65
minutes until Ole Mikkelsen
scored twice within the final
two minutes. Both goals came
with assists from Tim Ngubeni,
as the Bruins beat the weary
Card defense.
Commenting on Stanford's
"mental breakdown," head
coach Nelson Lodge said, "I'd
attribute the loss to not
capitalizing on their weakness
which was their outside
fullbacks. I think we should
have switched the ball and we
did not. We had Jon Hecht in a
one-on-one situation which is
the kind of situation you want
in soccer. We didn't switch —
that's what upsets me as a
coach."
One of the basic problems
for the Cards was ball control.
Lodge explained that the team
would "go through (the strong
side) instead of drawing the
UCLA defenders. There are a
lot of things we're doing wrong
even basically, fundamentally
— like trapping. The trapping
was atrocious. It (the ball) was
getting away and they were
countering off our poor trap."
Regarding the missed scor
ing attempts, one of which
came right after the game be
gan, Lodge felt that if the team
"could have gotten a goal in

the first 40 seconds it would
have been an entirely different
game. Then, the pressure
would have been different,"
he said.
Assistant coach Phil Wright
pointed out the demanding
situation the defenders had.
"The offense got no penetra
tion, therefore they put in
tense pressure on the defense
all game," he said. Again, ball
handling was mentioned as a
key problem.
Wright said, "Practically
every game, goals have come
because as we try to move the
ball upfield, we make the
wrong type of pass and lose the
ball. I thought )im Melamed
(midfielder) had a very good
game."
Mark Triska, junior fullback
said, "We could keep the ball
out, but we had trouble getting
the ball through. We were out
played. We didn't have the of
fense push — the strength to
keep the ball down on UCLA's
side. We don't have enough
skill to dribble through."
The defense gave the Bruin
forwards close coverage, until
they were worn out near the
end of the game. The forwards
were unmarked, and got free
to get the scores.
Triska added, "Once we
gave them that first goal, we
didn't give them anything else
except for the last three mi
nutes. We let down I guess, the
defense let down."
Greg Delgado, sophomore
fullback, also expressed
thoughts on the weakness in
passing. "We're having a hard
time booting the ball out to the
wings. We're not talented
enough to control (through
midfield)," he said. There was
a breakdown in the goalie area
— we weren't marking. There
should have been switching.
The defense was being intimi
dated — we're not putting it all
together."
Delgado added, "It was hard

for the defense to keep up
when there was no score.
Psychologically, it's very
weakening."
Steve Cay, head coach for
UCLA, commented that while
the Stanford defense was
doing well, the Bruin offense
was struggling, especially in
the first half. "They (Stanford)

Psychologically, it's very
weakening."
Steve Cay, head coach for
UCLA, commented that while
the Stanford defense was
doing well, the Bruin offense
was struggling, especially in
the first half. "They (Stanford)
frustrated us by not letting us
score. I think that our team did
not play well the first half. Stan
ford was frustrating us, but we
were our own problem," said
Cay.
Analyzing the Cardinal's
shortcomings, Cay also cited a
lack of passing which stifled
the offense. "They're an ag
gressive, hard team — I just
don't think they have any
punch up front. Their difficulty
was not having connection be
tween the half line and the
forward line. I'm very glad to
get out of the game alive," he
said.
