The No. 1-ranked Stanford
water polo team hosts Long
Beach State today in deGuerre
Pool at 3:30 p.m., then enter
tains UCLA tomorrow at 11
a.m.
Long Beach, a strong swim
ming team, according to Car
dinal coach Dante Dettamanti,
is led by Olympic swffnmerTim
Shaw and All-America Sean
Buckner.
"They're probably the fastest
team we'll play this year," De
ttamanti said. "Besides ourse-

Ives, they're one of the fastest
teams around. I think our reac
tions are quicker, though.
"They run a lot of picks and
screens in their offense so
we've been trying to practice
our switching on defense," he
said.
Long Beach, who Dettamanti
termed "one of the top teams
in the Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation," upset powerful
UCLA in overtime in a recent
game.
UCLA, meanwhile, invades

deGuerre tomorrow at 11 a.m.
for the Cards' first Pacific-8
contest this season.
Dettamanti said the Bruins
are always tough, but they've
lost some games due to the ab
sence of players with eligibility
problems.
"They have no superstars,
for a change," the Cardinal
coach said. "They just have a
lot of good players."
Admission to the games will
be $1.50 for adults and 50 cents
for students and children.
