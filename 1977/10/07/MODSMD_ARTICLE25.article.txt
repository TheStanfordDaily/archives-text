# Spikers down Irvine in three
## 
### Ken Betts 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team overcame a dis
oriented start to beat a tough
UC-lrvine team in three
straight games last night, 15-11,
15-11, 15-10.
Stanford started sluggishly
and made many apparent men
tal errors as the Anteaters
jumped out to a 7-1 lead in the
first game. The Cards, how
ever, stubbornly battled back
and finally tied the game at 11.
From there Stanford ran off
four straight points to take the

game. Coach Art Lambert attri
buted the flat start to the fact
that the Cards simply "weren't
ready to play."
The win in the first game
seemed to give the Cards a
boost in confidence as the
spikers clearly controlled play
in the last two contests.
The superb play of Cindy
Whitaker and Liz Hughes
seemed to tighten up the
Cards' performance as this
tandem was able to find the
vacant spots in the Irvine de
fense with searing spikes.
The win over Irvine raised
the Spiker's record to 8-1. The
Cards' next home game should
prove to be a great one. Stan
ford takes on USC, the defend
ing AIAW champion, on Oct.
14 at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
