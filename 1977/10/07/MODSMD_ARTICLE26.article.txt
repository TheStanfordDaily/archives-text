Aiming to repeat as field
hockey conference champ
ions, Stanford's scotchers
proved they were ready to de
fend their title by Wednesday's
performance against Sac
ramento State.
Though the final score was
3-0 in favor of Stanford, the vit
tory was even more impressive
as the offense didn't get un
packed until the midway point
of the first half.
Sacramento came out ag
gressively in the opening mi
nutes of the contest, but were
soon forced on the defensive
by a well-coordinated Cardinal

attack.
Senior Onnie Killefer, an
All-America candidate, regis
tered two of the Stanford
scores off strong corner
penalty rushes, and the third
tally was added by Mandy
Read. Total dominance by the
Cards, coached by Barbara
Longstreth, was evidenced in
the game statistics which
showed Stanford with 14 shots
at goal and Sacramento with
only two.
Sacramento's coach noted
unhappily that the Stanford
women were "always in better
position" throughout the
game.
