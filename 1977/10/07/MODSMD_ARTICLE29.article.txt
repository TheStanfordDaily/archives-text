# Cardinals prepare for tough test against UCLA
## 
### Bill Burger 
Recent history has shown
that if Stanford beats UCLA
tomorrow, the Cards will be in
Pasadena to face either Ohio
State or Michigan on Jan. 2.
(Yes, the Rose Bowl is played
on the second next year be
cause New Year's Day is on
Sunday.)
Of course, another college
team from Los Angeles may
think it should be the Pacific
-B's representative to the pre
stigious New Year's Day, uh —
I mean day after New Year's
Day contest. But we'll save that
argument for Nov. 5, when
Stanford invades the Coliseum
to meet the Trojans of USC.
But back to tomorrow's
game. Stanford has won only
two games against the Bruins in
the last 14 years. Pretty dismal.
Those two wins, however,
came in 1970 and 1971, the
years in which the Jim
Plunkett/Don Bunce-led Cards
played in — and won two Rose
Bowls. The ones on Jan. 1.
So this game is a big one,
certainly the biggest one of the
year thus far.
Everyone knows now that
Cuy Benjamin will watch to
morrow's action from the

sidelines, but Stanford wins
not by pass alone but by
balancing its offense so that
when it does pass, the play is
effective.
Oils called upon
Replacing Benjamin will be
Steve Dils, the man who im
pressed last Saturday's crowd
with his composure and lead
ership. Dils came off the bench
in the final quarter against
Oregon to direct the Cards on
a 70-yard touchdown march to
seal the victory.
Dils' quarterbacking career
prior to the Oregon game con
sisted of one play against
Washington State in 1976 and
an incomplete pass after a
fumbled snap on a field goal
attempt in the season's opener
at Colorado. On many of his
passes, Dils will be
Bill Kellar, a fine receiver and
longtime friend.
Speedster James Lofton,
whocaughta 37-yard bomb last
week should also be a favorite
target for Dils.
"I have confidence in Steve
Dils," Card coach Bill Walsh
said Monday. "He is an intelli
gent player. He has poise, con
fidence and a strong arm."
These attributes have appa

rently led to Walsh's decision
to go with his usual game plan
tomorrow, despite the loss of
Benjamin.
Hopefully, that game plan
will produce a bit more scoring
offense than the Cardinals
could muster last week against
Oregon.
Stanford moved the ball well
against the Ducks but was un
able to score on four occasions
after getting the ball deep into
Oregon territory.
Nelson — top frosh
But there are positive as
pects to the Card offense. Dar
rin Nelson is currently the most
productive freshman halfback
in the country. Ranking sixth
nationally in all-purpose rush
ing (which includes rushing
and kick return yardage)
with 155.5 yards per game and
tied for ninth in pass recep
tions with 21, Nelson is leading
the nation's freshmen in both
categories.
In addition, Nelson ranks
first in receiving and all
purpose rushing in the latest
Pac-8 statistics.
Junior running back Phil
Francis returned to action
against Oregon to rush for 66
yards and one touchdown.

Francis had been sidelined
with tendinitis in his hip prior
to last weekend's game.
The defensive effort on the
Cards' part was a most pleasant
surprise last weekend. Only
three of Oregon's 10 points
were earned against Stanford's
defensive 11: the other seven
came after a Benjamin pass in
terception was returned to the
Card 1-yard line.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds,
an outstanding defense hack
who missed much of the early
season action because of an in
jury suffered playing baseball
in the spring, is listed as doubt
ful for tomorrow with a shoul
der separation he received last
week.
Linebackers shine
Stanford's linebacking trio
has been playing exceptionally
well this season. Gordy Cere
sino, Ray Cardinalli and
freshman Tom Hall rank first,
second and fourth in total tack
les for the team.
Cardinalli, a senior, inter
cepted a pass, forced one fum
ble and recovered another
against Oregon.
The Cards kicking game has
been strong all year with
freshman Ken Naber seven
of-nine on field goal attempts
and five-of-six on PATs. Brad
Fox is averaging 43.6 yards per
punt, giving Stanford an im
portant edge in almost every
game this year.
Bruin coach Terry Donahue
said on Monday, "If they (Stan
ford) have a weakness, we ha
ven't found it in the films."
UCLA brings a 2-2 record
into tomorrow's game, having
lost to Houston and Minnesota
on the road and defeating Kan
sas and lowa at home. The
Bruins have lost their last three
road games, extending back to
last season's Liberty Bowl loss
to Alabama.
Walsh put the losses into
perspective, however, saying,
"Two losses early in the year
are not going to keep UCLA out
of the Pac-8 race."
Brown unlikely
UCLA has hadan injury prob
lem of its own since star
halfback Theotis Brown dislo
cated his elbow in the Bruin's
season opener against Hous
ton. Brown will probably not
see any action tomorrow.
Replacing Brown as
sparkplug of the running game
is junior James Owens, a
world-class hurdler, who, ac
cording to Walsh "is blossom
ing into an outstanding back."
Owens carried the ball 16 times
in the Bruin's 34-16 defeat of
lowa last week for 134 yards,
including a 67-yard touchdown

romp.
Owens ranks tourth in Pac-8
rushing yardage and teams
with Scott Stauch and Glenn
Cannon to give the Bruins a po
tent running attack.
UCLA is not the rushing
oriented team it once was,
however. Sophomore quar
terback Rick Bashore has com
pleted 57.6 per cent of his pas
ses this year and as Donahue
said, "We are more balanced
than in the past. We have the
ability to throw."
Donahue said that to win
"you can't do any one thing
against a team as well-coached

as Stanford."
The UCLA defense has sev
eral outstanding players, in
cluding inside linebacker Jerry
Robinson who returned an in
terception 69 yards for a
touchdown against Stanford
last year in the Cards' disastr
ous 38-20 loss to the Bruins.
All Pac-8 cornerback Levi
Armstrong and tackle Manu
Tuiasosopo bolster the defen
sive corps.
"Our sc- has not
been challenged all year," said
Donahue. "In terms of youth
and inexperience," he added,
"Stanford's defense is much

like our own."
Walsh indicated that "the
pass rush has hurt us. The
linebacker blitz is what really
has us worried this week."
Tomorrow's game is mean
ingless to Nevada's oddsmak
ers, who refuse to give a
point-spread on the contest
because of both teams' in
juries. But Stanford students,
alums and fans who would
enjoy basking under the sun in
Pasadena on the first. . .sorry,
second of lanuary, see this
game as the one to win — at
least if history is to be trusted.

State or Michigan on Jan. 2.
(Yes, the Rose Bowl is played
on the second next year be
cause New Year's Day is on
Sunday.)
Of course, another college
team from Los Angeles may
think it should be the Pacific
-B's representative to the pre
stigious New Year's Day, uh —
I mean day after New Year's
Day contest. But we'll save that
argument for Nov. 5, when
Stanford invades the Coliseum
to meet the Trojans of USC.
But back to tomorrow's
game. Stanford has won only
two games against the Bruins in
the last 14 years. Pretty dismal.
Those two wins, however,
came in 1970 and 1971, the
years in which the Jim
Plunkett/Don Bunce-led Cards
played in — and won two Rose
Bowls. The ones on Jan. 1.
So this game is a big one,
certainly the biggest one of the
year thus far.
Everyone knows now that
Cuy Benjamin will watch to
morrow's action from the

sidelines, but Stanford wins
not by pass alone but by
balancing its offense so that
when it does pass, the play is
effective.
Oils called upon
Replacing Benjamin will be
Steve Dils, the man who im
pressed last Saturday's crowd
with his composure and lead
ership. Dils came off the bench
in the final quarter against
Oregon to direct the Cards on
a 70-yard touchdown march to
seal the victory.
Dils' quarterbacking career
prior to the Oregon game con
sisted of one play against
Washington State in 1976 and
an incomplete pass after a
fumbled snap on a field goal
attempt in the season's opener
at Colorado. On many of his
passes, Dils will be
Bill Kellar, a fine receiver and
longtime friend.
Speedster James Lofton,
whocaughta 37-yard bomb last
week should also be a favorite
target for Dils.
"I have confidence in Steve
Dils," Card coach Bill Walsh
said Monday. "He is an intelli
gent player. He has poise, con
fidence and a strong arm."
These attributes have appa

rently led to Walsh's decision
to go with his usual game plan
tomorrow, despite the loss of
Benjamin.
Hopefully, that game plan
will produce a bit more scoring
offense than the Cardinals
could muster last week against
Oregon.
Stanford moved the ball well
against the Ducks but was un
able to score on four occasions
after getting the ball deep into
Oregon territory.
Nelson — top frosh
But there are positive as
pects to the Card offense. Dar
rin Nelson is currently the most
productive freshman halfback
in the country. Ranking sixth
nationally in all-purpose rush
ing (which includes rushing
and kick return yardage)
with 155.5 yards per game and
tied for ninth in pass recep
tions with 21, Nelson is leading
the nation's freshmen in both
categories.
In addition, Nelson ranks
first in receiving and all
purpose rushing in the latest
Pac-8 statistics.
Junior running back Phil
Francis returned to action
against Oregon to rush for 66
yards and one touchdown.

Francis had been sidelined
with tendinitis in his hip prior
to last weekend's game.
The defensive effort on the
Cards' part was a most pleasant
surprise last weekend. Only
three of Oregon's 10 points
were earned against Stanford's
defensive 11: the other seven
came after a Benjamin pass in
terception was returned to the
Card 1-yard line.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds,
an outstanding defense hack
who missed much of the early
season action because of an in
jury suffered playing baseball
in the spring, is listed as doubt
ful for tomorrow with a shoul
der separation he received last
week.
Linebackers shine
Stanford's linebacking trio
has been playing exceptionally
well this season. Gordy Cere
sino, Ray Cardinalli and
freshman Tom Hall rank first,
second and fourth in total tack
les for the team.
Cardinalli, a senior, inter
cepted a pass, forced one fum
ble and recovered another
against Oregon.
The Cards kicking game has
been strong all year with
freshman Ken Naber seven
of-nine on field goal attempts
and five-of-six on PATs. Brad
Fox is averaging 43.6 yards per
punt, giving Stanford an im
portant edge in almost every
game this year.
Bruin coach Terry Donahue
said on Monday, "If they (Stan
ford) have a weakness, we ha
ven't found it in the films."
UCLA brings a 2-2 record
into tomorrow's game, having
lost to Houston and Minnesota
on the road and defeating Kan
sas and lowa at home. The
Bruins have lost their last three
road games, extending back to
last season's Liberty Bowl loss
to Alabama.
Walsh put the losses into
perspective, however, saying,
"Two losses early in the year
are not going to keep UCLA out
of the Pac-8 race."
Brown unlikely
UCLA has hadan injury prob
lem of its own since star
halfback Theotis Brown dislo
cated his elbow in the Bruin's
season opener against Hous
ton. Brown will probably not
see any action tomorrow.
Replacing Brown as
sparkplug of the running game
is junior James Owens, a
world-class hurdler, who, ac
cording to Walsh "is blossom
ing into an outstanding back."
Owens carried the ball 16 times
in the Bruin's 34-16 defeat of
lowa last week for 134 yards,
including a 67-yard touchdown

romp.
Owens ranks tourth in Pac-8
rushing yardage and teams
with Scott Stauch and Glenn
Cannon to give the Bruins a po
tent running attack.
UCLA is not the rushing
oriented team it once was,
however. Sophomore quar
terback Rick Bashore has com
pleted 57.6 per cent of his pas
ses this year and as Donahue
said, "We are more balanced
than in the past. We have the
ability to throw."
Donahue said that to win
"you can't do any one thing
against a team as well-coached

as Stanford."
The UCLA defense has sev
eral outstanding players, in
cluding inside linebacker Jerry
Robinson who returned an in
terception 69 yards for a
touchdown against Stanford
last year in the Cards' disastr
ous 38-20 loss to the Bruins.
All Pac-8 cornerback Levi
Armstrong and tackle Manu
Tuiasosopo bolster the defen
sive corps.
"Our sc- has not
been challenged all year," said
Donahue. "In terms of youth
and inexperience," he added,
"Stanford's defense is much

like our own."
Walsh indicated that "the
pass rush has hurt us. The
linebacker blitz is what really
has us worried this week."
Tomorrow's game is mean
ingless to Nevada's oddsmak
ers, who refuse to give a
point-spread on the contest
because of both teams' in
juries. But Stanford students,
alums and fans who would
enjoy basking under the sun in
Pasadena on the first. . .sorry,
second of lanuary, see this
game as the one to win — at
least if history is to be trusted.

Sunday.)
Of course, another college
team from Los Angeles may
think it should be the Pacific
-B's representative to the pre
stigious New Year's Day, uh —
I mean day after New Year's
Day contest. But we'll save that
argument for Nov. 5, when
Stanford invades the Coliseum
to meet the Trojans of USC.
But back to tomorrow's
game. Stanford has won only
two games against the Bruins in
the last 14 years. Pretty dismal.
Those two wins, however,
came in 1970 and 1971, the
years in which the Jim
Plunkett/Don Bunce-led Cards
played in — and won two Rose
Bowls. The ones on Jan. 1.
So this game is a big one,
certainly the biggest one of the
year thus far.
Everyone knows now that
Cuy Benjamin will watch to
morrow's action from the

sidelines, but Stanford wins
not by pass alone but by
balancing its offense so that
when it does pass, the play is
effective.
Oils called upon
Replacing Benjamin will be
Steve Dils, the man who im
pressed last Saturday's crowd
with his composure and lead
ership. Dils came off the bench
in the final quarter against
Oregon to direct the Cards on
a 70-yard touchdown march to
seal the victory.
Dils' quarterbacking career
prior to the Oregon game con
sisted of one play against
Washington State in 1976 and
an incomplete pass after a
fumbled snap on a field goal
attempt in the season's opener
at Colorado. On many of his
passes, Dils will be
Bill Kellar, a fine receiver and
longtime friend.
Speedster James Lofton,
whocaughta 37-yard bomb last
week should also be a favorite
target for Dils.
"I have confidence in Steve
Dils," Card coach Bill Walsh
said Monday. "He is an intelli
gent player. He has poise, con
fidence and a strong arm."
These attributes have appa

rently led to Walsh's decision
to go with his usual game plan
tomorrow, despite the loss of
Benjamin.
Hopefully, that game plan
will produce a bit more scoring
offense than the Cardinals
could muster last week against
Oregon.
Stanford moved the ball well
against the Ducks but was un
able to score on four occasions
after getting the ball deep into
Oregon territory.
Nelson — top frosh
But there are positive as
pects to the Card offense. Dar
rin Nelson is currently the most
productive freshman halfback
in the country. Ranking sixth
nationally in all-purpose rush
ing (which includes rushing
and kick return yardage)
with 155.5 yards per game and
tied for ninth in pass recep
tions with 21, Nelson is leading
the nation's freshmen in both
categories.
In addition, Nelson ranks
first in receiving and all
purpose rushing in the latest
Pac-8 statistics.
Junior running back Phil
Francis returned to action
against Oregon to rush for 66
yards and one touchdown.

Francis had been sidelined
with tendinitis in his hip prior
to last weekend's game.
The defensive effort on the
Cards' part was a most pleasant
surprise last weekend. Only
three of Oregon's 10 points
were earned against Stanford's
defensive 11: the other seven
came after a Benjamin pass in
terception was returned to the
Card 1-yard line.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds,
an outstanding defense hack
who missed much of the early
season action because of an in
jury suffered playing baseball
in the spring, is listed as doubt
ful for tomorrow with a shoul
der separation he received last
week.
Linebackers shine
Stanford's linebacking trio
has been playing exceptionally
well this season. Gordy Cere
sino, Ray Cardinalli and
freshman Tom Hall rank first,
second and fourth in total tack
les for the team.
Cardinalli, a senior, inter
cepted a pass, forced one fum
ble and recovered another
against Oregon.
The Cards kicking game has
been strong all year with
freshman Ken Naber seven
of-nine on field goal attempts
and five-of-six on PATs. Brad
Fox is averaging 43.6 yards per
punt, giving Stanford an im
portant edge in almost every
game this year.
Bruin coach Terry Donahue
said on Monday, "If they (Stan
ford) have a weakness, we ha
ven't found it in the films."
UCLA brings a 2-2 record
into tomorrow's game, having
lost to Houston and Minnesota
on the road and defeating Kan
sas and lowa at home. The
Bruins have lost their last three
road games, extending back to
last season's Liberty Bowl loss
to Alabama.
Walsh put the losses into
perspective, however, saying,
"Two losses early in the year
are not going to keep UCLA out
of the Pac-8 race."
Brown unlikely
UCLA has hadan injury prob
lem of its own since star
halfback Theotis Brown dislo
cated his elbow in the Bruin's
season opener against Hous
ton. Brown will probably not
see any action tomorrow.
Replacing Brown as
sparkplug of the running game
is junior James Owens, a
world-class hurdler, who, ac
cording to Walsh "is blossom
ing into an outstanding back."
Owens carried the ball 16 times
in the Bruin's 34-16 defeat of
lowa last week for 134 yards,
including a 67-yard touchdown

romp.
Owens ranks tourth in Pac-8
rushing yardage and teams
with Scott Stauch and Glenn
Cannon to give the Bruins a po
tent running attack.
UCLA is not the rushing
oriented team it once was,
however. Sophomore quar
terback Rick Bashore has com
pleted 57.6 per cent of his pas
ses this year and as Donahue
said, "We are more balanced
than in the past. We have the
ability to throw."
Donahue said that to win
"you can't do any one thing
against a team as well-coached

as Stanford."
The UCLA defense has sev
eral outstanding players, in
cluding inside linebacker Jerry
Robinson who returned an in
terception 69 yards for a
touchdown against Stanford
last year in the Cards' disastr
ous 38-20 loss to the Bruins.
All Pac-8 cornerback Levi
Armstrong and tackle Manu
Tuiasosopo bolster the defen
sive corps.
"Our sc- has not
been challenged all year," said
Donahue. "In terms of youth
and inexperience," he added,
"Stanford's defense is much

like our own."
Walsh indicated that "the
pass rush has hurt us. The
linebacker blitz is what really
has us worried this week."
Tomorrow's game is mean
ingless to Nevada's oddsmak
ers, who refuse to give a
point-spread on the contest
because of both teams' in
juries. But Stanford students,
alums and fans who would
enjoy basking under the sun in
Pasadena on the first. . .sorry,
second of lanuary, see this
game as the one to win — at
least if history is to be trusted.

stigious New Year's Day, uh —
I mean day after New Year's
Day contest. But we'll save that
argument for Nov. 5, when
Stanford invades the Coliseum
to meet the Trojans of USC.
But back to tomorrow's
game. Stanford has won only
two games against the Bruins in
the last 14 years. Pretty dismal.
Those two wins, however,
came in 1970 and 1971, the
years in which the Jim
Plunkett/Don Bunce-led Cards
played in — and won two Rose
Bowls. The ones on Jan. 1.
So this game is a big one,
certainly the biggest one of the
year thus far.
Everyone knows now that
Cuy Benjamin will watch to
morrow's action from the

sidelines, but Stanford wins
not by pass alone but by
balancing its offense so that
when it does pass, the play is
effective.
Oils called upon
Replacing Benjamin will be
Steve Dils, the man who im
pressed last Saturday's crowd
with his composure and lead
ership. Dils came off the bench
in the final quarter against
Oregon to direct the Cards on
a 70-yard touchdown march to
seal the victory.
Dils' quarterbacking career
prior to the Oregon game con
sisted of one play against
Washington State in 1976 and
an incomplete pass after a
fumbled snap on a field goal
attempt in the season's opener
at Colorado. On many of his
passes, Dils will be
Bill Kellar, a fine receiver and
longtime friend.
Speedster James Lofton,
whocaughta 37-yard bomb last
week should also be a favorite
target for Dils.
"I have confidence in Steve
Dils," Card coach Bill Walsh
said Monday. "He is an intelli
gent player. He has poise, con
fidence and a strong arm."
These attributes have appa

rently led to Walsh's decision
to go with his usual game plan
tomorrow, despite the loss of
Benjamin.
Hopefully, that game plan
will produce a bit more scoring
offense than the Cardinals
could muster last week against
Oregon.
Stanford moved the ball well
against the Ducks but was un
able to score on four occasions
after getting the ball deep into
Oregon territory.
Nelson — top frosh
But there are positive as
pects to the Card offense. Dar
rin Nelson is currently the most
productive freshman halfback
in the country. Ranking sixth
nationally in all-purpose rush
ing (which includes rushing
and kick return yardage)
with 155.5 yards per game and
tied for ninth in pass recep
tions with 21, Nelson is leading
the nation's freshmen in both
categories.
In addition, Nelson ranks
first in receiving and all
purpose rushing in the latest
Pac-8 statistics.
Junior running back Phil
Francis returned to action
against Oregon to rush for 66
yards and one touchdown.

Francis had been sidelined
with tendinitis in his hip prior
to last weekend's game.
The defensive effort on the
Cards' part was a most pleasant
surprise last weekend. Only
three of Oregon's 10 points
were earned against Stanford's
defensive 11: the other seven
came after a Benjamin pass in
terception was returned to the
Card 1-yard line.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds,
an outstanding defense hack
who missed much of the early
season action because of an in
jury suffered playing baseball
in the spring, is listed as doubt
ful for tomorrow with a shoul
der separation he received last
week.
Linebackers shine
Stanford's linebacking trio
has been playing exceptionally
well this season. Gordy Cere
sino, Ray Cardinalli and
freshman Tom Hall rank first,
second and fourth in total tack
les for the team.
Cardinalli, a senior, inter
cepted a pass, forced one fum
ble and recovered another
against Oregon.
The Cards kicking game has
been strong all year with
freshman Ken Naber seven
of-nine on field goal attempts
and five-of-six on PATs. Brad
Fox is averaging 43.6 yards per
punt, giving Stanford an im
portant edge in almost every
game this year.
Bruin coach Terry Donahue
said on Monday, "If they (Stan
ford) have a weakness, we ha
ven't found it in the films."
UCLA brings a 2-2 record
into tomorrow's game, having
lost to Houston and Minnesota
on the road and defeating Kan
sas and lowa at home. The
Bruins have lost their last three
road games, extending back to
last season's Liberty Bowl loss
to Alabama.
Walsh put the losses into
perspective, however, saying,
"Two losses early in the year
are not going to keep UCLA out
of the Pac-8 race."
Brown unlikely
UCLA has hadan injury prob
lem of its own since star
halfback Theotis Brown dislo
cated his elbow in the Bruin's
season opener against Hous
ton. Brown will probably not
see any action tomorrow.
Replacing Brown as
sparkplug of the running game
is junior James Owens, a
world-class hurdler, who, ac
cording to Walsh "is blossom
ing into an outstanding back."
Owens carried the ball 16 times
in the Bruin's 34-16 defeat of
lowa last week for 134 yards,
including a 67-yard touchdown

romp.
Owens ranks tourth in Pac-8
rushing yardage and teams
with Scott Stauch and Glenn
Cannon to give the Bruins a po
tent running attack.
UCLA is not the rushing
oriented team it once was,
however. Sophomore quar
terback Rick Bashore has com
pleted 57.6 per cent of his pas
ses this year and as Donahue
said, "We are more balanced
than in the past. We have the
ability to throw."
Donahue said that to win
"you can't do any one thing
against a team as well-coached

as Stanford."
The UCLA defense has sev
eral outstanding players, in
cluding inside linebacker Jerry
Robinson who returned an in
terception 69 yards for a
touchdown against Stanford
last year in the Cards' disastr
ous 38-20 loss to the Bruins.
All Pac-8 cornerback Levi
Armstrong and tackle Manu
Tuiasosopo bolster the defen
sive corps.
"Our sc- has not
been challenged all year," said
Donahue. "In terms of youth
and inexperience," he added,
"Stanford's defense is much

like our own."
Walsh indicated that "the
pass rush has hurt us. The
linebacker blitz is what really
has us worried this week."
Tomorrow's game is mean
ingless to Nevada's oddsmak
ers, who refuse to give a
point-spread on the contest
because of both teams' in
juries. But Stanford students,
alums and fans who would
enjoy basking under the sun in
Pasadena on the first. . .sorry,
second of lanuary, see this
game as the one to win — at
least if history is to be trusted.

Steve Dils, starting his first Stanford game tomorrow, has some big shoes to fill — those of Guy Benjamin
the Cards' star quarterback who was sidelined last week with a small tear in the ligaments in his left knee
The Cards face the Bruins at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Recent history has shown
that if Stanford beats UCLA
tomorrow, the Cards will be in
Pasadena to face either Ohio
State or Michigan on Jan. 2.
(Yes, the Rose Bowl is played
on the second next year be
cause New Year's Day is on
Sunday.)
Of course, another college
team from Los Angeles may
think it should be the Pacific
-B's representative to the pre
stigious New Year's Day, uh —
