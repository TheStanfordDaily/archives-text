# New parking rates bring few protests

### Lane Webster 
Despite the increased cost of stu
dent resident parking permits ap
proved by last year's parking com
mittee, few people have protested,
according to Laverne Hart of Police
Services.
"The students do not complain,"
she said. "It's probably because we
have the lowest paid parking of any
school in the state." She said that
UC-Berkeley, for example, has no
on-campus parking for students.
Permits for what parking there is cost
twice as much as Stanford's.
Nonetheless, with processing in
complete, sales of student parking
permits are down by an estimated 50
per cent from last year, while faculty
permit sales are down about 25 per
cent, said parking secretary Carol
Christiansen.
Hart said the $15 cost of resident
permits is needed to pay for the stic
kers, enforcement of parking
privileges and the Marguerite shuttle
bus. "A," "B," and "C" stickers are
priced at $60, $40 and $15 respec
tively.
Carpools
Free parking permits are now av
ailable for carpools. An "A" sticker
requires four people, a "B" three and
a "C" two. In each case one person
must be a faculty member. Also for
the first time, students may now
purchase "A" stickers.

At least two campus residents have
told the Daily that they plan to risk
parking without paying. One student
has considered painting his truck red
and white to resemble a University
vehicle, logo and all.
Using cost-benefit analysis,
another reasoned that enforcement
is weak enough not to land him with
seven and a half $2 tickets in one
year. That way, he believes, he'll
come out ahead.
"In years past," Hart said, "we've
had a few people who try to beat the
system. We ordinarily catch up with
them."
Full force
She said the six University police
men assigned specifically to parking
will be out in full force on Monday.
"We try to give students and staff a
two-week grace period," she said.
"We don't want to be cruel or unfair
to those who have had difficulty get
ting a permit."
Nonetheless, she said, any com
plaints of stickerless cars parking in
places for registered vehicles will be
checked out promptly.
Another change this year hits stu
dents who wish to register more than
one vehicle. As before, the second
vehicle may park for free. But the
owner must bring each car's registra
tion at the same time to stop people
from pairing up and getting free stic
kers illegally.
