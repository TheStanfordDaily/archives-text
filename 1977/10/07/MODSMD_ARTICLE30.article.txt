# Hargadon joins grid prophets
## 
### 
This week the staff sooth
sayers add the name of the
University's No. 1 pick man,
Dean of Admissions fred
Hargadon, to its ignomious
and doubtful list of pigskin
prognosticators. Each week
a different member oi the
Stanford community will be
asked to add his or her gridi
ron expertise to the lift ,o d
prescience of the Daily's
sportswriters.
Of his picks, Hargadon
said, "In order to carry out
this task, I simply resorted
to our usual method for de
ciding between two applic
ants Tor the last remaining
place in the freshman class.
"I sought the advice of
Frank Sinatra, )ean Dixon
and asked Mrs. Pike to
check with her late hus
band. Assuming the travel
ling teams can get past the
flower children in the air

ports with only minor in
juries, I predict:
"Stanford over UCLA.
Steve and friends will pickle
their defense, while Cordy
and Ray & Co. will give the
Odd job treatment to their
offense.
"California over
Washington State. Cal will
have two touchdowns cal
led back for running the
wrong way, but will still win.
"Oregon over
Washington. Oregon turns
on their inhospitality.
"USC over Alabama. USC
has the Horse and the
horses. Bear stands to lose
more than his hat in the Col
iseum.
"Oregon State over BYU.
Egad! If I must pick an up
set, this is it. BYU's celestial
attack will be less impres
sive as they now move to the
league where 11-man foot
ball is played."
