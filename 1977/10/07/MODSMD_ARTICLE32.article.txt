Spaniard wins Nobel in literature
Stockholm, Sweden — The Swedish Academy of Letters
yesterday awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize for Literature to
Spaniard Vicente Aleixandre, a sickly recluse cited for a
half-century of haunting, surrealistic poetry that "il
luminates man's condition in the cosmos."
The academy's choice was a surprise — the 79 year old
Aleixandre's reputation has been largely limited 'o the
Spanish-speaking world. Such internationally celeb
rated authors as Britain's Doris Lessing, Turkey's Yasar
Kemal and West Germany's Guenther Grass had „cen
prominently mentioned as front-runners for this year's
award.
The decision was staunchly defended by Lars Gyl
lensten, a novelist and secretary to the 18-member
academy. "It is not the purpose of the Nobel Prize to
declare the current literary world champion," he said.
He suggested that the world had finally caught up with
Aleixandre: "His outlook . . . should be attractive to
modern readers."
American writer Kurt Vonnegut )r. may have summed
up much of the reaction, saying in Finland, "Who is fie?
I'm totally ignorant about him."
Aleixandre himself, who will receive a $145,000 cash
award, was modest, saying at his Madrid home the
award was a "surprise."
"I think I have no other merit than having (ought
against a great adversity in my life: a lack ot physical
health."
But the academy cited Aleixandre for his "creative
poetic writing, which, with roots in the traditions of
Spanish lyric verse and in modern currents, illuminates
man's condition in the cosmos and in soci
ety."
Aleixandre is the first Spaniard residing in Spain to win
the prize since before the late Gen. Francisco Franco
established his four-decade long right-wing dictator
ship. A Spanish poet, J.K. Jimenez, won the 1956 prize,
but he was a Spanish civil war exile living in Puerto Kico.
Senate rejects Carter's energy plan
Washington — The Senate rejected President )immy
Carter's proposal for cheaper electricity during non
peak hours, while a key committee voted down the last
of his major energy tax plans yesterday.
The Senate Finance Committee also voted to block the
president from imposing a $5-a-barrel tee on imported
oil as an alternative means of forcing energy conserva
tion.
Completing its action on the non-tax portions of the
president's energy program, the Senate approved on an
86 to 7 vote a watered-down version of Carter's plan to
reform electric rates.
But it scrapped entirely the president's proposal to

make utilities offer bargain rates for electricity con
sumed at night or during other non-peak hours. Carter
also wanted to prohibit utilities from selling power at
bargain rates to large industries.
The House had passed that proposal.
By contrast, the Senate bill would otter lower electric
rates to senior citizens and would give the government
the right to intervene in state electric rate-making cases
— but only to make recommendations on energy con
servation.
A House-Senate conference committee will have to
reconcile the difterences.
The finance committee, atter rejecting the bulk ot
Carter's energy-tax program, voted nine to two to en
dorse his goal ot reducing U.S. reliance on foreign oil
through some yet to be determined system ot tax cuts —
but not through tax increases.
Labor party votes to dissolve Lords
London — Britain's House ot Lords, abolished and
then revived more than 300 years ago, probably will still
hold out tor a long time despite the latest Labor party
vote that it be dissolved.
The party's annual convention, representing Labor
rank and tile, voted by a 70-1 margin Wednesday in tavor
of eliminating the 782-year-old upper house of Parlia
ment.
Oliver Cromwell eliminated the FHouse ot Lords back
in 1649 because it "was found by long experience to be
useless and dangerous to the people ot England.'" Labor
party arguments for abolition sounded much the same
in 1977.
Brought back with the restoration of the monarchy in
1660, the House of lords has declined over the past
century as a power in British politics but still retains a
potential for delay in the legislative process.
Fhe anti-Lords vote is not binding on Prime Minister
lames Callaghan's government and the task of steering
such a bill tfirough Parliament, tampering as it does with
a part of England's heritage, would daunt even the
strongest government. The Labor government, six seats
short ot a majority and dependent on Liberals, indepen
dents and small party votes to stay in power, hardly has
that kind of strength.
Wholesale prices rebound slightly
Washington — Wholesale prices turned upward by
one-half of one per cent in September, but a govern
ment economist said yesterday there is no evidence that
retail lood prices will begin spiraling again.
The increase followed three months ot declines or
little change in the Labor Department's over-all
wholesale price index.
File increase was the biggest since a 1.1 per cent in
crease in April, just before wholesale food prices began

a dramatic decline.
Farm product prices dropped a total ot 15.2 per cent in
May through August, translating into a slower rise in
food prices at the grocery store.
The September report showed prices ot tarm products
declining only two-tenths of one per cent.
Courtenay Slater, chiet Commerce Department
economist, said, " Fhere is still no reason to believe lood
prices will be rising much at the retail level. They should
be moderate for the rest ot the year."
She said food price increases should be in the lour to
4' i per cent range in the next year or so. Grocery prices
have risen less than one per cent in the past three
months.
Bell to focus on antitrust reform
Washington — The Carter administration is planning
an over-all examination of the nation's complex antitrust
laws, emphasizing toughened enforcement and im
proved efficiency in the fight-against monopolies.
Vice President Walter Mondale and Atty. Gen. GriWin
Bell indicated the question of antitrust enforcement,
and its affect on consumers, was on the administration's
agenda.
The two appeared yesterday at the ceremony to swear
into office the new head of the Justice Department's
antitrust division.
The fact that the swearing-in of Asst. Atty. Gen. lohn
Shenefield was held in the White House was itself a sign
ot the increased focus on antitrust enforcement. Such
ceremonies are usually held at the Justice Department,
where they attract less attention.
Study predicts low birth rate trend
Santa Monica — The unprecedented low birth rate in
America is likely to continue indefinitely as long as the
economy keeps expanding and many young women
choose to work, says a Kand Corp. study released yes
terday.
The prediction follows from what two Kand resear
chers say is the recent reversal of an historic trend that in
the past meant more babies were born in periods of
prosperity.
The government-ordered report's conclusions con
tradict the view of most population analysts that Ameri
can fertility will increase again soon.
"We have to qualify our predictions tor the more
distant future because there will be a bottoming out of
the downward trend eventually," noted Michael Ward,
who wrote the report along with another economist,
William Butz.
"Obviously people are not going to stop having
babies altogether, but low levels ot fertility are probably
with us to stay."

Jury denies TV-insanity defense
Miami — Konny /amora, the 15-year-old whose de
tense against a first-degree murder c harge was based on
a claim of television-induced insanity, was convicted late
yesterday.
The jury ot nine men and six women reached the
decision atter about two hours of deliberation.
The youth was also convicted on three other counts —
burglary, armed robbery and possession of a firearm
during the commission of a felony.
/amora stood, pale and shaken and head bowed, dur
ing the reading of the verdicts. His mother, sitting be
hind him, was expressionless.
Circuit judge Paul Baker agreed to a defense request
tor a pre-sentence investigation of Zamora's
background and set sentencing for Nov. 7.
The prosecution had waived the death penalty in the
case, citing the boy's age. The charge now carries a
minimum sentence of 25 years.
The |ury returned at about 11: iO p.m., but announce
ment of the verdict was delayed as the court waited tor
defense attorney Fllis Rubin to rush back from his home.
About 35 minutes after the deliberations began, the
jury had returned briefly to ask the judge to reread the
definitions ot all the possible murder charges against
/amora and the penalties.
He and Darrell Agrella, 14, were accused ot killing
Elinor Haggart, Zamora's 83-year-old socialite neighbor
on Miami Beach on |une 4. Police said she caught them
ransacking her home.
