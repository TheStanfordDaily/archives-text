# Minimum wage hike approved by Senate
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Senate
voted 76 to 13 yesterday to increase
the federal minimum wage in four
steps to $3.40 an hour in 1981.
The present minimum of $2.30 an
hour, in effect since Jan. 1, 1976,
would go to $2.65 an hour on )an. 1,
1978, to $2.90 an hour in 1979, and to
$3.15 an hour in 1980.
The House in September voted to
increase the minimum to $2.65 in
1978, to $2.85 in 1979 and to $3.05 in
1980.
The Senate defeated that proposal
on a vote of 60 to 32.
Differences in the minimum wage
rates will have to be worked out in a
House-Senate conference commit
tee after the Senate passes a final bill,
probably today.
The schedule of annual increases
in the Senate bill was a compromise
proposal supported by labor and the
Carter administration, after the
House on Sept. 15 rejected a formula
for perpetual automatic annual in
creases based on a percentage of av
erage annual wages of factory work
ers.
The compromise was presented to
the Senate by Sen. Harrison Williams
(D-N.J.), chairman, and Sen. Jacob
Javits (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican
on the Senate Human Resources
Committee, which originally had ap
proved the formula based on man
ufacturing wage, known as indexing.
Willfams said the schedule of rates
in the compromise amendment ap
proximates the rates that would have
been established under the indexing
formula, but that he recognized con
cerns about the endless annual in
creases in the minimum wage with
out congressional review.
Williams told the Senate the wage
rates in the Javits-Williams amend
ment would still produce an annual
income five per cent less than the
poverty rate for a non-farm family of
four in 1981.
"This," he said, "is the least we can
do to provide a fair shake for
minimum wage workers and an ac
tion we must take if we are to prevent
them from suffering a further reduc
tion in their already meager standard
of living."
In proposing the lower figures al
ready adopted by the House, Sen.
John Tower (D-Tex.) said the higher
rates would "cause layoffs, higher
prices, and a general reduction in

services available to the public."
Sen. Dewey Bartlett (R-Okla.)
proposed an even lower schedule of
$2.50 an hour in 1978, $2.70 in 1979
and $2.90 in 1980. It was rejected
72-17.
The Senate also turned down 57-32
an amendment by Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), to strike the 1981
increase from the Williams-Javits
proposal.

an amendment by Sen. Pete

Washington (AP) — The Senate
voted 76 to 13 yesterday to increase
the federal minimum wage in four
steps to $3.40 an hour in 1981.
The present minimum of $2.30 an
hour, in effect since Jan. 1, 1976,
would go to $2.65 an hour on )an. 1,
1978, to $2.90 an hour in 1979, and to
$3.15 an hour in 1980.
The House in September voted to
increase the minimum to $2.65 in
1978, to $2.85 in 1979 and to $3.05 in
1980.
The Senate defeated that proposal
on a vote of 60 to 32.
Differences in the minimum wage
rates will have to be worked out in a
House-Senate conference commit
tee after the Senate passes a final bill,
probably today.
The schedule of annual increases
in the Senate bill was a compromise
proposal supported by labor and the
Carter administration, after the
House on Sept. 15 rejected a formula
for perpetual automatic annual in
creases based on a percentage of av
erage annual wages of factory work
ers.
The compromise was presented to
the Senate by Sen. Harrison Williams
(D-N.J.), chairman, and Sen. Jacob
Javits (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican
on the Senate Human Resources
Committee, which originally had ap
proved the formula based on man
ufacturing wage, known as indexing.
Willfams said the schedule of rates
in the compromise amendment ap
proximates the rates that would have
been established under the indexing
formula, but that he recognized con
cerns about the endless annual in
creases in the minimum wage with
out congressional review.
Williams told the Senate the wage
rates in the Javits-Williams amend
ment would still produce an annual
income five per cent less than the
poverty rate for a non-farm family of
four in 1981.
"This," he said, "is the least we can
do to provide a fair shake for
minimum wage workers and an ac
tion we must take if we are to prevent
them from suffering a further reduc
tion in their already meager standard
of living."
In proposing the lower figures al
ready adopted by the House, Sen.
John Tower (D-Tex.) said the higher
rates would "cause layoffs, higher
prices, and a general reduction in

services available to the public."
Sen. Dewey Bartlett (R-Okla.)
proposed an even lower schedule of
$2.50 an hour in 1978, $2.70 in 1979
and $2.90 in 1980. It was rejected
72-17.
The Senate also turned down 57-32
an amendment by Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), to strike the 1981
increase from the Williams-Javits
proposal.
