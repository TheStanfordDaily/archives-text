# Tenure refused to Sandra Bem
## Psych prof plans appeal to board 
### Karen Wada 
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
said yesterday she will appeal her
twice-denied tenure bid to the Uni
versity's final authorities in the case,
the Academic Council's Advisory
Board and President Richard Lyman.
Last (anuary, the Psychology De
partment unanimously recom
mended Bern for tenure. In March,
however, Humanities and Sciences
Dean Halsey Royden vetoed the re
quest.
Provost William Miller upheld
Royden's decision last june.
If the Advisory Board confirms the
denial, Bern's contract with the Uni
versity would end in June 1978, ac
cording to Bern's husband, Psychol
ogy Prof. Daryl Bern.
If this occurs, Daryl Bern said, both
professors would leave the Univer
sity and find positions elsewhere.
No c omment
.Miller would not comment on his
June decision, explaining, "I will
confirm that in my review with the
dean I concurred . . . but in regard
for Sandra Bern's rights, I cannot dis
cuss the case."
With his wife unavailable for
comment, Daryl Bern said he was re
luctant to "jeopardize this by talking
too much about it. Normally, we
think the students should have as
much information as possible, but
this is a sensitive situation."
Winning appeals at the Advisory

Board level is difficult, he said, be
cause the reviewers consider only a
case's procedural circumstances.
Criteria
Even if he disagrees with it, Bern
said, the reviewer can reverse an ear
lier decision only if it violates criteria
cited in the University's Faculty
Handbook:
— Were the proper facts and
criteria brought to bear on the deci
sion? Were improper or extraneous
criteria brought to bear on the deci
sion?
— Were there any procedural ir
regularities that substantially af
fected the outcome of the matter?
— Given proper facts, criteria and
procedures, was the decision one
which a person in the position of the
decision-maker might reasonably
have made?
Second denial
Bern's second tenure denial was
not announced until yesterday be
cause the University never confirms
such action unless applicants make
the initial announcements.
No one knows when the Advisory
Board will decide the case, Daryl
Bern said.
He added that the Psychology De
partment, with one tenured woman,
has not promoted a woman to te
nured status since 1931. ,
The Academic Council's Advisory
Board consists of seven professors.
