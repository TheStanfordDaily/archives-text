# Nom Com to select 40 students
## Committee posts to be filled 
### Sara Lessley 
At least 40 positions on University
committees are open to students,
with ex officio positions open only to
freshmen and transfers, according to
ASSU Committee Staff Assistant
Janet Rappaport.
Within the next two weeks the AS
SU's Nominations Committee (Nom
Com) will begin reviewing applica
tions and interviewing people for
positions on committees including
Undergraduate Admissions, Services
to Students and Foreign Study Prog
rams, she said.
The committees recommend, ad
vise and coordinate various prog
rams on campus.

"Albers' Wall, the issue of free
parking, it's all there in the commit
tees," Rappaport said.
She added that this year "there
won't be a bunch of loose-ended
committees reporting to no one in
particular."
Instead, after the Nom Com has
appointed students to the various
committees, each of the six Nom
Com members will take several re
lated committees under his or her
jurisdiction.
The Nom Com member and his or
her committees will meet regularly,
Rappaport said. The Nom Com
member will fill out a report based on
ideas, problems and suggestions

from the members of the commit
tees. Heor she will takethese reports
directly to the senate so it will know
exactly what is happening in the
committees.
"Instead of having a big gap in the
communications network, it will all
run more smoothly," Rappaport ad
ded.
Inaddition, the Nom Com will now
have a continuous job rather than
serving simply as an interview board.
This may help make the Nom Com
more aware of who it appoints to
committees, Rappaport said.
Applications for positions on the
University committees are available
in the ASSU office. They must be re
turned by Oct. 14.
