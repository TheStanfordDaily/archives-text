Delta Tau Delta (Delts), in association with the Food
Bank of San lose, is holding its second annual canned
food drive Saturday at the UCLA football game, said
Jordan Schwartz, Delt vice president and the project's
director.
The food collected will be distributed to needy senior
citizens in the Bay Area by Operation Brown Bag, a
subsidiary of the Food Bank.
Delt pledges will man collection barrels at all entr
ances to the stadium. Since some fans mistook the bar
rels for trash cans during last year's drive, or missed
them entirely, this year the barrels will be well identified
by large signs, said Schwartz.
While acknowledging that alumni and local fans will
probably be the major contributors, Schwartz said he
hopes students will get involved too. FHe described the
drive as a worthy and non-controversial cause which is
easy to support.

Operation Brown Bag is a heavily volunteer organiza
tion dedicated to helping senior citizens maintain a ba
lanced diet.
Usually the organization collects non-marketable
tood left over by local retailers and growers in the Cent
ral Valley afld drops it off at locations throughout Santa
Clara County, according to Mary Heising, Brown Bag
director.
The senior citizens then pick up the bags of food and
divide it among themselves. The Delt food will be distri
buted in the same manner.
Schwartz said he hopes the food drive can become a
Stanford tradition, associated with either the UCLA or
USC game (whichever is played at home that year) in the
same way the bonfire is associated with the Big Game.
The Delts' first tood drive aided their successful at
tempt to be reinstated on campus. But, according to
Schwartz, the Delts believe it is an idea that is worthy of
not only their continued support, but the support ot all
members ot the Stanford ((immunity.
