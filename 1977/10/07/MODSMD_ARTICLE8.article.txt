# Balance science, humanism

It has become customary for a
large, diverse group of scientists,
humanists, government officials and
public advocates to assert that the
scientist has an increasingly vital role
to play in developing public policy
for science-related affairs.
This is an easy idea to justify. After
all, the past few years have seen dis
coveries and the development of
techniques that reach directly into
our daily lives by affecting our ethical
standards, the quality of life around
us, even the very nature of our family
and personal lives. It seems logical,
then, that the scientist be allowed to
participate in high-level decision
making, where scientific discoveries
or practices could change the quality
of life.
Often, in the past, however, the
entrance into public affairs by a
specialized group of individuals has
been greeted with something less
than welcoming enthusiasm. What
would science do but add to the wel
ter of voices and the confusion of
moving bodies already present in
Washington, D.C.?
The problem of the scientist in
government and, more generally, of
science in society raises a number of
questions. Where does objective
science end and value judgment be
gin? How should the scientist fit into
the policy-making apparatus? What
should government do about the

university and vice versa? How far
can we trust the judgment of scien
tists or legislators dealing with
science-related problems?
That these questions are being
raised is good. It has been a long
journey from alchemist and as
trologer to mildly eccentric country
naturalist to socially-conscious pro
fessional, and it would be a shame to
see the specific kinds of talent rep
resented by scientists ignored by the
institutions responsible! for solving
social problems. But what is there to
do now?
The 'Environmental Age'
The first thing, perhaps, is to try to
understand the problem in terms of
the larger system of society. The "En
vironmental Age" of the 60s has ex
panded our consciousness of the in
tricate web of the natural environ
ment. If we take this one step further,
we observe that all processes — liv
ing/non-living and societal — are re
lated, sometimes in ways that are not
at all obvious. Therein lies the worth
of scientists dealing with social prob
lems, both the ones that they have
caused or will cause and those that
are caused by the general activities of
man.
Secondly, they can communicate
results to the lay public in an
understandable form, so that we can
take further action. Finally, scientists

can help make the value judgments
that shape policy — but as citizens,
not "experts."
These questions are especially im
portant to the members of the Stan
ford community. The University is
now involved in areas of high con
troversy that are intimately linked to
public policy.
Stanford's efforts
Stanford's pioneering efforts in
energy conservation and research in
energy technology give us an ideal
opportunity to participate in the dis
cussions of energy policy. A substan
tial number of professors are on
leave in Washington, D.C. to head,
among other agencies, the National
Science Foundation, the Food and
Drug Administration, the Institute of
Medicine, and the National Institute
of Child Health and Human De
velopment.
Stanford faculty also serve on
prominent scientific advisory com
mittees of the National Academy of
Sciences. In light of these facts, it
might be a timely idea to launch
campus-wide discussion on the role
of the scientist in government and
the nature of scientific responsibil
ity.
The problem with this sort of dis
cussion is that it rapidly degenerates
into a firing range for malcontents,
the biased and the uninformed. Sci
ence is a peculiar activity; it must be
pursued with an objective mind, un
clouded by emotional biases.
The science-society interface is a
new concept and a new field of inves
tigation for all of us. It is an exciting,
unexplored topic, and it should be
considered without the emotional
accusations, denunciations and
mutual distrust that has marred the
earliest forays of scientists into pub
lic affairs, notably the A-bomb deci
sion, the recombinant DNA con
troversy and the SST decision.
Science and humanism must be
balanced. There is tremendous po
tential for societal and physical chaos
in that fragile link between the scien
tific enterprise and society at large.
But there is also a potential for a very
fruitful relationship that comes of the
pursuit of new ideas.
