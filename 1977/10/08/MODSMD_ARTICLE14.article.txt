# Drink and be merry
## Tailgating's a bash 
### Jay Roach 
Three hours before the kic
koff they arrive in numbers . . .
big numbers, and all ready to
Play-
Football is everything to
them, but they don't come on
buses, they don't dress in
pads, and they don't arrive as a
team.
They arrive as a mass. They
are tailgaters.
It's another home-game
Saturday at Stanford and as
thousands of football freaks
roll into the wooded parking
areas around the stadium, they
prepare to take part in a tradi
tion.
Long before coach Walsh's

ground game begins, the tail
gaters' ground strategy (claim
as much as possible as early as
you can with as many cars and
tables as are handy) will have
covered many times more
yards than Darrin Nelson's
ever dreamed about.
"It's a great sport," beamed
one proud alumnus before a
game. He wasn't talking about
football, he was referring to
the block party, class or family
reunion, beer bust, cocktail
party and social event that sur
rounds Stanford football on
every side.
Football isn't everything,
though. "It's only the catalyst,"
a middle-aged tailgatersaid. "It
gives us a reason to get to
gether and have fun once in a
while."
Having fun at a tailgate party
looks easy, but some of the
veterans seem to think it re
quires as much planning,
strategy and equipment as
winning a game against USC.
Friends and food
"The important thing is to
get here early," a 1958 graduate
said. "Some people sleep here
over night. We bring the cars
over the day before the game
just so we can get this spot
each time." The spot, centered
among three shady oak trees,
seemed to be worth the trou
ble.
"Good food, good drink and
good friends" were another
family's ingredients, according
to the hostess. "This is all it re
ally takes," added her grinning
husband, holding up a bottle
of rum high off the red lace tab
lecloth. He was convincing.
Some groups go elaborately,
with barbecue spits,
candlelabras and floral center
pieces. Others bring fast-food
boxes and eat from fruit crates.
A typical setting includes a
red-checkered tablecloth co
vered with cold chicken,
potato salad and plenty of ah
cohol.
Repeat: Plenty of alcohol.
"There have been times
when he didn't even make it
into the game after a morning's
worth of daquiris," whispered
a map-eyed alum's wife.
Wandering from tailgate
party to tailgate party can be
hazardous to one's sober state.
"Try this," offered a half
dozen already polluted fans.
"We call it 'bug juice.' " After
drinking a couple glasses full,
one doesn't care what it is cal
led. They apologized for
forgetting the red food color
ing.
Clothing counts
"It doesn't matter what you
bring, it's what you wear," em
phasized a plump woman who
was dressed all in red. "BRING
BACK THE INDIAN" blared
from numerous buttons cor
nering the lapels of her bright
red pants suit and a block 'S'
was centered in a corsage on
her shoulder.

The other members of her
party agreed heartily, their red
feathers jerking through the air
as they excitedly nodded their
inebriated heads.
Carlton and Vera May
Thomas, 1937 grads, said they
had been coming to the same
tree outside one main gate for
years and years. They always
arrive early, and a TV perched
on the tailgate of their station
wagon helps them pass the
time until their friend, George
Gillespi, arrives. They claim
Gillespi was the first to play a
glockenspiel in the Stanford
Band during the 19305. (In
those days, Gillespi said the
Daily was called the 'Dippy.')
Gillespi spoke of some
memorable parties. "One guy
hired a butler," he remem
bered. "For years, people just
kept trying to out do each
other. But for me, companion
ship, a little booze, and
eucalyptus shade have always
been enough."
Food for thought
An interesting part of the
sport of tailgating is what the
players talk about on the field.
The conversations focused on
Darrin Nelson, the game's out
look, and stories of old football
greats. Former coach Jack
Christiansen and the return of
the Indian were topics among
the red-feathered set.
Tailgating is an institution at
many stadiums across the
country. Veterans of the Stan
ford version say it's been going
strong here at least since liquor
was allowed on campus in the
mid-'6os.
Bob Murphy, the athletic di
rector at San Jose State, was the
Stanford Sports Information
Director (SID) in those days. It
was he who began to use tail
gating as a promotable aspect
of Stanford football during
some losing seasons.
"We played Army at West
Point one year. I wandered
around and took notice,"
Murphy said.
And so, as Gary Cavalli (the
current SID) remembers, Mur
phy began promoting each
game as "A Day On The Farm"
with much more than just
football to offer.
"We didn't start it," Murphy
admits, "we just gave it a
push."
With free parking, unpaved,
shady lots, and thousands of
fans enjoying it, there just
hasn't been enough friction to
slow tailgating down since that
push. Now, no description of
Stanford football is complete
without mentioning tailgating.
Conversely, there's no tail
gating without football. One
recent grad put it this way:
"Football . . . that's the cen
terpiece. The social life just
makes it better."
That's it. An all day picnic
party, with lots of food and
drink on the table and, yes,
football in the middle.
