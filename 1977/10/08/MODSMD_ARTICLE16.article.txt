# Halftime festivities
## The 						Band reviews the evolution of the ear 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is a summary of
today's halftime presentation by the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band, pre
pared for the Daily by a special committee of the
Band, which is responsible for its content.)
The Stanford Band proclaims to the world its
New Ear's resolution!
Realizing the Ear is waxing in popularity, the
Band would like to dedicate halftime to all those
Ears that have been pierced in the service of
mankind, thereby drastically altering the course
of western civilization. Imagine, if you will, a
herd of prehistoric ears, peacefully grazing in
the noonday sun. Late in the afternoon of the
sixth day, God looked down upon these inno
cent creatures and envisioned for them a better
way to get a head.
Not entirely sure, however, of how to best
wed man and his new-found ears, He abdicated
all responsibility (in familiar fashion), thus giv
ing Man a blank check to Put It Where You Want
It. Observe the prototypical Ear, template for
many oblivious generations.
Man was then in a quandry the number of
access points through which he had been at
tempting to come to grips with his inner self had
been increased by 40 per cent, confusing him
greatly. This dilemma caused our simple but
curious ancestors to experiment with the uses of
his newest orifices. He tried smelling with them,
tasting with them, even smoking with them. And
before he hit upon their proper usage he had
even attempted "Aural Sex." Regarding the

twisted course of earvents leading to the even
tual discovery of hearing, the Band plays Pretzel
Logic.
After this point in Man's cultural develope
ment, he began to realize the value of his ears;
soon his own were not enough and he began to
covet the ears of those around him. Vestiges of
this petty jealousy persist today, as was recently
shown by the cold-blooded theft of the Ear of J.
Paul Getty, Jr.
His robbers brutally removed it for simple
amusement; then, when the novelty wore off,
they took the Ear to the marketplace and traded
it for substantial monetary recompense. (Ears
must be valuable indeed.) Depicting this chilling
separation of man and Ear, the Band plays Cold
as Ice, as it portrays the fateful event, in allegori
cal fashion.
Not all is dark, however, in the history of our
friend the Ear. With it, our greatest thinkers have
become inspired to soar heavenward.-In the
sciences, literature, and the arts, this must be
the Age of Earlightenment! Van Gogh,, for in
stance, was very attached to his ear. (In fact, for
years he carried a spare.) To Van Gogh, the Ear
was a symbol of divine life, a belief which even
tually led him to cut it off, so as to give of himself
to his loved one. (She, in turn, gave him her
eye!) Both remained optimistic. The Band re
flects this optimism, playing Still the One.
Hoping that this brief outline causes you to be
kind to your Aurifices, the Band wishes you a
happy new Ear.

New Ear's resolution!
Realizing the Ear is waxing in popularity, the
Band would like to dedicate halftime to all those
Ears that have been pierced in the service of
mankind, thereby drastically altering the course
of western civilization. Imagine, if you will, a
herd of prehistoric ears, peacefully grazing in
the noonday sun. Late in the afternoon of the
sixth day, God looked down upon these inno
cent creatures and envisioned for them a better
way to get a head.
Not entirely sure, however, of how to best
wed man and his new-found ears, He abdicated
all responsibility (in familiar fashion), thus giv
ing Man a blank check to Put It Where You Want
It. Observe the prototypical Ear, template for
many oblivious generations.
Man was then in a quandry the number of
access points through which he had been at
tempting to come to grips with his inner self had
been increased by 40 per cent, confusing him
greatly. This dilemma caused our simple but
curious ancestors to experiment with the uses of
his newest orifices. He tried smelling with them,
tasting with them, even smoking with them. And
before he hit upon their proper usage he had
even attempted "Aural Sex." Regarding the

twisted course of earvents leading to the even
tual discovery of hearing, the Band plays Pretzel
Logic.
After this point in Man's cultural develope
ment, he began to realize the value of his ears;
soon his own were not enough and he began to
covet the ears of those around him. Vestiges of
this petty jealousy persist today, as was recently
shown by the cold-blooded theft of the Ear of J.
Paul Getty, Jr.
His robbers brutally removed it for simple
amusement; then, when the novelty wore off,
they took the Ear to the marketplace and traded
it for substantial monetary recompense. (Ears
must be valuable indeed.) Depicting this chilling
separation of man and Ear, the Band plays Cold
as Ice, as it portrays the fateful event, in allegori
cal fashion.
Not all is dark, however, in the history of our
friend the Ear. With it, our greatest thinkers have
become inspired to soar heavenward.-In the
sciences, literature, and the arts, this must be
the Age of Earlightenment! Van Gogh,, for in
stance, was very attached to his ear. (In fact, for
years he carried a spare.) To Van Gogh, the Ear
was a symbol of divine life, a belief which even
tually led him to cut it off, so as to give of himself
to his loved one. (She, in turn, gave him her
eye!) Both remained optimistic. The Band re
flects this optimism, playing Still the One.
Hoping that this brief outline causes you to be
kind to your Aurifices, the Band wishes you a
happy new Ear.

to the Band, Jett is an "able stick handler" and "their leading
masochist."
