# Strength up front
## Kieburtz anchors defense 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The Stanford defense turned its best effort of
the season last Saturday against the University of
Oregon Ducks. Instrumental in the long
awaited defensive success was three-year re
turning letterman Geoff Kieburtz, a starting de
fensive tackle for the Cardinals.
Football is not Kieburtz' only interest, how
ever. His major mechanical engineering
demands a great deal of attention.
"It is really demanding," Kieburtz said about
trying to play football and be a full-time student
at the same time. "But, I wouldn't be happy here
or anywhere else if I were just going to school
and not playing football."
Kieburtz has played organized football since
his firstyear of high school in Newjersey when a
friend of his convinced him to try out for the
team. He started out as a punter for his school,
but with his good size and strength, he was soon
moved to tackle where he has stayed.
In his freshman year at Stanford, he played on
goal-line and punt return defenses for the var
sity, while exploring the different engineering
programs available to him.
Mechanical choice
By his sophomore year, Kieburtz had decided
to major in mechanical engineering, but he still
believed that it would be possible to dedicate '
himself to both academics and serious athletics,
as well as enjoy himself a little while in college.
The 6-foot-4,238 senior returned to the Cards'
defense this season with a lot of experience and
enthusiasm. Although he set no specific goals
for his final season, Kieburtz has high standards
for himself in every game. Each game he plays,
he works on weaknesses discovered in previous
appearances.
"I want to play up to my ability, and I want the
team to play up to its ability," stated Kieburtz.
"I'd be lying if I said that the Rose Bowl isn't on
our minds, but we don't go around thinking

only that. Instead we concentrate on winning
each and every game . . . one at a time."
Kieburtz, who finished with 55 tackles last
season, has played a key role in helping the
Cardinals improve their defense each week.
And the "D" is needed, because as Kieburtz
said, "A great defense is important for becom
ing a solid team, but we're not going to beat the
great teams until we put it all together."
During the summer, Kieburtz helped put
something else together. He worked as an en
gineer for the Weyerhauser Corp. in Longview,
Wash.
Take a shot
As far as career plans after college go,
Kieburtz wouldn't mind getting a shot at the
pros. However, what offers he does receive will
have to compete with the many offers he ex
pects to receive in mechanical engineering.
Regardless of what comes his way, Kieburtz
said "my career, eventually, will be in the en
gineering field. It is not my ultimate goal to play
pro ball at all costs."
If a notion exists that college admissions of
fices drop their standards for the school to re
cruit a good football team, it certainly doesn't
apply at Stanford. According to Kieburtz, mem
bers of the football team represent a wide range
of majors from pre-meds to engineers.
If some of the players appear to be having a
tough time in classes, it is just that they are
representative of the whole school, according
to Kieburtz. "There is a certain percentage of
students at Stanford who are struggling through
classes the football team is just a cross
section of the entire student body," he said.
It appears Geoff Kieburtz has overcome any
problems that go with playing a varsity sport and
being a full-time student. Whether the numbers
are on his back or on his paper, Kieburtz is a
Stanford standout.

Take a shot
As far as career plans after college go,
Kieburtz wouldn't mind getting a shot at the
pros. However, what offers he does receive will
have to compete with the many offers he ex
pects to receive in mechanical engineering.
Regardless of what comes his way, Kieburtz
said "my career, eventually, will be in the en
gineering field. It is not my ultimate goal to play
pro ball at all costs."
If a notion exists that college admissions of
fices drop their standards for the school to re
cruit a good football team, it certainly doesn't
apply at Stanford. According to Kieburtz, mem
bers of the football team represent a wide range
of majors from pre-meds to engineers.
If some of the players appear to be having a
tough time in classes, it is just that they are
representative of the whole school, according
to Kieburtz. "There is a certain percentage of
students at Stanford who are struggling through
classes the football team is just a cross
section of the entire student body," he said.
It appears Geoff Kieburtz has overcome any
problems that go with playing a varsity sport and
being a full-time student. Whether the numbers
are on his back or on his paper, Kieburtz is a
Stanford standout.
The Stanford defense turned its best effort of
the season last Saturday against the University of
Oregon Ducks. Instrumental in the long
awaited defensive success was three-year re
turning letterman Geoff Kieburtz, a starting de
fensive tackle for the Cardinals.
Football is not Kieburtz' only interest, how
ever. His major mechanical engineering
demands a great deal of attention.
"It is really demanding," Kieburtz said about
trying to play football and be a full-time student
at the same time. "But, I wouldn't be happy here
or anywhere else if I were just going to school
and not playing football."
Kieburtz has played organized football since
his firstyear of high school in Newjersey when a
friend of his convinced him to try out for the
team. He started out as a punter for his school,
but with his good size and strength, he was soon
moved to tackle where he has stayed.
In his freshman year at Stanford, he played on
goal-line and punt return defenses for the var
sity, while exploring the different engineering
programs available to him.
Mechanical choice
By his sophomore year, Kieburtz had decided
to major in mechanical engineering, but he still
believed that it would be possible to dedicate '
himself to both academics and serious athletics,
as well as enjoy himself a little while in college.
The 6-foot-4,238 senior returned to the Cards'
defense this season with a lot of experience and
enthusiasm. Although he set no specific goals
for his final season, Kieburtz has high standards
for himself in every game. Each game he plays,
he works on weaknesses discovered in previous
appearances.
"I want to play up to my ability, and I want the
team to play up to its ability," stated Kieburtz.
"I'd be lying if I said that the Rose Bowl isn't on
our minds, but we don't go around thinking

only that. Instead we concentrate on winning
each and every game . . . one at a time."
Kieburtz, who finished with 55 tackles last
season, has played a key role in helping the
Cardinals improve their defense each week.
And the "D" is needed, because as Kieburtz
said, "A great defense is important for becom
ing a solid team, but we're not going to beat the
great teams until we put it all together."
During the summer, Kieburtz helped put
something else together. He worked as an en
gineer for the Weyerhauser Corp. in Longview,
Wash.
