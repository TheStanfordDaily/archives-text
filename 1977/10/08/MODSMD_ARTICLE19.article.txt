# Bears vs. Cougs
## Palouse contest pivotal 
### 
Are they for real? Today's
game between the undefeated
California Golden Bears and
the Washington State Cougars
in Pullman should provide
some answers to any questions
about the 14th-ranked Bears.
Cal has yet to meet a Pacific-8
foe, but has averaged 32.8
points in its four wins. The
Cougs, meanwhile, will be
playing their first home game
of the year after splitting four
games on the road, including a
41-7 loss to USC last week.
The Trojans' conference
mark of 2-0 will remain intact
today, but whether the top
ranked Trojans will continue
their 15-game winning streak
the longest in the nation
is debatable. Alabama will
the Coliseum, and the Crimson
Tide has beaten the Trojans
three times in the four-game
series.
The other conference team
taking on an op
ponent is Oregon State. Quar
terback Gifford Nielson and
the airborne Brigham Young
offense will be facing a Beaver
defense which has given up
over 25 points a game.
But the 1-3 Beavers (0-1 in
conference) have an offensive
weapon of their own. Setback
James Fields is third in the con
ference in rushing with 358
yards and a 6.5 yards per carry
average.
Down the road from Corval
lis, a battle to avoid the cellar
will be taking place between
Washington and Oregon. The
Ducks have been enduring a
frustrating 1-3 season under
new coach Rich Brooks, and
will try to even their confer
ence mark at 1-1 against the
Huskies.
The Huskies seem to have
the talent to beat a lot of teams,
but that potential has come
through only once this season
while in three other games the
Huskies have fumbled, stum
bled and bumbled their way to
defeat.
The last two defeats have
been in the last minute,
though, spoiling fine perfor
mances by quarterback War
ren Moon.
