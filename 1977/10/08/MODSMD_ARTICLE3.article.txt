# Stanford has an injured Guy
## Cardinals' mettle tested by Bruins 
### David Georgette 
Every football team faces a
few critical games each season,
and today's Pacific-8 streetfight
between Stanford and UCLA is
one of those games this season
for coach Bill Walsh's Cardi
nals.
"If we were to win," said
Walsh last week, "we could
expect positive results the rest
of the season."
Riding a three-game win
streak against less than out
standing competition, the

Cardinals' task against the 2-2
Bruins has been made more
difficult by the injury to quar
terback Guy Benjamin's left
knee. The Pacific-B's top pas
ser, Benjamin will miss a
chance to light up the
scoreboard as he did last sea
son in a 38-20 loss to the Bruins
in Los Angeles.
In that game, Benjamin put
the ball up 53 times, complet
ing 35 passes for 378 yards. But
four fourth-quarter tipped in
terceptions, two of which were

returned for touchdowns,
turned a 20-10 Stanford advan
tage into a3B-20 traumatic loss.
The Bruin defense had been
looking forward to going
against Heisman Trophy can
didate Benjamin in its confer
ence opener, but instead the
Westwood crew will see junior
redshirt Steve Dils, a 6-foot-2,
180 thrower from Vancouver,
Wash.
Up until Dils hit on all three
of his passes for4B yards on the
clinching touchdown drive

against Oregon last week, he
had attempted only one pass in
varsity competition. Lack of
experience on Dils' part, how
ever, will not drastically affect
the Stanford game plan, ac
cording to Walsh. Maybe the
Cards will be more cautious,
though.
"Anytime you have a substi
tute quarterback," said Walsh,
"you're going to be more care
ful about what you do. To beat

this club (UCLA), we're gonna
have to mix our game up. But
we're not going to be reck
less."
Don't tell Phil Francis that.
The junior fullback, who runs
with reckless abandon, will get
the starting call with halfback
Darrin Nelson, the confer
ence's leading receiver with 21
catches for 295 yards and the
fifth-leading rusher with a 5.8
