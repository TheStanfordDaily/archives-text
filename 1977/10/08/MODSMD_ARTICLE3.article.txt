# Stanford has an injured Guy
## Cardinals' mettle tested by Bruins 
### David Georgette 
Every football team faces a
few critical games each season,
and today's Pacific-8 streetfight
between Stanford and UCLA is
one of those games this season
for coach Bill Walsh's Cardi
nals.
"If we were to win," said
Walsh last week, "we could
expect positive results the rest
of the season."
Riding a three-game win
streak against less than out
standing competition, the

Cardinals' task against the 2-2
Bruins has been made more
difficult by the injury to quar
terback Guy Benjamin's left
knee. The Pacific-B's top pas
ser, Benjamin will miss a
chance to light up the
scoreboard as he did last sea
son in a 38-20 loss to the Bruins
in Los Angeles.
In that game, Benjamin put
the ball up 53 times, complet
ing 35 passes for 378 yards. But
four fourth-quarter tipped in
terceptions, two of which were

returned for touchdowns,
turned a 20-10 Stanford advan
tage into a3B-20 traumatic loss.
The Bruin defense had been
looking forward to going
against Heisman Trophy can
didate Benjamin in its confer
ence opener, but instead the
Westwood crew will see junior
redshirt Steve Dils, a 6-foot-2,
180 thrower from Vancouver,
Wash.
Up until Dils hit on all three
of his passes for4B yards on the
clinching touchdown drive

against Oregon last week, he
had attempted only one pass in
varsity competition. Lack of
experience on Dils' part, how
ever, will not drastically affect
the Stanford game plan, ac
cording to Walsh. Maybe the
Cards will be more cautious,
though.
"Anytime you have a substi
tute quarterback," said Walsh,
"you're going to be more care
ful about what you do. To beat

this club (UCLA), we're gonna
have to mix our game up. But
we're not going to be reck
less."
Don't tell Phil Francis that.
The junior fullback, who runs
with reckless abandon, will get
the starting call with halfback
Darrin Nelson, the confer
ence's leading receiver with 21
catches for 295 yards and the
fifth-leading rusher with a 5.8

yards per carry average. Francis
is returning to full strength
after tendinitis in the hip.
Stanford has not defeated
UCLA since 1971, the last time
Stanford went to the Rose
Bowl. So far this season,
though, Walsh has changed
the pattern of recent years
he came home with a win, en
tered conference play with a
plus record and opened the
Pac-8 season with a triumph.
For the Cards to break the
drought against UCLA, they'll
have to come up with a strong
defensive effort, especially
considering the difficulty Stan
ford has had in containing
good option-style offenses in
recent times.
The Bruins "have a great op
tion offense," said Walsh.
"They have a big offensive line
and very fast backs."
The fastest of the Bruin run
ners is probably halfback
James Owens, who finished
sixth in the high hurdles at the
Olympics. Owens is the
Bruins' top rusher with 346
yards and a 5.2 average. Last
week against lowa he broke
loose on a trap play for a 67-
yard touchdown run on his way
to a career-best 134-yard per
formance.

Second-year head coach
Terry Donahue had hoped to
team Owens in the backfield
with junior Theotis "Bigfoot"
Brown. But Brown's been out
since the Bruins' opener with a
dislocated elbow, and
Donahue has started three dif
ferent players at Brown's right
halfback position.
When the Bruins put the ball
up, it's quarterback sopho
more Rick Bashore who does
the throwing. Bashore has
connected on 57 per cent of his
passes, and has a 13.1 yard av
erage gain per completion.
Flanker Homer Butler is the top
Bruin receiver, averaging 23
yards per catch.
The statistics indicate then,
although the Bruins are eighth
in conference passing (only 68
passes attempted), when they
do pass, they can be effective.
"Their passing hasn't been
real consistent," said Walsh.
"They can beat you with it, but
they can get into trouble with
it."
The overall team speed of
the Bruin attack can mean con
stant headaches for defensive
coaches, because as Walsh
said, "one mistake can mean
seven points for them."

of his passes for4B yards on the
clinching touchdown drive

against Oregon last week, he
had attempted only one pass in
varsity competition. Lack of
experience on Dils' part, how
ever, will not drastically affect
the Stanford game plan, ac
cording to Walsh. Maybe the
Cards will be more cautious,
though.
"Anytime you have a substi
tute quarterback," said Walsh,
"you're going to be more care
ful about what you do. To beat

this club (UCLA), we're gonna
have to mix our game up. But
we're not going to be reck
less."
Don't tell Phil Francis that.

yards per carry average. Francis
is returning to full strength
after tendinitis in the hip.
Stanford has not defeated
UCLA since 1971, the last time
Stanford went to the Rose
Bowl. So far this season,
though, Walsh has changed
the pattern of recent years
he came home with a win, en
tered conference play with a
plus record and opened the
Pac-8 season with a triumph.
For the Cards to break the
drought against UCLA, they'll
have to come up with a strong
defensive effort, especially
considering the difficulty Stan
ford has had in containing
good option-style offenses in
recent times.
The Bruins "have a great op
tion offense," said Walsh.
"They have a big offensive line
and very fast backs."
The fastest of the Bruin run
ners is probably halfback
James Owens, who finished
sixth in the high hurdles at the
Olympics. Owens is the
Bruins' top rusher with 346
yards and a 5.2 average. Last
week against lowa he broke
loose on a trap play for a 67-
yard touchdown run on his way
to a career-best 134-yard per
formance.

Second-year head coach
Terry Donahue had hoped to
team Owens in the backfield
with junior Theotis "Bigfoot"
Brown. But Brown's been out
since the Bruins' opener with a
dislocated elbow, and
Donahue has started three dif
ferent players at Brown's right
halfback position.
When the Bruins put the ball
up, it's quarterback sopho
more Rick Bashore who does
the throwing. Bashore has
connected on 57 per cent of his
passes, and has a 13.1 yard av
erage gain per completion.
Flanker Homer Butler is the top
Bruin receiver, averaging 23
yards per catch.
The statistics indicate then,
although the Bruins are eighth
in conference passing (only 68
passes attempted), when they
do pass, they can be effective.
"Their passing hasn't been
real consistent," said Walsh.
"They can beat you with it, but
they can get into trouble with
it."
The overall team speed of
the Bruin attack can mean con
stant headaches for defensive
coaches, because as Walsh
said, "one mistake can mean
seven points for them."

Every football team faces a
few critical games each season,
and today's Pacific-8 streetfight
between Stanford and UCLA is
one of those games this season
for coach Bill Walsh's Cardi
nals.
"If we were to win," said
Walsh last week, "we could
expect positive results the rest
of the season."
Riding a three-game win
streak against less than out
standing competition, the

Cardinals' task against the 2-2
Bruins has been made more
difficult by the injury to quar
terback Guy Benjamin's left
knee. The Pacific-B's top pas
ser, Benjamin will miss a
chance to light up the
scoreboard as he did last sea
son in a 38-20 loss to the Bruins
in Los Angeles.
In that game, Benjamin put
the ball up 53 times, complet
ing 35 passes for 378 yards. But
four fourth-quarter tipped in
terceptions, two of which were

returned for touchdowns,
turned a 20-10 Stanford advan
tage into a3B-20 traumatic loss.
The Bruin defense had been
looking forward to going

didate Benjamin in its confer

Westwood crew will see junior
redshirt Steve Dils, a 6-foot-2,
180 thrower from Vancouver,

tered conference play with a
plus record and opened the
Pac-8 season with a triumph.
For the Cards to break the
drought against UCLA, they'll
have to come up with a strong
defensive effort, especially
considering the difficulty Stan
ford has had in containing
good option-style offenses in
recent times.
The Bruins "have a great op
tion offense," said Walsh.
"They have a big offensive line
and very fast backs."
The fastest of the Bruin run
ners is probably halfback
James Owens, who finished
sixth in the high hurdles at the
Olympics. Owens is the
Bruins' top rusher with 346
yards and a 5.2 average. Last
week against lowa he broke
loose on a trap play for a 67-
yard touchdown run on his way
to a career-best 134-yard per
formance.

Second-year head coach
Terry Donahue had hoped to
team Owens in the backfield
with junior Theotis "Bigfoot"
Brown. But Brown's been out
since the Bruins' opener with a
dislocated elbow, and
Donahue has started three dif
ferent players at Brown's right
halfback position.
When the Bruins put the ball
up, it's quarterback sopho
more Rick Bashore who does
the throwing. Bashore has
connected on 57 per cent of his
passes, and has a 13.1 yard av
erage gain per completion.
Flanker Homer Butler is the top
Bruin receiver, averaging 23
yards per catch.
The statistics indicate then,
although the Bruins are eighth
in conference passing (only 68
passes attempted), when they
do pass, they can be effective.
"Their passing hasn't been
real consistent," said Walsh.
"They can beat you with it, but
they can get into trouble with
it."
The overall team speed of
the Bruin attack can mean con
stant headaches for defensive
coaches, because as Walsh
said, "one mistake can mean
seven points for them."

Every football team faces a
few critical games each season,
and today's Pacific-8 streetfight
between Stanford and UCLA is
one of those games this season
for coach Bill Walsh's Cardi
nals.
"If we were to win," said
Walsh last week, "we could
expect positive results the rest
of the season."
Riding a three-game win
streak against less than out
standing competition, the

Cardinals' task against the 2-2
Bruins has been made more
difficult by the injury to quar
terback Guy Benjamin's left
knee. The Pacific-B's top pas
ser, Benjamin will miss a
chance to light up the
scoreboard as he did last sea
son in a 38-20 loss to the Bruins
in Los Angeles.
In that game, Benjamin put
the ball up 53 times, complet
ing 35 passes for 378 yards. But
four fourth-quarter tipped in
terceptions, two of which were

returned for touchdowns,
turned a 20-10 Stanford advan
tage into a3B-20 traumatic loss.
The Bruin defense had been
looking forward to going
against Heisman Trophy can
didate Benjamin in its confer
ence opener, but instead the
Westwood crew will see junior
redshirt Steve Dils, a 6-foot-2,
180 thrower from Vancouver,
Wash.
Up until Dils hit on all three
of his passes for4B yards on the
clinching touchdown drive

against Oregon last week, he
had attempted only one pass in
varsity competition. Lack of
experience on Dils' part, how
ever, will not drastically affect
the Stanford game plan, ac
cording to Walsh. Maybe the
Cards will be more cautious,
though.
"Anytime you have a substi
tute quarterback," said Walsh,
"you're going to be more care
ful about what you do. To beat

this club (UCLA), we're gonna
have to mix our game up. But
we're not going to be reck
less."
Don't tell Phil Francis that.
The junior fullback, who runs
with reckless abandon, will get
the starting call with halfback
Darrin Nelson, the confer
ence's leading receiver with 21
catches for 295 yards and the
fifth-leading rusher with a 5.8

Stanford has not defeated
UCLA since 1971, the last time
Stanford went to the Rose
Bowl. So far this season,
though, Walsh has changed
the pattern of recent years
he came home with a win, en
tered conference play with a

Pac-8 season with a triumph.
