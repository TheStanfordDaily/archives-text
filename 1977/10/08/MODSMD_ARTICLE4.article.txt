# Into the breach
## Dils gets his chance 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Steve Dils is a man who en
joys playing football — when he
gets the opportunity. Last
week against Oregon when an
injured Guy Benjamin limped
from the field, second-team
quarterback Dils finally got his
chance.
"Just playing that one quar
ter was so much fun I couldn't
believe it," said Dils. "Just like
what football used to be for
me." Before he came to col
lege.
Dils, a three-year, three
sport varsity letterman in foot
ball, basketball and baseball in
high school, wasn't used to sit
ting the bench until he came to
Stanford. But when you come
to a school that has a history of
excellent quarterbacks, you
learn to wait your turn.
Was he scared when he fi
nally got the opportunity to call
the first varsity series of his col
lege career?
"I wasn't nervous," said Dils
confidently. "I've had a lot of
time to think about things
like about four years."
Now Dils only has one week
to think about the first Stanford
game in which he'll start and it
happens to be a big one
against UCLA.
"If they were picking a game
to put me into, they could have
at least picked an easier one. I
guess I don't have much
choice."
Exciting debut
Dils performed excellently
last week against Oregon com
ing from obscurity "Four/
five days ago, no one knew
who the hell I was" to lead
Stanford to a touchdown on a
seventy-yard drive.
Jhe*nost profound aspect of
though, was the calm, control
led manner with which he pul
led it off. After spending four
years psyching up, it seems

one would exhibit a little trepi
dation, or at least be a little
neurotic. But Dils refused to
succumb to the trauma of sud
denly being removed from a
familiar environment the
bench.
On a field that should have
looked strange with thousands
of cheering, jostling fans sur
rounding it, the signalcaller
acted as if he'd been raised
with a football in his hands. Of

a key pass to Bill Kellar, Dils
remarked, "I knew it was third
and eight, but I didn't really
think about 'God, if I miss
this ' In football you don't
have time to get nervous and
I've never had any trouble with
that."
But has Dils had any trouble
coping with the school he
chose to accept? He's decisive
about his reasons for choosing

Stanford over the other
schools that desired his atten
dance and athletic ability.
Shucks easy way out
"In the first place, I wouldn't
have come here if I didn't have
a lot of confidence," said Dils,
"because there's a lot of places
I could have gone where I
would have played sooner and
things wouldn't have been so
tough for me academically.
"I wanted to play here."
But would he still have come
if he'd known how things
would eventually work out?
"Well, it's funny," said Dils.
"When I was being recruited,
Guy Benjamin was kind of an
afterthought." (After Cordova
and Waldvogel.) "I've doubted
sometimes whether I should
have come here or not, but it's
working out for the best. Plus,
there's a long background of
my family going to Stanford.
My grandmother always
wanted me to come here."
That same grandmother
"almost had a heart attack
when she saw me on ABC,"
said Dils. But the 6-foot-2 quar
terback enjoys the onslaught
of publicity.
"It's fun," he remarked. "I
mean, it's only going to last a
couple of weeks, then I can
have all the time I want to my

self. My name's in the paper
and it's blowing me away!"
Coaching circus
It seems as if the escapades
Stanford coach provided for
the fans the last three years in
the form of the great quarter
back controversy might have
blown Dils away a little, too.
But he refused to take sides.
His attitude toward Benjamin,
untarnished by being the low
man on a two-man totem pole,
is still filled with a friendly re
spect.
"He's a really good friend of
mine," assured Dils. "We
room together on the road any
time we have a game. He's a
super guy (no pun intended),
just a good person to be
around."
And like any friend would
be, Dils is sorry that Benjamin
is out, even for one game.
"It was really bad that he got
hurt, just because he's doing
such a good job. It means a lot
to Guy to play a whole season,
he really wanted to. It's nice for

me to get to play but it's a hard
way to have to step in."
One thing that might ease the
difficulty is the opportunity
Dils is finally going to get to
play with one of his best
friends wide receiver Bill
Kellar.
In describing he and Kellar's
first meeting, Dils said, "I
didn't really know him then but
we played once my senior year
in high school and his team
beat the crap out of mine."
Every summer Steve has dri
ven a short way across the
Washington-Oregon border to
get together with Bill and
throw.
joint decision
"We were recruited by al
most all the same schools and
we pretty much decided we
were going to go to the same
place to play. As it's worked
out, I haven't thrown to him as
much as I've wanted, but this
week I'll know exactly what
he's doing because we've
spent so much time together."

Dils doubted if that will affect
the number of passes Kellar re
ceives from him against UCLA,
though.
Dils has also spent enough
time around to have a keen in
sight into the aspects of an ex
cellent athlete.
"There are athletes like
James Lofton or Guy Benjamin
who are just unbelievably
talented," commented Dils.

"Like with Guy . . . I've never
seen anybody throw a football
as easily as he does. He throws
a lot of passes and I'll go, 'Jeez,
how the hell did he do that?' "
Dils has had four years of col
lecting splinters on the bench.
Why did he stick it out?
"Because I knew that even
tually I'd play. . . I've spent too
much time to just say'bag it!' "
Well, he's got his chance.

the form of the great quarter
back controversy might have
blown Dils away a little, too.
But he refused to take sides.
His attitude toward Benjamin,
untarnished by being the low
man on a two-man totem pole,
is still filled with a friendly re
spect.
"He's a really good friend of
mine," assured Dils. "We
room together on the road any
time we have a game. He's a
super guy (no pun intended),
just a good person to be
around."
And like any friend would
be, Dils is sorry that Benjamin
is out, even for one game.
"It was really bad that he got
hurt, just because he's doing
such a good job. It means a lot
to Guy to play a whole season,
he really wanted to. It's nice for

me to get to play but it's a hard
way to have to step in."
One thing that might ease the
difficulty is the opportunity
Dils is finally going to get to
play with one of his best
friends wide receiver Bill
Kellar.
In describing he and Kellar's
first meeting, Dils said, "I
didn't really know him then but
we played once my senior year
in high school and his team
beat the crap out of mine."
Every summer Steve has dri
ven a short way across the
Washington-Oregon border to
get together with Bill and
throw.
joint decision
"We were recruited by al
most all the same schools and
we pretty much decided we
were going to go to the same
place to play. As it's worked
out, I haven't thrown to him as
much as I've wanted, but this
week I'll know exactly what
he's doing because we've
spent so much time together."

Dils doubted if that will affect
the number of passes Kellar re
ceives from him against UCLA,
though.
Dils has also spent enough
time around to have a keen in
sight into the aspects of an ex
cellent athlete.
"There are athletes like
James Lofton or Guy Benjamin
who are just unbelievably
talented," commented Dils.

"Like with Guy . . . I've never
seen anybody throw a football
as easily as he does. He throws
a lot of passes and I'll go, 'Jeez,
how the hell did he do that?' "
Dils has had four years of col
lecting splinters on the bench.
Why did he stick it out?
"Because I knew that even
tually I'd play. . . I've spent too
much time to just say'bag it!' "
Well, he's got his chance.
Steve Dils is a man who en
joys playing football — when he
gets the opportunity. Last
week against Oregon when an
injured Guy Benjamin limped
from the field, second-team
quarterback Dils finally got his
chance.
"Just playing that one quar
ter was so much fun I couldn't
believe it," said Dils. "Just like
what football used to be for
me." Before he came to col
lege.
Dils, a three-year, three
sport varsity letterman in foot
ball, basketball and baseball in
high school, wasn't used to sit
ting the bench until he came to
Stanford. But when you come
to a school that has a history of
excellent quarterbacks, you
learn to wait your turn.
Was he scared when he fi
nally got the opportunity to call
the first varsity series of his col
lege career?
"I wasn't nervous," said Dils
confidently. "I've had a lot of
time to think about things
like about four years."
Now Dils only has one week
to think about the first Stanford
game in which he'll start and it
happens to be a big one
against UCLA.
"If they were picking a game
to put me into, they could have
at least picked an easier one. I
guess I don't have much
choice."
Exciting debut
Dils performed excellently
last week against Oregon com
ing from obscurity "Four/
five days ago, no one knew
who the hell I was" to lead
Stanford to a touchdown on a
seventy-yard drive.

though, was the calm, control
led manner with which he pul
led it off. After spending four
years psyching up, it seems

one would exhibit a little trepi

neurotic. But Dils refused to
succumb to the trauma of sud
denly being removed from a
familiar environment the
bench.
On a field that should have
looked strange with thousands
of cheering, jostling fans sur
rounding it, the signalcaller
acted as if he'd been raised

a key pass to Bill Kellar, Dils
remarked, "I knew it was third
and eight, but I didn't really
think about 'God, if I miss
this ' In football you don't
have time to get nervous and
I've never had any trouble with
that."
But has Dils had any trouble
coping with the school he
chose to accept? He's decisive
about his reasons for choosing

schools that desired his atten

"In the first place, I wouldn't
have come here if I didn't have
a lot of confidence," said Dils,
"because there's a lot of places
I could have gone where I
would have played sooner and
things wouldn't have been so
tough for me academically.
"I wanted to play here."
But would he still have come
if he'd known how things
would eventually work out?
"Well, it's funny," said Dils.
"When I was being recruited,
Guy Benjamin was kind of an
afterthought." (After Cordova
and Waldvogel.) "I've doubted
sometimes whether I should
have come here or not, but it's
working out for the best. Plus,
there's a long background of
my family going to Stanford.
My grandmother always
wanted me to come here."
That same grandmother
"almost had a heart attack
when she saw me on ABC,"
said Dils. But the 6-foot-2 quar
terback enjoys the onslaught
of publicity.
"It's fun," he remarked. "I
mean, it's only going to last a
couple of weeks, then I can
have all the time I want to my

self. My name's in the paper

Stanford over the other
schools that desired his atten
dance and athletic ability.
Shucks easy way out
"In the first place, I wouldn't
have come here if I didn't have
a lot of confidence," said Dils,
"because there's a lot of places
I could have gone where I
would have played sooner and
things wouldn't have been so
tough for me academically.
"I wanted to play here."
But would he still have come
if he'd known how things
would eventually work out?
"Well, it's funny," said Dils.
"When I was being recruited,
Guy Benjamin was kind of an
afterthought." (After Cordova
and Waldvogel.) "I've doubted
sometimes whether I should
have come here or not, but it's
working out for the best. Plus,
there's a long background of
my family going to Stanford.
My grandmother always
wanted me to come here."
That same grandmother
"almost had a heart attack
when she saw me on ABC,"
said Dils. But the 6-foot-2 quar
terback enjoys the onslaught
of publicity.
"It's fun," he remarked. "I
mean, it's only going to last a
couple of weeks, then I can
have all the time I want to my

self. My name's in the paper
and it's blowing me away!"
Coaching circus
It seems as if the escapades
Stanford coach provided for
the fans the last three years in
the form of the great quarter
back controversy might have
blown Dils away a little, too.
But he refused to take sides.
His attitude toward Benjamin,
untarnished by being the low
man on a two-man totem pole,
is still filled with a friendly re
spect.
"He's a really good friend of
mine," assured Dils. "We
room together on the road any
time we have a game. He's a
super guy (no pun intended),
just a good person to be
around."
And like any friend would
be, Dils is sorry that Benjamin
is out, even for one game.
"It was really bad that he got
hurt, just because he's doing
such a good job. It means a lot
to Guy to play a whole season,
he really wanted to. It's nice for

me to get to play but it's a hard
way to have to step in."
One thing that might ease the
difficulty is the opportunity
Dils is finally going to get to
play with one of his best
friends wide receiver Bill
Kellar.
In describing he and Kellar's
first meeting, Dils said, "I
didn't really know him then but
we played once my senior year
in high school and his team
beat the crap out of mine."
Every summer Steve has dri
ven a short way across the
Washington-Oregon border to
get together with Bill and

"We were recruited by al
most all the same schools and
we pretty much decided we
were going to go to the same
place to play. As it's worked
out, I haven't thrown to him as
much as I've wanted, but this
week I'll know exactly what
he's doing because we've
spent so much time together."

Dils doubted if that will affect
the number of passes Kellar re
ceives from him against UCLA,
though.
Dils has also spent enough
time around to have a keen in
sight into the aspects of an ex
cellent athlete.
"There are athletes like
James Lofton or Guy Benjamin
who are just unbelievably
talented," commented Dils.

"Like with Guy . . . I've never
seen anybody throw a football
as easily as he does. He throws
a lot of passes and I'll go, 'Jeez,
how the hell did he do that?' "
Dils has had four years of col
lecting splinters on the bench.
Why did he stick it out?
"Because I knew that even
tually I'd play. . . I've spent too
much time to just say'bag it!' "
Well, he's got his chance.
Steve Dils is a man who en
joys playing football — when he
gets the opportunity. Last
week against Oregon when an
injured Guy Benjamin limped
from the field, second-team
quarterback Dils finally got his
chance.
"Just playing that one quar
ter was so much fun I couldn't
believe it," said Dils. "Just like
what football used to be for
me." Before he came to col
lege.
Dils, a three-year, three
sport varsity letterman in foot
ball, basketball and baseball in
high school, wasn't used to sit
ting the bench until he came to
Stanford. But when you come
to a school that has a history of
excellent quarterbacks, you
learn to wait your turn.
Was he scared when he fi
nally got the opportunity to call
the first varsity series of his col
lege career?
"I wasn't nervous," said Dils
confidently. "I've had a lot of
time to think about things
like about four years."
Now Dils only has one week
to think about the first Stanford
game in which he'll start and it
happens to be a big one
against UCLA.
"If they were picking a game
to put me into, they could have
at least picked an easier one. I
guess I don't have much
choice."

Dils performed excellently
