## Dils gets his chance 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Steve Dils is a man who en
joys playing football â€” when he
gets the opportunity. Last
week against Oregon when an
injured Guy Benjamin limped
from the field, second-team
quarterback Dils finally got his
chance.
"Just playing that one quar
ter was so much fun I couldn't
believe it," said Dils. "Just like
what football used to be for
me." Before he came to col
lege.
Dils, a three-year, three
sport varsity letterman in foot
ball, basketball and baseball in
high school, wasn't used to sit
ting the bench until he came to
Stanford. But when you come
to a school that has a history of
excellent quarterbacks, you
learn to wait your turn.
Was he scared when he fi
nally got the opportunity to call
the first varsity series of his col
lege career?
"I wasn't nervous," said Dils
confidently. "I've had a lot of
time to think about things
like about four years."
Now Dils only has one week
to think about the first Stanford
game in which he'll start and it
happens to be a big one
against UCLA.
"If they were picking a game
to put me into, they could have
at least picked an easier one. I
guess I don't have much
choice."
Exciting debut
Dils performed excellently
last week against Oregon com
ing from obscurity "Four/
five days ago, no one knew
who the hell I was" to lead
Stanford to a touchdown on a
seventy-yard drive.
Jhe*nost profound aspect of
though, was the calm, control
led manner with which he pul
led it off. After spending four
years psyching up, it seems

one would exhibit a little trepi
dation, or at least be a little
neurotic. But Dils refused to
succumb to the trauma of sud
denly being removed from a
familiar environment the
bench.
On a field that should have
looked strange with thousands
of cheering, jostling fans sur
rounding it, the signalcaller
acted as if he'd been raised
with a football in his hands. Of

a key pass to Bill Kellar, Dils
remarked, "I knew it was third
and eight, but I didn't really
think about 'God, if I miss
this ' In football you don't
have time to get nervous and
I've never had any trouble with
that."
But has Dils had any trouble
coping with the school he
chose to accept? He's decisive
about his reasons for choosing
