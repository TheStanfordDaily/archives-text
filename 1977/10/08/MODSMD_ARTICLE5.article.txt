# UCLA linebacker instant success
## Robinson outweighed but not outplayed 
### Richard Keller 
At 6-foot-3, 208, you might
think Jerry Robinson would
make a good wide receiver.
Well, you're right.
Robinson, a junior at UCLA,
was adept enough to play on
the Bruin varsity as a freshman
receiver. Last year, following
his sophomore season, Robin
son was named All-American
and AII-Pacific-8 as a
linebacker. It was the first time
since 1969 that a sophomore
had received the national
honor.
In one summer, Robinson
was converted from just
another receiver into a premier
inside linebacker who piled up
more tackles than any of his
teammates in seven of 11
games. He finished out the
year with an amazing 159 tack
les.
To understand how Robin
son could make such a transi
tion so rapidly, you need only
take a quick glance at his athle
tic accomplishments.
At Cardinal Newman High in

Santa Rosa, he starred in foot
ball as a tight end, running
back, middle guard and
punter. In one game he rushed
for 350 yards and five
touchdowns. He received Ail-
American status. As a center on
the basketball team, he was
All-Northern California. For
the track squad, Robinson had
bests of 9.9 seconds in the 100,
21.3 in the 220, 23-2 in the long
jump and 6-5 in the high jump.
There wasn't a whole lot he
couldn't do.
Highly recruited
Due to his prodigious high
school career, Robinson was
hounded by scouts from nearly
every college fqotball team in
the country. Stanford was one
of the few that didn't express
any interest.
Robinson wasn't overlooked
in basketball, either. In addi
tion to the University of North
Carolina, all the northern Pac-8
schools wanted to put him in
their uniform.
Ironically, Robinson's dream
was to play basketball for the

Bruins. But as he admitted,
"UCLA didn't need any 6-3 cen
ters." Despite the change in
avocation, Robinson said he
had "always wanted to play for
UCLA."
After taking the hits as a wide
receiver for an entire season,
then-coach Dick Vermeil let
Robinson do the hitting. The
switch was made during Rose
Bowl practice. Robinson was
understandably "unsure."
"It did strike me as being
strange," commented the vet
eran linebacker. "It really did
surprise me. I guess it was be
cause coach Vermeil thought
I'd have a better chance and I'd
play much sooner. He had con
fidence in my ability to play in
the position."
Not many freshmen play in
the Rose Bowl, especially when
they've only had several weeks
of experience at their position.
Robinson was one of the lucky
few.
He called playing in the Rose
Bowl "the biggest thrill of my
life it was like heaven. I was

in another world. I couldn't
hear the crowd.
"I was only in for two plays,"
he continued, "but I was
ready. On my first play I was in
on the tackle. They had a
sweep. I was on the back side
and just ran it down. It felt
good\"
One year later, Robinson
was an All-American in that
position. It would seem that a
little sorcery occurred over the
summer. What exactly hap
pened in those three months?
"Really nothing," said
Robinson. "I just played bas
ketball, lifted weights and ran.
I guess I just had the ability."
During the 1976 campaign,
Robinson had 159 tackles, in

eluding 28 against Air Force.
Still, he didn't expect the All-
American rating.
"I had set my goals as All-
Pac-8," he succinctly
explained. "When I found out I
won those honors, I was al
most as excited as when I was
in the Rose Bowl.
"Maybe I'm not the best. But
I'd like to feel I'm up there near
the top. There's a lot of im
provement I have to do. That's
my philosophy improve
every game."
According to Robinson, he
needs to work on "taking on
blockers, pass drops, reading
the offense . . . the whole
game. If you don't improve and
