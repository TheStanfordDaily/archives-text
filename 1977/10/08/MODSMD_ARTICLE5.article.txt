# UCLA linebacker instant success
## Robinson outweighed but not outplayed 
### Richard Keller 
At 6-foot-3, 208, you might
think Jerry Robinson would
make a good wide receiver.
Well, you're right.
Robinson, a junior at UCLA,
was adept enough to play on
the Bruin varsity as a freshman
receiver. Last year, following
his sophomore season, Robin
son was named All-American
and AII-Pacific-8 as a
linebacker. It was the first time
since 1969 that a sophomore
had received the national
honor.
In one summer, Robinson
was converted from just
another receiver into a premier
inside linebacker who piled up
more tackles than any of his
teammates in seven of 11
games. He finished out the
year with an amazing 159 tack
les.
To understand how Robin
son could make such a transi
tion so rapidly, you need only
take a quick glance at his athle
tic accomplishments.
At Cardinal Newman High in

Santa Rosa, he starred in foot
ball as a tight end, running
back, middle guard and
punter. In one game he rushed
for 350 yards and five
touchdowns. He received Ail-
American status. As a center on
the basketball team, he was
All-Northern California. For
the track squad, Robinson had
bests of 9.9 seconds in the 100,
21.3 in the 220, 23-2 in the long
jump and 6-5 in the high jump.
There wasn't a whole lot he
couldn't do.
Highly recruited
Due to his prodigious high
school career, Robinson was
hounded by scouts from nearly
every college fqotball team in
the country. Stanford was one
of the few that didn't express
any interest.
Robinson wasn't overlooked
in basketball, either. In addi
tion to the University of North
Carolina, all the northern Pac-8
schools wanted to put him in
their uniform.
Ironically, Robinson's dream
was to play basketball for the

Bruins. But as he admitted,
"UCLA didn't need any 6-3 cen
ters." Despite the change in
avocation, Robinson said he
had "always wanted to play for
UCLA."
After taking the hits as a wide
receiver for an entire season,
then-coach Dick Vermeil let
Robinson do the hitting. The
switch was made during Rose
Bowl practice. Robinson was
understandably "unsure."
"It did strike me as being
strange," commented the vet
eran linebacker. "It really did
surprise me. I guess it was be
cause coach Vermeil thought
I'd have a better chance and I'd
play much sooner. He had con
fidence in my ability to play in
the position."
Not many freshmen play in
the Rose Bowl, especially when
they've only had several weeks
of experience at their position.
Robinson was one of the lucky
few.
He called playing in the Rose
Bowl "the biggest thrill of my
life it was like heaven. I was

in another world. I couldn't
hear the crowd.
"I was only in for two plays,"
he continued, "but I was
ready. On my first play I was in
on the tackle. They had a
sweep. I was on the back side
and just ran it down. It felt
good\"
One year later, Robinson
was an All-American in that
position. It would seem that a
little sorcery occurred over the
summer. What exactly hap
pened in those three months?
"Really nothing," said
Robinson. "I just played bas
ketball, lifted weights and ran.
I guess I just had the ability."
During the 1976 campaign,
Robinson had 159 tackles, in

eluding 28 against Air Force.
Still, he didn't expect the All-
American rating.
"I had set my goals as All-
Pac-8," he succinctly
explained. "When I found out I
won those honors, I was al
most as excited as when I was
in the Rose Bowl.
"Maybe I'm not the best. But
I'd like to feel I'm up there near
the top. There's a lot of im
provement I have to do. That's
my philosophy improve
every game."
According to Robinson, he
needs to work on "taking on
blockers, pass drops, reading
the offense . . . the whole
game. If you don't improve and

your opponent does, you'll get
behind. And I don't like being
behind."
Everyone but Robinson is
surprised by how successful he
has been, given his relatively
small size.
"I'm up to 211 now," he said.
"It's easier for me to lose
weight than to gain it. But I
held up last year and I can do it
again. Just look at Jack Lambert
(middle linebacker, Pittsburgh
Steelers). He's only 218, and
he's playing in the middle,
man."
In one-plus seasons as inside
linebacker, Robinson has pul
led down three interceptions.
That's nothing spectacular, but
returning all three for
touchdowns of 69, 72 and 95
yards is spectacular.
"I still have some of that
wide receiver instinct," he re
marked. "And once I catch the
ball, I don't want to be
touched."
Card cleanup
Stanford's coaching staff
wasn't around last year to wit

ness how Robinson stonewal
led the Cardinal offense. But
you can bet they're seeing
plenty of reruns in the film
room.
For his 21 tackles and his 69-
yard interception return for a
touchdown during the 1976
Stanford contest, Sports Illus
trated named Robinson as de
fensive player-of-the-week.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh is
hoping that performance isn't
repeated.
"He's just a very quick in
stinctive athlete," said Walsh.
"He has all those great tools of
a great linebacker. His best
single quality is his quickness,
though. We will make an effort
to work our formations so he
isn't at the critical point of the
attack."
Stanford's offensive line will
have the challenge of keeping
Robinson out of the way.
Tackle Gordy King analyzed his
adversary's qualities:
"He's not real big," said
King, "but he makes up for that
because he's fast and he's
quick. He has the speed of a

defensive end. And he's not
weak by any means. He stands
in there real well."
Stanford is concerned about
Robinson, but the feeling is
mutual.
"We haven't really seen a
passing attack yet," said
Robinson. "It'll be a tough test.
They (Stanford) have a ba
lanced attack. Last year they
threw a lot more. I just saw the
films and that (Darrin) Nelson
is quick! It gives them an
added dimension. You've got
to respect the fun."

the basketball team, he was
All-Northern California. For
the track squad, Robinson had
bests of 9.9 seconds in the 100,
21.3 in the 220, 23-2 in the long
jump and 6-5 in the high jump.
There wasn't a whole lot he
couldn't do.
Highly recruited
Due to his prodigious high
school career, Robinson was
hounded by scouts from nearly
every college fqotball team in
the country. Stanford was one
of the few that didn't express
any interest.
Robinson wasn't overlooked
in basketball, either. In addi
tion to the University of North
Carolina, all the northern Pac-8
schools wanted to put him in
their uniform.
Ironically, Robinson's dream
was to play basketball for the

Bruins. But as he admitted,
"UCLA didn't need any 6-3 cen
ters." Despite the change in
avocation, Robinson said he
had "always wanted to play for
UCLA."
After taking the hits as a wide
receiver for an entire season,
then-coach Dick Vermeil let
Robinson do the hitting. The
switch was made during Rose
Bowl practice. Robinson was
understandably "unsure."
"It did strike me as being
strange," commented the vet
eran linebacker. "It really did
surprise me. I guess it was be
cause coach Vermeil thought
I'd have a better chance and I'd
play much sooner. He had con
fidence in my ability to play in
the position."
Not many freshmen play in
the Rose Bowl, especially when
they've only had several weeks
of experience at their position.
Robinson was one of the lucky
few.
He called playing in the Rose
Bowl "the biggest thrill of my
life it was like heaven. I was

in another world. I couldn't
hear the crowd.
"I was only in for two plays,"
he continued, "but I was
ready. On my first play I was in
on the tackle. They had a
sweep. I was on the back side
and just ran it down. It felt
good\"
One year later, Robinson
was an All-American in that
position. It would seem that a
little sorcery occurred over the
summer. What exactly hap
pened in those three months?
"Really nothing," said
Robinson. "I just played bas
ketball, lifted weights and ran.
I guess I just had the ability."
During the 1976 campaign,
Robinson had 159 tackles, in

eluding 28 against Air Force.
Still, he didn't expect the All-
American rating.
"I had set my goals as All-
Pac-8," he succinctly
explained. "When I found out I
won those honors, I was al
most as excited as when I was
in the Rose Bowl.
"Maybe I'm not the best. But
I'd like to feel I'm up there near
the top. There's a lot of im
provement I have to do. That's
my philosophy improve
every game."
According to Robinson, he
needs to work on "taking on
blockers, pass drops, reading
the offense . . . the whole
game. If you don't improve and

your opponent does, you'll get
behind. And I don't like being
behind."
Everyone but Robinson is
surprised by how successful he
has been, given his relatively
small size.
"I'm up to 211 now," he said.
"It's easier for me to lose
weight than to gain it. But I
held up last year and I can do it
again. Just look at Jack Lambert
(middle linebacker, Pittsburgh
Steelers). He's only 218, and
he's playing in the middle,
man."
In one-plus seasons as inside
linebacker, Robinson has pul
led down three interceptions.
That's nothing spectacular, but
returning all three for
touchdowns of 69, 72 and 95
yards is spectacular.
"I still have some of that
wide receiver instinct," he re
marked. "And once I catch the
ball, I don't want to be
touched."
Card cleanup
Stanford's coaching staff
wasn't around last year to wit

ness how Robinson stonewal
led the Cardinal offense. But
you can bet they're seeing
plenty of reruns in the film
room.
For his 21 tackles and his 69-
yard interception return for a
touchdown during the 1976
Stanford contest, Sports Illus
trated named Robinson as de
fensive player-of-the-week.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh is
hoping that performance isn't
repeated.
"He's just a very quick in
stinctive athlete," said Walsh.
"He has all those great tools of
a great linebacker. His best
single quality is his quickness,
though. We will make an effort
to work our formations so he
isn't at the critical point of the
attack."
Stanford's offensive line will
have the challenge of keeping
Robinson out of the way.
Tackle Gordy King analyzed his
adversary's qualities:
"He's not real big," said
King, "but he makes up for that
because he's fast and he's
quick. He has the speed of a

defensive end. And he's not
weak by any means. He stands
in there real well."
Stanford is concerned about
Robinson, but the feeling is
mutual.
"We haven't really seen a
passing attack yet," said
Robinson. "It'll be a tough test.
They (Stanford) have a ba
lanced attack. Last year they
threw a lot more. I just saw the
films and that (Darrin) Nelson
is quick! It gives them an
added dimension. You've got
to respect the fun."

Bruin linebacker.jerry Robinson (84) is in the ideal hitting position as
he unloads a big pop against an Arizona Wildcat in a game from last
season. A former receiver, Robinson led the Bruins with 159 tackles as
a sophomore last year and was named a consensus All-American.
Robinson returned an intercepted pass 69 yards for a touchdown in last
year's game against Stanford.

At 6-foot-3, 208, you might
think Jerry Robinson would
make a good wide receiver.
Well, you're right.
Robinson, a junior at UCLA,
was adept enough to play on
the Bruin varsity as a freshman
receiver. Last year, following
his sophomore season, Robin
son was named All-American
and AII-Pacific-8 as a
linebacker. It was the first time
since 1969 that a sophomore
had received the national
honor.
In one summer, Robinson
was converted from just
another receiver into a premier
inside linebacker who piled up
more tackles than any of his
teammates in seven of 11
games. He finished out the
year with an amazing 159 tack
les.
To understand how Robin
son could make such a transi
tion so rapidly, you need only
take a quick glance at his athle
tic accomplishments.
At Cardinal Newman High in

Santa Rosa, he starred in foot
ball as a tight end, running
back, middle guard and
punter. In one game he rushed
for 350 yards and five
touchdowns. He received Ail-
American status. As a center on
the basketball team, he was
All-Northern California. For

Not many freshmen play in

Robinson was one of the lucky
few.
He called playing in the Rose
Bowl "the biggest thrill of my
life it was like heaven. I was

in another world. I couldn't
hear the crowd.
"I was only in for two plays,"
he continued, "but I was
ready. On my first play I was in
on the tackle. They had a
sweep. I was on the back side
and just ran it down. It felt

One year later, Robinson
was an All-American in that
position. It would seem that a
little sorcery occurred over the
summer. What exactly hap
pened in those three months?
"Really nothing," said
Robinson. "I just played bas
ketball, lifted weights and ran.
I guess I just had the ability."
During the 1976 campaign,
Robinson had 159 tackles, in

eluding 28 against Air Force.
Still, he didn't expect the All-
American rating.
"I had set my goals as All-
Pac-8," he succinctly
explained. "When I found out I
won those honors, I was al
most as excited as when I was

provement I have to do. That's
my philosophy improve

According to Robinson, he
needs to work on "taking on
blockers, pass drops, reading
the offense . . . the whole
game. If you don't improve and

your opponent does, you'll get
behind. And I don't like being
behind."
Everyone but Robinson is
surprised by how successful he
has been, given his relatively
small size.
"I'm up to 211 now," he said.
"It's easier for me to lose
weight than to gain it. But I
held up last year and I can do it
again. Just look at Jack Lambert
(middle linebacker, Pittsburgh
Steelers). He's only 218, and
he's playing in the middle,
man."
In one-plus seasons as inside
linebacker, Robinson has pul
led down three interceptions.
That's nothing spectacular, but
returning all three for
touchdowns of 69, 72 and 95
yards is spectacular.
"I still have some of that
wide receiver instinct," he re
marked. "And once I catch the
ball, I don't want to be
touched."
Card cleanup
Stanford's coaching staff
wasn't around last year to wit

ness how Robinson stonewal
led the Cardinal offense. But
you can bet they're seeing
plenty of reruns in the film
room.
For his 21 tackles and his 69-
yard interception return for a
touchdown during the 1976
Stanford contest, Sports Illus
trated named Robinson as de
fensive player-of-the-week.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh is
hoping that performance isn't
repeated.
"He's just a very quick in
stinctive athlete," said Walsh.
"He has all those great tools of
a great linebacker. His best
single quality is his quickness,
though. We will make an effort
to work our formations so he
isn't at the critical point of the
attack."
Stanford's offensive line will
have the challenge of keeping
Robinson out of the way.
Tackle Gordy King analyzed his
adversary's qualities:
"He's not real big," said
King, "but he makes up for that
because he's fast and he's
quick. He has the speed of a

defensive end. And he's not
weak by any means. He stands
in there real well."
Stanford is concerned about
Robinson, but the feeling is
mutual.
"We haven't really seen a
passing attack yet," said
Robinson. "It'll be a tough test.
They (Stanford) have a ba
lanced attack. Last year they
threw a lot more. I just saw the
films and that (Darrin) Nelson
is quick! It gives them an
added dimension. You've got

Bruin linebacker.jerry Robinson (84) is in the ideal hitting position as
he unloads a big pop against an Arizona Wildcat in a game from last
season. A former receiver, Robinson led the Bruins with 159 tackles as
a sophomore last year and was named a consensus All-American.
Robinson returned an intercepted pass 69 yards for a touchdown in last
year's game against Stanford.

At 6-foot-3, 208, you might
think Jerry Robinson would
make a good wide receiver.
Well, you're right.
Robinson, a junior at UCLA,
was adept enough to play on
the Bruin varsity as a freshman
receiver. Last year, following
his sophomore season, Robin
son was named All-American
and AII-Pacific-8 as a
linebacker. It was the first time
since 1969 that a sophomore
had received the national
honor.
In one summer, Robinson
was converted from just
another receiver into a premier
inside linebacker who piled up
more tackles than any of his
teammates in seven of 11
games. He finished out the
year with an amazing 159 tack
les.
To understand how Robin
son could make such a transi
tion so rapidly, you need only
take a quick glance at his athle
tic accomplishments.
At Cardinal Newman High in

Santa Rosa, he starred in foot
ball as a tight end, running
back, middle guard and
punter. In one game he rushed
for 350 yards and five
touchdowns. He received Ail-
American status. As a center on
the basketball team, he was
All-Northern California. For
the track squad, Robinson had
bests of 9.9 seconds in the 100,
21.3 in the 220, 23-2 in the long
jump and 6-5 in the high jump.
There wasn't a whole lot he
couldn't do.
Highly recruited
Due to his prodigious high
school career, Robinson was
hounded by scouts from nearly
every college fqotball team in
the country. Stanford was one
of the few that didn't express
any interest.
Robinson wasn't overlooked
in basketball, either. In addi
tion to the University of North
Carolina, all the northern Pac-8
schools wanted to put him in
their uniform.
Ironically, Robinson's dream
was to play basketball for the

Bruins. But as he admitted,
"UCLA didn't need any 6-3 cen
ters." Despite the change in
avocation, Robinson said he
had "always wanted to play for
UCLA."
After taking the hits as a wide
receiver for an entire season,
then-coach Dick Vermeil let
Robinson do the hitting. The
switch was made during Rose
Bowl practice. Robinson was
understandably "unsure."

During the 1976 campaign,
Robinson had 159 tackles, in

Still, he didn't expect the All-
American rating.
"I had set my goals as All-

your opponent does, you'll get

Everyone but Robinson is
surprised by how successful he
has been, given his relatively
small size.
"I'm up to 211 now," he said.
"It's easier for me to lose
weight than to gain it. But I
held up last year and I can do it
again. Just look at Jack Lambert

In one-plus seasons as inside
linebacker, Robinson has pul
led down three interceptions.
That's nothing spectacular, but
returning all three for
touchdowns of 69, 72 and 95
yards is spectacular.
"I still have some of that
wide receiver instinct," he re
marked. "And once I catch the
ball, I don't want to be
touched."
Card cleanup
Stanford's coaching staff
wasn't around last year to wit

ness how Robinson stonewal
led the Cardinal offense. But
you can bet they're seeing
plenty of reruns in the film
room.
For his 21 tackles and his 69-
yard interception return for a
touchdown during the 1976
Stanford contest, Sports Illus
trated named Robinson as de
fensive player-of-the-week.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh is
hoping that performance isn't
repeated.
"He's just a very quick in
stinctive athlete," said Walsh.
"He has all those great tools of
a great linebacker. His best
single quality is his quickness,
though. We will make an effort
to work our formations so he
isn't at the critical point of the
attack."
Stanford's offensive line will
have the challenge of keeping
Robinson out of the way.
Tackle Gordy King analyzed his
adversary's qualities:
"He's not real big," said
King, "but he makes up for that
because he's fast and he's
quick. He has the speed of a

defensive end. And he's not
weak by any means. He stands
in there real well."
Stanford is concerned about
Robinson, but the feeling is
mutual.
"We haven't really seen a
passing attack yet," said
Robinson. "It'll be a tough test.
They (Stanford) have a ba
lanced attack. Last year they
threw a lot more. I just saw the
films and that (Darrin) Nelson
is quick! It gives them an
added dimension. You've got
to respect the fun."

Bruin linebacker.jerry Robinson (84) is in the ideal hitting position as
he unloads a big pop against an Arizona Wildcat in a game from last
season. A former receiver, Robinson led the Bruins with 159 tackles as
a sophomore last year and was named a consensus All-American.
Robinson returned an intercepted pass 69 yards for a touchdown in last
year's game against Stanford.

At 6-foot-3, 208, you might
think Jerry Robinson would
make a good wide receiver.
Well, you're right.
Robinson, a junior at UCLA,
was adept enough to play on
the Bruin varsity as a freshman
receiver. Last year, following
his sophomore season, Robin
son was named All-American
and AII-Pacific-8 as a
linebacker. It was the first time
since 1969 that a sophomore
had received the national
honor.
In one summer, Robinson
was converted from just
another receiver into a premier
inside linebacker who piled up
more tackles than any of his
teammates in seven of 11
games. He finished out the
year with an amazing 159 tack
les.
To understand how Robin
son could make such a transi
tion so rapidly, you need only
take a quick glance at his athle
tic accomplishments.
At Cardinal Newman High in

Santa Rosa, he starred in foot
ball as a tight end, running
back, middle guard and
punter. In one game he rushed
for 350 yards and five
touchdowns. He received Ail-
American status. As a center on
the basketball team, he was
All-Northern California. For
the track squad, Robinson had
bests of 9.9 seconds in the 100,
21.3 in the 220, 23-2 in the long
jump and 6-5 in the high jump.
There wasn't a whole lot he
couldn't do.
Highly recruited
Due to his prodigious high
school career, Robinson was
hounded by scouts from nearly
every college fqotball team in
the country. Stanford was one
of the few that didn't express
any interest.
Robinson wasn't overlooked
in basketball, either. In addi
tion to the University of North
Carolina, all the northern Pac-8
schools wanted to put him in
their uniform.
Ironically, Robinson's dream
was to play basketball for the

Bruins. But as he admitted,
"UCLA didn't need any 6-3 cen
ters." Despite the change in
avocation, Robinson said he
had "always wanted to play for
UCLA."
After taking the hits as a wide
receiver for an entire season,
then-coach Dick Vermeil let
Robinson do the hitting. The
switch was made during Rose
Bowl practice. Robinson was
understandably "unsure."
"It did strike me as being
strange," commented the vet
eran linebacker. "It really did
surprise me. I guess it was be
cause coach Vermeil thought
I'd have a better chance and I'd
play much sooner. He had con
fidence in my ability to play in
the position."
Not many freshmen play in
the Rose Bowl, especially when
they've only had several weeks
of experience at their position.
Robinson was one of the lucky
few.
He called playing in the Rose
Bowl "the biggest thrill of my
life it was like heaven. I was

in another world. I couldn't
hear the crowd.
"I was only in for two plays,"
he continued, "but I was
ready. On my first play I was in
on the tackle. They had a
sweep. I was on the back side
and just ran it down. It felt
good\"
One year later, Robinson
was an All-American in that
position. It would seem that a
little sorcery occurred over the
summer. What exactly hap
pened in those three months?
"Really nothing," said
Robinson. "I just played bas
ketball, lifted weights and ran.
I guess I just had the ability."

Robinson had 159 tackles, in
