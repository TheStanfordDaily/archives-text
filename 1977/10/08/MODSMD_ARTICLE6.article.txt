# Versatile defensive back
## Pigott's quickness helps to avoid "burns" 
### Brad Brockbank 
Scene: It is Oct. 1, about
1:45 p.m. The Stanford football
stadium is filled with fans. The
Oregon football team has the
ball in its own territory and is
about to initiate its first offen
sive play.
The quarterback takes the
snap, turns and hands the ball
to the halfback who heads to
the right side of the field. A
sweep.
Suddenly a short, red
â€¢clothed figure with a large 24
printed on his shirt dashes ac
ross the line, flying headlong
into the halfback who falls to
the ground six yards behind
the line of scrimmage.
A slightly inebriated student
in the 12th row of the rooting
section yells out, "Who was
that masked man?"
A nearby friend, also feeling
the effects of liquid refresh
ment, answers, "Hi-yo John
Pigott."
The first one retorts, "Who
the hell is John Pigott?"
Who, indeed?
A quick glance at the roster
tells us that John Pigott is a
5-foot-11, 177 defensive back
from Portland, Oregon.
Thanks, roster.
"I say I'm 5-11, but I'm actu
ally 5-10," Pigott admitted re
cently.
"He's not a big man," coach
Bill Walsh concurred. "He has
to depend on quickness to get
things done. He's a very alert

player. He's decisive and he's
very tough."
Pigott, a senior who red
shirted as a sophomore and
has one more year of eligibility
after this season, said that
speed is his other main weak
ness besides size.
"I'm fairly quick," he
explained, "but if I get up
against a guy like (Cardinal
speedster) James Lofton, I've
really got to get on my horse."
Tendencies help
Pigott said that i n those situa
tions, pre-game scouting is
helpful. During the week be
fore each game, the defense
watches films of their oppo
nent's offense.
"If you know what kind of
pattern they're going to run in
a certain situation, or if you can
narrow it down to two or three
patterns that they'll run from a
certain formation, that helps a
lot," Pigott said.
"If I know a guy's just a
speed burner," he continued,
"I'm just turning my hips quick
and ready to go. If he breaks
his pattern and runs a curl or an
out, then I just plant and drive
on him as hard as I can."
By doing this, and "fighting
like a little (expletive deleted)"
if a pass does come his way,
Pigott compensates for his lack
of size and speed.
Pigott's size does have one
advantage, however.
"When I'm coming up on a
sweep or an option," he said,
"and some big lineman or tight
end is trying to block me, I feel
like I do a pretty good job of
getting my shoulders under
neath his and if I do that, I'm in
a pretty good position to get
around him. That technique

has helped me a lot."
Pigott, who is majoring in in
dustrial engineering, played
on the junior varsity as a
freshman. In his junioryear, he
made the varsity squad.
"I think I played about 40
minutes last year," he said. "I
equalled that in just my first
game this year."
Safety switch
Recruited as a cornerback,
Pigott made the switch to
safety after a successful spring
this year. However, when Larry
Reynolds was injured before
the Colorado game, Pigott
started his first game back at
the corner spot. During the
Oregon game, he spent time at
both corners and strong safety
as well.
"He's probably the steadiest
player we've got," Walsh
commented, "and the most
flexible. He can play all four
positions in the backfield and
play them well. His flexibility
has allowed us to insert
Reynolds back into the lineup.
If a corner falters at all, then he
can go back to corner and play
it well. He's a real fine, all
around football player."
With most of the publicity
being directed toward Stan
ford's powerful offense, the
defense has been put under a
lot of pressure to hold its own.
"The defense, as a whole,
doesn't see it as a big pressure
thing that's making us really
tense," Pigott explained. "We
do realize that we have a job to
do and we're trying to add our
half of the effort to the game.
"In the first three games, we
improved little by little but we
really had a long way to go.
