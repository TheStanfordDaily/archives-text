# Last-minute touchdown pass topples UCLA
## Dils, Nelson spark Cards to 32-28 win 
### Bruce Anderson 
When the UCLA Bruins got
word last week that they we
ren't going to face Cuy Benja
min in last Saturday's game,
they took the news almost as
hard as Stanford fans did.
The Los Angeles Times head
lined a story "UCLA Defense
Disappointed — Benjamin Is
Out," and UCLA All-America
linebacker Jerry Robinson said,
"You only live life once, so why
not go against the best
whenever you can?"
"Our secondary really hasn't
been tested," Bruin corner
back Levi Armstrong said. "We
don't know how good we are."
But if the Bruin defense was
truly disappointed that Benja
min was sidelined during
Saturday's contest with a knee
injury it was not because their
defense would go untested.
It was because that meant
the Bruins would have to face
Benjamin's talented under
study, 6-foot-2 180-pound
senior Steve Dils.
Dils riddled the Bruin sec
ondary all afternoon before

64,500 fans at Stanford Stadium
and gave Armstrong and com
pany an idea how good they
are —and they didn't likewhat
they found out.
Dils picked the vaunted
UCLA defense apart, complet
ing 24 of 37 throws for 287 yards
and one touchdown, a 27-yard
strike to James Lofton that the
senior wide receiver carried
into the end zone with only 37
seconds remaining to give
Stanford a 32-28 victory over
the Bruins.
"We had a super week of
practice — best we've ever
had," Dils said. "We deserved
to win this game."
Rose Bowl foreshadowing?
"I wanted to beat them to
start our freshmen off right,"
said Lofton. For Stanford vete
rans, as well as Card freshmen,
Saturday's victory was their
first over UCLA. The Cardinals
have beaten the Bruins only
twice in the previous 14 years,
and both of those victorious
Stanford teams ended up in the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford has now won four

straight this season and is 2-0 in
Pac-8 play and 4-1 overall.
UCLA is 2-3 for the season and
0-1 in the conference.
Stanford began the game
playing as if the opposition
were Palo Alto High School,
not UCLA. Stanford put 16
points on the board before the
Bruins had even gained a first
down.
"The defense swelled up this
game," defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said. "I think UCLA
was testing for our weaknesses
in the first quarter and that's
why they were a little slow get
ting started."
UCLA capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble and two long
touchdown runs — 75 and 78
yards — to grab a 21-19 lead in
the third quarter.
Dils sharp
On the ensuing drive, Dils
completed four straight passes
to move Stanford to the UCLA
24-yard line.
"Steve Dils did a tremend
ous job," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said after the game. "He

led the team and at times car
ried the team with his great
poise. He executed beauti
fully."
With third-and-three from
the Bruin 23 Dils pitched to
halfback Darrin Nelson who
went around left end for 13
yards. One play later Nelson
sprinted around right end be
hind a block by fullback Phil
Francis to score untouched
from four years out and recap
ture the lead for the Cards.
Nelson, who had scored ear
lier on a 31-yard run, amassed
189 yards on 23 carries. The
heralded Stanford scatback
became the first Card
freshman to ever run for 100
yards in a single game. His 189
yards were the third most ever
totalled by a Stanford back in
one game.
"This guy (Nelson) makes my
job a heck of a lot easier," said
Dils.
Resilient Bruins
UCLA didn't lie dormant and
let Stanford breeze through
the fourth quarter.
Bruin quarterback Rick
Bashore, finding the running
game unsuccessful against the
fired-up Stanford defense,
went to the air.
A 31-yard pass to tight end
Don Pederson and a 27-yard
aerial to flanker Homer Butler
set up a 21-yard scoring toss to
Theotis Brown.
Brown, UCLA's No. 1 rusher
last year, missed three games
after injuring his elbow in the
season opener. He returned to
the lineup in the second quar

ter and scored on a 75-yard
dash which came on his third
carry.
This time, Bashore found
him free on the right sideline,
threw a strike to Brown who
rambled in with the gp-ahead
touchdown from five years out
with 2:20 remaining.
Cards we! 1 Irilled
"We workec: n the two
minute drill all week," said of
fensive tackle Gordon King.
"We knew we plenty of
time."
"I had been talking to the
team all game about keeping
our poise, but then in the final
minutes there just wasn't time
to worry about pressure," Dils
said.
Starting on his 20-yard line,
Dils opened the final series by
running up the middle for
seven yards. On the next play
he found tight end Mitch Pleis
open for four yards and the
first down." "
One play later, Dils fired a
40-yard bomb to Lofton who
was streaking down the right
sideline.
S # *wford 'jumps' to vvin
Lofton, cornerback Arm
strong and safety Kenny
Easlev all rose together for the
Dils aerial. But the 6-foot-3 Lof
ton, a world-class long jumper,
got to the ball first and held on
to the ball on the way to the
ground.
"I didn't throw a very good
pass;" Dils said, "I was a little
tired after running the draw.
He made a great catch."
But with the tight double
coverage Lofton received, the

pass was probably thrown the
only way that it could have
been to be completed.
"It was perfectly thrown,"
Lofton said.
"I talked to him (Dils) the day
before the game about putting
the ball up there."
After an incomplete pass to
Francis, Dils found Lofton bet
ween Easley and Armstrong
again, pinpointing the senior
flanker at the 5-yard line. Lof
ton spun as he caught the ball
and broke free of the two de
fenders. He lifted the ball over
his head and pranced into the
end zone from the four with
just 37 seconds remaining.
UCLA took Ken Naber's kic
koff and moved the ball to the
Stanford 24, before time ran
out on the Bruins.
Strong character
"It was a team effort — a
team that's not giving up,"
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino said. "It's a personal
ity found in most champion
ship teams."
"I suppose the difference in
this Stanford team and the
ones I dealt with in the mid-60s
is that this team has tremend
ous character," Walsh said.
"We beat a very good UCLA
team and came from behind
twice. We've been behind in
every game this year.
"I'm really happy about the
way we moved the ball. That
was our best offensive effort
against the best defense we've
played.
Stanford had its largest of
fensive output of the year with
Dils at the helm of the attack.

The Cards rolled to 265 yards
on the ground and gained 287
yards in the air for a total of 552
yards.
Coach impressed
"I was impressed with Stan
ford's offense and defense,
especially in the first half," said
UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
Stanford gained 18 first
downs to UCLA's four in the
first half.
"The defense played darned
good," Stanford's freshman
linebacker Tom Hall said. "All
week we knew we were playing
UCLA and today we just had it
all together."
"We knew we had to cut off
their outside offense," said
safety Ralph Phillips. "In my
last game against UCLA they
scored on their first series. This
time we shut them off. Three
big plays gave them 21 points."
Stanford has thrown itself
into the middle of the Race for
the Roses with its triumph over
UCLA.
"Come Monday we'll be
thinking about Washington,"
Kieburtz said. "This one is for
nothing if we don't win next
week."

Oarrin Nelson speeds to the open field in Stanford's 32-28 defeat of UCLA Saturday. The fleet freshman
picked up 189 yards in 23 carries and scored two touchdowns, one from 31 yards and the other from four
yards.
When the UCLA Bruins got
word last week that they we
ren't going to face Cuy Benja
min in last Saturday's game,
they took the news almost as
hard as Stanford fans did.
The Los Angeles Times head
lined a story "UCLA Defense
Disappointed — Benjamin Is
Out," and UCLA All-America
linebacker Jerry Robinson said,
"You only live life once, so why
not go against the best
whenever you can?"
"Our secondary really hasn't
been tested," Bruin corner
back Levi Armstrong said. "We
don't know how good we are."
But if the Bruin defense was
truly disappointed that Benja
min was sidelined during
Saturday's contest with a knee
injury it was not because their
defense would go untested.
It was because that meant
the Bruins would have to face
Benjamin's talented under
study, 6-foot-2 180-pound
senior Steve Dils.
Dils riddled the Bruin sec
ondary all afternoon before

64,500 fans at Stanford Stadium
and gave Armstrong and com
pany an idea how good they
are —and they didn't likewhat
they found out.
Dils picked the vaunted
UCLA defense apart, complet
ing 24 of 37 throws for 287 yards
and one touchdown, a 27-yard
strike to James Lofton that the
senior wide receiver carried
into the end zone with only 37
seconds remaining to give
Stanford a 32-28 victory over
the Bruins.
"We had a super week of
practice — best we've ever
had," Dils said. "We deserved
to win this game."
Rose Bowl foreshadowing?
"I wanted to beat them to
start our freshmen off right,"
said Lofton. For Stanford vete
rans, as well as Card freshmen,
Saturday's victory was their
first over UCLA. The Cardinals
have beaten the Bruins only
twice in the previous 14 years,
and both of those victorious
Stanford teams ended up in the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford has now won four

straight this season and is 2-0 in
Pac-8 play and 4-1 overall.
UCLA is 2-3 for the season and
0-1 in the conference.
Stanford began the game
playing as if the opposition
were Palo Alto High School,
not UCLA. Stanford put 16
points on the board before the
Bruins had even gained a first
down.
"The defense swelled up this
game," defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said. "I think UCLA
was testing for our weaknesses
in the first quarter and that's
why they were a little slow get
ting started."
UCLA capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble and two long
touchdown runs — 75 and 78
yards — to grab a 21-19 lead in
the third quarter.
Dils sharp
On the ensuing drive, Dils
completed four straight passes
to move Stanford to the UCLA
24-yard line.

Walsh said after the game. "He

With third-and-three from

sprinted around right end be
hind a block by fullback Phil
Francis to score untouched
from four years out and recap
ture the lead for the Cards.
Nelson, who had scored ear
lier on a 31-yard run, amassed
189 yards on 23 carries. The
heralded Stanford scatback
became the first Card
freshman to ever run for 100
yards in a single game. His 189
yards were the third most ever
totalled by a Stanford back in
one game.
"This guy (Nelson) makes my
job a heck of a lot easier," said
Dils.
Resilient Bruins
UCLA didn't lie dormant and
let Stanford breeze through
the fourth quarter.
Bruin quarterback Rick
Bashore, finding the running
game unsuccessful against the
fired-up Stanford defense,
went to the air.
A 31-yard pass to tight end
Don Pederson and a 27-yard
aerial to flanker Homer Butler
set up a 21-yard scoring toss to
Theotis Brown.
Brown, UCLA's No. 1 rusher
last year, missed three games
after injuring his elbow in the
season opener. He returned to
the lineup in the second quar

ter and scored on a 75-yard
dash which came on his third
carry.
This time, Bashore found
him free on the right sideline,
threw a strike to Brown who
rambled in with the gp-ahead
touchdown from five years out
with 2:20 remaining.

"We workec: n the two

fensive tackle Gordon King.
"We knew we plenty of
time."
"I had been talking to the
team all game about keeping
our poise, but then in the final
minutes there just wasn't time
to worry about pressure," Dils
said.
Starting on his 20-yard line,
Dils opened the final series by
running up the middle for
seven yards. On the next play
he found tight end Mitch Pleis
open for four yards and the
first down." "
One play later, Dils fired a
40-yard bomb to Lofton who
was streaking down the right
sideline.

Lofton, cornerback Arm
strong and safety Kenny
Easlev all rose together for the
Dils aerial. But the 6-foot-3 Lof
ton, a world-class long jumper,
got to the ball first and held on
to the ball on the way to the
ground.
"I didn't throw a very good
pass;" Dils said, "I was a little
tired after running the draw.
He made a great catch."
But with the tight double
coverage Lofton received, the

pass was probably thrown the
only way that it could have
been to be completed.
"It was perfectly thrown,"
Lofton said.
"I talked to him (Dils) the day
before the game about putting
the ball up there."
After an incomplete pass to
Francis, Dils found Lofton bet
ween Easley and Armstrong
again, pinpointing the senior
flanker at the 5-yard line. Lof
ton spun as he caught the ball
and broke free of the two de
fenders. He lifted the ball over
his head and pranced into the
end zone from the four with
just 37 seconds remaining.
UCLA took Ken Naber's kic
koff and moved the ball to the
Stanford 24, before time ran
out on the Bruins.
Strong character
"It was a team effort — a
team that's not giving up,"
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino said. "It's a personal
ity found in most champion
ship teams."
"I suppose the difference in
this Stanford team and the
ones I dealt with in the mid-60s
is that this team has tremend
ous character," Walsh said.
"We beat a very good UCLA
team and came from behind
twice. We've been behind in
every game this year.
"I'm really happy about the
way we moved the ball. That
was our best offensive effort
against the best defense we've
played.
Stanford had its largest of
fensive output of the year with
Dils at the helm of the attack.

The Cards rolled to 265 yards
on the ground and gained 287
yards in the air for a total of 552
yards.
Coach impressed
"I was impressed with Stan
ford's offense and defense,
especially in the first half," said
UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
Stanford gained 18 first
downs to UCLA's four in the
first half.
"The defense played darned
good," Stanford's freshman
linebacker Tom Hall said. "All
week we knew we were playing
UCLA and today we just had it
all together."
"We knew we had to cut off
their outside offense," said
safety Ralph Phillips. "In my
last game against UCLA they
scored on their first series. This
time we shut them off. Three
big plays gave them 21 points."
Stanford has thrown itself
into the middle of the Race for
the Roses with its triumph over
UCLA.
"Come Monday we'll be
thinking about Washington,"
Kieburtz said. "This one is for
nothing if we don't win next
week."

Oarrin Nelson speeds to the open field in Stanford's 32-28 defeat of UCLA Saturday. The fleet freshman
picked up 189 yards in 23 carries and scored two touchdowns, one from 31 yards and the other from four
yards.
When the UCLA Bruins got
word last week that they we
ren't going to face Cuy Benja
min in last Saturday's game,
they took the news almost as
hard as Stanford fans did.
The Los Angeles Times head
lined a story "UCLA Defense
Disappointed — Benjamin Is
Out," and UCLA All-America
linebacker Jerry Robinson said,
"You only live life once, so why
not go against the best
whenever you can?"
"Our secondary really hasn't
been tested," Bruin corner
back Levi Armstrong said. "We
don't know how good we are."
But if the Bruin defense was
truly disappointed that Benja
min was sidelined during
Saturday's contest with a knee
injury it was not because their
defense would go untested.
It was because that meant
the Bruins would have to face
Benjamin's talented under
study, 6-foot-2 180-pound
senior Steve Dils.
Dils riddled the Bruin sec
ondary all afternoon before

64,500 fans at Stanford Stadium
and gave Armstrong and com
pany an idea how good they
are —and they didn't likewhat
they found out.
Dils picked the vaunted
UCLA defense apart, complet
ing 24 of 37 throws for 287 yards
and one touchdown, a 27-yard
strike to James Lofton that the
senior wide receiver carried
into the end zone with only 37
seconds remaining to give
Stanford a 32-28 victory over
the Bruins.
"We had a super week of
practice — best we've ever
had," Dils said. "We deserved
to win this game."
Rose Bowl foreshadowing?
"I wanted to beat them to
start our freshmen off right,"
said Lofton. For Stanford vete
rans, as well as Card freshmen,
Saturday's victory was their
first over UCLA. The Cardinals
have beaten the Bruins only
twice in the previous 14 years,
and both of those victorious
Stanford teams ended up in the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford has now won four

straight this season and is 2-0 in
Pac-8 play and 4-1 overall.
UCLA is 2-3 for the season and
0-1 in the conference.
Stanford began the game
playing as if the opposition
were Palo Alto High School,
not UCLA. Stanford put 16
points on the board before the
Bruins had even gained a first
down.
"The defense swelled up this
game," defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said. "I think UCLA
was testing for our weaknesses
in the first quarter and that's
why they were a little slow get
ting started."
UCLA capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble and two long
touchdown runs — 75 and 78
yards — to grab a 21-19 lead in
the third quarter.
Dils sharp
On the ensuing drive, Dils
completed four straight passes
to move Stanford to the UCLA
24-yard line.
"Steve Dils did a tremend

Walsh said after the game. "He

pass was probably thrown the
only way that it could have
been to be completed.
"It was perfectly thrown,"
Lofton said.
"I talked to him (Dils) the day
before the game about putting
the ball up there."
After an incomplete pass to
Francis, Dils found Lofton bet
ween Easley and Armstrong
again, pinpointing the senior
flanker at the 5-yard line. Lof
ton spun as he caught the ball
and broke free of the two de
fenders. He lifted the ball over
his head and pranced into the
end zone from the four with
just 37 seconds remaining.
UCLA took Ken Naber's kic
koff and moved the ball to the
Stanford 24, before time ran
out on the Bruins.
Strong character
"It was a team effort — a
team that's not giving up,"
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino said. "It's a personal
ity found in most champion
ship teams."
"I suppose the difference in
this Stanford team and the
ones I dealt with in the mid-60s
is that this team has tremend
ous character," Walsh said.
"We beat a very good UCLA
team and came from behind
twice. We've been behind in
every game this year.
"I'm really happy about the
way we moved the ball. That
was our best offensive effort
against the best defense we've
played.
Stanford had its largest of
fensive output of the year with
Dils at the helm of the attack.

The Cards rolled to 265 yards
on the ground and gained 287
yards in the air for a total of 552
yards.
Coach impressed
"I was impressed with Stan
ford's offense and defense,
especially in the first half," said
UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
Stanford gained 18 first
downs to UCLA's four in the
first half.
"The defense played darned
good," Stanford's freshman
linebacker Tom Hall said. "All
week we knew we were playing
UCLA and today we just had it
all together."
"We knew we had to cut off
their outside offense," said
safety Ralph Phillips. "In my
last game against UCLA they
scored on their first series. This
time we shut them off. Three
big plays gave them 21 points."
Stanford has thrown itself
into the middle of the Race for
the Roses with its triumph over
UCLA.
"Come Monday we'll be
thinking about Washington,"
Kieburtz said. "This one is for
nothing if we don't win next
week."

Oarrin Nelson speeds to the open field in Stanford's 32-28 defeat of UCLA Saturday. The fleet freshman
picked up 189 yards in 23 carries and scored two touchdowns, one from 31 yards and the other from four
yards.
When the UCLA Bruins got
word last week that they we
ren't going to face Cuy Benja
min in last Saturday's game,
they took the news almost as
hard as Stanford fans did.
The Los Angeles Times head
lined a story "UCLA Defense
Disappointed — Benjamin Is
Out," and UCLA All-America
linebacker Jerry Robinson said,
"You only live life once, so why
not go against the best
whenever you can?"
"Our secondary really hasn't
been tested," Bruin corner
back Levi Armstrong said. "We
don't know how good we are."
But if the Bruin defense was
truly disappointed that Benja
min was sidelined during
Saturday's contest with a knee
injury it was not because their
defense would go untested.
It was because that meant
the Bruins would have to face
Benjamin's talented under
study, 6-foot-2 180-pound
senior Steve Dils.
Dils riddled the Bruin sec
ondary all afternoon before

64,500 fans at Stanford Stadium
and gave Armstrong and com
pany an idea how good they
are —and they didn't likewhat
they found out.
Dils picked the vaunted
UCLA defense apart, complet
ing 24 of 37 throws for 287 yards
and one touchdown, a 27-yard
strike to James Lofton that the
senior wide receiver carried
into the end zone with only 37
seconds remaining to give
Stanford a 32-28 victory over
the Bruins.
"We had a super week of
practice — best we've ever
had," Dils said. "We deserved
to win this game."
Rose Bowl foreshadowing?
"I wanted to beat them to
start our freshmen off right,"
said Lofton. For Stanford vete
rans, as well as Card freshmen,
Saturday's victory was their
first over UCLA. The Cardinals
have beaten the Bruins only
twice in the previous 14 years,
and both of those victorious
Stanford teams ended up in the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford has now won four

straight this season and is 2-0 in
Pac-8 play and 4-1 overall.
UCLA is 2-3 for the season and
0-1 in the conference.
Stanford began the game
playing as if the opposition
were Palo Alto High School,
not UCLA. Stanford put 16
points on the board before the
Bruins had even gained a first
down.
"The defense swelled up this
game," defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said. "I think UCLA
was testing for our weaknesses
in the first quarter and that's
why they were a little slow get
ting started."
UCLA capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble and two long
touchdown runs — 75 and 78
yards — to grab a 21-19 lead in
the third quarter.
Dils sharp
On the ensuing drive, Dils
completed four straight passes
to move Stanford to the UCLA
24-yard line.
"Steve Dils did a tremend
ous job," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said after the game. "He

With third-and-three from
the Bruin 23 Dils pitched to
halfback Darrin Nelson who
went around left end for 13
yards. One play later Nelson
sprinted around right end be
hind a block by fullback Phil
Francis to score untouched
from four years out and recap
ture the lead for the Cards.
Nelson, who had scored ear
lier on a 31-yard run, amassed
189 yards on 23 carries. The
heralded Stanford scatback
became the first Card
freshman to ever run for 100
yards in a single game. His 189
yards were the third most ever
totalled by a Stanford back in
one game.
"This guy (Nelson) makes my
job a heck of a lot easier," said
Dils.
Resilient Bruins
UCLA didn't lie dormant and
let Stanford breeze through
the fourth quarter.
Bruin quarterback Rick
Bashore, finding the running
game unsuccessful against the
fired-up Stanford defense,
went to the air.
A 31-yard pass to tight end
Don Pederson and a 27-yard
aerial to flanker Homer Butler
set up a 21-yard scoring toss to
Theotis Brown.
Brown, UCLA's No. 1 rusher
last year, missed three games
after injuring his elbow in the
season opener. He returned to
the lineup in the second quar

ter and scored on a 75-yard
dash which came on his third
carry.
This time, Bashore found
him free on the right sideline,
threw a strike to Brown who
rambled in with the gp-ahead
touchdown from five years out
with 2:20 remaining.
Cards we! 1 Irilled
"We workec: n the two
minute drill all week," said of
fensive tackle Gordon King.
"We knew we plenty of
time."
"I had been talking to the
team all game about keeping
our poise, but then in the final
minutes there just wasn't time
to worry about pressure," Dils
said.
Starting on his 20-yard line,
Dils opened the final series by
running up the middle for
seven yards. On the next play
he found tight end Mitch Pleis
open for four yards and the
first down." "
One play later, Dils fired a
40-yard bomb to Lofton who
was streaking down the right
sideline.
S # *wford 'jumps' to vvin
Lofton, cornerback Arm
strong and safety Kenny
Easlev all rose together for the
Dils aerial. But the 6-foot-3 Lof

got to the ball first and held on

ground.
"I didn't throw a very good

been tested," Bruin corner
back Levi Armstrong said. "We
don't know how good we are."
But if the Bruin defense was
truly disappointed that Benja
min was sidelined during
Saturday's contest with a knee
injury it was not because their
defense would go untested.
It was because that meant
the Bruins would have to face
Benjamin's talented under
study, 6-foot-2 180-pound
senior Steve Dils.
Dils riddled the Bruin sec
ondary all afternoon before

64,500 fans at Stanford Stadium
and gave Armstrong and com
pany an idea how good they
are —and they didn't likewhat
they found out.
Dils picked the vaunted
UCLA defense apart, complet
ing 24 of 37 throws for 287 yards
and one touchdown, a 27-yard
strike to James Lofton that the
senior wide receiver carried
into the end zone with only 37
seconds remaining to give
Stanford a 32-28 victory over
the Bruins.
"We had a super week of
practice — best we've ever
had," Dils said. "We deserved
to win this game."
Rose Bowl foreshadowing?
"I wanted to beat them to
start our freshmen off right,"
said Lofton. For Stanford vete
rans, as well as Card freshmen,
Saturday's victory was their
first over UCLA. The Cardinals
have beaten the Bruins only
twice in the previous 14 years,
and both of those victorious
Stanford teams ended up in the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford has now won four

straight this season and is 2-0 in
Pac-8 play and 4-1 overall.
UCLA is 2-3 for the season and
0-1 in the conference.
Stanford began the game
playing as if the opposition
were Palo Alto High School,
not UCLA. Stanford put 16
points on the board before the
Bruins had even gained a first
down.
"The defense swelled up this
game," defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said. "I think UCLA
was testing for our weaknesses
in the first quarter and that's
why they were a little slow get
ting started."
UCLA capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble and two long
touchdown runs — 75 and 78
yards — to grab a 21-19 lead in
the third quarter.
Dils sharp
On the ensuing drive, Dils
completed four straight passes
to move Stanford to the UCLA
24-yard line.
"Steve Dils did a tremend
ous job," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said after the game. "He

poise. He executed beauti

With third-and-three from
the Bruin 23 Dils pitched to
halfback Darrin Nelson who
went around left end for 13
yards. One play later Nelson
sprinted around right end be
hind a block by fullback Phil
Francis to score untouched
from four years out and recap
ture the lead for the Cards.
Nelson, who had scored ear
lier on a 31-yard run, amassed
189 yards on 23 carries. The
heralded Stanford scatback
became the first Card
freshman to ever run for 100
yards in a single game. His 189
yards were the third most ever
totalled by a Stanford back in
one game.
"This guy (Nelson) makes my
job a heck of a lot easier," said
Dils.
Resilient Bruins
UCLA didn't lie dormant and
let Stanford breeze through
the fourth quarter.
Bruin quarterback Rick
Bashore, finding the running
game unsuccessful against the
fired-up Stanford defense,
went to the air.
A 31-yard pass to tight end
Don Pederson and a 27-yard
aerial to flanker Homer Butler
set up a 21-yard scoring toss to
Theotis Brown.
Brown, UCLA's No. 1 rusher
last year, missed three games
after injuring his elbow in the
season opener. He returned to
the lineup in the second quar

ter and scored on a 75-yard
dash which came on his third
carry.
This time, Bashore found
him free on the right sideline,
threw a strike to Brown who
rambled in with the gp-ahead
touchdown from five years out
with 2:20 remaining.
Cards we! 1 Irilled
"We workec: n the two
minute drill all week," said of
fensive tackle Gordon King.
"We knew we plenty of
time."
"I had been talking to the
team all game about keeping
our poise, but then in the final
minutes there just wasn't time
to worry about pressure," Dils
said.
Starting on his 20-yard line,
Dils opened the final series by
running up the middle for
seven yards. On the next play
he found tight end Mitch Pleis
open for four yards and the
first down." "
One play later, Dils fired a
40-yard bomb to Lofton who
was streaking down the right
sideline.
S # *wford 'jumps' to vvin
Lofton, cornerback Arm
strong and safety Kenny
Easlev all rose together for the
Dils aerial. But the 6-foot-3 Lof
ton, a world-class long jumper,
got to the ball first and held on
to the ball on the way to the
ground.
"I didn't throw a very good
pass;" Dils said, "I was a little
tired after running the draw.
He made a great catch."
But with the tight double
coverage Lofton received, the

pass was probably thrown the
only way that it could have
been to be completed.
"It was perfectly thrown,"
Lofton said.
"I talked to him (Dils) the day
before the game about putting
the ball up there."
After an incomplete pass to
Francis, Dils found Lofton bet
ween Easley and Armstrong
again, pinpointing the senior
flanker at the 5-yard line. Lof
ton spun as he caught the ball
and broke free of the two de
fenders. He lifted the ball over
his head and pranced into the
end zone from the four with
just 37 seconds remaining.
UCLA took Ken Naber's kic
koff and moved the ball to the
Stanford 24, before time ran
out on the Bruins.
Strong character
"It was a team effort — a
team that's not giving up,"
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino said. "It's a personal
ity found in most champion
ship teams."
"I suppose the difference in
this Stanford team and the
ones I dealt with in the mid-60s
is that this team has tremend
ous character," Walsh said.
"We beat a very good UCLA
team and came from behind
twice. We've been behind in
every game this year.
"I'm really happy about the
way we moved the ball. That
was our best offensive effort
against the best defense we've
played.
Stanford had its largest of
fensive output of the year with
Dils at the helm of the attack.

The Cards rolled to 265 yards
on the ground and gained 287
yards in the air for a total of 552
yards.
Coach impressed
"I was impressed with Stan
ford's offense and defense,
especially in the first half," said
UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
Stanford gained 18 first
downs to UCLA's four in the
first half.
"The defense played darned
good," Stanford's freshman
linebacker Tom Hall said. "All
week we knew we were playing
UCLA and today we just had it
all together."
"We knew we had to cut off
their outside offense," said
safety Ralph Phillips. "In my
last game against UCLA they
scored on their first series. This
time we shut them off. Three
big plays gave them 21 points."
Stanford has thrown itself
into the middle of the Race for
the Roses with its triumph over
UCLA.
"Come Monday we'll be
thinking about Washington,"
Kieburtz said. "This one is for
nothing if we don't win next
week."

from four years out and recap
ture the lead for the Cards.
Nelson, who had scored ear
lier on a 31-yard run, amassed
189 yards on 23 carries. The
heralded Stanford scatback
became the first Card
freshman to ever run for 100
yards in a single game. His 189
yards were the third most ever
totalled by a Stanford back in
one game.
"This guy (Nelson) makes my
job a heck of a lot easier," said
Dils.
Resilient Bruins
UCLA didn't lie dormant and
let Stanford breeze through
the fourth quarter.
Bruin quarterback Rick
Bashore, finding the running
game unsuccessful against the
fired-up Stanford defense,
went to the air.
A 31-yard pass to tight end
Don Pederson and a 27-yard
aerial to flanker Homer Butler
set up a 21-yard scoring toss to
Theotis Brown.
Brown, UCLA's No. 1 rusher
last year, missed three games
after injuring his elbow in the
season opener. He returned to
the lineup in the second quar

ter and scored on a 75-yard
dash which came on his third
carry.
This time, Bashore found
him free on the right sideline,
threw a strike to Brown who
rambled in with the gp-ahead
touchdown from five years out
with 2:20 remaining.
Cards we! 1 Irilled
"We workec: n the two
minute drill all week," said of
fensive tackle Gordon King.
"We knew we plenty of
time."
"I had been talking to the
team all game about keeping
our poise, but then in the final
minutes there just wasn't time
to worry about pressure," Dils
said.
Starting on his 20-yard line,
Dils opened the final series by
running up the middle for
seven yards. On the next play
he found tight end Mitch Pleis
open for four yards and the
first down." "
One play later, Dils fired a
40-yard bomb to Lofton who
was streaking down the right
sideline.

Lofton, cornerback Arm
strong and safety Kenny
Easlev all rose together for the
Dils aerial. But the 6-foot-3 Lof
ton, a world-class long jumper,
got to the ball first and held on
to the ball on the way to the
ground.
"I didn't throw a very good
pass;" Dils said, "I was a little
tired after running the draw.
He made a great catch."
But with the tight double
coverage Lofton received, the

pass was probably thrown the
only way that it could have
been to be completed.
"It was perfectly thrown,"
Lofton said.
"I talked to him (Dils) the day
before the game about putting
the ball up there."
After an incomplete pass to
Francis, Dils found Lofton bet
ween Easley and Armstrong
again, pinpointing the senior
flanker at the 5-yard line. Lof
ton spun as he caught the ball
and broke free of the two de
fenders. He lifted the ball over
his head and pranced into the
end zone from the four with
just 37 seconds remaining.
UCLA took Ken Naber's kic
koff and moved the ball to the
Stanford 24, before time ran
out on the Bruins.
Strong character
"It was a team effort — a
team that's not giving up,"
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino said. "It's a personal
ity found in most champion
ship teams."
"I suppose the difference in
this Stanford team and the
ones I dealt with in the mid-60s
is that this team has tremend
ous character," Walsh said.
"We beat a very good UCLA
team and came from behind
twice. We've been behind in
every game this year.
"I'm really happy about the
way we moved the ball. That
was our best offensive effort
against the best defense we've
played.
Stanford had its largest of
fensive output of the year with
Dils at the helm of the attack.

The Cards rolled to 265 yards
on the ground and gained 287
yards in the air for a total of 552
yards.
Coach impressed
"I was impressed with Stan
ford's offense and defense,
especially in the first half," said
UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
Stanford gained 18 first
downs to UCLA's four in the
first half.
"The defense played darned
good," Stanford's freshman
linebacker Tom Hall said. "All
week we knew we were playing
UCLA and today we just had it
all together."
"We knew we had to cut off
their outside offense," said
safety Ralph Phillips. "In my
last game against UCLA they
scored on their first series. This
time we shut them off. Three
big plays gave them 21 points."
Stanford has thrown itself
into the middle of the Race for
the Roses with its triumph over
UCLA.
"Come Monday we'll be
thinking about Washington,"
Kieburtz said. "This one is for
nothing if we don't win next
week."
