# Last-minute touchdown pass topples UCLA
## Dils, Nelson spark Cards to 32-28 win 
### Bruce Anderson 
When the UCLA Bruins got
word last week that they we
ren't going to face Cuy Benja
min in last Saturday's game,
they took the news almost as
hard as Stanford fans did.
The Los Angeles Times head
lined a story "UCLA Defense
Disappointed — Benjamin Is
Out," and UCLA All-America
linebacker Jerry Robinson said,
"You only live life once, so why
not go against the best
whenever you can?"
"Our secondary really hasn't
been tested," Bruin corner
back Levi Armstrong said. "We
don't know how good we are."
But if the Bruin defense was
truly disappointed that Benja
min was sidelined during
Saturday's contest with a knee
injury it was not because their
defense would go untested.
It was because that meant
the Bruins would have to face
Benjamin's talented under
study, 6-foot-2 180-pound
senior Steve Dils.
Dils riddled the Bruin sec
ondary all afternoon before

64,500 fans at Stanford Stadium
and gave Armstrong and com
pany an idea how good they
are —and they didn't likewhat
they found out.
Dils picked the vaunted
UCLA defense apart, complet
ing 24 of 37 throws for 287 yards
and one touchdown, a 27-yard
strike to James Lofton that the
senior wide receiver carried
into the end zone with only 37
seconds remaining to give
Stanford a 32-28 victory over
the Bruins.
"We had a super week of
practice — best we've ever
had," Dils said. "We deserved
to win this game."
Rose Bowl foreshadowing?
"I wanted to beat them to
start our freshmen off right,"
said Lofton. For Stanford vete
rans, as well as Card freshmen,
Saturday's victory was their
first over UCLA. The Cardinals
have beaten the Bruins only
twice in the previous 14 years,
and both of those victorious
Stanford teams ended up in the
Rose Bowl.
Stanford has now won four

straight this season and is 2-0 in
Pac-8 play and 4-1 overall.
UCLA is 2-3 for the season and
0-1 in the conference.
Stanford began the game
playing as if the opposition
were Palo Alto High School,
not UCLA. Stanford put 16
points on the board before the
Bruins had even gained a first
down.
"The defense swelled up this
game," defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said. "I think UCLA
was testing for our weaknesses
in the first quarter and that's
why they were a little slow get
ting started."
UCLA capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble and two long
touchdown runs — 75 and 78
yards — to grab a 21-19 lead in
the third quarter.
Dils sharp
On the ensuing drive, Dils
completed four straight passes
to move Stanford to the UCLA
24-yard line.
"Steve Dils did a tremend
ous job," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said after the game. "He
