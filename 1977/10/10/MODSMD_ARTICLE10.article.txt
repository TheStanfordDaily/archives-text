## ASSU Senate candidates' views: 
### 
Matt Cobb
There were moments when I con
sidered not writing this statement.
What good was it going to do? After
all, who cares about this election, or
the ASSU Senate for that matter?
Well, for reading this far, you obvi
ously have more than a passing in
terest and I guess that's why I ended
up writing it.
The biggest challenge the senate
faces this year is to overcome its im
potent image. I don't pretend to
know the whole answer, nor can I
promise quick changes — that's im
possible — but I do have some ideas.
The road is a long and difficult one
and one that we should start down
this year.
Granted, I haven't said much here,
but no one can solve the senate's
problems in 135 words. My phone
number is 328-2594 — call me if
you're interested . . . I'll listen.
Jim Esserman
In the course of the upcoming
campaign, students will hear many
claims by candidates for the ASSU
Senate. As a junior, I have witnessed
the platforms of many successful
candidates dissolve in their own
overheated rhetoric.
I feel a rational student will realize
that the power of an ASSU Senator is
limited, and his ability to legislate
significant transformations of the
status quo is more apparent than
real. I intend to concentrate my
energies on practical issues that have
good chances of being solved.
To this end, I will address such is
sues as beer at Tresidder, elimination
of RA positions in housing units that
don't need them, and establishment
of a mascot that the whole Stanford
community can support. Modest ob
jectives and practical approaches will
yield real results. Think about it.
Tom Faletti
My major emphasis will be
academic issues. Overseas studies
cut-backs, poor advising programs,
teaching evaluation and improve
ment, distribution and other re
quirements, strengthening de
partmental associations — these is
sues have no easy answers. Senate
speech-making will not solve them.
Last year, the ASSU Task Force on
Tenure and Teaching Quality made
some influential recommendations.
We need new task forces to do care
ful, researched studies of difficult is
sues and provide the University with
the thoughtful suggestions it needs.
The senate should meet informally
with students at sherry hours and
over dinner to determine what kinds
of improvements and new services
students want. Services I support in
clude the recycling center, funding
for the Undergraduate Lights Project
to help further dorm drama and ac
tivities, and more detailed explana
tion of where ASSU funds go. Stu
dent government can be responsive
and responsible.
Tom McCormack
Why the senate?
Because I believe the senate serves
necessary financial, academic, and
administrative functions.
Because as a member of the Com
mittee on Services to Students
(COSS), an R.A., and a staffer in the
Stanford Housing office, I have de
veloped an important understanding
of both the strengths and weaknes
ses of the Residential Education Sys
tem. There is still much room for im
provement.
Because I will not waste time esp
ousing personal ideologies irrelev
ant to the senate's jurisdiction or
purpose of service to the student.
Because as editor of the Autumn
'77 Course Abstracts I have come in
contact with curriculum studies,
student/faculty concerns, and
academic inadequacies. An in
formed opinion is an important be
ginning.
Because as an experienced and
concerned individual, I realize the
potential of an efficient A.S.S.U. Se
nate.
Why the senate? Because it makes
sense.
Mike Picard
With such a numerous and varied
graduate student body it is important
for this community to have proper
and enthusiastic representation. I
feel I can provide such support. My
aim is not to use this position as a
sounding board for any personal
gripes but rather to act on your be
half, supporting issues provided by
you and those issues brought before
the senate that may have adverse ef
fects on the graduate community.

Robert Docters, Susan O'Hara,
Mark Chin
Through time, effort, and deter
mination this year's senate can ac
complish much. Robert Docters,
Susan O'Hara, and Mark Chin pledge
that time and perseverance.
At present the most effective stu
dent voice is the ASSU. Since it can
act as a focus of opiTiion, and be
cause it appoints students to the
powerful university committees
which determine policy at Stanford,
the senate can constructively chal
lenge the soundness and morality of
decisions concerning investment or
curriculum.
The directions in which we intend
to channel our attention are pre
sented below, as our position state
ment.
1. Student advocacy. The students
have the right to make their views
become an integral part of every uni
versity decision. This input may
range from helping determine the re
lative priorities of research and
teaching at Stanford, to determining
fairly specific issues of university in
vestment.
In light of substantial tuition, stu
dents can insist that their education
is not needlessly compromised dur
ing their four years here, either be
cause of the university's long term
goals (such as in housing, which
must be improved), or because of
bureaucratic inefficiency and waste.
2. Academic quality. Stanford's
advisory system is inadequate com
pared to many other schools. Ad
visors are often unmotivated, and
frequently poorly equipped to pro
vide complete course and career ad
visory information. Students, in turn,
become apathetic and seemingly wil
ling to accept this inferior system.
The ASSU has yet to follow
through on a SWOPSI report, co
authored by a member of this slate,
which recommended major changes
in the present advising system.
Above all else, Robert Docters,
Susan O'Hara, and Mark Chin will
fight hard to see needed improve
ments quickly instituted.
3. Student services. A special re
port to the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, co-authored by a member of
this slate, showed that a flat-rate,
long distance phone center at Stan
ford could be rapidly installed and
expect widespread usage. The report
projected potential savings to stu
dents of between 30-70 per cent of
normal long distance charges, but
has not been acted upon. We sup
port its swift implementation.
As a slate, Robert Docters, Susan
O'Hara and Mark Chin intend to seek
out others' opinions on senate mat
ters, both in order to represent a
constituency and to seek out new
ideas.
We hope you will consider voting
for us October 12 and 13. With your
support we can create an effective
and activist senate.
Marc Ventresca, David Parker
This past spring quarter the Faculty
Senate unanimously endorsed the
"concept" of Universal Course
Evaluation. As a result of this man
date, the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement's (CAAA)
Subcommittee on the Evaluation and
Improvement of Teaching (CEIT) met
this summer to decide how Universal
Course Evaluation could best be im
plemented. David Parker served as
one of the three student members on
CEIT.
We are running for the senate be
cause we want the senate to be an
effective force for students in the
up-coming implementation of Univ
ersal Course Evaluations. Rarely does
the senate have the opportunity to
address such an important issue, and
we have the enthusiasm and the ex
perience to ensure that the senate
does it and does it right.
During 1976-77, Marc Ventresca
was associate editor for the ASSU
Course Guide, and was also involved
as a writer/staffer for Stanford's
Daily, Quad, and Chaparral. This
year Marc will be serving as editor of
the Course Guide and will be con
tinuing at the Daily and the Quad, as
well as with Student Orientation '77.
David Parker is currently the pro
ject manager for the ASSU Course
Guide, as well as a member of CAAA
and CEIT. In the past-, he has served
as the Course Guide's survey coor
dinator, as a member of CAAA's sub
committee on University and De
partmental Honors, as a member of
Students Interested in Tenure (SIT),
and for a short while as entertain
ment writer/staffer for the Daily.
The teaching evaluation issue con
cerns all of us. Marc Ventresca and
David Parker, the Course Guide
slate, can provide a currently in
volved perspective. Let us continue
with your vote.

Will Nixon
My job as senator will not be so
much to enact what I want but,
rather, to do what you want. A
senator is not called a representative
for nothing. The most important mat
ter in my campaign is how I will be
available to you.
As senator I intend to eat in diffe
rent dorms, frats, houses, etc., at
least four nights a week, and at many
lunches.
I also intend to keep in close touch
with the various political and social
organizations around campus. I will
attend their meetings, and also
house meetings when relevant.
I live in Loro, Flo Mo, phone 326-
6199. I will also be available at the
ASSU office when elected. I will want
you to contact me both about senate
affairs and other matters, e.g.
bureaucratic hassles, where I can
help.
Chuck Pacheco
Often senate candidates have
worked hard to become elected but
have been surprisingly unwilling to
work within the Senate as responsi
ble leaders. It is no surprise, then,
that the ASSU Senate has been the
least respected student organization
on campus. This year's senate should
work towards becoming an active
and effective body willing to become
involved with the serious needs of
the student.
The following are three commit
ments I would work towards as a
senator:
Increased student awareness to
the extent and purpose of senate fi
nancial affairs:
More autonomy given to the over
seas campuses and a strengthening
of the present overseas programs;
Better liaison with student organi
zations and clubs.
For concerned and progressive
leadership, vote Chuck Pacheco.
Nick Valenzuela, Steven Men
tor,
Victor Martinez, Don Moon

Francisco Santana, Paul Fram
son
As the graduate student candi
dates endorsed by the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee, we will work to
enliven the exchange of values and
ideas that should characterize educa
tion in the broadest sense. We take
the following stands:
1. Minority groups should be rep
resented by minority students. Only
then will issues such as minority re
cruitment, counseling, and realistic
placement service receive adequate
attention. The recent decline in
minority graduate admissions, and
the results of the Bakke case threaten
to undermine hard-won victories;
systematic prejudice can only be
ended by active and informed oppos
ition. We also propose to move the
Chicano Activities Center to more
spacious headquarters, and to en
courage fuller participation of
minorities in senate agenda.
2. Alongside SOC, we strongly
support the establishment of a suc
cessful recycling program here at
Stanford. With sufficient initial fund
ing, the program would become
self-supporting — this means a yes
vote on the upcoming fee assess
ment decision.
3. The Senate needs to better ac
commodate student interests if it is to
take an active role in student affairs.
We agree with SOC's proposal of
open meetings, with agenda, time
and place conspicuously published
in the Daily.
4. Stanford employees are a large
part of the university community; we
support greater participation of
U.S.E. in community affairs and
decision-making, and specifically
advocate employe representation
on the C.I.R.

Jon Sigler
Graduate students tend to have a
harder time meeting people other
than those in their curriculum or liv
ing environment. My major concern
as a senator will be to develop prog
rams to ease the interfacing of grad
students with others from the diffe
rent facets of the University. More
organized social and extra-curricular
activities are called for, as well as in
creased graduate participation in
campus affairs.
Although new to the campus, I
have a record of major student gov
ernment involvement behind me as a
student senator and president of the
student union while an undergrad. I
am certain that I will be able to utilize
this experience to the benefit of my
constituents by bringing new (and
old) ideas into action.

Janet Rappaport
As a candidate for ASSU Senate I
make no election promises. For years
students have been bombarded
with, if elected I promise. . . . how
ever, I know there are restrictions to
what the senate can actually do.
I run alone because I feel that the
slates and interest groups are one of
the major limitations facing the se
nate, as was evidenced by last year's
power plays. Representation of all in
terests on campus, from club sports
to minority groups, is what the se
nate should strive for.
I therefore advocate a strong line
of communication between student
committee members and the senate.
This way issues such as student hous
ing, parking fees and aids for the
handicapped could be worked for
and resolved in an efficient manner.
A vote for me is a vote for you — and
your interests.
Robert Schwebel
Many students come to Stanford
either seeking a specific major or a
general 'education.' Quite a few of
these students come unstuck, either
through disenchantment with their
own goals, or a loss of direction
when given so many choices of
specific courses. I feel the University
has a responsibility to its students in
this area, which it has not fully met.
I am running for the ASSU Senate
primarily to give voice to those dis
enchanted students who "wonder
why they came here anyway." I
would like for there to be some kind
of student self-help organization,
where drop-outs and stop-outs
could give advice to students who
are mixed up. If elected, I would
make this my prime interest in the
senate.
Dave Steuer
After a year of dormancy, the se
nate must now address important
student issues. Cutbacks in Stan
ford's Overseas Programs need to
end. Plans for new housing must be
considered, and if construction is
not immediately possible, the quality
of present housing services must be
improved. Manzanita especially de
mands attention.
Stanford's student services
bureaucracy must become more re
sponsive to student needs. Stan
ford's investment policies deserve
continued scrutiny; moral responsi
bility needn't be sacrificed for finan
cial security. The senate can work
toward these goals either through
projects of its own creation or, sig
nificantly, through the ability to pub
licize and to supplement the more
exhaustive committee work.
Hampering this process is postur
ing by ideologically constricted
senators. As an independent candi
date, my only commitment is to build
an effective, constructive senate.
We've had enough obstruction. It's
now time for some progress.
Doug Bandow, Howard Wolf
The senate has, for too long,
lacked credibility with students.
Rather than representing student in
terests, it has broken down over
petty bickering and politicking for
COP campaigns, and involved itself
in matters which it doesn't under
stand, and over which it has no con
trol.
A major effort needs to be
mounted to make the ASSU more re
levant to student concerns —particu-
larly those of graduate students, who
have'had little reason to be in
terested in it in the past. The senate
should only work in those areas
where it can have a meaningful ef
fect, such as in academic affairs and
the support of student organiza
tions.
Most importantly, the senate
should be open to input from all stu
dents, regardless of political persua
sion or connections. Committee ap
pointments and organizational fund
ing should be decided on a non
partisan basis. Resolutions should be
passed only when they serve a useful
purpose — rather than to boost some
individual's ego.
Petty personal differences and nar
row political causes should not be
permitted to interfere with those
areas where the Senate can be effec
tive; the senate should be respon
sive to the student body as a whole,
and not to special interests.
Doug Bandow and Howard Wolf
will be totally independent, and will
seek to represent all students objec
tively and effectively. They view the
senate as a vehicle for student input
and representation, rather than as a
vehicle for personal prominence and
political gain. We need a responsible
senate; Doug Bandow and Howard
Wolf will be responsible senators.
