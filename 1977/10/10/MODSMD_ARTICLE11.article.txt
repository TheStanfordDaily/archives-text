Mike Veiluva.
; The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) is a coalition of Stanford's
rininority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees. This year SOC has
organized a slate to enhance interac
tion of student government and stu
dent groups. As ten candidates run
ning together, we share common
priorities but represent a diversity of
interests, experiences, and skills that
can be combined to realize the full
potential of the ASSU Senate.
In the past few years, the senate
has become inactive and glaringly
ineffective in dealing with major is
sues of the Stanford community. Last
year, it degenerated to a forum for
joke-telling by the clowns of the
Hammer and Coffin slate, and in
fighting between petty politicians
seeking personal gains.
The senate is not just a closed
committee for administering ASSU
funds. It should provide active lead
ership for students. This means in
volving the student body in decisions
which affect us, and serving as a
voice for student opinion on impor
tant questions. Last April, asweeping
majority elected a highly activist slate
to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Already these four people have
begun to change the definition of
student government at Stanford.
Last spring the campus witnessed
an upsurge of student protest unpre
cedented since 1972. This year prom
ises to be one of political activity at
campuses across the nation. Besides
working hard for issues that will di
rectly improve the quality of our lives
and education, the SOC slate intends
to provide an active voice for the
political views of the student body.
Our goals are comprehensive. But
we know we can work together, and
because we are backed by the major
campus organizations we have ac
cess to resources and constituencies
that will enable us to effect change.
More importantly, we plan to struc
ture a government that can maximize
input from all elements of the stu
dent body.
We would like to establish greater
cooperation between the various
segments of the Stanford student
government — the senate, Council
of Presidents, Nominations Commit
tee, and the university committee
members. It is important that stu
dents are informed about — and
consequently get involved in — the

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet
ings will be open so that anyone can
participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa
tion can be disseminated, and straw
v<otesat house meetings can betaken
on important issues with the results
directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed
by the senate.
: —Non-sexist language in the se
nate bylaws, meetings, and constitu
tion.
Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to
call us at 321-8868, 326-7126, or 328-
$362.

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.
To do the job right requires a
commitment which few candidates
seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.
Annie Cramblit, Jill Liscom
As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

Let's face it — just about the only
grad students who take the ASSU Se
nate seriously are running for
senator. I happen to think it's suffi
ciently important that I get enough
votes to become a senator instead of
an alternate (as I was last year until I
replaced a disillusioned "regular")
that I am willing to publicly reveal my
candidacy (and in doing so appear
rather silly to most of my pe£rs). But I
certainly can't criticize anyone for
not voting, much less not voting for
me. Still — if you've got nothing bet
ter to do on election days, it'll only
take a minute to drag yourself out of
your office or lab and down to a vot
ing place. You might even eventually
get something out of it....
John Paval
This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.
George Drysdale
As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.
. Al Miner
Al Miner is my name. I am a
graduate student in Industrial En
gineering.
I will strive to achieve greater so
cial contacts between the different
segments of the graduate commun
ity, and between the grads and the
undergraduates of Stanford.
I believe the ASSU has the re
sources ($) to create a better on
campus social environment for grad
students. For instance, I think the
ASSU could sponsor Friday after
noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.

directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed
by the senate.
: —Non-sexist language in the se
nate bylaws, meetings, and constitu
tion.
Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.
To do the job right requires a
commitment which few candidates
seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.

As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

Let's face it — just about the only
grad students who take the ASSU Se
nate seriously are running for
senator. I happen to think it's suffi
ciently important that I get enough
votes to become a senator instead of
an alternate (as I was last year until I
replaced a disillusioned "regular")
that I am willing to publicly reveal my
candidacy (and in doing so appear
rather silly to most of my pe£rs). But I
certainly can't criticize anyone for
not voting, much less not voting for
me. Still — if you've got nothing bet
ter to do on election days, it'll only
take a minute to drag yourself out of
your office or lab and down to a vot
ing place. You might even eventually
get something out of it....

This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.
George Drysdale
As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.

Al Miner is my name. I am a
graduate student in Industrial En

I will strive to achieve greater so
cial contacts between the different
segments of the graduate commun
ity, and between the grads and the
undergraduates of Stanford.
I believe the ASSU has the re
sources ($) to create a better on
campus social environment for grad
students. For instance, I think the
ASSU could sponsor Friday after
noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.

; The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) is a coalition of Stanford's
rininority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees. This year SOC has
organized a slate to enhance interac
tion of student government and stu
dent groups. As ten candidates run
ning together, we share common
priorities but represent a diversity of
interests, experiences, and skills that
can be combined to realize the full
potential of the ASSU Senate.
In the past few years, the senate
has become inactive and glaringly
ineffective in dealing with major is
sues of the Stanford community. Last
year, it degenerated to a forum for
joke-telling by the clowns of the
Hammer and Coffin slate, and in
fighting between petty politicians
seeking personal gains.
The senate is not just a closed
committee for administering ASSU
funds. It should provide active lead
ership for students. This means in
volving the student body in decisions
which affect us, and serving as a
voice for student opinion on impor
tant questions. Last April, asweeping
majority elected a highly activist slate
to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Already these four people have
begun to change the definition of
student government at Stanford.
Last spring the campus witnessed
an upsurge of student protest unpre
cedented since 1972. This year prom
ises to be one of political activity at
campuses across the nation. Besides
working hard for issues that will di
rectly improve the quality of our lives
and education, the SOC slate intends
to provide an active voice for the
political views of the student body.
Our goals are comprehensive. But
we know we can work together, and
because we are backed by the major
campus organizations we have ac
cess to resources and constituencies
that will enable us to effect change.
More importantly, we plan to struc
ture a government that can maximize
input from all elements of the stu
dent body.
We would like to establish greater
cooperation between the various
segments of the Stanford student
government — the senate, Council
of Presidents, Nominations Commit
tee, and the university committee
members. It is important that stu
dents are informed about — and
consequently get involved in — the

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet

participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa

—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed

: —Non-sexist language in the se

Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.
To do the job right requires a
commitment which few candidates
seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.

As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

Let's face it — just about the only
grad students who take the ASSU Se
nate seriously are running for
senator. I happen to think it's suffi
ciently important that I get enough
votes to become a senator instead of
an alternate (as I was last year until I
replaced a disillusioned "regular")
that I am willing to publicly reveal my
candidacy (and in doing so appear
rather silly to most of my pe£rs). But I
certainly can't criticize anyone for
not voting, much less not voting for
me. Still — if you've got nothing bet
ter to do on election days, it'll only
take a minute to drag yourself out of
your office or lab and down to a vot
ing place. You might even eventually
get something out of it....

This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.
George Drysdale
As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.
. Al Miner
Al Miner is my name. I am a
graduate student in Industrial En
gineering.
I will strive to achieve greater so
cial contacts between the different
segments of the graduate commun
ity, and between the grads and the
undergraduates of Stanford.
I believe the ASSU has the re
sources ($) to create a better on
campus social environment for grad
students. For instance, I think the
ASSU could sponsor Friday after
noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.

; The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) is a coalition of Stanford's
rininority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees. This year SOC has
organized a slate to enhance interac
tion of student government and stu
dent groups. As ten candidates run
ning together, we share common
priorities but represent a diversity of
interests, experiences, and skills that
can be combined to realize the full
potential of the ASSU Senate.
In the past few years, the senate
has become inactive and glaringly
ineffective in dealing with major is
sues of the Stanford community. Last
year, it degenerated to a forum for
joke-telling by the clowns of the
Hammer and Coffin slate, and in
fighting between petty politicians
seeking personal gains.
The senate is not just a closed
committee for administering ASSU
funds. It should provide active lead
ership for students. This means in
volving the student body in decisions
which affect us, and serving as a
voice for student opinion on impor
tant questions. Last April, asweeping
majority elected a highly activist slate
to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Already these four people have
begun to change the definition of
student government at Stanford.
Last spring the campus witnessed
an upsurge of student protest unpre
cedented since 1972. This year prom
ises to be one of political activity at
campuses across the nation. Besides
working hard for issues that will di
rectly improve the quality of our lives
and education, the SOC slate intends
to provide an active voice for the
political views of the student body.
Our goals are comprehensive. But
we know we can work together, and
because we are backed by the major
campus organizations we have ac
cess to resources and constituencies
that will enable us to effect change.
More importantly, we plan to struc
ture a government that can maximize
input from all elements of the stu
dent body.
We would like to establish greater
cooperation between the various
segments of the Stanford student
government — the senate, Council
of Presidents, Nominations Commit
tee, and the university committee
members. It is important that stu
dents are informed about — and
consequently get involved in — the

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet
ings will be open so that anyone can
participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa
tion can be disseminated, and straw
v<otesat house meetings can betaken
on important issues with the results
directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit

seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.

As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

Let's face it — just about the only
grad students who take the ASSU Se
nate seriously are running for
senator. I happen to think it's suffi
ciently important that I get enough
votes to become a senator instead of
an alternate (as I was last year until I
replaced a disillusioned "regular")
that I am willing to publicly reveal my
candidacy (and in doing so appear
rather silly to most of my pe£rs). But I
certainly can't criticize anyone for
not voting, much less not voting for
me. Still — if you've got nothing bet
ter to do on election days, it'll only
take a minute to drag yourself out of
your office or lab and down to a vot
ing place. You might even eventually
get something out of it....

This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.
George Drysdale
As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.
. Al Miner
Al Miner is my name. I am a
graduate student in Industrial En
gineering.
I will strive to achieve greater so
cial contacts between the different
segments of the graduate commun
ity, and between the grads and the
undergraduates of Stanford.
I believe the ASSU has the re
sources ($) to create a better on
campus social environment for grad
students. For instance, I think the
ASSU could sponsor Friday after
noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.

; The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) is a coalition of Stanford's
rininority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees. This year SOC has
organized a slate to enhance interac
tion of student government and stu
dent groups. As ten candidates run
ning together, we share common
priorities but represent a diversity of
interests, experiences, and skills that
can be combined to realize the full
potential of the ASSU Senate.
In the past few years, the senate
has become inactive and glaringly
ineffective in dealing with major is
sues of the Stanford community. Last
year, it degenerated to a forum for
joke-telling by the clowns of the
Hammer and Coffin slate, and in
fighting between petty politicians
seeking personal gains.
The senate is not just a closed
committee for administering ASSU
funds. It should provide active lead
ership for students. This means in
volving the student body in decisions
which affect us, and serving as a
voice for student opinion on impor
tant questions. Last April, asweeping
majority elected a highly activist slate
to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Already these four people have
begun to change the definition of
student government at Stanford.
Last spring the campus witnessed
an upsurge of student protest unpre
cedented since 1972. This year prom
ises to be one of political activity at
campuses across the nation. Besides
working hard for issues that will di
rectly improve the quality of our lives
and education, the SOC slate intends
to provide an active voice for the
political views of the student body.
Our goals are comprehensive. But
we know we can work together, and
because we are backed by the major
campus organizations we have ac
cess to resources and constituencies
that will enable us to effect change.
More importantly, we plan to struc
ture a government that can maximize
input from all elements of the stu
dent body.
We would like to establish greater
cooperation between the various
segments of the Stanford student
government — the senate, Council
of Presidents, Nominations Commit
tee, and the university committee
members. It is important that stu
dents are informed about — and
consequently get involved in — the

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet
ings will be open so that anyone can
participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa
tion can be disseminated, and straw
v<otesat house meetings can betaken
on important issues with the results
directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed
by the senate.
: —Non-sexist language in the se
nate bylaws, meetings, and constitu
tion.
Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.

This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.

As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.

Al Miner is my name. I am a
graduate student in Industrial En
gineering.
I will strive to achieve greater so
cial contacts between the different
segments of the graduate commun
ity, and between the grads and the
undergraduates of Stanford.
I believe the ASSU has the re
sources ($) to create a better on
campus social environment for grad
students. For instance, I think the
ASSU could sponsor Friday after
noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.

; The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) is a coalition of Stanford's
rininority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees. This year SOC has
organized a slate to enhance interac
tion of student government and stu
dent groups. As ten candidates run
ning together, we share common
priorities but represent a diversity of
interests, experiences, and skills that
can be combined to realize the full
potential of the ASSU Senate.
In the past few years, the senate
has become inactive and glaringly
ineffective in dealing with major is
sues of the Stanford community. Last
year, it degenerated to a forum for
joke-telling by the clowns of the
Hammer and Coffin slate, and in
fighting between petty politicians
seeking personal gains.
The senate is not just a closed
committee for administering ASSU
funds. It should provide active lead
ership for students. This means in
volving the student body in decisions
which affect us, and serving as a
voice for student opinion on impor
tant questions. Last April, asweeping
majority elected a highly activist slate
to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Already these four people have
begun to change the definition of
student government at Stanford.
Last spring the campus witnessed
an upsurge of student protest unpre
cedented since 1972. This year prom
ises to be one of political activity at
campuses across the nation. Besides
working hard for issues that will di
rectly improve the quality of our lives
and education, the SOC slate intends
to provide an active voice for the
political views of the student body.
Our goals are comprehensive. But
we know we can work together, and
because we are backed by the major
campus organizations we have ac
cess to resources and constituencies
that will enable us to effect change.
More importantly, we plan to struc
ture a government that can maximize
input from all elements of the stu
dent body.
We would like to establish greater
cooperation between the various
segments of the Stanford student
government — the senate, Council
of Presidents, Nominations Commit
tee, and the university committee
members. It is important that stu
dents are informed about — and
consequently get involved in — the

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet
ings will be open so that anyone can
participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa
tion can be disseminated, and straw
v<otesat house meetings can betaken
on important issues with the results
directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed
by the senate.
: —Non-sexist language in the se
nate bylaws, meetings, and constitu
tion.
Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to
call us at 321-8868, 326-7126, or 328-

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.
To do the job right requires a
commitment which few candidates
seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.

As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.

; The Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) is a coalition of Stanford's
rininority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees. This year SOC has
organized a slate to enhance interac
tion of student government and stu
dent groups. As ten candidates run
ning together, we share common
priorities but represent a diversity of
interests, experiences, and skills that
can be combined to realize the full
potential of the ASSU Senate.
In the past few years, the senate
has become inactive and glaringly
ineffective in dealing with major is
sues of the Stanford community. Last
year, it degenerated to a forum for
joke-telling by the clowns of the
Hammer and Coffin slate, and in
fighting between petty politicians
seeking personal gains.
The senate is not just a closed
committee for administering ASSU
funds. It should provide active lead
ership for students. This means in
volving the student body in decisions
which affect us, and serving as a
voice for student opinion on impor
tant questions. Last April, asweeping
majority elected a highly activist slate
to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Already these four people have
begun to change the definition of
student government at Stanford.
Last spring the campus witnessed
an upsurge of student protest unpre
cedented since 1972. This year prom
ises to be one of political activity at
campuses across the nation. Besides
working hard for issues that will di
rectly improve the quality of our lives
and education, the SOC slate intends
to provide an active voice for the
political views of the student body.
Our goals are comprehensive. But
we know we can work together, and
because we are backed by the major
campus organizations we have ac
cess to resources and constituencies
that will enable us to effect change.
More importantly, we plan to struc
ture a government that can maximize
input from all elements of the stu
dent body.
We would like to establish greater
cooperation between the various
segments of the Stanford student
government — the senate, Council
of Presidents, Nominations Commit
tee, and the university committee
members. It is important that stu
dents are informed about — and
consequently get involved in — the

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet
ings will be open so that anyone can
participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa
tion can be disseminated, and straw
v<otesat house meetings can betaken
on important issues with the results
directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed
by the senate.
: —Non-sexist language in the se
nate bylaws, meetings, and constitu
tion.
Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to
call us at 321-8868, 326-7126, or 328-

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.
To do the job right requires a
commitment which few candidates
seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.

As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

Let's face it — just about the only
grad students who take the ASSU Se
nate seriously are running for
senator. I happen to think it's suffi
ciently important that I get enough
votes to become a senator instead of
an alternate (as I was last year until I
replaced a disillusioned "regular")
that I am willing to publicly reveal my
candidacy (and in doing so appear
rather silly to most of my pe£rs). But I
certainly can't criticize anyone for
not voting, much less not voting for
me. Still — if you've got nothing bet
ter to do on election days, it'll only
take a minute to drag yourself out of
your office or lab and down to a vot
ing place. You might even eventually
get something out of it....

This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.
George Drysdale
As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.

decision-making process in the se
nate.
There will be regular reports and
analyses by senators in the Daily. The
agenda, time, and place of the meet
ings will be announced in the media
in advance. Discussions at the meet
ings will be open so that anyone can
participate. An R.A. phone network
will be established so that informa
tion can be disseminated, and straw
v<otesat house meetings can betaken
on important issues with the results
directly communicated to us.
Services that purport to be in the
best interest of Stanford students
may in fact be "ripping us off." We
intend to investigate.
1. Why the Bookstore is a private
corporation and not a student co-op.
2. The enormous growth of the
university bureaucracy, why it has
grown so much faster than the stu
dent body it serves, and how this af
fects tuition.
3. Why must students who fre
quent Tresidder, The Store, and the
food service bear the brunt of profi
teering, when student administered
co-ops would not only provide better
service, but lower prices?
4. Why is there a continual "hous
ing crisis" at Stanford?
5. Why are hundreds of thousands
of dollars being spent on fountains in
the midst of a drought?
The present off-campus student
lounge is an insult to students who
commute. The center needs to be
expanded to provide services that
have been denied a large part of the
student body. This will be a budget
priority.
The ASSU course guide should be
made mandatory for all classes and
used as a criterion in tenure deci
sions.
Last spring massive student de
monstrations graphically revealed
how little the trustees are in touch
with student sentiment. Only stu
dents can speak for students. We will
support efforts by the COP to place a
student on the Board of Trustees.
It is ironic that while students and
staff were subjecting themselves to
arrest over the issue of investments
in corporations involved in South Af
rica, the ASSU maintained a stock
portfolio with many of the same cor
porations. The ASSU should review
its portfolio and re-invest in accepta
ble ventures. Consistent with this
view, the senate should put forth
demands to the administration to
change its own investment policy.
Stanford's investments are made
in the name of the entire university
community. Therefore, employees,
as well as students, faculty, and
alumni, must be represented on the
Commission on Investment Respon

sibility.
Half the Sky is a coalition of
feminist individuals and over 15 dif
ferent women's groups. The SOC
slate strongly supports the following
issues and activities of Half the Sky:
—Accelerated hiring and promo
tion of women faculty. Last spring
only 84 out of 1133 Stanford profes
sors were female.
—A rape crisis center that would
staff a 24 hour hot line, gather and
publish statistics about assaults on
women, and inform women about
protection.
—Activities such as Women's
Week, to be held at Stanford Oct.
18-22.
It will be our role as senators to
encourage and financially support
women's activities at Stanford.
Specific goals that we will work for in
the senate include:
—Financial support of childcare
programs and facilities.
—Affirmative action in confirma
tion of women to university commit
tee posts.
—Encouragement of women to
apply for the Nominations Commit
tee, whose members are appointed
by the senate.
: —Non-sexist language in the se
nate bylaws, meetings, and constitu
tion.
Bakke: We strongly support affir
mative action programs created to
correct the extreme imbalance of
Asian American, Black, Chicano, and
Native American participation in our
society's universities and profes
sional programs. Systematic dis
crimination imposed upon these
groups must stop. Therefore we op
pose the State Supreme Court rul
ing in the Bakke case. In addition, we
support efforts for accelerated hiring
and recruitment of minorities for fa
culty positions.
Jewish: We disapprove of the Uni
versity's insensitivity in scheduling
registration days on Jewish holidays,
and will work with Hillel to insure
that registration will never be held on
the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah
or Yom Kippur.
Cay Rights: We pledge support to
the G.P.U. in the struggle to insure
that Stanford does not discriminate
on the basis of sexual preference.
Recruiters from companies that dis
criminate against gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to use campus
facilities for interviews.
If you agree with these positions,
please give us your support on Oct.
12 and 13. We must work together in
order to be most effective. We there
fore ask that you support the entire
SOC slate. If you would like further
information about SOC or the SOC
slate, we will be visiting the dorms in

the next few days. Also, feel free to
call us at 321-8868, 326-7126, or 328-
$362.

If you're taking the time to read
this, you must be somewhat con
cerned about the course of student
government this year. So are we. So,
apparently, are the dozens of other
candidates who appear on this page.
Yet where were these candidates
last year when ASSU decisions were
being made? All of the candidates
this year are upperclassmen — when
they knock on your door, ask them
how many took the time to attend
senate meetings last year; ask them
to explain the finances of the ASSU
for which they have so many propos
als; ask them how they have worked
to implement their many ideas for
the ASSU prior to this campaign.
Service in the senate is more than
an ego trip following an October
election. It is more than a lofty prom
ise of "investment responsibility,"
"better communication" or of cir
culating your phone number in bold
type.
To do the job right requires a
commitment which few candidates
seem to mention — a commitment to
take the time to learn the issues, at
tend committee meetings, under
stand the finances of the ASSU and
be able to intelligently respond to
student concerns.
Service in the senate does not
mean using the money and influence
of the ASSU to further narrow politi
cal causes. All too often in the past,
"activism" has translated itself into
an unrepresentative abuse of power.
We offer a slate with more com
bined experience than any other,
with individuals who understand the
ASSU, who know what it can and
cannot do. Most importantly, we
know what it should and should not
do.
Throughout the campaign, we
have used the phrase "Responsibility
in the Senate." To us, it is more than
a campaign slogan. Hopefully, it is a
description of the way in which we
have served the students in the past.
Most importantly, it is a commitment
we will abide by in the futre.
Please vote on Wednesday.

As 1977 senate representatives for
the Daily and KZSU, we observed
how the senate functions, and are
aware of its procedures and limita
tions. We feel these limitations can
be overcome with careful investiga
tion into student needs and opin
ions. Realistically, the senate alone
cannot change University policy; we

see its primary responsibility as act
ing as liaison between students, ad
ministrators, and the Stanford com
munity in voicing student opinion.
Communication is essential. We
feel our past experience in the media
will enable us to get more student
input into the senate. Specifically,
we would like to see the publication
of a senate agenda in The Daily prior
to meetings. It should list the issues
and their tentative times to be dis
cussed. Hopefully this would en
courage students to attend more
meetings and relay their feelings.
A senate task force should be
created to investigate pertinent
housing questions, such as that of
sororities on campus, present resi
dent's priority and optional fraternity
R.A.'s. With enough student in
terest, we can use the senate's power
to influence change in the administ
ration's ideas.
Student government cannot be
representative when only 20 per cent
of the student body votes. To en
courage higher voter participation,
more easily accessible polling places
should be set up, such as in student
residences or dining halls.
We proved our dedication by at
tending each 1977 senate meeting;
our familiarity and interest in the se
nate will allow us to begin working
immediately on meeting student
needs.

Let's face it — just about the only
grad students who take the ASSU Se
nate seriously are running for
senator. I happen to think it's suffi
ciently important that I get enough
votes to become a senator instead of
an alternate (as I was last year until I
replaced a disillusioned "regular")
that I am willing to publicly reveal my
candidacy (and in doing so appear
rather silly to most of my pe£rs). But I
certainly can't criticize anyone for
not voting, much less not voting for
me. Still — if you've got nothing bet
ter to do on election days, it'll only
take a minute to drag yourself out of
your office or lab and down to a vot
ing place. You might even eventually
get something out of it....
John Paval
This year's senate faces numerous
controversial issues involving uni
versity investment and research pol
icy, the Bakke case, and women's
role at Stanford. These call for firm,
well publicized stands by the senate,
but require thoughtful consideration
beforehand. Intelligence should
take precedence over ideology on
sensitive issues.
The senate needs to be sensitized
to resolvable concerns of graduates

and undergraduates. Forty-five per
cent of the ASSU fees are paid by
graduate students. For them, the se
nate must support improvements in
residential and fellowship policy,
and in the quality of graduate social
life.
Student complaints about
academic grievance procedures and
university services deserve senate
support and university action. Pro
cedures in these areas cry out for re
form.
We must formulate independent
ASSU positions, pursue specific re
sponses from university policy mak
ers, and press for accountability on
the part of committees and individu
als.
George Drysdale
As a newcomer to Stanford last
year I was frustratingly aware of the
lack of graduate student interaction
and campus involvement. As a
senator I will work to develop a grea
ter sense of graduate (and
graduate-undergraduate) commun
ity, to allocate a fair share of ASSU
funds to deserving graduate pro
jects, and to articulate and represent
our academic, housing, financial,
and social concerns.
Because the Senate is a forum to
which many look for both expressing
and reflecting student viewpoints,
and a major source of student fund
ing and initiative, the tasks of this
organization must be undertaken
with responsibility and sensitivity.
From my experiences in both
"workworld" and campus organiza
tions, I feel I can contribute energy,
various interpersonal and adminis
trative skills, and some different
perspectives that can make the se
nate more representative and effi
cient.
. Al Miner
Al Miner is my name. I am a
graduate student in Industrial En
gineering.
I will strive to achieve greater so
cial contacts between the different
segments of the graduate commun
ity, and between the grads and the
undergraduates of Stanford.
I believe the ASSU has the re
sources ($) to create a better on
campus social environment for grad
students. For instance, I think the
ASSU could sponsor Friday after
noon kegger football or soccer
games. We've got to be able to im
prove the image of the graduate stu
dent.
I wasn't in the senate last year. I'm
easy going, receptive to ideas (ex
cept when I referee Intramurals),and
I have plenty of my own. I hope you'll
give me a chance to implement them
by voting for me, Al Miner.
