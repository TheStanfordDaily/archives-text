First of two parts
How would you like to live in
outer space?
We may all be able to live
amongst the stars, or at least
the planets, in our solar system
sooner than we realize.
It's been four years since the
United States has sent a man
into outer space, but research
being conducted this very
moment indicates that we may
be ready for something com
pletely different — the era of
"space colonization."
This could become the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space
Administration's biggest pro
ject ever. Space colonization is
based on two main hopes: that
men and women will soon be
able to live and work in outer
space, independent of earth,
and that outer space will soon
provide us with an inexhausti
ble source of clean energy.
Direct benefits
With materials mined from
the moon and the asteroids,
food and housing could be
supplied in outer space for trill
ions of people. This is impor
tant because according to Un
ited Nations estimates, the
world population will reach 10
billion by the year 2035. This
contrasts with four billion
people now on earth.
Once human colonies are
set up in space, solar power
stations could be built in earth
orbit. These immense satellites
would capture the sun's rays,
and divert them down to earth
where they cart be converted

into electricity.
Within 30 years, there could
be enough solar power sta
tions to satisfy the world's
energy needs. Solar power
from space should pay for
space colonization many times
over. This is where space col
onization differs from past
NASA projects.
Old dream
Men have dreamed of living
in outer space for quite some
time. Novelists have been writ
ing stories about humans in
space for over a hundred years.
The first, scientist to propose
the colonization of space was
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a Rus
sian physicist.
In 1903, he theorized that a
space habitat could be rotated,
to provide gravity for the

Unlike past NASA projects, space col
onies could pay for themselves many
times over by diverting the sun's rays to
earth to produce electricity.

people inside. He also thought
of growing food in space, and
of deriving energy from the
sun.
The idea progressed slowly
until the 19505. Gerard O'Neill,
a Princeton physicist, picked
up the idea in 1969. After eight
years of hard work, he and his
colleagues concluded that we
can colonize outer space using
existing technology without
much adverse harm to anyone
or effect to human popula
tions.
O'Neill is still very much in
volved in this project. He con
ducted a study here two years
ago on this very topic.
1985
If NASA receives sufficient
funding, all basic research
could be completed within five
years. Then, if the project were

approved, full-scale planning
would begin. Construction of
homes in outer space could
begin as early as 1985.
The first space habitats
would be small, temporary
shift stations, capable of sup
porting crews of up to 150 men
and women who would build
the larger permanent settle
ments. The crew members
would probably serve short
tours of duty, remaining in
space for up to two years at a
time to construct the solar
power stations.
These later colonies will
have populations of 10,000 to
10 million persons.
They would be spacious,
comfortable and similar to
earth in many ways. Inhabit
ants of these colonies would

be able to enjoy mountain
climbing, bike riding, swim
ming in fresh-water lakes or an
occasional walk through the
woods. They won't have to
worry about hurricanes,
floods, earthquakes or
droughts.
Doughnut
At first you may not be very
excited about living in an
enormous doughnut or a huge
concrete ball, but once you've
settled into your new house in
the sky, you'll hardly noticethe
shape of the space habitat it
self. The interior of the colony
will probably be designed to
make newcomers from earth
feel at home.
The gravity in the colony
would feel normal, as the en
tire habitat would be spinning
at a calculated rate. Sunlight

will enter the habitat through
windows and even be reflected
onto an artificial "sky."
You would live in a private
home or a spacious apartment.
You may have a garden if you
wish, because there will be a
thick layer of lunar soil bet
ween your feet and the shell of
the habitat.
Agriculture
Your food would be grown
in an'agricultural compartment
separated from the main
habitat. The temperature in the
agricultural areas can be kept
at a constant 95 degrees and
sunlight can pour in 24 hours a
day.
If all seeds are sterilized be
fore being brought from earth,
harmful insects may never exist
in space colonies. Livestock
can also be raised in the ag
ricultural sections.
In addition to homes, the
colonies will have schools,
hospitals, theatres, shops and
offices, even a football
stadium. Trees and plants will
be planted throughout the
colony. Rivers and lakes will be
easy to construct, and moun
tains can be built from lunar
ore.
If you're a surfer, your col
ony may have a climate similar
to that of Hawaii or southern
California. If skiing is your in
terest, you may choose to live
in a colony with a climate and
topography similar to that in
Switzerland. T he day/night
cycleinyourcoloi., ran also be
controlled.,
(Commute
You'll probably use a bicycle
to get to and from your job, if

you work within the colony.
Low-powered electric cars may
be used, but certainly no vehi
cles that would pollute the col
ony's environment. To com
mute to the industrial areas lo
cated outside the habitat, your
private space-car or rocket-bus
could be used.
Space vehicles are easily de
signed and built because such
crafts will not have to lift-off
from any planetary surfaces. In
the vacuum of space, a vehicle
set in motion will continue fly
ing indefinitely, so there will
be no gas-guzzlers.
Once manufacturing in
outer space is perfected, all

heavy and polluting industries
can be moved from the earth's
surface. Most industrial pro
cesses will proceed more easily
in the weightlessness of outer
space.
Meanwhile, earth's re
sources can be spared, and the
air, land, and water can be kept
clean. Our planet may some
day serve as a huge park for
space colonists to visit.
Employment
Many of the early space col
onists will be employed in the
manufacture of solar power
satellites, which will beam
energy down to earth. These
huge orbiting power stations,

which may be up to five miles
wide, will store the sun's
energy in tiny solar cells.
This energy will be con
verted into microwaves, which
will be directed toward receiv
ing stations on earth 24 hours £
day. The microwaves will be
continuously reconverted into
electrical power, to be stored
or used whenever needed.
Enough solar power to
satisfy the entire world's
energy needs can be beamed
to earth via solar power satel
lites by as early as theyear2oo4,
according to researchers. At
that point, profits from the
power satellites could be as
high as $8 billion per year.


Artists' conception of the interior of a space colony. While gravity along the habitat's equator would be
like that of earth's, areas near the "poles" of the sphere would have zero gravity, a coup for low-gravity
sports fans. (Note human-powered flying machine in upper left corner.)

would live cn the inner surface of the sphere. Rotation of the sphere

recreates a gravity comparable to Earth's. An energy processing
station sits atop the habitat.
