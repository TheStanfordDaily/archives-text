Stockton — The Stanford
soccer team ended its losing
streak in impressive style this
weekend, exploding for 15
goals in two days. The Cardi
nals traveled to the University
of the Pacific and beat the Ti
gers 8-0 on Saturday, while
triumphing 7-0 over Humboldt
State in yesterday's home ac
tion.
In stark contrast to the last
four games, in which Stan
ford's goals were either late in
the game or nonexistent,
Saturday's game began with a
quick score by Jon Hecht, with
an assist by Stephen Dietz.
The other first-half tallies for
the Cards were by Bill Allstetter
and Teddy Robinson to make
the score 3-0 at the break.
Hecht scored again, only seven
minutes into the second half.
Goals from Paul Kozachenko
(assisted by Hecht), Greg De-
Igado, Hecht again (earning
him a "hat trick") and Bill Hof
fenburg closed out the game.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge analyzing the game said,
"I think this game indicates
progress — as far as working
on switching the ball. A good
deal of our practice was shoot
ing and that paid off because
they (the players) didn't miss
too many."
Lodge explained that a main
reason for the win was that
"Stanford played a moving
game and their (UOP's) game
doesn't move — we exploited
their biggest problems."
In preparing the team for the
UOP game, Lodge said,
"Philosophically, I told the
team it's like starting a brand
new season. We learned quite
a bit from our mistakes."
UOP head coach Glenn
Richards said, "Stanford had a
far superior team. They were
running off the ball a hell of a
lot better than we were."
Freshman striker Dan
McNevin said of the victory,
"We know the system can
work now — just by controlling

the ball and passing to team
mates, play is more relaxed."
Junior Mark Triska added,
"The big answer, the reason
we won the game is because
we were utliizing space.
People tried to move into the
open space."
Fullback Allstetter said, "Af
ter six losses, it's very sweet.
After getting the first couple of
goals we weren't having to
fight from behind."
In yesterday's victory over
Humboldt State, Bill Hoffen
burg began the scoring with
y/i minutes to go in the first
half. In the second half, Stan
ford erupted with six goals by
Peter Phillips, Hecht, McNevin
on a penalty shot,

Kozachenko, Hoffenburg and
Kozachenko.
Commenting on the play
against Humboldt, Lodge said,
"We've been practicing really
hard. It looks like it's paying
off, especially with the switch
ing of the ball. There's no
doubt in my mind — any time
you can score 15 goals in two
games against anybody that
certainly shows that we're
doing something."
Lodge explained that a key to
the turnaround in the Card's
play is due to practices: "We're
getting into more scrimmage
situations and that alone is
helping us out."
The Cards' next match is
against Sonoma State on
Thursday at 2 p.m. on Stan
ford's Harry Maloney Field.

doubt in my mind — any time
you can score 15 goals in two
games against anybody that
certainly shows that we're
doing something."
Lodge explained that a key to
the turnaround in the Card's
play is due to practices: "We're
getting into more scrimmage
situations and that alone is
helping us out."
The Cards' next match is
against Sonoma State on
Thursday at 2 p.m. on Stan
ford's Harry Maloney Field.

Danny McNevin brings ball upfield in last week's loss to UCLA. The
booters fared better this weekend, however, beating UOP, 8-0 and
Humbolt State 7-0.
Stockton — The Stanford
soccer team ended its losing
streak in impressive style this
weekend, exploding for 15
goals in two days. The Cardi
nals traveled to the University
of the Pacific and beat the Ti
gers 8-0 on Saturday, while
triumphing 7-0 over Humboldt
State in yesterday's home ac
tion.
In stark contrast to the last
four games, in which Stan
ford's goals were either late in
the game or nonexistent,
Saturday's game began with a
quick score by Jon Hecht, with
an assist by Stephen Dietz.
The other first-half tallies for
the Cards were by Bill Allstetter
and Teddy Robinson to make
the score 3-0 at the break.
Hecht scored again, only seven
minutes into the second half.
Goals from Paul Kozachenko
(assisted by Hecht), Greg De-
Igado, Hecht again (earning
him a "hat trick") and Bill Hof
fenburg closed out the game.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge analyzing the game said,
"I think this game indicates
progress — as far as working
on switching the ball. A good
deal of our practice was shoot
ing and that paid off because
they (the players) didn't miss
too many."
Lodge explained that a main
reason for the win was that
"Stanford played a moving
game and their (UOP's) game
doesn't move — we exploited
their biggest problems."
In preparing the team for the
UOP game, Lodge said,
"Philosophically, I told the
team it's like starting a brand
new season. We learned quite
a bit from our mistakes."
UOP head coach Glenn
Richards said, "Stanford had a
far superior team. They were
running off the ball a hell of a
lot better than we were."
Freshman striker Dan
McNevin said of the victory,
"We know the system can
work now — just by controlling

the ball and passing to team
mates, play is more relaxed."
Junior Mark Triska added,
"The big answer, the reason
we won the game is because
we were utliizing space.
People tried to move into the
open space."
Fullback Allstetter said, "Af
ter six losses, it's very sweet.
After getting the first couple of
goals we weren't having to
fight from behind."
In yesterday's victory over
Humboldt State, Bill Hoffen
burg began the scoring with
y/i minutes to go in the first
half. In the second half, Stan
ford erupted with six goals by
Peter Phillips, Hecht, McNevin
on a penalty shot,

Kozachenko, Hoffenburg and
Kozachenko.
Commenting on the play
against Humboldt, Lodge said,
"We've been practicing really
hard. It looks like it's paying
off, especially with the switch
ing of the ball. There's no
doubt in my mind — any time
you can score 15 goals in two
games against anybody that
certainly shows that we're
doing something."
