# Says, 'I'm no hotdog'
## Lofton keys win with two grabs 
### David Georgette 
With 1:45 left to play Satur
day and UCLA leading 28-25, it
looked like for the second year
in a row an outplayed Bruin
football team was going to
come up with a victory over
Stanford.
But on a second-and-eight
play from the Stanford 33, Car
dinal quarterback Steve Dils
faked a dive play into the line,
dropped back and heaved the
ball deep down the right
sideline. Flanker James Lofton,
who already had three catches
for 59 yards, went up for the
ball sandwiched between two
Bruin defenders. When
6-foot-3 Lofton came back
down, he had the ball — and
Stanford had a chance.
"I knew I could catch it,"
said Lofton. "I had to slow
down a little. I knew what I had
to do — go straight up and turn
my body into the defenders. I
had a good shot at the ball."
Lofton denied the 40-yard
gain had been a desperation
play. "Desperation?" he re
sponded. "That's a regular part
of our offense."
"Lofton's catch was a great
individual effort and ypu need
thattowina highly competitive
game like this one," said Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh.
UCLA's disappointed head

coach Terry Donahue was un
derstandably less glowing in
his description of the catch.
"The deep safety went up, Levi
Armstrong went up for the ball,
and Lofton got it,"he said.
If the two Bruin defenders —
6-2 senior left cornerback
Armstrong and 6-3% freshman
safety Kenny Easley — felt frus
trated at Lofton's super catch
which put Stanford in scoring
position, two plays later they
must have despaired as Lofton
strutted across the goal line for
the winning touchdown.
"It was the short post," said
Lofton of the touchdown. "The
same kind of pattern we ran
against Tulane." Lofton caught
the ball on the 5-yard line near
the right hash mark, and then
got hit by Easley. Lofton spun
to his left, broke away from
Armstrong, and then raised the
ball above his head before he
crossed the goal line.
"See, they (the Bruins) don't
tackle, they just hit," com
mented Lofton about getting
away from Easley and
Armstrong.
"I was no hotdog," he added
about holding the ball in the
air. "I was happy. I knew I was
going to score."
For a while, Lofton must
have thought his playing time
for the day was over after Stan

ford had gone ahead 25-21 in
the third quarter.
"I got hit in the tailbone," he
explained about the limp he
displayed in the second half. "I
wasn't going to go back into
the game because we were
ahead. I only went back in be
cause we were losing."
Lofton finished with five
catches for 126 yards against
what he called "the best sec
ondary we have played all sea
son."
The Bruin pass defense had
difficulty, though, stopping

Lofton and split end Bill Kellar
(four receptions for 45 yards),
The two receivers caught a
lot of passes in the middle of
the UCLA defense. "They had
trouble with us, huh," said
Walsh.
"We moved the ball real
good," said Lofton. "They play
a zone coverage and their
safeties play real deep, so we
could find holes there. Instead
of going deep, I stopped in
front of them."
Except for one play.

The two receivers caught a
lot of passes in the middle of
the UCLA defense. "They had
trouble with us, huh," said
Walsh.
"We moved the ball real
good," said Lofton. "They play
a zone coverage and their
safeties play real deep, so we
could find holes there. Instead
of going deep, I stopped in
front of them."

Scintillating James Lofton runs with the ball in Stanford's opening
season loss to Colorado. Saturday against UCLA Lofton caught a
40-yard bomb in the waning seconds of the game, then grabbed a
Steve Dils pass on the 5-yardline, spun free and crossed the goal line
for the deciding touchdown.
With 1:45 left to play Satur
day and UCLA leading 28-25, it
looked like for the second year
in a row an outplayed Bruin
football team was going to
come up with a victory over
Stanford.
But on a second-and-eight
play from the Stanford 33, Car
dinal quarterback Steve Dils
faked a dive play into the line,
dropped back and heaved the
ball deep down the right
sideline. Flanker James Lofton,
who already had three catches
for 59 yards, went up for the
ball sandwiched between two
Bruin defenders. When
6-foot-3 Lofton came back
down, he had the ball — and
Stanford had a chance.
"I knew I could catch it,"
said Lofton. "I had to slow
down a little. I knew what I had
to do — go straight up and turn
my body into the defenders. I
had a good shot at the ball."
Lofton denied the 40-yard
gain had been a desperation
play. "Desperation?" he re
sponded. "That's a regular part
of our offense."
"Lofton's catch was a great
individual effort and ypu need
thattowina highly competitive
game like this one," said Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh.
UCLA's disappointed head

coach Terry Donahue was un
derstandably less glowing in
his description of the catch.
"The deep safety went up, Levi
Armstrong went up for the ball,
and Lofton got it,"he said.
If the two Bruin defenders —
6-2 senior left cornerback
Armstrong and 6-3% freshman
safety Kenny Easley — felt frus
trated at Lofton's super catch
which put Stanford in scoring
position, two plays later they
must have despaired as Lofton
strutted across the goal line for
the winning touchdown.
"It was the short post," said
Lofton of the touchdown. "The
same kind of pattern we ran
against Tulane." Lofton caught
the ball on the 5-yard line near
the right hash mark, and then
got hit by Easley. Lofton spun
to his left, broke away from
Armstrong, and then raised the
ball above his head before he
crossed the goal line.
"See, they (the Bruins) don't
tackle, they just hit," com
mented Lofton about getting
away from Easley and
Armstrong.
"I was no hotdog," he added
about holding the ball in the
air. "I was happy. I knew I was
going to score."
For a while, Lofton must
have thought his playing time
for the day was over after Stan

ford had gone ahead 25-21 in
the third quarter.
"I got hit in the tailbone," he
explained about the limp he
displayed in the second half. "I
wasn't going to go back into
the game because we were
ahead. I only went back in be
cause we were losing."
Lofton finished with five
catches for 126 yards against
what he called "the best sec
ondary we have played all sea
son."
The Bruin pass defense had
difficulty, though, stopping

Lofton and split end Bill Kellar
(four receptions for 45 yards),
The two receivers caught a
