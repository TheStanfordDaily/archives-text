# Law student interviews up
## 
### Kelly Raftery 
The number of employers con
ducting on-campus interviews of law
students here is up 8.5 per cent from
last year's figure, according to offi
cials in the Law School Placement Of
fice.
Some 331 employers from all parts
of the United States are now con
ducting interviews, said Law Place
ment Director Gloria Pyszka.
And last year's placement record
wasn't bad, either, according to
Pyszka. Some 75 per cent of the
members of the Law School's Class
of 1977 polled last June had job
commitments after graduation. Of
these jobs, 60 percent were obtained
through the Law Placement Office.
This trend is in contrast to the re
sults of a recent survey of California
lawyers admitted to the bar over the
last five years which showed that 70
per cent of the respondents were
dissatisfied with the placement ser
vices provided by their law schools.
Difficulties shown
In addition, the poll, conducted by
the California Young Lawyers As
sociation (CYLA), showed that 20 per
cent of young lawyers had "signific
ant difficulties in finding employ
ment as lawyers," according to in
coming CYLA President W. Toliver
Besson.
On the other hand, Pyszka said she
feels the Law School here is in a "very
good position in terms of quality of
graduates" and employers know it.
The Law School ranked third in the
nation behind Harvard and Yale in a
February 1976 survey conducted by
the UC-Berkeley Academic Senate.

On an average Friday afternoon
this time of year, the Law Placement
Office is crowded with law students
looking through lists of clerkships,
fellowships, government and public
interest opportunities, as well as stu
dents signing up for interviews or re
laxing after them.
Easier
Having employers interview stu
dents on campus is "a lot easier than
having to write all the law firms your
self," said George Drysdale, a

second-year law and business stu
dent. It beats "having to get to the
cities and beat on the doors," third
year siudent Lindell Van Dyke ag
reed.
To help alleviate unnecessary anx
iety in interviews, the office holds
videotaped mock interviews in
which students and volunteer Palo
Alto lawyers participate. Students
can watch their own interviews and
evaluate critically their performance,
noting potential improvement areas.


It didn't look good. Stanford stadium contained a horde of
high school kids staging a recycling drive, and the recording
engineer had proclaimed the place unfit for album-cutting
due to wind. Thus did the Leland Stanford |unior University
Marching Band begin its afternoon — all set to disc them
selves, but with nowhere to commit the act. The Band

director Dr. Arthur P. Barnes made a few phone calls and
the whole thing changed. Frost Ampitheater was opened.
The members took positions. Then they blew, pounded,
screamed and yeiled until material had been provided for
what may be the finest LSJUMB album to date. The album
will be released in December.
