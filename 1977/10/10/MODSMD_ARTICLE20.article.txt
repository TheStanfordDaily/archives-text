Cross country
The Stanford women's cross
country team turned in an im
pressive performance Saturday
to win the Aggie Invitational at
UC-Davis. Audrey Kemp and
Vivian Soderholm-Difatte, a
newcomer to the team, were
Stanford's top finishers at sixth
and seventh, finishing the
five-kilometer course in 19:28
and 19:37, respectively.
In the university men's divi
sion, Stanford took fourth in a
field of 11. Sophomore Bill
Haldeman was the top Cardinal
finisher, running the flat,
five-mile course in 24:48 for
sixth place, followed by
freshman Tom O'Neil at 17th in
25:08 and Harold Celms at 19th
in 25:10.
The men's individual winner
was Hal Shultz of California
who ran 24:14. The men's team
champion was Fresno State
with a low of 48 points, fol
lowed by California with 53,
Sacramento State with 80 and
Stanford with 105. UC-Davis

and Chico State finished sec
ond and third in the five-team
women's division.
Although last week's victory
in the Fresno State Invitational
suggested the women's poten
tial, Saturday's win was surpris
ingly decisive.
"The women are running
well as a team," said Stanford
coach Marshall Clark. "The
spread from our first finisher to
our fifth was only 28 seconds."
The meet was a good test for
some of the younger runners
on the men's team. Freshmen
Tom Lobsinger and Mark
Stillman, along with O'Neil,
were impressive. Lobsinger
ran 25:10 for 10th in the
college-open division, and
Stillman ran 25:49 for 33rd in
the university division.
Saturday at 10 a.m. the Car
dinals host the Stanford Invita
tional at the Stanford Golf
Course. Texas-El Paso, which
won the NCAA cross country

McDonald and Mike Boit.

Field hockey
The Stanford women's field
hockey team defeated the
Northern California Field Hoc
key Association, 2-0, in a
scrimmage Saturday afternoon
at Roble Field.
Card coach Barbara
Longstreth noted the NCFHA
was in the process of selecting
its team and hence used a
number of players in the game.
Nevertheless, Longstreth said
Stanford "put on an excellent
show against an adult team."
Kelly Westerwick and Mandy
Read scored the two Cardinal
goals.
Longstreth described the
team as "a very capable group
of women who are working
very hard. They do just what
you'd expect of Stanford stu
dents," said Longstreth. "If
you tell them something they
reach out and do it.
"The team began putting a

lot of things together Saturday
and they are getting some
self-confidence too," said
Longstreth, who doesn't want
to make any predictions on the
success of this year's team. She
would admit, however, "We're
really developing into a strong
team."

Cross country
The Stanford women's cross
country team turned in an im
pressive performance Saturday
to win the Aggie Invitational at
UC-Davis. Audrey Kemp and
Vivian Soderholm-Difatte, a
newcomer to the team, were
Stanford's top finishers at sixth
and seventh, finishing the
five-kilometer course in 19:28
and 19:37, respectively.
In the university men's divi
sion, Stanford took fourth in a
field of 11. Sophomore Bill
Haldeman was the top Cardinal
finisher, running the flat,
five-mile course in 24:48 for
sixth place, followed by
freshman Tom O'Neil at 17th in
25:08 and Harold Celms at 19th
in 25:10.
The men's individual winner
was Hal Shultz of California
who ran 24:14. The men's team
champion was Fresno State
with a low of 48 points, fol
lowed by California with 53,
Sacramento State with 80 and
Stanford with 105. UC-Davis

and Chico State finished sec
ond and third in the five-team
women's division.
Although last week's victory
in the Fresno State Invitational
suggested the women's poten
tial, Saturday's win was surpris
ingly decisive.
"The women are running
well as a team," said Stanford
coach Marshall Clark. "The
spread from our first finisher to
our fifth was only 28 seconds."
The meet was a good test for
some of the younger runners
on the men's team. Freshmen
Tom Lobsinger and Mark
Stillman, along with O'Neil,
were impressive. Lobsinger
ran 25:10 for 10th in the
college-open division, and
Stillman ran 25:49 for 33rd in
the university division.
Saturday at 10 a.m. the Car

Field hockey
The Stanford women's field
hockey team defeated the
Northern California Field Hoc

Card coach Barbara
Longstreth noted the NCFHA
was in the process of selecting
its team and hence used a
number of players in the game.
Nevertheless, Longstreth said
Stanford "put on an excellent
show against an adult team."
Kelly Westerwick and Mandy
Read scored the two Cardinal
goals.
Longstreth described the
team as "a very capable group
of women who are working
very hard. They do just what
you'd expect of Stanford stu
dents," said Longstreth. "If
you tell them something they
reach out and do it.
"The team began putting a

lot of things together Saturday
and they are getting some
self-confidence too," said
Longstreth, who doesn't want
to make any predictions on the
success of this year's team. She
would admit, however, "We're
really developing into a strong
team."
