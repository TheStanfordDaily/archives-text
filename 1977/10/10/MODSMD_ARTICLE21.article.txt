# Squeak by Long Beach, 10-6
## Water poloists blast UCLA 
### Brad Brockbank 
"This team is like six water
faucets," said Robby Arnold
about Stanford's water polo
team. "Even if you shut five of
them off, one is still going to
leak."
This weekend, Long Beach
State and UCLA both left Ar
nold leaking as the junior from
Downey scored three overtime
goals in a 10-6 victory over the
former Friday, then followed
with three more in a 7-2 drown
ing of the Bruins Saturday
morning.
"Arnold is really hot right
now," said Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti. "This is the
best I've seen him play this
year, including last summer."

Besides the three goals on
Friday, Arnold made a steal and
had two assists, one of which
led to a last-minute, game
tying goal.
With 1:40 left in the game,
the Long Beach 49ers scored to
take a 6-5 lead. The Cards, in
danger of losing their first
game in more than a year,
fought back.
With 14 seconds left, Arnold
took a pass in the hole and was
fouled. He quickly placed the
ball in front of a driving Tom
Angelo who flipped it past the
49er goalie to send the game
into overtime.
"It was mostly reflex,"
Angelo said of his shot. "Af
terward, everything went

blank. It took a minute to
realize what happened."
Once into the overtime
periods, the poloists began
playing with the intensity that
they lacked during the four
quarters of regular play, as they
shut the 49ers off completely.
In the first of the two three
minute overtime periods,
freshman goalie John Cansel
set the tone by, as Dettamanti
called it, "pulling a Dorst."
Reminiscent of Chris Dorst,
Stanford's All-America goalie
last year, Gansel left the goal
and swam out to intercept a
pass coming to the 49ers' hole
man.
"We've been working with
John all week on that," De
ttamanti said.
Gansel, who recorded 21
saves and three steals in the
two games, praised the team's
defense.
"It helps to have a good de
fensive team," he said. "No,
change that to a great defen
sive team."
Dettamanti emphasized that
everyone on the team was
doing a "great job on de
fense." In particular, he men
tioned Angelo and senior
Marty Davis who each had
three thefts over the weekend.
Dettamanti also com
mended Gansel by saying,
"He's the best goalie I've seen
this year and I've seen them all
at the NCAA tournament. He
(Gansel) is further along than
Dorst was as a freshman."
In contrast to the somewhat
uninspired four quarters
against Long Beach, De
ttamanti said he was pleased
with the team's play Saturday.

"It was a different Stanford
team against UCLA," he said.
The difference was im
mediately apparent. The Cards
came charging out during the
first half and by halftime the
poloists had the Bruins com
pletely shut down and held a
5-0 lead. In the third quarter,
the Cards' defense slipped a lit
tle and UCLA scored its only
two goals of the game.
Buckling down again in the
fourth period, Arnold and
sophomore Randy Kalbus each
scored a goal and the Bruin
machinery fell apart.
The game was a rough one.
Arnold was hit in the face at
one point and had to leave the
game.
"It wasn't just a physical
game," Angelo said. "They
(UCLA) are just a gross team.
They are really just sub
human."
The Cards are now 1-0 in
Pacific-8 play and have won 24
consecutive games.
Tomorrow, Stanford plays
the University of Pacific at de-
Guerre at 3:30 p.m. Friday the
team travels to Berkeley to take
on the Cal Bears in their first
Pac-8 season matchup.

Stanford's Robby Arnold shoots over a UCLA player in Saturday's 7-2 win over the Bruins. Arnold had an
outstanding weekend for the Cards, scoring three overtime goals in Friday's 10-6 win over Long Beach
State and three more in the victory over UCLA.
"This team is like six water
faucets," said Robby Arnold
about Stanford's water polo
team. "Even if you shut five of
them off, one is still going to
leak."
This weekend, Long Beach
State and UCLA both left Ar
nold leaking as the junior from
Downey scored three overtime
goals in a 10-6 victory over the
former Friday, then followed
with three more in a 7-2 drown
ing of the Bruins Saturday
morning.
"Arnold is really hot right
now," said Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti. "This is the
best I've seen him play this
year, including last summer."

Besides the three goals on
Friday, Arnold made a steal and
had two assists, one of which
led to a last-minute, game
tying goal.
With 1:40 left in the game,
the Long Beach 49ers scored to
take a 6-5 lead. The Cards, in
danger of losing their first
game in more than a year,
fought back.
With 14 seconds left, Arnold
took a pass in the hole and was
fouled. He quickly placed the
ball in front of a driving Tom
Angelo who flipped it past the
49er goalie to send the game
into overtime.
"It was mostly reflex,"
Angelo said of his shot. "Af
terward, everything went

blank. It took a minute to
realize what happened."
Once into the overtime
periods, the poloists began
playing with the intensity that
they lacked during the four
quarters of regular play, as they
shut the 49ers off completely.
In the first of the two three
minute overtime periods,
freshman goalie John Cansel
set the tone by, as Dettamanti
called it, "pulling a Dorst."
Reminiscent of Chris Dorst,
Stanford's All-America goalie
last year, Gansel left the goal
and swam out to intercept a
pass coming to the 49ers' hole
man.
"We've been working with
John all week on that," De
ttamanti said.
Gansel, who recorded 21
saves and three steals in the
two games, praised the team's
defense.
"It helps to have a good de
fensive team," he said. "No,
change that to a great defen
sive team."
Dettamanti emphasized that
everyone on the team was
doing a "great job on de
fense." In particular, he men
tioned Angelo and senior
Marty Davis who each had
three thefts over the weekend.
Dettamanti also com
mended Gansel by saying,
"He's the best goalie I've seen
this year and I've seen them all
at the NCAA tournament. He
(Gansel) is further along than
Dorst was as a freshman."
In contrast to the somewhat
uninspired four quarters
against Long Beach, De
ttamanti said he was pleased
with the team's play Saturday.

"It was a different Stanford
team against UCLA," he said.
The difference was im
mediately apparent. The Cards
came charging out during the
first half and by halftime the
poloists had the Bruins com
pletely shut down and held a
5-0 lead. In the third quarter,
the Cards' defense slipped a lit
tle and UCLA scored its only
two goals of the game.
Buckling down again in the
fourth period, Arnold and
sophomore Randy Kalbus each
scored a goal and the Bruin
machinery fell apart.
The game was a rough one.
Arnold was hit in the face at
one point and had to leave the
game.
"It wasn't just a physical
game," Angelo said. "They
(UCLA) are just a gross team.
They are really just sub
human."
The Cards are now 1-0 in
Pacific-8 play and have won 24
consecutive games.
Tomorrow, Stanford plays
the University of Pacific at de-
Guerre at 3:30 p.m. Friday the
team travels to Berkeley to take
on the Cal Bears in their first
Pac-8 season matchup.
