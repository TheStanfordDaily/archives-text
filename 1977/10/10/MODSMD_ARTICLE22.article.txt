India jolted after Gandhi's arrest
New Delhi, India — India's new government is
trying to repair the political damage and fix the
blame for the blunders surrounding former Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's arrest ana quick release
on corruption charges.
Gandhi, after only 16 hours in custody last week,
has resumed with new confidence and aggres
siveness her speeches and taunts against the ad
ministration of Prime Minister Morarji Desai, her
successor.
She appears to have turned her arrest and re
lease into a political gain both against the govern
ment and critics within her Congress party, many
of whom have rallied back to her support.
Many Indians are saying Desai's government has
itself to blame, by mistiming the sensitive decision
to prosecute a former prime minister, followed by
mishandling of the arrest. Newspapers accuse the
government of bungling the case at every step.
The government is being criticized for bringing
Gandhi to the magistrate's court without record
ing any of the evidence it said was available. And
the High Court delayed admission of its appeal
because somebody forgot to paste revenue
stamps on the petition to cover court costs.
On a trip to Lucknow to drum up public support,
Charan Singh, Desai's home minister, asked party
workers to dispel the idea that Gandhi was freed
because there was no case against her. Her release
was ordered on technical grounds, he said, and
she will be arrested again, because the charges are
well-established.
ERA deadline may move back
Washington — The Justice Department is prepar
ing an opinion on whether Congress can extend
the 7-year deadline set in 1972 for states to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Atty. Gen.
Griffin Bell said yesterday.
Bell said he knew of no precedent for an exten
sion. But he said the White House counsel, who
asked for the opinion, had suggested there was an
indirect precedent for it.
Thirty-five states have ratified the ERA and three
more must do so by March 22, 1979, for the
amendment to become part of the Constitution.
But worried about meeting that deadline, some
female members of Congress and White House
backers of the ERA are seeking the extension, a
move President |immy Carter reportedly is pre
pared to support.
"He is committed to the ERA and will do any
thing to make sure it will pass," Judy Carter, the

president's daughter-in-law, said in a weekend in
terview.
Carter plans reorganizations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is ex
pected to propose this week creation of a new
agency that would swallow up the U.S. Informa
tion Agency (USIA) and guarantee that Voice of
America policy pronouncements be clearly
labeled, much like paid commercials.
Carter, about to send Congress his second gov
ernment reorganization plan, wants to replace
USIA, an offspring of the Cold War, with a new
agency that also would take charge of cultural and
educational exchange programs now adminis
tered by the State Department.
Reorganization plans take effect automatically
unless disapproved within 60 days by either the
Senate or House.
Carter's first such plan, to reorganize the Execu
tive Office of the president, is expected to clear
the 60-day hurdle within the next two weeks.
Reorganizers also have told Carter, who is under
pressure to produce a comprehensive policy for
dealing with urban ills, that they are beginning to
consider the wisdom of proposing a new Cabinet
level Department of Economic Development to
work with communities and other local govern
ment units.
Conferees feud on human rights
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — The 35-nation East-West
conference moves into closed session this week
with the Communists resisting a U.S. proposal for
separate discussions of human rights, military and
economic issues.
The dispute developed after an opening week of
public speeches in which the United States, its
European allies and some neutral countries at
tacked Communist failures to live up to human
rights pledges made at the 1975 Helsinki Confer
ence on European Security and Cooperation.
The Soviet Union rejected the charges as inter
ference in its internal affairs. It said detente could
be improved by concentrating on military issues,
such as a treaty banning first use of atomic
weapons or an agreement not to enlarge military
alliances.
Western delegates at this conference, called to
review the Helsinki accords, argued that the Soviet
proposals are issues for other forums.
Senate may curb child porn
Washington — The Senate this week takes up a

bill to curb child pornography and the House,
facing a heavy calendar, is heading for another
joust with President Jimmy Carter over the na
tion's nuclear breeder reactor project.
Meanwhile, the president's energy program sits
like a smoking hulk on the Senate sidelines while
the Finance Committee tries to find a replacement
for his recommended package of oil and natural
gas taxes.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, con
tinuing hearings on the Panama Canal treaty, is
calling 34 witnesses, with former secretaries of
state Henry Kissinger and Dean Rusk expected to
testify toward the end of the week.
Senate Judiciary Committee members open
hearings on Thursday on Carter's nomination of
U.S. District Judge Frank Johnson Jr. ot Alabama to
head the FBI.
The Senate pornography bill is designed to
allow federal action against the sexual exploitation
of children. The measure would make it a federal
crime to use children younger than 16 in the pro
duction of pornographic materials or to transport
a child across state lines for prostitution. Penalties
would range up to a $15,000 fine and 15 years in
prison.
On the subject of the nuclear breeder reactor
program. Carter had urged Congress to scrap the
project at Clinch River, Tenn., but a conference
committee wants to keep the project roughly on
schedule without starting construction.

India jolted after Gandhi's arrest
New Delhi, India — India's new government is
trying to repair the political damage and fix the
blame for the blunders surrounding former Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's arrest ana quick release
on corruption charges.
Gandhi, after only 16 hours in custody last week,
has resumed with new confidence and aggres
siveness her speeches and taunts against the ad
ministration of Prime Minister Morarji Desai, her
successor.
She appears to have turned her arrest and re
lease into a political gain both against the govern
ment and critics within her Congress party, many
of whom have rallied back to her support.
Many Indians are saying Desai's government has
itself to blame, by mistiming the sensitive decision
to prosecute a former prime minister, followed by
mishandling of the arrest. Newspapers accuse the
government of bungling the case at every step.
The government is being criticized for bringing
Gandhi to the magistrate's court without record
ing any of the evidence it said was available. And
the High Court delayed admission of its appeal
because somebody forgot to paste revenue
stamps on the petition to cover court costs.
On a trip to Lucknow to drum up public support,
Charan Singh, Desai's home minister, asked party
workers to dispel the idea that Gandhi was freed
because there was no case against her. Her release
was ordered on technical grounds, he said, and
she will be arrested again, because the charges are
well-established.
ERA deadline may move back
Washington — The Justice Department is prepar
ing an opinion on whether Congress can extend
the 7-year deadline set in 1972 for states to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Atty. Gen.
Griffin Bell said yesterday.
Bell said he knew of no precedent for an exten
sion. But he said the White House counsel, who
asked for the opinion, had suggested there was an
indirect precedent for it.
Thirty-five states have ratified the ERA and three
more must do so by March 22, 1979, for the
amendment to become part of the Constitution.
But worried about meeting that deadline, some
female members of Congress and White House
backers of the ERA are seeking the extension, a
move President |immy Carter reportedly is pre
pared to support.
"He is committed to the ERA and will do any
thing to make sure it will pass," Judy Carter, the

president's daughter-in-law, said in a weekend in
terview.
Carter plans reorganizations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is ex
pected to propose this week creation of a new
agency that would swallow up the U.S. Informa
tion Agency (USIA) and guarantee that Voice of
America policy pronouncements be clearly
labeled, much like paid commercials.
Carter, about to send Congress his second gov
ernment reorganization plan, wants to replace
USIA, an offspring of the Cold War, with a new
agency that also would take charge of cultural and
educational exchange programs now adminis
tered by the State Department.
Reorganization plans take effect automatically
unless disapproved within 60 days by either the
Senate or House.
Carter's first such plan, to reorganize the Execu
tive Office of the president, is expected to clear
the 60-day hurdle within the next two weeks.
Reorganizers also have told Carter, who is under
pressure to produce a comprehensive policy for
dealing with urban ills, that they are beginning to
consider the wisdom of proposing a new Cabinet
level Department of Economic Development to
work with communities and other local govern
ment units.
Conferees feud on human rights
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — The 35-nation East-West
conference moves into closed session this week
with the Communists resisting a U.S. proposal for
separate discussions of human rights, military and
economic issues.
The dispute developed after an opening week of
public speeches in which the United States, its
European allies and some neutral countries at
tacked Communist failures to live up to human
rights pledges made at the 1975 Helsinki Confer
ence on European Security and Cooperation.
The Soviet Union rejected the charges as inter
ference in its internal affairs. It said detente could
be improved by concentrating on military issues,
such as a treaty banning first use of atomic
weapons or an agreement not to enlarge military
alliances.
Western delegates at this conference, called to
review the Helsinki accords, argued that the Soviet
proposals are issues for other forums.
Senate may curb child porn
Washington — The Senate this week takes up a

bill to curb child pornography and the House,
facing a heavy calendar, is heading for another
joust with President Jimmy Carter over the na
tion's nuclear breeder reactor project.
Meanwhile, the president's energy program sits
like a smoking hulk on the Senate sidelines while
the Finance Committee tries to find a replacement
for his recommended package of oil and natural
gas taxes.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, con
tinuing hearings on the Panama Canal treaty, is
calling 34 witnesses, with former secretaries of
state Henry Kissinger and Dean Rusk expected to
testify toward the end of the week.
Senate Judiciary Committee members open
hearings on Thursday on Carter's nomination of
U.S. District Judge Frank Johnson Jr. ot Alabama to
head the FBI.
The Senate pornography bill is designed to
allow federal action against the sexual exploitation
of children. The measure would make it a federal
crime to use children younger than 16 in the pro
duction of pornographic materials or to transport
a child across state lines for prostitution. Penalties
would range up to a $15,000 fine and 15 years in
prison.
On the subject of the nuclear breeder reactor
program. Carter had urged Congress to scrap the
project at Clinch River, Tenn., but a conference
committee wants to keep the project roughly on
schedule without starting construction.

India jolted after Gandhi's arrest
New Delhi, India — India's new government is
trying to repair the political damage and fix the
blame for the blunders surrounding former Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's arrest ana quick release
on corruption charges.
Gandhi, after only 16 hours in custody last week,
has resumed with new confidence and aggres
siveness her speeches and taunts against the ad
ministration of Prime Minister Morarji Desai, her
successor.
She appears to have turned her arrest and re
lease into a political gain both against the govern
ment and critics within her Congress party, many
of whom have rallied back to her support.
Many Indians are saying Desai's government has
itself to blame, by mistiming the sensitive decision
to prosecute a former prime minister, followed by
mishandling of the arrest. Newspapers accuse the
government of bungling the case at every step.
The government is being criticized for bringing
Gandhi to the magistrate's court without record
ing any of the evidence it said was available. And
the High Court delayed admission of its appeal
because somebody forgot to paste revenue
stamps on the petition to cover court costs.
On a trip to Lucknow to drum up public support,
Charan Singh, Desai's home minister, asked party
workers to dispel the idea that Gandhi was freed
because there was no case against her. Her release
was ordered on technical grounds, he said, and
she will be arrested again, because the charges are
well-established.
ERA deadline may move back
Washington — The Justice Department is prepar
ing an opinion on whether Congress can extend
the 7-year deadline set in 1972 for states to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Atty. Gen.
Griffin Bell said yesterday.
Bell said he knew of no precedent for an exten
sion. But he said the White House counsel, who
asked for the opinion, had suggested there was an
indirect precedent for it.
Thirty-five states have ratified the ERA and three
more must do so by March 22, 1979, for the
amendment to become part of the Constitution.
But worried about meeting that deadline, some
female members of Congress and White House
backers of the ERA are seeking the extension, a
move President |immy Carter reportedly is pre
pared to support.
"He is committed to the ERA and will do any
thing to make sure it will pass," Judy Carter, the

president's daughter-in-law, said in a weekend in
terview.
Carter plans reorganizations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is ex
pected to propose this week creation of a new
agency that would swallow up the U.S. Informa
tion Agency (USIA) and guarantee that Voice of
America policy pronouncements be clearly
labeled, much like paid commercials.
Carter, about to send Congress his second gov
ernment reorganization plan, wants to replace
USIA, an offspring of the Cold War, with a new
agency that also would take charge of cultural and
educational exchange programs now adminis
tered by the State Department.
Reorganization plans take effect automatically
unless disapproved within 60 days by either the
Senate or House.
Carter's first such plan, to reorganize the Execu
tive Office of the president, is expected to clear
the 60-day hurdle within the next two weeks.
Reorganizers also have told Carter, who is under
pressure to produce a comprehensive policy for
dealing with urban ills, that they are beginning to
consider the wisdom of proposing a new Cabinet
level Department of Economic Development to
work with communities and other local govern
ment units.
Conferees feud on human rights
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — The 35-nation East-West
conference moves into closed session this week
with the Communists resisting a U.S. proposal for
separate discussions of human rights, military and
economic issues.
The dispute developed after an opening week of
public speeches in which the United States, its
European allies and some neutral countries at
tacked Communist failures to live up to human
rights pledges made at the 1975 Helsinki Confer
ence on European Security and Cooperation.
The Soviet Union rejected the charges as inter
ference in its internal affairs. It said detente could
be improved by concentrating on military issues,
such as a treaty banning first use of atomic
weapons or an agreement not to enlarge military
alliances.
Western delegates at this conference, called to
review the Helsinki accords, argued that the Soviet
proposals are issues for other forums.
Senate may curb child porn
Washington — The Senate this week takes up a

Meanwhile, the president's energy program sits
like a smoking hulk on the Senate sidelines while
the Finance Committee tries to find a replacement
for his recommended package of oil and natural
gas taxes.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, con
tinuing hearings on the Panama Canal treaty, is
calling 34 witnesses, with former secretaries of
state Henry Kissinger and Dean Rusk expected to
testify toward the end of the week.
