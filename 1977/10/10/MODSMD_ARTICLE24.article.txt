Pamphlet printing error
One halt of the 6000 ASSU election
pamphlets intended for distribution
yesterday were misprinted, accord
ing to Steve Westly, member of the
Council of Presidents.
The mistake was discovered yes
terday morning after approximately
100 of the pamphlets had already
been distributed, Westly said.
Those pamphlets that were not
misprinted were distributed to un
dergraduate residences yesterday,
he said.
The printers were immediately
notified of the error and new pam

phlets were printed last night to be
distributed to "as many graduate
students as possible" today, Westly
said.
Apparently a random page from a
1973 issue of Campus Report had
been inadvertently substituted for
one of the pamphlet's pages, he said.
