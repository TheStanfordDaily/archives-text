# Prof says U.S. aided Thai repression

The United States has found Thailand "the perfect
country for experimentation" with violent counterin
surgency techniques for over 25 years, according to
Thomas Lobe, professor of international relations at the
University of South Dakota.
The United States provided "an inordinate amount of
assistance" in the creation of the Thai military govern
ment's "violent and informal groups of veterans, police
and thugs," Lobe told an overflowing crowd in the
Meyer Library's Forum Room Friday night.
Vet "people leave the room" when current American
entanglements in Southeast Asia are brought up, he
said.
Invited to speak by the Stanford Committee of Con
cerned Asian Scholars, Lobe described the Thai "ter
rorist police" force as "a child the U.S. brought up,"
citing "consistent and careful" CIA, Pentagon and Of
fice of Public Safety direction of Thailand's right-wing
thought and military programs.
The three organizations "literally tripped over each
other" to create, staff and arm Thai security groups, he
said.
Lobe, after visiting Thailand in 1972, said he found
corruption in Thai national and local politics "abso

lute'ly, totally pervasive." He said the police forces with
which most Thai villagers deal "create local thiefdoms
. . . in cahoots with every form of local crime."
Concurring with a study made by Ben Anderson of
Cornell University, Lobe said he found murder, torture,
arbitrary arrests and kidnappings "typically administra
tive in character" and said most high-level Thai officials
stood "neck deep in opium and heroin trade."
Lobe alleged that 3400 people have been arrested and
over one million books burned since 1976 by a regime
claiming "Buddhism endorses the killing of Com
munists."
He predicted the "sickening" condition of a Un
supported Thailand would deteriorate in one of two
ways.
He said the nation would either face "full-fledged civil
war" due to growing left-wing insurgency, or a growing
autonomy of right wing terrorist groups resulting in a
"right wing anarchy" similar to Chile or Argentina.
He also praised those arrested at the May 10 Old
Union sit-in here for fulfilling the American "obligation"
to bring a halt to economic and military involvement in
foreign internal affairs, particularly in socially repressive
but profitable regimes.
