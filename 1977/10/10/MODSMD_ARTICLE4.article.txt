# U.S., Panama quit squabbling over U.S. intervention issue
## 
### 
Panama City (AP) — The United
States and Panama apparently have
agreed to stop squabbling in public
on the most controversial aspect of
the new Panama Canal treaties — the
question of U.S. intervention.
The two governments seem com
fo.'iable with a two-pronged answer.
Yes, the United States has the right to
defend the waterway's neutrality.
No, it can not interfere in Panama's
internal affairs.
Evidence that such an agreement
had been reached surfaced Friday
night when Romulo Escobar Bethan
court, Panama's chief treaty
negotiator, addressed a lawyers'
meeting here in a speech aired
nationwide.
"Intervention has been discussed
to the point of saturation," he said.
"Nowhere does it appear that there
is a special right for the United States
to intervene in the internal affairs of
our country."
In an interview with the French

newsmagazine L'Express, Panama
nian leader Gen. Omar Torrijos said
the question of intervention is "not
clearly defined." He said the way the
pact was written, it could "serve as
the legal instrument for those temp
ted to intervene militarily. I person
ally only give it moral value," he ad
ded.
The question of whether the new
treaties give the United States the
right to intervene in Panama to pro
tect the new canal surfaced in U.S.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearings last week.
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) released a
confidential cable from the U.S. Em
bassy in Panama in which Panama
nian treaty negotiator Carlos Lopez
Cuevera warned the United States
against using the term "interven
tion" to describe American rights
under the treaties.
Dole told the Committee he be
lieved the cable proves the Panama
nian government does not accept the
U.S. interpretation that America has
the right to decide on its own if milit
ary action is necessary to defend the
canal.
Contradiction
This, Dole said, would contradict
what Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and U.S. negotiators Ellsworth
Bunker and Sol Linowitz had led
senators to believe in testimony be
fore the committee.
But the U.S. State Department re
plied that the U.S. interpretation "is
accurate" and that under the
treaties, the United States retains the
right to protect the canal's neutrality
against an outside threat.
The State Department added, the
pact "does not give the United States
any right to intervene in the internal
affairs of Panama, nor has it been our
intention to seek or to exercise such
a right."
Sen. Frank Church (D-ldaho) said
U.S. spokesmen who testified before
the panel recently "exaggerated
what the actual wording of the
treaties did for the United States."
Visit the canal
In an interview on CBS-TV's "Face
the Nation," Church said he and
other foreign relations committee
members should visit the canal dur
ing Congress' year-end recess to get
"a first-hand view of its defenses" as
well as a feel for the political climate
in Panama and other countries in the
Caribbean.
Escobar strongly endorsed Friday
the State Department letter to the
Foreign Relations Committee, and
his speech gave no hint of disagree
ment between the two countries.
Political observers here inter
preted that to mean the two execu
tive branches have worked out a
common position to present to the
U.S. Senate, which must ratify the
controversial canal treaties.
Panamanian voters will decide on the
pact Oct. 23 in a national referen
dum.
Radio interview
Lopez Cuevera, the Panamanian
whose cable was quoted by Dole,

said in a radio interview last week:
"To be frank, they (the United States)
do not need that neutrality pact to
tell them whether or not they may
intervene.
"They need it to show their Con
gress, in order to be able to tell their
Congress, 'Look, we are turning the
canal over to those Panamanians, but
we still have the right to watch over
them so they behave.' "
The agreement is actually two
treaties. One covers a transition
period to the year 2000 when full con
trol of the 10-mile-wide Canal Zone
would pass to the Panamanian re
public. The second declares a per
manent neutrality for the zone, en
forced by a U.S.-Panama alliance.
While the Carter Administration
tries to convince the Senate that the
treaties protect the best interests of
the United States, the Panamanian
government is telling its citizens
their longtime dream of "complete
liberation" is coming true.
The Panamanian government's
basic message in its promotion cam
paign is that the Panama Canal
treaties get the Americans out by the
turn of the century, and the separate
neutrality pact guarantees they won't
come back
