Educating the Stanford community
on the Bakke issue, working with
Nairobi School in East Palo Alto and
joining in the efforts of other campus
organizations are the major plans for
the new NAACP chapter here.
Organized last May and chartered
over the summer, the organization
plans to make use of information
from NAACP attorneys working on
the Bakke case, according to chapter
President Diane Burbie.
Burbie also said she hopes to
"bridge the gap between black Stan
ford students and the East Palo Alto
area" by providing tutors and help
ing to maintain the Nairobi School, a
private nursery and grade school in
East Palo Alto. She said she hopes to
bring Nairobi students to campus
cultural events as well.
The Black Students Union, the
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy, and MEChA,
the chicano students' organization,
will be among the groups receiving
help from the NAACP chapter.
According to Burbie, the reasons
for organizing a campus NAACP
chapter were twofold: the hope for
"the support and prestige" of a na
tional organization like the NAACP
on campus issues such as the in
vestment controversy; and a new wil
lingness to get involved inspired by
lulian Bond's speech on campus last
spring.
