## For ASSU Senate: 
### 
This Wednesday and Thursday students will vote on
candidates for the ASSU Senate, which will be composed
of 10 undergraduates and 10 graduate students. Before
making the following endorsements we wish to call two
matters to the attention of students.
First, this year's candidates are similar to those who
have run in the past few years. There are those candidates
who say they represent special interest groups, and those
who say they don't represent any specific group; there are
those who believe the senate should be a forum for stu
dents' opinions, and those who think it should represent
the students; and finally, there are those who would like
to see the senate just advocate positions for students, and
those who would rather see the senate oversee service
programs for students.
Thus, in some ways this year's senate will certainly re
semble previous senates. We have endorsed candidates
we believe to be qualified and sincere, and so even
though this year's senate may not turn out to be what it
should, it may be better than it has in the past.
Secondly, we do not feel qualified to discuss the merits
of candidates who did not appear before us, and thus we
have chosen candidates only from those whom we inter
viewed.
These endorsements are not listed in order of prefer
ence:
Undergraduates
Thomas Faletti — shows a deep-founded concern with
academic issues, and appears dedicated to his clear ideas
and goals.
Charles Pacheco is diligent and earnest, and is particularly
interested in the administration of the Overseas Studies
Program.
Janet Rappaport has experience from working last year as
an ASSU committee staff assistant, and yet is still open
minded and sincere.
David Parker is the Course Project Manager and is well
informed and hard working. Last year's senate failed,
however, to set Parker's official salary, and so this will
have to be done this autumn. If Parker is elected, we hope
he will avoid any conflict of interest in this area.
Jill Liscom is a Daily reporter who covered the ASSU Se
nate last year. She has experience, competency and un
derstanding in dealing with the senate. If elected, the
Daily will adhere to its longstanding policy not to allow
ASSU officials and employes to be news reporters for the
Daily.
Tom McCormack is one candidate whom we unanimously
and wholeheartedly endorse. McCormack is thoughtful,
informed and experienced — certainly the most impres
sive of all the candidates whom we interviewed.
Dan Livingston is very experienced with the senate, and
did a fine job as chairman of the Senate Finance Commit
tee last year. However, we hope that this year he will
improve his ability to compromise and will also be more
open to campus views.
Graduates
Doug Bandow has experience with the senate and is con
scientious. He also has worked for the Stanford Arena.
Jon Sigler has been a graduate student here for two weeks,
and already he apparently knows more about the senate
than any other graduate candidate except Bandow. He
should bring diligence to the senate's actions.
George Drysdale has experience in undergraduate com
mittees, and will be another new face for the senate.

Graduates
Doug Bandow has experience with the senate and is con
scientious. He also has worked for the Stanford Arena.
Jon Sigler has been a graduate student here for two weeks,
and already he apparently knows more about the senate
than any other graduate candidate except Bandow. He
should bring diligence to the senate's actions.
George Drysdale has experience in undergraduate com
mittees, and will be another new face for the senate.
This Wednesday and Thursday students will vote on
candidates for the ASSU Senate, which will be composed
of 10 undergraduates and 10 graduate students. Before
making the following endorsements we wish to call two
matters to the attention of students.
First, this year's candidates are similar to those who
have run in the past few years. There are those candidates
who say they represent special interest groups, and those
who say they don't represent any specific group; there are
those who believe the senate should be a forum for stu
dents' opinions, and those who think it should represent
the students; and finally, there are those who would like
to see the senate just advocate positions for students, and
those who would rather see the senate oversee service
programs for students.
Thus, in some ways this year's senate will certainly re
semble previous senates. We have endorsed candidates
we believe to be qualified and sincere, and so even
though this year's senate may not turn out to be what it
should, it may be better than it has in the past.
Secondly, we do not feel qualified to discuss the merits
of candidates who did not appear before us, and thus we
have chosen candidates only from those whom we inter
viewed.
These endorsements are not listed in order of prefer
ence:
Undergraduates
Thomas Faletti — shows a deep-founded concern with
academic issues, and appears dedicated to his clear ideas
and goals.
Charles Pacheco is diligent and earnest, and is particularly
interested in the administration of the Overseas Studies
Program.
Janet Rappaport has experience from working last year as
an ASSU committee staff assistant, and yet is still open
minded and sincere.
David Parker is the Course Project Manager and is well
informed and hard working. Last year's senate failed,
however, to set Parker's official salary, and so this will
have to be done this autumn. If Parker is elected, we hope
he will avoid any conflict of interest in this area.
Jill Liscom is a Daily reporter who covered the ASSU Se
nate last year. She has experience, competency and un
derstanding in dealing with the senate. If elected, the
Daily will adhere to its longstanding policy not to allow
ASSU officials and employes to be news reporters for the
Daily.
Tom McCormack is one candidate whom we unanimously
and wholeheartedly endorse. McCormack is thoughtful,
informed and experienced — certainly the most impres
sive of all the candidates whom we interviewed.
Dan Livingston is very experienced with the senate, and
did a fine job as chairman of the Senate Finance Commit
tee last year. However, we hope that this year he will
improve his ability to compromise and will also be more
open to campus views.
