# Steve Buckley, Lori Hunter, Peter Joost
## 
### 
As a slate, we believe that we
offer a unique blend of experience
and enthusiasm. Steve Buckley, a
'76-'77 ASSU Senator, provides some
much-needed continuity. Lori
Hunter and Peter Joost, who have
both participated in a wide range of
activities here, also bring some new
ideas and energy to spark the '77 se
nate. We've decided to spend our
collegiate efforts in two directions:
Election reform: You've all by now
encountered the flyers and door
knocking which accompany each
year's senate election. Forty-three
candidates can very nearly inundate
the campus, wasting both time and
paper. We'd like to rationalize the
voting process through a system of
residential voting districts (for exam
ple, BrannerandToyon might consti
tute one district).
In such a system, students would
need to evaluate only a relatively few
candidates, rather than the 40-70
under the present voting process.
Making voting easier and more

reasonable would pave the way to
ward a better senate.
Student lobby: Although Stanford
harbors many would-be political
types, the students do little as a col
lective body to enter the policy de
bate over state legislation. We feel a
student lobby based in Sacramento
could have a discernable and valu
able impact.
Through persuasive information
transfer, student lobbyists could in
form legislators on the student
perspective on such issues as scho
larship monies (Cal-State) and drink
ing age stipulations. While Stanford
might not storm the capital, a lobby
program would go far in educating
the often harried members of the
state legislature.
The above represent our focal
points. We do not mean to exclude
other valid issues; the '77 senate
will treat many topics throughout the
course of the year. However, ac
complishment requires concentra
tion.
Please vote Wednesday and
Thursday. Consider Buckley/
Hunter/Joost as a serious alternative.
