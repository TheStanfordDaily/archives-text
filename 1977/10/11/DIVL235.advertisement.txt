How to convince
Mom and Dad to buy you
a pre-paid Trailways ticket home
Check boxes, clip out, mail to parents.

Dear Mom and Dad,
Things are swell here at college except, of course, the
food, which is so bad that I'm □ down to 91 lbs. □ living on
salted water □ sending samples to the biology lab □ hoping
you'll buy me a prepaid Trailways ticket home to get a decent
meal.
I sure could go for some of Mom's good ol' □ apple pie
□ Riz de Veau ala Financiere □ blood transfusions □ Trail
ways tickets paid for at your local station and picked up at
mine.
Dad, next time we get together, I want to tell you
□ about my part-time job □ how I suddenly realized what a
truly wise and magnanimous fellow you are □ where I left
your car last New Year's Eve □ thanks for making this trip
possible with a prepaid Trailways ticket.
I also need some advice on □ a personal matter □ my
backhand □ where one can hire decent servants these days
□ how to separate you from a few bucks for a prepaid Trail
ways ticket.
Got to sign off now and go □ to class □ to pieces
□ drop three or four courses □ to the Trailways station to
see if anyone sent me a prepaid ticket to get out of here for
the weekend.
Love,
P. S..Just go to the Trailways station and pay for my ticket, tell
them who it's for and where I am. I pick the ticket up here
when I go to catch the bus.
