# Board plans to study possible remedies for UGLY ventilation, acoustical woes

Ventilation and acoustical prob
lems are inherent in the design of
Meyer Library, according to Gene
Kershner, assistant director of plan
ning.
A board of architects, engineers
and University officials has been
formed to examine possible re
medies for these problems, Kershner
said.
Poor air circulation is causing
overheating in some parts of the
building and cold spells in others.
Regarding immediate overheating,
Utilities Manager Robert McKnight
explained that a temperature of 78
degrees is the specified level for
Meyer.
"If the temperature is more than
that, we need to do something. But
energy and energy cost are big prob
lems we must be aware of,"
McKnight said.
During the first few weeks of
school, overheating was a result of
systems running on summer
schedules, during which Meyer
closed at 10 p.m., according to
McKnight.
"We're now back in jive with au
tumn scheduling," McKnight said.
Chilled water
Although a new cold water storage
tank to store chilled water for air
conditioning purposes was installed
last year, the intent of this system was

not to improve Meyer's overheating
problems but to improve the cost ef
ficiency of campus air ventilation in
general, according to McKnight.
"Meyer is just a lousy building. If
you put in all the brute cooling you
had it would still never work satisfac
torily. Keeping the entire building at
equal levels of temperature is just
impossible," McKnight said.
At present, Plant Services is main
taining a 78 degree mark in Meyer,
according to McKnight, but tempera
tures in the 80s have been regularly
noticed on Meyer thermostats.
Students continue to complain
about the temperature.
"It's like a sauna in here, but Main
closes at 10 p.m. so Meyer's the only
library to go to. I may have to come
decked in a bikini the next time I'm
here," one student remarked.
Drop of a pin
Meyer also has acoustics problems
which will be critically examined by
architects and others during the
study, Kershner said.
"The ventilation is so quiet that
you can hear anything from a sneeze
to the drop of a pin. In most build
ings the ambient noise level from air
and air ducts prohibits such small
sounds from reverberating over the
library," Kershner said.
"But in Meyer the ventilation
comes through the ceilings in tiny
performations," Kershner added.

"Air is then sucked back into ducts
near the light well which extends
from the second floor up to the top
of the building. This creates a system
which is too quiet. Everyone hears
everything."
This problem, too, has proven a
distraction to students.
"The other night, Wednesday at 10
p.m., when the freshmen left for
their study breaks, Icould hear about
five different conversations going on
on the second floor. I was in the back
part of the fourth. It's like my high
school student lounge," one student
said.
Skits and horses
A third problem of student skits
and disturbances is being examined.
Students have, in the past, taken ad
vantage of the stairwell design and
the balcony overlook, performing
skits and riding horses up the stairs,
Kershner said.
At present two structural changes
are being considered to remedy this
problem along with the acoustics is
sue. One is the possibility of a ceiling
over the second floor where the cir
culation department operates.
A second possibility would pro
vide for the extension of glass from
the balconies to the ceilings, making
a wall around each floor near the
light well.
The summer carpeting job was
partly an attempt to curb some of the

noise problems, but carpeting of the
entire building has always been a
long term goal, according to Guy
Deßall of the circulation department.
Not anticipated
None of the problems being
examined was anticipated at th e time
of Meyer's design and construction,
more than 10 years ago. The build
ing's plans proceeded along the
normal review process and were crit
ically examined by operations,
health services, planning and plant
services departments, the president


Warming up for the big race, contestants prepare for Sunday's five-mile
Alumni Cross-Country Run. The Alumni Association-sponsored event, held for
the third time this year, included a 2.7 mile race as well. Some 200 contestants
entered the event in one of 10 categories, according to coordinator Celia
Nogales. Prizes were awarded for winners in each category, as well as two

overall winners. Winning the five-miler was Ramsey Thomas, while George
Lynch took the shorter race. In addition, a special award was given to Frank
Novotny, 73, for being the most senior citizen to finish the race. A picnic
followed the event, which was open to alumni, faculty, staff, students ami their
families.
