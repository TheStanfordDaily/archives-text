# Important to cast your vote

Westly et al.

Without going into the usual
philosophical harangue about the
duties of citizens in a democracy,
we'd like to poirtt out a few reasons
why it is worth your while to vote in
the ASSU elections tomorrow and
Thursday.
Two very important fee assess
ments are on this fall ballot — one for
the Speakers Bureau and one for the
new ASSU Recycling Project. We
urge you to vote Yes on both.

Any student or student group who
has tried to bring a speaker to cam
pus knows how difficult it can be to
raise the honorariums and/or ex
penses for such an event. The
Speakers Bureau was created to ena
ble students to bring speakers of
their choice to Stanford, with a
minimum of hassle.
In the past, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau has presented such per
sonalities as Ray Bradbury, Erica
Jong, Hunter S. Thompson, John
Kenneth Calbraith and Cesar
Chavez. A Yes vote on the Speakers
Bureau fee assessment will help the
ASSU continue bringing authors,
politicians, journalists and other
notables to the Stanford community.
The two-quarter Recycling Project
fee assessment enables the ASSU to
build and equip a campus recycling
center, to pay student project mana
gers and employes, and to buy a
truck to make the regular pick-ups of
recyclables from residences, offices

and University departments. Al
though the project is intended to be
come self-supporting, it will require
an initial capital investment. Your
Yes vote on the ASSU Recycling Pro
ject fee assessment will make recycl
ing a permanent and regular part of
life at Stanford.
Last but of course not least, we'd
like to emphasize the importance of
the Senate. Reputations of the past
need not influence the present. The
Senate can be a real and vital part of
campus life. Channel your concerns
or your frustrations into an active
support of the senators you want to
represent you. As the Council of
Presidents, we will work closely with
the Senate, and rely on them to accu
rately reflect your interests. The
ASSU should be student government
by election — not by default.
