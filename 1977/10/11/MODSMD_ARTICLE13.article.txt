# Outer space dwellings
## NASA develops building method 
### Mike Simon Last of two parts 
Most authorities on the sub
ject beiiev? we can and will
colonize space in the near fu
ture. Physicist Gerard O'Neill,
who has already been called
the "father of space coloniza
tion," believes this will happen
some time between 1990 and
2005.
If ongoing research at the
National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and
other institutions is fully
funded, space colonization
may be declared a full NASA
project in five years. It would
take about five years of re
search before the safety and
profitability of colonizing
outer space can be deter
mined.
Training
If this did become a full-scale
project, a ground control sys
tem would be set up in 1982 or
1983. Ground control would
train personnel for the coloniz
ing task, and would schedule
launches and construction of
the outer space facilities. Ac
tual launches and space activity
could be underway by 1985.
Colonizingwould beginwith
NASA's space shuttle orbiter,
which had its first test flight in
August. This huge craft is
launched into orbit with boos
ter rockets, and is capable of
supporting a crew in space for
a month. When the shuttle re
turns to earth, it will glide to a
landing like an airplane and be
re-used up to 100 times. The
shuttle will be tested in space
within two years.
The shuttle, at launching, is
connected to a 100-foot long
tank. The tank is initially filled
with fuel for the trip into space.
When the shuttle reaches or
bit, the tank can be emptied
and used for construction pur
poses. The first colonies in
space may be built out of these
huge tanks. One such tank
could be modified to house 27
persons.
New engine
The shuttle cannot go any
further into space than earth
orbit, so another means of
space transportation will be
needed. One such vessel is
currently being developed by
O'Neill and his associates. It
will be run with a "mass-drive"
engine, so called because it
uses solids for fuel instead of
liquid propellents. Bits of rock
or any other type of solid arc
shot through space by the
mass-driver at high speeds.
The mass-driver then moves in
the opposite direction.
With the shuttle and mass
driver available for space
transportation, space-age har
dhats can begin to set up the
facilities needed for space
manufacturing.
At least three temporary
space habitats will be needed
to house these workers. One
such habitat will be built in
low-earth orbit, within 150
miles of our planet's surface.
The people who work here will
probably assemble habitats,
using empty shuttle tanks.
They will also help transfer
cargo and personnel from the
shuttle to the mass-driver.
Moon mines
Another habitat will be
placed on or near the surface
of the moon. Almost all space
structures will be made from
materials mined from the
moon. Typical samples of lunar
ore brought back to earth by
Apollo astronauts contain
many elements such as
aluminum, iron, silicon and
oxygen. The crew of the lunar
habitat will be responsible for

the mining operations.
The lunar ore will be
launched from the moon with
another mass-driver, and will
eventually be brought to the
site of the space manufacturing
facility, where the first colonies
in space will be built.
It is here that a third tempor
ary habitat will be set up. The
crew that works at this facility
will build a factory, which will
be used for the production of
solar power satellites and other
large space structures. All
three of these temporary
habitats can be made from

used shuttle tanks.
Each station will have a crew
of between 50 and 150 men and
women. The three stations will
form the network of "Class
One" habitats, meaning they
will be the first set of housing
and manufacturing facilities to
be put into operation in outer
space.
Long hours
Class One crew members
will not enjoy all the comforts
of home; they will work long
hours in close quarters to get
the project underway. They
will serve brief tours of duty,

probably less than two years,
before returning to earth.
Once the three Class One
habitats are put into full opera
tion, the men and women
working in space will be faced
with two monumental tasks:
the production of solar power
satellites and the construction
of the larger, permanent space
habitats.
The satellites will be man
ufactured at the space man
ufacturing facility which will be
located somewhere between
the earth and the moon. These
immense power stations will

then be towed, with the mass
driver, into geosynchronous
orbit, that is, an orbit about the
earth in which the satellite re
mains in a fixed position above
a certain spot on our planet.
Solar energy
As early as 1992, a typical
solar power station could be
supplying earth with 10,000
megawatts of energy, enough
power to run the city of New
York.
Building the permanent
space habitats presents a grea
ter challenge. One possible
model will be a sphere, about a
third of a mile in diameter, ac
cording to O'Neill. The outer
shell will be several feet thick,
to shield the colony's residents
from cosmic radiation. This
shell, made of aluminum and
glass, would weigh 170,000
tons and would be rotated at
two rolls per minute to provide
gravity. The 10,000 residents
would move about inside the
habitat and using earth
methods, would construct
cities and communities.
10 million people
A typical Class Three space
colony might be a cylinder, 100
miles long and 20 miles in
diameter. It would have more
land area than Switzerland and
could support 10 million
people. Food and space will be
plentiful. Some day, life on
earth may not even be missed.
Once we've established a
firm foothold in outer space,
we can turn to other activities
such as improving our planet,
if that hasn't already been
taken care of.
The search for other planets
is another possibility ac
complished with a huge tele
scope in space, with enough
power to allow us to view
scenery on planets 10 lights
years away. A manned mission
to such a planet could be next
as man continues to learn
about his place in the universe.


Cylindrical space habitats are surrounded by a halo of agricultural farms. Communication and energy
manufacturing stations adorn the tops of the cylinders.
