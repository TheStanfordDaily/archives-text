# Brooks, Truffaut, & 'Bobby Deerfield': yes, yes, no
## 
### 
Oct. 5
It was a typical opening
night. Spotlights, limos,
tuxedos, mink coats and, of
course, my three-year-old blue
jeans which served as my iden
tification as an irreverent Stan
ford student.
Director Sydney Pollack and
actress Marthe Keller waved at
the photographers. A capacity
crowd surrounded the theater.
"Bobby Deerfield" was
opening the 21st Annual San
Francisco International Film
Festival.
Al Pacino stars as Deerfield, a
cold, unemotional American
Grand Prix driver. In the film's
opening minutes, Deerfield's
teammate dies in a fiery crash.
Concerned about his own
safety (he and his teammate
had identical cars), Bobby tries

to find out what caused the
crash.
His search takes him to a
hospital in Switzerland, where
he meets Lillian (Marthe Kel
ler).
The rest of the film is taken
up with their relationship. Lil
lian, unknown to Bobby, is dy
ing, but her attitude toward life
gradually changes him into a
warm, caring person. When
Deerfield learns of Lillian's im
pending death, his metamor
phosis is complete, and in Lil
lian's last days he spends all his
time with her and lives life with
a zest he never had before.
Alvin Sargent wrote the
thoughtful and believable
screenplay, and Al Pacino gives
a solid (and rare) romantic per
formance as Deerfield.
But the film is shot down by
Sydney Pollack's confused and

inconsistent direction. Pollack
makes Sargent's screenplay
look threadbare (it isn't) be
cause he spends so much time
on visual images. The film has
about four shots too many of
Pacino's blank face — I guess
you call those "character
study" shots.
What's sad about the movie
is that Pollack does manage to
create some fine scenes. They
come in the second half of the
film, which at least has some
energy (the first half of the film
is nearly comatose).
If Pollack weren't getting in
the way of Sargent's screenplay
with his myriad landscape
shots and profuse editing, the
story may have breathed and
the film might have been quite
good. As it stands, if you ignore
the direction and try to focus

on the story, the film can be
moderately enjoyable.
Sydney Pollack is a director
who has shown flashes of ta
lent and intelligence; for
example, parts of "They Shoot
Horses, Don't They?" and"The
Way We Were" are excellent.
In this film the closing mo
ments are well handled (espe
cially in the scene where
Pacino does a spontaneous
Mae West impression) and
they have a naturalistic quality
one longs for in the rest of the
film.
Perhaps in his next film Pol
lack will hold himself in check
and not get so overblown. He
has the capacity to make a fine
film, but this isn't the one.
All this aside, it's good to
see films turning again towards
honest relationships between
men and women instead of

showing dishonest relation
ships between men and men.
"Bobby Deerfield" is a
flawed but welcome step in
this direction.
Oct. 6
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men," the new film from
French master director Fran
cois Truffuat, is the story of
Betrand Moscone, a funny-sad
character played with quiet
brilliance by veteran French
character actor Charles De
nner.
Bertrand is obsessed by wo
men. The women who satisfy
this obsession are less impor
tant to Bertrand than the ob
session itself. He isn't a Don
Juan or Casanova because it's
not sex that's vital to him; it's
the pursuit he can't live with
out.
Bertrand is constantly look
ing at women (especially their
legs), and is continually plot
ting and scheming about how
to meet and seduce them. His
endless pursuit finally kills him
(he sees a beautiful woman on
the other side of a street, and in
his blind distraction crosses
the street and gets hit by a car).
The film is directed with a
light touch. Truffaut explores
the comic aspects of Bertrand's
unending pursuit with a sure
hand. The acting, as in all Truf
faut films, is natural and com
petent. Of the supporting
players, Leslie Caron, in an all
too-brief performance, stands
out as the one woman Bertrand
really loved.
The movie, on the whole, is
highly enjoyable. But it's
slightly overlong and doesn't
seem to be as inspired as some
of Truffaut's best works ("Jules
and Jim," "The 400 Blows,"
"Small Change"). Yet a mea
sure of Francois Truffaut's ta
lent is that his lesser works are
better than many directors'
best.
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men" is worth seeing.
Oct. 8
Sydney Pollack opened the
"Festival Forum" series. After
clips from each of his films, Pol
lack answered questions from
the audience. He said that
working with so-called "dif
ficult" stars (such as Pacino,
Jane Fonda or Barbra
Streisand) is like handling "a
thoroughbred race horse,"
and takes a special touch.
Pollack discussed his direct
ing frankly (ana correctly):
"My strength, I think, is my
handling of actors . . . My
weakness is my tendency to
use deliberate pacing to the
point where I lose the audi
ence."
Oct. 9
After iengthy clips were
shown from his five films (of
special pleasure were the

"Springtime for Hitler" seg
ment from"The Producers"
and the Music Hall scene from
"Young Frankenstein"), Mel
Brooks came out for a showing
of a "rough cut" (meaning the
soundtrack is not yet mixed,
and there is no background
music) from his upcoming film,
"High Anxiety." This is a
send-up of Alfred Hitchcock,
whom Brooks calls the
"greatest cinematic director."
He showed two scenes from
the film; the first is a parody of
the shower murder sequence
from "Psycho," which I won't
spoil by explaining. You'll be
able to laugh at it when the film
is released in January.
In the second scene, Brooks
does a hysterically funny imita
tion of Frank Sinatra. The
"Psycho" parody was filmed at
San Francisco's Hyatt Regency
and Brooks said there is a
"Vertigo"-type sequence done
on the Golden Gate Bridge.
Needless to say, "High Anxi
ety" looks like another hit for
Brooks.
Talking about stand-up
comedians who've influenced
him, he explained many of
them are Jewish. (It) "has
something to do with the
cohabitation of Jewish parents
50 years ago. Every family had
four or five kids, and one of
them became a stand-up com
edian."
He went on to say that he
admires Bob Hope and Henny
Youngman, but that Sid Caeser
is the "greatest I ever saw." He
said that he enjoys physical
comedy more than other forms
and that "Silent Movie," in par
ticular, was a tribute to the
genius of Keaton and Chaplin.
He said he wants to work
with Gene Wilder again, but he
doesn't know when he will. He
professed a love for Woody Al
len, and he said he envied Al
len's ability to make statements
with his comedy.
After about three hours of
clips and questions, Brooks
left, as he put it, "In my pink
Seville for Sausalito." It was an
enjoyable afternoon.
Lauren Bacall will be at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theatre for
film clips and discussion.
Claude Lelouch (Oct. 16 — di
rector of "A Man and a Wo
man") will be the focus of the
forum. Tickets are still availa
ble for both.
As for films, the festival con
tinues until Oct. 16, with high
lights being "Blue Country,"
the new film by Jean Charles
Tacchella, who directed last
year's "Cousin Cousine."
"Blue Country" will be shown
tonight at the Castro Theatre.
A promising double bill of
"Cat and Mouse," a romantic
murder mystery from Claude
Lelouch, with "A Special Day,"
which stars Marcello Mas
troianni and Sophia Loren, and
received unanimous acclaim at
last month's New York Film
Festival, run Oct. 15 at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theatre and
Oct. 16 at the Castro.
The complete festival prog
ram is in the Oct. issue of San
Francisco Magazine.
Tickets for the films are $4
each, for the forums $3.

lent is that his lesser works are
better than many directors'
best.
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men" is worth seeing.
Oct. 8
Sydney Pollack opened the
"Festival Forum" series. After
clips from each of his films, Pol
lack answered questions from
the audience. He said that
working with so-called "dif
ficult" stars (such as Pacino,
Jane Fonda or Barbra
Streisand) is like handling "a
thoroughbred race horse,"
and takes a special touch.
Pollack discussed his direct
ing frankly (ana correctly):
"My strength, I think, is my
handling of actors . . . My
weakness is my tendency to
use deliberate pacing to the
point where I lose the audi
ence."
Oct. 9
After iengthy clips were
shown from his five films (of
special pleasure were the

"Springtime for Hitler" seg
ment from"The Producers"
and the Music Hall scene from
"Young Frankenstein"), Mel
Brooks came out for a showing
of a "rough cut" (meaning the
soundtrack is not yet mixed,
and there is no background
music) from his upcoming film,
"High Anxiety." This is a
send-up of Alfred Hitchcock,
whom Brooks calls the
"greatest cinematic director."
He showed two scenes from
the film; the first is a parody of
the shower murder sequence
from "Psycho," which I won't
spoil by explaining. You'll be
able to laugh at it when the film
is released in January.
In the second scene, Brooks
does a hysterically funny imita
tion of Frank Sinatra. The
"Psycho" parody was filmed at
San Francisco's Hyatt Regency
and Brooks said there is a
"Vertigo"-type sequence done
on the Golden Gate Bridge.
Needless to say, "High Anxi
ety" looks like another hit for
Brooks.
Talking about stand-up
comedians who've influenced
him, he explained many of
them are Jewish. (It) "has
something to do with the
cohabitation of Jewish parents
50 years ago. Every family had
four or five kids, and one of
them became a stand-up com
edian."
He went on to say that he
admires Bob Hope and Henny
Youngman, but that Sid Caeser
is the "greatest I ever saw." He
said that he enjoys physical
comedy more than other forms
and that "Silent Movie," in par
ticular, was a tribute to the
genius of Keaton and Chaplin.
He said he wants to work
with Gene Wilder again, but he
doesn't know when he will. He
professed a love for Woody Al
len, and he said he envied Al
len's ability to make statements
with his comedy.
After about three hours of
clips and questions, Brooks
left, as he put it, "In my pink
Seville for Sausalito." It was an
enjoyable afternoon.
Lauren Bacall will be at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theatre for
film clips and discussion.
Claude Lelouch (Oct. 16 — di
rector of "A Man and a Wo
man") will be the focus of the
forum. Tickets are still availa

As for films, the festival con
tinues until Oct. 16, with high
lights being "Blue Country,"
the new film by Jean Charles
Tacchella, who directed last
year's "Cousin Cousine."
"Blue Country" will be shown

'Black Litter'


'Blue Country'


'Bobby Deerfield'
Oct. 5
It was a typical opening
night. Spotlights, limos,
tuxedos, mink coats and, of
course, my three-year-old blue
jeans which served as my iden
tification as an irreverent Stan
ford student.
Director Sydney Pollack and
actress Marthe Keller waved at
the photographers. A capacity
crowd surrounded the theater.
"Bobby Deerfield" was
opening the 21st Annual San
Francisco International Film
Festival.
Al Pacino stars as Deerfield, a
cold, unemotional American
Grand Prix driver. In the film's
opening minutes, Deerfield's
teammate dies in a fiery crash.
Concerned about his own
safety (he and his teammate
had identical cars), Bobby tries

to find out what caused the
crash.
His search takes him to a
hospital in Switzerland, where
he meets Lillian (Marthe Kel
ler).
The rest of the film is taken
up with their relationship. Lil
lian, unknown to Bobby, is dy
ing, but her attitude toward life
gradually changes him into a
warm, caring person. When
Deerfield learns of Lillian's im
pending death, his metamor
phosis is complete, and in Lil
lian's last days he spends all his
time with her and lives life with
a zest he never had before.
Alvin Sargent wrote the
thoughtful and believable
screenplay, and Al Pacino gives
a solid (and rare) romantic per
formance as Deerfield.
But the film is shot down by
Sydney Pollack's confused and

inconsistent direction. Pollack
makes Sargent's screenplay
look threadbare (it isn't) be
cause he spends so much time
on visual images. The film has
about four shots too many of
Pacino's blank face — I guess
you call those "character
study" shots.
What's sad about the movie
is that Pollack does manage to
create some fine scenes. They
come in the second half of the
film, which at least has some
energy (the first half of the film
is nearly comatose).
If Pollack weren't getting in
the way of Sargent's screenplay
with his myriad landscape
shots and profuse editing, the
story may have breathed and
the film might have been quite
good. As it stands, if you ignore
the direction and try to focus

on the story, the film can be
moderately enjoyable.
Sydney Pollack is a director
who has shown flashes of ta
lent and intelligence; for
example, parts of "They Shoot
Horses, Don't They?" and"The
Way We Were" are excellent.
In this film the closing mo
ments are well handled (espe
cially in the scene where
Pacino does a spontaneous
Mae West impression) and
they have a naturalistic quality
one longs for in the rest of the
film.
Perhaps in his next film Pol
lack will hold himself in check
and not get so overblown. He
has the capacity to make a fine
film, but this isn't the one.
All this aside, it's good to
see films turning again towards
honest relationships between
men and women instead of

showing dishonest relation
ships between men and men.
"Bobby Deerfield" is a
flawed but welcome step in
this direction.
Oct. 6
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men," the new film from
French master director Fran
cois Truffuat, is the story of
Betrand Moscone, a funny-sad
character played with quiet
brilliance by veteran French
character actor Charles De
nner.
Bertrand is obsessed by wo
men. The women who satisfy
this obsession are less impor
tant to Bertrand than the ob
session itself. He isn't a Don
Juan or Casanova because it's
not sex that's vital to him; it's
the pursuit he can't live with
out.
Bertrand is constantly look
ing at women (especially their
legs), and is continually plot
ting and scheming about how
to meet and seduce them. His
endless pursuit finally kills him
(he sees a beautiful woman on
the other side of a street, and in
his blind distraction crosses
the street and gets hit by a car).
The film is directed with a
light touch. Truffaut explores
the comic aspects of Bertrand's
unending pursuit with a sure
hand. The acting, as in all Truf
faut films, is natural and com
petent. Of the supporting
players, Leslie Caron, in an all
too-brief performance, stands
out as the one woman Bertrand
really loved.
The movie, on the whole, is
highly enjoyable. But it's
slightly overlong and doesn't
seem to be as inspired as some
of Truffaut's best works ("Jules
and Jim," "The 400 Blows,"
"Small Change"). Yet a mea
sure of Francois Truffaut's ta
lent is that his lesser works are
better than many directors'
best.

crash.
His search takes him to a
hospital in Switzerland, where
he meets Lillian (Marthe Kel
ler).
The rest of the film is taken
up with their relationship. Lil
lian, unknown to Bobby, is dy
ing, but her attitude toward life
gradually changes him into a
warm, caring person. When
Deerfield learns of Lillian's im
pending death, his metamor
phosis is complete, and in Lil
lian's last days he spends all his
time with her and lives life with
a zest he never had before.
Alvin Sargent wrote the
thoughtful and believable
screenplay, and Al Pacino gives
a solid (and rare) romantic per
formance as Deerfield.
But the film is shot down by
Sydney Pollack's confused and

inconsistent direction. Pollack
makes Sargent's screenplay
look threadbare (it isn't) be
cause he spends so much time
on visual images. The film has
about four shots too many of
Pacino's blank face — I guess
you call those "character
study" shots.
What's sad about the movie
is that Pollack does manage to
create some fine scenes. They
come in the second half of the
film, which at least has some
energy (the first half of the film
is nearly comatose).
If Pollack weren't getting in
the way of Sargent's screenplay
with his myriad landscape
shots and profuse editing, the
story may have breathed and
the film might have been quite
good. As it stands, if you ignore
the direction and try to focus

on the story, the film can be
moderately enjoyable.
Sydney Pollack is a director
who has shown flashes of ta
lent and intelligence; for
example, parts of "They Shoot
Horses, Don't They?" and"The
Way We Were" are excellent.
In this film the closing mo
ments are well handled (espe
cially in the scene where
Pacino does a spontaneous
Mae West impression) and
they have a naturalistic quality
one longs for in the rest of the
film.
Perhaps in his next film Pol
lack will hold himself in check
and not get so overblown. He
has the capacity to make a fine
film, but this isn't the one.
All this aside, it's good to
see films turning again towards
honest relationships between
men and women instead of

showing dishonest relation
ships between men and men.
"Bobby Deerfield" is a
flawed but welcome step in
this direction.

"The Man Who Loved Wo
men," the new film from
French master director Fran
cois Truffuat, is the story of
Betrand Moscone, a funny-sad
character played with quiet
brilliance by veteran French
character actor Charles De
nner.
Bertrand is obsessed by wo
men. The women who satisfy
this obsession are less impor
tant to Bertrand than the ob
session itself. He isn't a Don
Juan or Casanova because it's
not sex that's vital to him; it's
the pursuit he can't live with
out.
Bertrand is constantly look
ing at women (especially their
legs), and is continually plot
ting and scheming about how
to meet and seduce them. His
endless pursuit finally kills him
(he sees a beautiful woman on
the other side of a street, and in
his blind distraction crosses
the street and gets hit by a car).
The film is directed with a
light touch. Truffaut explores
the comic aspects of Bertrand's
unending pursuit with a sure
hand. The acting, as in all Truf
faut films, is natural and com
petent. Of the supporting
players, Leslie Caron, in an all
too-brief performance, stands
out as the one woman Bertrand
really loved.
The movie, on the whole, is
highly enjoyable. But it's
slightly overlong and doesn't
seem to be as inspired as some
of Truffaut's best works ("Jules
and Jim," "The 400 Blows,"
"Small Change"). Yet a mea
sure of Francois Truffaut's ta
lent is that his lesser works are
better than many directors'
best.
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men" is worth seeing.
Oct. 8
Sydney Pollack opened the
"Festival Forum" series. After
clips from each of his films, Pol
lack answered questions from
the audience. He said that
working with so-called "dif
ficult" stars (such as Pacino,
Jane Fonda or Barbra
Streisand) is like handling "a
thoroughbred race horse,"
and takes a special touch.
Pollack discussed his direct
ing frankly (ana correctly):
"My strength, I think, is my
handling of actors . . . My
weakness is my tendency to
use deliberate pacing to the
point where I lose the audi
ence."
Oct. 9
After iengthy clips were
shown from his five films (of
special pleasure were the

"Springtime for Hitler" seg
ment from"The Producers"
and the Music Hall scene from
"Young Frankenstein"), Mel
Brooks came out for a showing
of a "rough cut" (meaning the
soundtrack is not yet mixed,
and there is no background
music) from his upcoming film,
"High Anxiety." This is a
send-up of Alfred Hitchcock,
whom Brooks calls the
"greatest cinematic director."
He showed two scenes from
the film; the first is a parody of
the shower murder sequence
from "Psycho," which I won't
spoil by explaining. You'll be
able to laugh at it when the film
is released in January.
In the second scene, Brooks
does a hysterically funny imita
tion of Frank Sinatra. The
"Psycho" parody was filmed at
San Francisco's Hyatt Regency
and Brooks said there is a
"Vertigo"-type sequence done
on the Golden Gate Bridge.
Needless to say, "High Anxi
ety" looks like another hit for
Brooks.
Talking about stand-up
comedians who've influenced
him, he explained many of
them are Jewish. (It) "has
something to do with the
cohabitation of Jewish parents
50 years ago. Every family had
four or five kids, and one of
them became a stand-up com
edian."
He went on to say that he
admires Bob Hope and Henny
Youngman, but that Sid Caeser
is the "greatest I ever saw." He
said that he enjoys physical
comedy more than other forms
and that "Silent Movie," in par
ticular, was a tribute to the
genius of Keaton and Chaplin.
He said he wants to work
with Gene Wilder again, but he
doesn't know when he will. He
professed a love for Woody Al
len, and he said he envied Al
len's ability to make statements
with his comedy.
After about three hours of
clips and questions, Brooks
left, as he put it, "In my pink
Seville for Sausalito." It was an
enjoyable afternoon.
Lauren Bacall will be at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theatre for
film clips and discussion.
Claude Lelouch (Oct. 16 — di
rector of "A Man and a Wo
man") will be the focus of the
forum. Tickets are still availa
ble for both.
As for films, the festival con
tinues until Oct. 16, with high
lights being "Blue Country,"
the new film by Jean Charles
Tacchella, who directed last
year's "Cousin Cousine."
"Blue Country" will be shown
tonight at the Castro Theatre.
A promising double bill of
"Cat and Mouse," a romantic
murder mystery from Claude
Lelouch, with "A Special Day,"
which stars Marcello Mas
troianni and Sophia Loren, and
received unanimous acclaim at
last month's New York Film
Festival, run Oct. 15 at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theatre and

'Bobby Deerfield'
Oct. 5

shown from his five films (of
special pleasure were the

"Springtime for Hitler" seg
ment from"The Producers"
and the Music Hall scene from
"Young Frankenstein"), Mel
Brooks came out for a showing
of a "rough cut" (meaning the
soundtrack is not yet mixed,
and there is no background
music) from his upcoming film,
"High Anxiety." This is a
send-up of Alfred Hitchcock,
whom Brooks calls the
"greatest cinematic director."
He showed two scenes from
the film; the first is a parody of
the shower murder sequence
from "Psycho," which I won't
spoil by explaining. You'll be
able to laugh at it when the film
is released in January.
In the second scene, Brooks
does a hysterically funny imita
tion of Frank Sinatra. The
"Psycho" parody was filmed at
San Francisco's Hyatt Regency
and Brooks said there is a
"Vertigo"-type sequence done
on the Golden Gate Bridge.
Needless to say, "High Anxi
ety" looks like another hit for
Brooks.
Talking about stand-up
comedians who've influenced
him, he explained many of
them are Jewish. (It) "has
something to do with the
cohabitation of Jewish parents
50 years ago. Every family had
four or five kids, and one of
them became a stand-up com
edian."
He went on to say that he
admires Bob Hope and Henny
Youngman, but that Sid Caeser
is the "greatest I ever saw." He
said that he enjoys physical
comedy more than other forms
and that "Silent Movie," in par
ticular, was a tribute to the
genius of Keaton and Chaplin.
He said he wants to work
with Gene Wilder again, but he
doesn't know when he will. He
professed a love for Woody Al
len, and he said he envied Al
len's ability to make statements
with his comedy.
After about three hours of
clips and questions, Brooks
left, as he put it, "In my pink
Seville for Sausalito." It was an
enjoyable afternoon.
Lauren Bacall will be at the
Palace of Fine Arts Theatre for
film clips and discussion.
Claude Lelouch (Oct. 16 — di
rector of "A Man and a Wo
man") will be the focus of the
forum. Tickets are still availa
ble for both.
As for films, the festival con
tinues until Oct. 16, with high
lights being "Blue Country,"
the new film by Jean Charles
Tacchella, who directed last
year's "Cousin Cousine."
"Blue Country" will be shown
tonight at the Castro Theatre.
A promising double bill of
"Cat and Mouse," a romantic
murder mystery from Claude
Lelouch, with "A Special Day,"
which stars Marcello Mas
troianni and Sophia Loren, and

'Black Litter'


'Blue Country'


'Bobby Deerfield'
Oct. 5
It was a typical opening
night. Spotlights, limos,
tuxedos, mink coats and, of
course, my three-year-old blue
jeans which served as my iden
tification as an irreverent Stan
ford student.
Director Sydney Pollack and
actress Marthe Keller waved at
the photographers. A capacity
crowd surrounded the theater.
"Bobby Deerfield" was
opening the 21st Annual San
Francisco International Film
Festival.
Al Pacino stars as Deerfield, a
cold, unemotional American
Grand Prix driver. In the film's
opening minutes, Deerfield's
teammate dies in a fiery crash.
Concerned about his own
safety (he and his teammate
had identical cars), Bobby tries

to find out what caused the
crash.
His search takes him to a
hospital in Switzerland, where
he meets Lillian (Marthe Kel
ler).
The rest of the film is taken
up with their relationship. Lil
lian, unknown to Bobby, is dy
ing, but her attitude toward life
gradually changes him into a
warm, caring person. When
Deerfield learns of Lillian's im
pending death, his metamor
phosis is complete, and in Lil
lian's last days he spends all his
time with her and lives life with
a zest he never had before.
Alvin Sargent wrote the
thoughtful and believable
screenplay, and Al Pacino gives
a solid (and rare) romantic per
formance as Deerfield.
But the film is shot down by
Sydney Pollack's confused and

inconsistent direction. Pollack
makes Sargent's screenplay
look threadbare (it isn't) be
cause he spends so much time
on visual images. The film has
about four shots too many of
Pacino's blank face — I guess
you call those "character
study" shots.
What's sad about the movie
is that Pollack does manage to
create some fine scenes. They
come in the second half of the
film, which at least has some
energy (the first half of the film
is nearly comatose).
If Pollack weren't getting in
the way of Sargent's screenplay
with his myriad landscape
shots and profuse editing, the
story may have breathed and
the film might have been quite
good. As it stands, if you ignore
the direction and try to focus

on the story, the film can be
moderately enjoyable.
Sydney Pollack is a director
who has shown flashes of ta
lent and intelligence; for
example, parts of "They Shoot
Horses, Don't They?" and"The
Way We Were" are excellent.
In this film the closing mo
ments are well handled (espe
cially in the scene where
Pacino does a spontaneous
Mae West impression) and
they have a naturalistic quality
one longs for in the rest of the
film.
Perhaps in his next film Pol
lack will hold himself in check
and not get so overblown. He
has the capacity to make a fine
film, but this isn't the one.
All this aside, it's good to
see films turning again towards
honest relationships between
men and women instead of

showing dishonest relation
ships between men and men.
"Bobby Deerfield" is a
flawed but welcome step in
this direction.
Oct. 6
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men," the new film from
French master director Fran
cois Truffuat, is the story of
Betrand Moscone, a funny-sad
character played with quiet
brilliance by veteran French
character actor Charles De
nner.
Bertrand is obsessed by wo
men. The women who satisfy
this obsession are less impor
tant to Bertrand than the ob
session itself. He isn't a Don
Juan or Casanova because it's
not sex that's vital to him; it's
the pursuit he can't live with
out.
Bertrand is constantly look
ing at women (especially their
legs), and is continually plot
ting and scheming about how
to meet and seduce them. His
endless pursuit finally kills him
(he sees a beautiful woman on
the other side of a street, and in
his blind distraction crosses
the street and gets hit by a car).
The film is directed with a
light touch. Truffaut explores
the comic aspects of Bertrand's
unending pursuit with a sure
hand. The acting, as in all Truf
faut films, is natural and com
petent. Of the supporting
players, Leslie Caron, in an all
too-brief performance, stands
out as the one woman Bertrand
really loved.
The movie, on the whole, is
highly enjoyable. But it's
slightly overlong and doesn't
seem to be as inspired as some
of Truffaut's best works ("Jules
and Jim," "The 400 Blows,"
"Small Change"). Yet a mea
sure of Francois Truffaut's ta
lent is that his lesser works are
better than many directors'
best.
"The Man Who Loved Wo
men" is worth seeing.
Oct. 8
Sydney Pollack opened the
"Festival Forum" series. After
clips from each of his films, Pol
lack answered questions from
the audience. He said that
working with so-called "dif
ficult" stars (such as Pacino,
Jane Fonda or Barbra
Streisand) is like handling "a
thoroughbred race horse,"
and takes a special touch.
Pollack discussed his direct
ing frankly (ana correctly):
"My strength, I think, is my
handling of actors . . . My
weakness is my tendency to
use deliberate pacing to the
point where I lose the audi
ence."
Oct. 9
After iengthy clips were
shown from his five films (of
