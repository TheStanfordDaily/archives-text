# 'Valentino': bizarrely boring
## 
### 
"Valentino" is a movie about
Rudolf Nureyev, the dancer.
The plot deals with the life and
exploits of a mythically libidin
ous movie star in days of yore,
but the movie is about
Nureyev, the dancer.
"Dancer" is operative be
cause Nureyev cannot act. He
effervesces, and he exudes,
and he does one hell of a
tango, but when it comes to
abandoning his accent for that
of his character, or showing
anything but stricken dignity,
he is not good.
This is unfortunate. It is dif

ficult to enjoy a movie about a
movie star when the person
playing the movie star cannot
act. Director Ken Russell
("Lisztomania," "Tommy,"
"Mahler," "The Boyfriend")
provides the usual sexual
bombast, and he hints at even
more, yet the potency is lack
ing where it counts, so to
speak.
What's more, I'm getting
pretty tired of
"docudramas" — those big
screen, bastardized history
films that leave history behind
at every turn.

I haven't any idea whether
Valentino was the lethargically
prolific caricature he is made
out to be here, but if Russell's
earlier efforts are any indica
tion, I wasn't supposed to.
Russell is interested in further
ing the myths that surround
and subsume such figures, and
if his methods are admirable
his ends are not.
And in all fairness, it must be
granted that some of Russell's
methods c/o deserve praise.
"Valentino" is visually a flam
boyant movie, one that man
ages to move through a verita

ble minefield of cliches with
vigorous mastery. Further,
Russell's fascination for things
bizarre ought not be summar
ily condemned, as it some
times enables him to hit
characters otherwise elusive
right between the eyes.
Still, this ought not lead one
to the conclusion that "Valen
tino" is a good movie. "Valen
tino" is not a good movie. Rus
sell's talents are wasted herein,
as they are used to support an
approach that is to my mind
growing stale.
Besides, even if the method
were appealing (and I suppose
my inability to stomach much
more of this larger-than-life
garbage borders on hysteria)
there is no real need to get
metaphysical. Nureyev just
couldn't cut it.

"Valentino" is a movie about
Rudolf Nureyev, the dancer.
The plot deals with the life and
exploits of a mythically libidin
ous movie star in days of yore,
but the movie is about
Nureyev, the dancer.
"Dancer" is operative be
cause Nureyev cannot act. He
effervesces, and he exudes,
and he does one hell of a
tango, but when it comes to
abandoning his accent for that
of his character, or showing
anything but stricken dignity,
he is not good.
This is unfortunate. It is dif

ficult to enjoy a movie about a
movie star when the person
playing the movie star cannot
act. Director Ken Russell
("Lisztomania," "Tommy,"
"Mahler," "The Boyfriend")
provides the usual sexual
bombast, and he hints at even
more, yet the potency is lack
ing where it counts, so to
speak.
What's more, I'm getting
pretty tired of
"docudramas" — those big
screen, bastardized history
films that leave history behind
at every turn.

I haven't any idea whether
Valentino was the lethargically
prolific caricature he is made
out to be here, but if Russell's
earlier efforts are any indica
tion, I wasn't supposed to.
Russell is interested in further
ing the myths that surround
and subsume such figures, and
if his methods are admirable
his ends are not.
And in all fairness, it must be
granted that some of Russell's
methods c/o deserve praise.
"Valentino" is visually a flam
boyant movie, one that man
ages to move through a verita

ble minefield of cliches with
vigorous mastery. Further,
Russell's fascination for things
bizarre ought not be summar
ily condemned, as it some
times enables him to hit
characters otherwise elusive
right between the eyes.
Still, this ought not lead one
to the conclusion that "Valen
tino" is a good movie. "Valen
tino" is not a good movie. Rus
sell's talents are wasted herein,
as they are used to support an
approach that is to my mind
growing stale.
Besides, even if the method
were appealing (and I suppose
my inability to stomach much
more of this larger-than-life
garbage borders on hysteria)
there is no real need to get
metaphysical. Nureyev just
couldn't cut it.
