# Berkeley's Bread and Roses
## Accoustic extravaganza 
### 
(First of two parts)
Acoustic music: the story is
both simple and familiar. It was
the only music in the early
19605, with Bob Dylan and Joan
Baez leading a pack of folkies
whose topical songs moved
and inspired the young. Then,
after Dylan went electric and
the Beatles did "Sergeant Pep
per," it went unnoticed until
revived by Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young and the
journalistically titled
Woodstock Generation. And
since then, it has died a slow
and somewhat painless death
in the whatever sells is best
19705.
The ending of the story may
have to be revised, however, to
include a celebration in Oc
tober 1977, when thousands
witnessed living proof of
acoustic music's staying power
at the Bread and Roses Festival
of Music in Berkeley's Greek
Theatre.
Friday night's schedule fea
tured a mixed bag of perfor
mers. John McEuen, in

strumentalist of the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band, opened the show
and was perhaps the most en
tertaining player of the even
ing.
McEuen performed both
bluegrass and Bach superbly
on the banjo, and kept the au
dience in near hysterics with a
monologue that ran through
his entire set (describing the
Dirt Band's recent tour of the
Soviet Union, he remarked,
"That place is like a whole
other country").
McEuen was followed by
Robin Williamson, a Scottish
guitarist and original member
of the Incredible String Band.
Williamson and his Merry Band
worked through an enjoyable
set of what could be described
as baroque folk, and what he
termed "nouveau riche."
The comedians hired to keep
the audience occupied bet
ween acts were the festival's
only downfall. Former mem
bers of a San Francisco comedy
troupe known as "The Com
mittee" had the difficult task of
acting as fillers, and provided
lame and sometimes obnoxi
ous humor throughout the
weekend.
After Williamson's set, Joyi
Baez made the first of her many
appearances of the weekend.
After doing a warmly received a
cappella version of the humor
ous "Time Rag," she intro
duced Mickey Newberry.
Newberry's performance
was a special treat; he rarely
makes public appearances.
The audience, subdued by his
set of wistful storytelling
songs, rewarded him with an
ovation that brought him back
for the festival's first encore.
Closing the first half of the
show was the five-piece John
Herald Band, which engaged
the spectators in the first of the
weekend's many singalongs
with a tune called "John the
Generator."
Jesse Colin Young opened
the second half, delivering a
pitch for cleaning up the envi
ronment along with traditional
songs like "Black Eyed Suzie"
and "Frankie and Johnny,"
along with his own "Before

You Came," before giving way
to Mimi Farina.
Farina was backed by an all
star band of sorts, including
singer Terry Reid, ex-
Youngblood Banana on guitar,
Jesse Colin Young's sax player
Jim Rothermel, bassist Freebo
and violinist David Lindley.
They performed songs from an
album Farina is currently re
cording, the best of which was
entitled "Old Woman."
Next was a "totally oiled"
Hoyt Axton, who . . started
drinkin' at two so I'd be ready
by nine." But it was close to
midnight when Axton began,
and though he was on his "17th
glass of wine," the 16th of
which he poured all over his
guitar and vocal microphone,
he kept the crowd loose and
applauding with both his music
and his slurred stories.
But as Axton got drunker,
and the night air grew colder,
the concert began to drag. The
situation was not improved by
Baez, who followed Axton with
another a cappella number, a
drawn out version of "Swing
Low Sweet Chariot."
The evening ended on a high
note, however, as Arlo Guthrie
performed the final set of the
evening, opening with a
marathon tune at the piano
about Moses and the Pharoah,
which he delivered in his famil
iar rambling style.
Saturday's show was an Old
Timer's Night, with both the
performers and much of the
audience being well past the
teeny bopper stage. Gravel
voiced (actually "boulder
voiced" might be a better term)
Dave Van Ronk delighted the
crowd with an array of old folk
tunes including "Motherless
Children" and"He was a
Friend of Mine."
He was followed by 77-
year-old Malvina Reynolds
who charmed the audience
with a tune about a mouse who
fouled up a computer and a
feminist jingle called "We
Don't Need the Men." Round
ing out the first half of the con
cert were Theo Bikel, a Vien
nese actor who performed folk
songs in Yiddish, French, En

glish, Spanish and Russian and
received a standing ovation;
and Tom Paxton, who sang
some humorous material such
as his ode to capital punish
ment, "Let's Bring Back the
Chair," and closed with a mov
ing piece about his friend and
fellow folksinger, the late Phil
Ochs.
The Boys of the Lough, a four
piece group from the British
Isles, opened the second por
tion of the show, and provided
some outstanding musician
ship on fiddle and pennywhis
tle.
Ramblin' Jack Elliot, a con
temporary of Van Ronk and
Paxton during the 1960s
Greenwich Village folk scene
days followed and performed a
short set, joined at the finish by
Banana, Freebo and Arlo Gut
hrie.
Joan Baez followed Elliot,
opening with a new song,
"Honest Lullaby," which,
though obviously drawing
heavily in both content and
meter from Janis lan's "At Se
venteen," was quite pleasant.
.The show was oversold, with
some 9000 people crammed
into a small area, but Pete
Seeger made the Greek seem
as intimate as a somewhat
crowded living room with his
easy folk style. He performed
such standards as "John
Henry," "Guantanamera" and
along with Baez and Guthrie,
"Amazing Grace."
