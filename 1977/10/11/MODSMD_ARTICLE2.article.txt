# ASSU hopefuls in tiff over rules
## 
### Dean Eyre 
With the ASSU Senate elections
now only a day away, last Monday's
candidate petition deadline exten
sion has been a source of candidate
squabbles.
The postponement of the filing
date for senate graduate candidates
from Monday, Oct. 3 to Wednesday,
Oct. 5 prompted questions as to
whether or not candidates may have
utilized the additional time to gain an
advantage.
Sean Murphy, ASSU election
commissioner, said the deadline ex
tension became necessary because
"as of 4:30 p.m., Oct. 3, there were
only nine graduate candidates." He
consulted with senate chairman Pat
Flynn and ASSU Co-presidents Greg
Larson and Steve Westly and found
the ASSU Constitution to be in con
flict with the extension, however.
The constitution states that candi
date petitions must be submitted
nine days before the day of the elec
tion, yet requires that the senate be
comprised of an equal number of
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents.
Unless the deadline was extended,
the senate balance would be lost.
Larson said that Murphy recalled the
1976 election, in which the election
commission established a precedent
by not abiding by the nine day rule.
Thus, the 48-hour addition was ap
proved by Murphy, and 11 more
graduate candidates filed petitions.
"Murphy contacted the original
candidates and told the nine that
they could reword their statements,"
Larson said. The action was out of
fairness to those who may have
rushed to meet the original deadline,
Larson indicated.
Murphy commented, "Constitu
tionally I am the only one to make
that decision."
Prior to confirmation in yester
day's Daily article, rumors existed
that a slate representing the Student
Organizing Committee was forming
among the graduate candidates. At

the time of the interview, the specu
lation was that a seven person slate
had formed.
Senate candidate John Paval said
the COP involvement in the senate
elections should have been "more
up front. I don't think that the senate
election is any of the COP's business.
It's tampering," Paval explained.
Paval said, "The COP slate was very
clean last year. The slates got elected
but the COP .vas not backing any.
This year the situation is different."
Paval said that while "Murphy has
acted with complete integrity," he
questions the COP. He "might have

made the same decision on his own.
There aren't any hard and fast rules
about what the COP can or cannot
do. . . . They will not admit to help
ing candidates. I know they are — it's
a reasonable assumption, common
sense. They (the COP) are building
up their own power, which is not
what the COP is for. I don't know
what the COP involvement is," Paval
added.
"To my knowledge no one took
unfair advantage of the extension,"
Murphy said.
Larson commented, "The COP as a
whole isn't endorsing anybody."
However, Larson said, "Steve
(Westly) and I, also Anne (Henkels)
are very attached to the SOC."
Paval contradicted Larson's state
ment regarding COP noninvolve
ment, saying that "Pat Flynn is talking
about the senate chairmanship. He
never has run for the senate. He's
afraid he'll lose. Larson didn't think it
was a good idea (to run). I guess
that's really interference."
Paval added, "The chairman
should reflect the make-up of the se
nate. It can't be done by someone
who's the right-hand man for the
COP. The SOC is acting in its own
interest. The senate is not supposed
to be a proving ground."
The final result of the controversy
of deadline extension could be an
invalidation of the election. On this
topic, Paval said, "There are pos
sibilities. I can easily imagine some
people challenging the results." Lar
son commented, "The senate would
fail to certify the election."

With the ASSU Senate elections
now only a day away, last Monday's
candidate petition deadline exten
sion has been a source of candidate
squabbles.
The postponement of the filing
date for senate graduate candidates
from Monday, Oct. 3 to Wednesday,
Oct. 5 prompted questions as to
whether or not candidates may have
utilized the additional time to gain an
advantage.
Sean Murphy, ASSU election
commissioner, said the deadline ex
tension became necessary because
"as of 4:30 p.m., Oct. 3, there were
only nine graduate candidates." He
consulted with senate chairman Pat
Flynn and ASSU Co-presidents Greg
Larson and Steve Westly and found
the ASSU Constitution to be in con
flict with the extension, however.
The constitution states that candi
date petitions must be submitted
nine days before the day of the elec
tion, yet requires that the senate be
comprised of an equal number of
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents.
Unless the deadline was extended,
the senate balance would be lost.
Larson said that Murphy recalled the
1976 election, in which the election
commission established a precedent
by not abiding by the nine day rule.
Thus, the 48-hour addition was ap
proved by Murphy, and 11 more
graduate candidates filed petitions.
"Murphy contacted the original
candidates and told the nine that
they could reword their statements,"
Larson said. The action was out of
fairness to those who may have
rushed to meet the original deadline,
Larson indicated.
Murphy commented, "Constitu
tionally I am the only one to make
that decision."
Prior to confirmation in yester
day's Daily article, rumors existed
that a slate representing the Student
Organizing Committee was forming
among the graduate candidates. At

the time of the interview, the specu
lation was that a seven person slate
had formed.
Senate candidate John Paval said
the COP involvement in the senate
elections should have been "more
up front. I don't think that the senate
election is any of the COP's business.
It's tampering," Paval explained.
Paval said, "The COP slate was very
clean last year. The slates got elected
but the COP .vas not backing any.
This year the situation is different."
Paval said that while "Murphy has
acted with complete integrity," he
questions the COP. He "might have

made the same decision on his own.
There aren't any hard and fast rules
about what the COP can or cannot
do. . . . They will not admit to help
ing candidates. I know they are — it's
a reasonable assumption, common
sense. They (the COP) are building
up their own power, which is not
what the COP is for. I don't know
what the COP involvement is," Paval
added.
"To my knowledge no one took
unfair advantage of the extension,"
Murphy said.
Larson commented, "The COP as a
whole isn't endorsing anybody."
However, Larson said, "Steve
(Westly) and I, also Anne (Henkels)
are very attached to the SOC."
Paval contradicted Larson's state
ment regarding COP noninvolve
ment, saying that "Pat Flynn is talking
about the senate chairmanship. He
never has run for the senate. He's
afraid he'll lose. Larson didn't think it
was a good idea (to run). I guess
that's really interference."
Paval added, "The chairman
should reflect the make-up of the se
nate. It can't be done by someone
who's the right-hand man for the
COP. The SOC is acting in its own
interest. The senate is not supposed
to be a proving ground."
The final result of the controversy
of deadline extension could be an
invalidation of the election. On this
topic, Paval said, "There are pos
sibilities. I can easily imagine some
people challenging the results." Lar
son commented, "The senate would
