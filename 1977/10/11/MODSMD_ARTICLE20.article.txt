# Ramona's: the midnight snack
## 
### 
It's 10:30 — you've been
studying for at least 20 minutes
and you're ready for a break.
Vou grab some change, charge
out the door and make for the
vending machines. Unfortu
nately, you're not alone. By the
time you reach your destina
tion an angry crowd has
gathered. Rebellious murmurs
drive through the ranks as the
news becomes public — the
vending machines are empty.
Instinctively you and four
others head for the woman on
the second floor, the one with
the car.
The troops fall in and head
for the parking lot. Undaunted
by the size of her '67 MG, you
press on (or in?). Yet the situa
tion and the hunger pangs still
remain unresolved. Mutiny
threatens as suggestions of
Jack-in-the-Box, 31 Flavors and
McDonald's fail to sway the
group.

Suddenly, a voice rises
above the din and calls out,
"Ramona's." A concensus is fi
nally reached. Within five mi
nutes you're standing at the
door; the smell of pizza per
meates the air. You enter and
are greeted by a hostess who,
like the hanging ferns and
natural wood decor, is de
cidedly organic.
In keeping with the general
atmosphere of peace, sprouts
and macrame, the menu offers
a tempting range of
homemade soups, pizzas,
burgers, submarine and deli
sandwiches, and a fairly exten
sive wine and beer selection.
You and a friend order the
small Stromboli pizza (a ten
inch thick-crusted entree with
pepperoni, salami and two
kinds of sausage for $3.90),
while the others order a mus
hroom burger ($2.30), a bowl
of salad ($1.20), cheesecake

($1.25), and a Mango Bong (50
cents).
The salad bar is a well
appreciated departure from
the typical dorm counterpart.
After selecting from among
four dressings, your friend
quickly perceives the one in
evitable drawback — getting
everything to fit in one bowl
without looking like a pig and
without having the cherry to
matoes following rather than
accompanying her to the table.
One of your other compan
ions has in the meantime been
served a Mango Bong. The
fruity concoction is given a
mixed reception; the extrava
gance in cost far outweighs any
comparable extravagance in
taste.
The remaining orders are
still unfilled, and it is only after
a good 30-minute wait that they
are finally given entrance. The
mushroom burger is big and

good. Served on either a
french roll or homemade
wheat bread with a choice of
melted cheeses, the patty is
thick and the sauteed mus
hrooms savory.
The pizza is a well-seasoned
combination of cheeses and
meats but lacks that ample
quantity of tomato sauce which
distinguishes the great pizza
from the good. The crust how
ever, passes with flying colors;
thick and chewy, it's the kind
you want to eat even after
you've picked off all the
cheese. The cheesecake falls to
lesser fortunes and is likened
to frozen cottage cheese. The
meal is done and all appetites
are appeased.
The overall opinion is posi
tive but the slow service and
higher prices promise a con
tinued patronage of the dorm
vending machines.

Ibsen play joins "Julius Caesar" (opens Oct. 15) in repertory. W. Somerset Maugham's "The Circle"
opens in November.
It's 10:30 — you've been
studying for at least 20 minutes
and you're ready for a break.
Vou grab some change, charge
out the door and make for the
vending machines. Unfortu
nately, you're not alone. By the
time you reach your destina
tion an angry crowd has
gathered. Rebellious murmurs
drive through the ranks as the
news becomes public — the
vending machines are empty.
Instinctively you and four
others head for the woman on
the second floor, the one with
the car.
The troops fall in and head
for the parking lot. Undaunted
by the size of her '67 MG, you
press on (or in?). Yet the situa
tion and the hunger pangs still
remain unresolved. Mutiny
threatens as suggestions of
Jack-in-the-Box, 31 Flavors and
McDonald's fail to sway the
group.

Suddenly, a voice rises
above the din and calls out,
"Ramona's." A concensus is fi
nally reached. Within five mi
nutes you're standing at the
door; the smell of pizza per
meates the air. You enter and
are greeted by a hostess who,
like the hanging ferns and
natural wood decor, is de
cidedly organic.
In keeping with the general
atmosphere of peace, sprouts
and macrame, the menu offers
a tempting range of
homemade soups, pizzas,
burgers, submarine and deli
sandwiches, and a fairly exten
sive wine and beer selection.
You and a friend order the
small Stromboli pizza (a ten
inch thick-crusted entree with
pepperoni, salami and two
kinds of sausage for $3.90),
while the others order a mus
hroom burger ($2.30), a bowl
of salad ($1.20), cheesecake

($1.25), and a Mango Bong (50
cents).
The salad bar is a well
appreciated departure from
the typical dorm counterpart.
After selecting from among
four dressings, your friend
quickly perceives the one in
evitable drawback — getting
everything to fit in one bowl
without looking like a pig and
without having the cherry to
matoes following rather than
accompanying her to the table.
One of your other compan
ions has in the meantime been
served a Mango Bong. The
fruity concoction is given a
mixed reception; the extrava
gance in cost far outweighs any
comparable extravagance in
taste.
The remaining orders are
still unfilled, and it is only after
a good 30-minute wait that they
are finally given entrance. The
mushroom burger is big and

good. Served on either a
french roll or homemade
wheat bread with a choice of
melted cheeses, the patty is
thick and the sauteed mus
hrooms savory.
The pizza is a well-seasoned
combination of cheeses and
meats but lacks that ample
quantity of tomato sauce which
distinguishes the great pizza
from the good. The crust how
ever, passes with flying colors;
thick and chewy, it's the kind
you want to eat even after
you've picked off all the
cheese. The cheesecake falls to
lesser fortunes and is likened
to frozen cottage cheese. The
meal is done and all appetites
are appeased.
The overall opinion is posi
tive but the slow service and
higher prices promise a con
tinued patronage of the dorm
vending machines.
