Postal service predicts surplus
Washington — The Postal Service, experiencing
an unexpected rise in mail volume, is predicting a
budget surplus in fiscal 1979 for the first time since
the deficit-plagued agency was formed in 1971.
As a result, officials say postal rates will not have
to be increased as fast as previously thought.
The favorable predictions are in a report by
Senior Assistant Postmaster General Francis Biglin
to the service's ruling board.
The report says the volume of mail reached
nearly $2 billion pieces in the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, an increase of two billion over the previ
ous year. A five-year forecast in the report predicts
volume will continue rising to almost 100 billion by
fiscal 1981.
The changed outlook for mail volume has a
major effect on the financial picture for the agency
and on what it must charge the public in postal
rates.
With many of the agency's costs virtually the
same regardless of volume, more mail means
more revenue for the Postal Service and thus less
need to raise rates.
The new predictions of mail volume contrast
sharply with a series of gloomy predictions issued
previously.
Postmaster General Benjamin Bailar, speaking
on March 8, 1976, in Detroit, said, "Our mail vol
ume for 1976, slightly over 90 billion pieces, will
probably stand forever as our peak, for we project
that over the next five years volume will slump to
83 or 84 billion — and never recover."
Irish women win peace prize
Oslo, Norway — Two women antiwar activists in
Northern Ireland and Amnesty International, the
London-based organization that works to free
political prisoners, won Nobel peace prizes yes
terday.
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan were
awarded the 1976 prize for organizing a 14-
month-old "Peace People's" movement to end
years of fighting in their homeland between Pro
testant and Catholic extremists.
The 1977 prize went to Amnesty International for
its 16years of worldwide efforts to win freedom for
"prisoners of conscience" and abolish torture and
the death penalty.
Williams, 33, and Corrigan, 32, were the fourth
and fifth women to win the prize, awarded annu
ally by the Norwegian parliament, and the first
women recipients since American peace activist

Emily Balch shared it in 1946.
Administration considers tax cut
Washington — The Carter administration is con
sidering tax cuts of up to $22 billion as part of its tax
revision plan, Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal said yesterday.
But Blumenthal, emerging from a long meeting
with the president and his senior economic advis
ers, said no final decisions were reached on the
size of the tax breaks that will be part of the plan.
The $22 billion figure is "indeed one of the op
tions, but it is not necessarily the number" that will
be settled on, he said.
Although Blumenthal said the tax cut could
reach as high as $22 billion, other reports have
placed it in the range of $17 billion to $20 billion.
Administration sources have forecast that one
third of the tax cut would be for businesses and
two-thirds for individuals.
Dayan rejects PLO involvement
United Nations, N.Y. — Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Dayan set out a four-point plan yesterday
for peace with the Arabs. He also said his country
would never negotiate with the PLO and would
not return occupied land in the Gaza Strip or West
Bank of the Jordan River.
"Many delegations have proposed the estab
lishment of a Palestinian state governed by the
Palestine Liberation Organization in the West
Bank and Gaza," he told the General Assembly.
"This is but a futile exercise in wishful thinking,
totally unacceptable to us."
Dayan said any peace agreement "should be
based on our living together with the Palestinians
in those areas, and not on partition of the territ
ory."
The Carteradministration has endorsed the idea
of a Palestinian homeland and a joint U.S.-Soviet
declaration on the Middle East recognized "the
legitimate rights" of the Palestinians.
Dayan's proposals envision continued Israeli
control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, cap
tured from Egypt and jordan in the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war.
Brown urges admissions change
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown said yesterday
he will strive to see that all University of California
graduate and professional students are admitted
under the same criteria now reserved for some
minority applicants.
"We need a total examination based on the qual

ities of the individual applying," Brown told repor
ters following a Columbus Day ceremony on the
steps of Los Angeles City Hall.
Brown said he plans to use his influence as a
regent to set up new criteria for admissions.
"I would like to see the special admissions prog
ram criteria applied to each applicant," he said.
Brown reiterated yesterday that he hopes the
U.S. Supreme Court will reverse the Bakke deci
sion. Grades and examination scores are not by
themselves sufficient to forecast whether an
applicant will make a good doctor, he said.
"Somebody who had a C-plus average in college
but had to work to support his family might make a
better doctor than somebody who got straight As
but never had to work a day in his life," Brown
said.
GOP steals Carter's thunder
Bretton Woods, N.H. — Republican governors
announced yesterday the theme of their campaign
to increase their waning numbers — states' rights
versus the federal government. Ironically, it's the
same theme used by Democrat Jimmy Carter in
winning the presidency.
Gov. Robert Bennett of Kansas, chairman of the
Republican Governors Association, told GOP
office-holders and candidates at the opening ses
sion of the group's two-day annual meeting here
yesterday that states' rights is the issue of the fu
ture.
"If there is a hope for sanity in government, it
lies with the governors and with the individual
states, and not with the Congress and certainly,
under current circumstances, not with the White
House," Bennett said. "We meet at a time when
states' rights are seriously questioned at the na
tional level."
Carter used as a campaign theme the issue of a
federal government grown too large and a
bureaucracy too complex to serve the people.
