# Report criticizes U.S. energy plan
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The new De
partment of Energy has seriously
overestimated its ability to cope with
another cold winter and resulting
natural gas shortages, a congres
sional report says.
Federal officials have said they will
be able to make up 60 per cent of
expected shortages like those that
closed schools and factories last
winter.
But in a report released yesterday,
a Senate subcommittee said "the
federal government will not be in a
position to help very much," even
though it credited officials with
doing more than ever to deal with
anticipated shortages.
'Not ready'
The subcommittee on inter
governmental relations based its
conclusions on three days of hear
ings in which officials outlined a
Winter Emergency Energy Plan for
1977-78.
"Another cold winter is on its way
and we are not ready for what it may
bring," said Sen. Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine), the panel's chairman.
The report's authors said they
were impressed with both the detail
and scope of the emergency energy
plan, prepared by the Federal Energy
Administration.
The FEA's responsibilities have
been taken over by the new Depart
ment of Energy, which went into
existence on Oct. 1.
'Serious overestimate'
The subcommittee report said that
the mere existence of the plan repre
sents a far higher level of concern
than the federal government has
shown previously.
But at the same time it said the plan

"appears to seriously overestimate
the government's ability to increase
natural gas supplies and decrease
demand should another cold winter
bring about natural gas curtail
ments."
In any case, it concluded that fed
eral efforts, no matter how well
intentioned, may be too late to have
full effect this winter.
Significantly colder
Testifying at the subcommittee
hearings, government and private
long-term weather forecasters said
the nation can expect the coming
winter to be significantly colder than
normal, although not as cold as the
winter of 1976-77.
The report made five recommen
dations it said would improve the
administration's emergency plan:
—The administration should begin
negotiations immediately with
Canada to buy additional natural gas
this winter.
—Congress should enact legisla
tion granting President Jimmy Carter
authority to allocate natural gas
supplies.
—In order to protect jobs that
might otherwise be lost, Congress
should consider giving the president
power to re-allocate small amounts
of natural gas to pipelines experienc
ing shortfalls from those which are
not.
—The administration should ex
tend the Special Crisis Intervention
Program, which helped two million
persons pay last winter's increased
fuel bills.
—It should also urge the Depart
ment of Energy to act immediately to
ease the special problems affecting
the distribution of natural gas in New
England.

and we are not ready for what it may
bring," said Sen. Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine), the panel's chairman.
The report's authors said they
were impressed with both the detail
and scope of the emergency energy
plan, prepared by the Federal Energy
Administration.
The FEA's responsibilities have
been taken over by the new Depart
ment of Energy, which went into
existence on Oct. 1.
'Serious overestimate'
The subcommittee report said that
the mere existence of the plan repre
sents a far higher level of concern
than the federal government has
shown previously.
But at the same time it said the plan

"appears to seriously overestimate
the government's ability to increase
natural gas supplies and decrease
demand should another cold winter
bring about natural gas curtail
ments."
In any case, it concluded that fed
eral efforts, no matter how well
intentioned, may be too late to have
full effect this winter.
Significantly colder
Testifying at the subcommittee
hearings, government and private
long-term weather forecasters said
the nation can expect the coming
winter to be significantly colder than
normal, although not as cold as the
winter of 1976-77.
The report made five recommen
dations it said would improve the
administration's emergency plan:
—The administration should begin
negotiations immediately with
Canada to buy additional natural gas
this winter.
—Congress should enact legisla
tion granting President Jimmy Carter
authority to allocate natural gas
supplies.
—In order to protect jobs that
might otherwise be lost, Congress
should consider giving the president
power to re-allocate small amounts
of natural gas to pipelines experienc
ing shortfalls from those which are
not.
—The administration should ex
tend the Special Crisis Intervention
Program, which helped two million
persons pay last winter's increased
fuel bills.
—It should also urge the Depart
ment of Energy to act immediately to
ease the special problems affecting
the distribution of natural gas in New
England.
Washington (AP) — The new De
partment of Energy has seriously
overestimated its ability to cope with
another cold winter and resulting
natural gas shortages, a congres
sional report says.
Federal officials have said they will
be able to make up 60 per cent of
expected shortages like those that
closed schools and factories last
winter.
But in a report released yesterday,
a Senate subcommittee said "the
federal government will not be in a
position to help very much," even
though it credited officials with
doing more than ever to deal with
anticipated shortages.
'Not ready'
The subcommittee on inter
governmental relations based its
conclusions on three days of hear
ings in which officials outlined a
Winter Emergency Energy Plan for
1977-78.
"Another cold winter is on its way
and we are not ready for what it may
bring," said Sen. Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine), the panel's chairman.
