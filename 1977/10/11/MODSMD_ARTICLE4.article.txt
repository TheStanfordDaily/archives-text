# Trustees to consider budgets of University Hospital, Clinics
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Consideration of the operating
budgets of the University Hospital
and Clinics tops a busy agenda as the
Board of Trustees holds its regular
October meeting on campus today.
The board will also consider ap
proval of the plan to remode l the
Loeb Laboratory at Hopkins Marine
Station, a $6.8 million plan to im
prove Sand Hill Road, and the ilease
of 6.1 acres of University land near
Palo Alto Square among other busi
ness.
The trustees are expected to ap
prove the proposed $82 million
budget for the University hospital
which is expected to include a
surplus of about $3.5 million.
The net revenue figure for next
year is about $9 million more than the
hospital expects this year. The
surplus in the proposal is about
$500,000 more than this year's
surplus estimate.
University clinics will also ask for
budget approval with net revenue in
the proposal totaling $20 million. A
surplus is expected from the ci'inic
operation as well, but the $3.6 mill
ion will be a $1.5 million drop from
the estimated $5.1 million surplus
this year.
The Committee on Lands and

Buildings will hear much of the other
top business expected to come be
fore the board including an $811,000
proposal to remodel the Loeb
Laboratory at Hopkins Marine Sta
tion.
To be funded from the David and
Lucille Packard Fund, the project
would renovate the structure, origi
nally built in 1928, by March 1978.
The committee is also expected to
act on a proposal to implement a $6.8
million Sand Hill Road Improvement
Project.
The action, subject to approval by
the Palo Alto City Council, will widen
the thoroughfare from the end of
Sand Hill Road at Santa Cruz Avenue
in Menlo Park to El Camino Real in
Palo Alto.
The University and its tenants
along the route will pay $5.1 million
of the cost of the project. The re
maining $1.7 million will be financed
by the cities of Palo Alto, and Menlo
Park and S.in Mateo County.
In other action, the board is ex
pected to award lease of 6.1 acres of
Industrial Park land to Wheatley-
Johnson of Palo Alto.
The property, located at the rear of
Palo Alto Square, was originally to be
the site of a 250-room high-rise hotel.
The lessees of the land were unable

to use it for that, and the lease was
terminated, according to a
background report supplied to the
trustees.
Wheatley-Johnson plans to con
struct three multi-story buildings for
office and research space.
The Committee on Investments,
meeting yesterday afternoon, heard
a series of reports including an an
nual review of outside properties, a
semi-annual listing of the Universi
ty's security portfolio, a status report
on the Stanford Shopping Center
project, a review of returns the Uni
versity has received from different
investment media and a status report
on the study of costs and benefits of
divestment of South African-related
securities.
An agenda cover letter to the trus
tees from Assistant to the President
(trustee affairs) Robert Hamrdla
states that President Richard Lyman
will report the University staff's opin
ion about possible reduction of the
number of meetings of the board
during the year.
Following the meeting, nine board
members, including board president
Peter Bing, are scheduled to attend
sherry hours at various dormitories
and houses on campus, Hamrdla
said.
