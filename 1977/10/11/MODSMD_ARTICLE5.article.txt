# No funds for village site
## Still no after-school day care 
### Robert lames 
After-school day care will be unavailable for children
of the Stanford community for the second consecutive
year, due to abandonment of plans to fund the construc
tion of a suitable site in Escondido Village.
According to Isabella Romeo, president of the Stan
ford New After-School Program, the University with
drew its offer to finance the building of an addition to
the Escondido Village Community Center when contrac
tors' estimates of costs proved to be almost double the
architect's estimate of $70,000.
SNAP is the body responsible for the administration of
the day care center.
"There's no question that the SNAP project would
have met a need," said Mike Bever, manager of Escon
dido Village. He explained that the addition was origi
nally to have been paid for out of the Escondido repair
fund, but that there was significant opposition from
residents to reimbursing this fund through rent in
creases.
A proposal to allow SNAP to repay the construction
cost over a 10 year period became infeasible because of
the unexpectedly high construction bids.
Romeo, a graduate student living in Escondido, said
that the day-care program at Stanford for 5- to 9-year-old
children has not operated since the loss of the previous
location at Nixon Elementary School in 1975.
"We are now trying to find any place at all in the

Stanford area with the necessary facilities," she com
mented.
The community center facility would have been ideal,
Romeo explained, because of its proximity to Escondido
Elementary School and the children's homes.
A tuition fee of approximately $1 per child per hour
would have been charged to repay the University loan
and to employ one full-time and one part-time teacher.
Before the announcement of the loan cancellation this
summer, the fall program had been filled to capacity
with 50 children registered to participate.
Tim Royer, who had been affiliated with the Nixon
Elementary School project, had been employed to ad
minister the new center, which was to have begun oper
ation last month.
Currently, said Romeo, Escondido Village parents
primarily rely on babysitters for child supervision. This
service, however, is too expensive for the typical
graduate student, she stated, and does not provide lor
administered activities and projects.
Although there are two day care centers for pre
school children in the Stanford area (the Escondido Vil
lage Nursery School and the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community), the nearest after school child
care programs are in Palo Alto, said Romeo.
"Either busing or car pools would be necessary
there," she maintained, "and this would be difficult to
arrange."

Lack of funding for construction of a day-care facility in Escondido Village has
once again prevented after-school day care from being provided for community
children. Children shown here attend the Escondido Village Nursery School, one
of two schooltime day-care centers on campus. At this point the closest after
school programs are in Palo Alto and parents must rely on babysitters.
