## Fee Assessments: 
### 
ASSU Recycling Center —
Yes
Students will be voting tomorrow and
Thursday on two fee assessments. One is for a
$2 ($1 for both winter and spring quarters) fee
assessment to start an ASSU Recycling Center.
This center is planned to fill the gap left by
termination of another recycling service and
will pick-up, store and sell recyclable mate
rials such as glass, metals and newspapers.
The center hopes to become self-sufficient
and to expand in the future throughout cam
pus. However, the center needs a large lump
sum payment until it can pay for itself and to
pay back a University loan.
We support this fee assessment, with some
reservations. We believe in recycling projects
in general, and we like the idea of a student
operated center here. We think most students
are in favor of recycling. However, we hope
those who want a recycling project here will
not only vote Yes but will also continue to
supply the center with recyclable materials in
the years to come, because a major shortage
of materials will jeopardize the existence of
the center.
The center should break even within a year,
based on research we've seen. And we like the
statement of its proponents that, barring
major disaster, this will be the first and last fee
assessment on this matter.

We do hope, however, that if the center has
large earnings in a few years as is possible in
the recycling industry, and if further expan
sion is no longer possible, then the project's
officers will consider paying residence units
for recyclable materials, or channeling some
of the earnings back into the ASSU.
We also hope the center's staff will do its
utmost to purchase a pickup truck for the
$1800 stated in the budget.
One final note : considering the amount of
money which students are being asked to
give, we believe the project's sponsors could
have distributed more information to stu
dents concerning the project's finances. We
also would have preferred a better job of in
forming campus groups about the project.
Speakers Bureau — Yes
Students will be voting on two fee assess
ments tomorrow and Thursday. For $1 winter
quarter refundable fee assessment for the
Speakers Bureau, we recommend a Yes vote.
This year the bureau's staff has done its
homework and appears to be in good shape to
bring some exciting speakers to the campus in
the coming months. The bureau is also at
tempting to help line up other speakers'
series. Our only reservation with the assess
ment is that the final selection of speakers for
the previous two years has not been all it
could have been.

homework and appears to be in good shape to
bring some exciting speakers to the campus in
the coming months. The bureau is also at
tempting to help line up other speakers'
series. Our only reservation with the assess
ment is that the final selection of speakers for
the previous two years has not been all it
could have been.
ASSU Recycling Center —
Yes
Students will be voting tomorrow and
Thursday on two fee assessments. One is for a
$2 ($1 for both winter and spring quarters) fee
assessment to start an ASSU Recycling Center.
This center is planned to fill the gap left by
termination of another recycling service and
will pick-up, store and sell recyclable mate
rials such as glass, metals and newspapers.
The center hopes to become self-sufficient
and to expand in the future throughout cam
pus. However, the center needs a large lump
sum payment until it can pay for itself and to
pay back a University loan.
We support this fee assessment, with some
reservations. We believe in recycling projects
in general, and we like the idea of a student
operated center here. We think most students
are in favor of recycling. However, we hope
those who want a recycling project here will
not only vote Yes but will also continue to
supply the center with recyclable materials in
the years to come, because a major shortage
of materials will jeopardize the existence of
the center.
The center should break even within a year,
based on research we've seen. And we like the
statement of its proponents that, barring
major disaster, this will be the first and last fee
assessment on this matter.

We do hope, however, that if the center has
large earnings in a few years as is possible in
the recycling industry, and if further expan
sion is no longer possible, then the project's
officers will consider paying residence units
for recyclable materials, or channeling some
of the earnings back into the ASSU.
We also hope the center's staff will do its
utmost to purchase a pickup truck for the
$1800 stated in the budget.
One final note : considering the amount of
money which students are being asked to
give, we believe the project's sponsors could
have distributed more information to stu
dents concerning the project's finances. We
also would have preferred a better job of in
forming campus groups about the project.
Speakers Bureau — Yes
Students will be voting on two fee assess
ments tomorrow and Thursday. For $1 winter
quarter refundable fee assessment for the
Speakers Bureau, we recommend a Yes vote.
This year the bureau's staff has done its
homework and appears to be in good shape to
bring some exciting speakers to the campus in
the coming months. The bureau is also at
tempting to help line up other speakers'
series. Our only reservation with the assess
ment is that the final selection of speakers for
the previous two years has not been all it
could have been.
