# No Bonfire, please
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) will meet to decide whether
there should be a Big Game Bonfire this
November. We don't wish to start another
round of charges and countercharges about
the need for a Bonfire, but rather we wish to
point out one fact to the IFC.
California is in the midst of a severe
drought, and both Stanford and its surround
ing communities are attempting to cope with
dead trees, bushes and lawns. Several dead

trees are near Lake Lagunita, the site of the
Bonfire.
Thus, for reasons of fire safety, we strongly
urge the IFC to vote against having this year's
Bonfire. We are sure they can foresee the
damage which could result from errant sparks
emanating from the Bonfire.
We hope the IFC will instead direct its ener
gies and money into organizing other Big
Game week activities or in assisting those that
are currently being planned.
