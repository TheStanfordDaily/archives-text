# Get involved through school committees
## 
### 
Westly et al.

So, you say you want to get in
volved? There is no better way to
learn about the University and get
involved in the University structure
than by working on a committee.
Why are committees so great? There
are several reasons why committee
work can be the most rewarding type
of involvement in the University.
First, it's an ideal way for new stu
dents — freshmen, transfers and
first-year graduates — to get in
volved. It's ideal because there are
special internships open to new stu

dents that require no prior experi
ence in the University, but only a
positive and enthusiastic attitude.
Second, committee work offers
you the most amazingly diverse
choice of fields, ranging from pro
tecting the University community
against the viral hazards of DNA re
search to the threat of library theft.
There are also openings on commit
tees dealing with parking, public
events, education, employment of
women and quite possibly any other
pet grievances you may have with the

University.
Finally, working on committees of
fers you an excellent chance to find
out how the University operates, and
more importantly, what sort of
people operate the University.
Whether you have classes of 500 or
five, neither will give you the oppor
tuni'ty to actually get to know faculty
and administrators on an informal
basis and work with them over a long
period of time.
In short, working on a committee
can provide you with unique experi
ence's not to be found elsewhere in
the University. So, why don't you get
involved? Applications can be picked
up in the ASSU office on the second
floor of Tresidder Union. The dead
line! for turning in applications is Fri
day , Oct. 14.
In an effort to get as many students
involved in the ASSU on as many pro
jects as possible, we pledged to run a
list of issues that the four of us will be
working on during the rest of our
term. If you are interested in these
issues or any aspect of them, please
call the ASSU office (497-4331) so we
can begin working together.
Even more important are the many
issues which affect all of us, but
which we simply do not have time to
work on. However, as the executive

body of the ASSU, we do have the
knowledge and resources to help
you undertake any of the following
projects, or any other projects you
may be interested in.
In either case, come to the ASSU
office and get involved. Our office is
open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day and
one night a week.
Some of the issues we will be work
ing on (but still need help with) are:
student internships, teaching re
source center, advising, student
spouse rights, Bakke, coalition of in
dependent theme houses, ongoing
house associate (RA) orientation,
Western Culture requirement and
gay rights.
Issues we will not have time to
work on are: student organizations'
space, undergraduate research op
portunities, putting grass in the
Quad, graduate student association,
national energy conservation lobby,
creating a student information
center, developing ties between stu
dents and the United Stanford
Employees, graduate "Entering Stan
ford" booklet and reinstitution of
Dead Week.
