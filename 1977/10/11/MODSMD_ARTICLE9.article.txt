Goode's comment inane
Sociology Prof. William Goode's
comment, "The art in California is
incredibly bad" (Daily, Oct. 5),
strikes me as inane.
His further aside about West Coast
provincialism clearly reflects a New
York City cultural chauvinism which
is all too familiar to non-New Yor
kers.
By employing the tiresome cliche
"provincialism" to characterize such
a complex thing as culture on the
West Coast, Coode demonstrates

that as yet he understands precious
little about what is going on out here.
Tact alone, one would have thought,
should have prevented him from in
dulging himself in such simplistic
dribble.
Evidently, though, tough-minded
New Yorkers put little stock in this.
Professor Goode's remarks offended
those of us who are doing our best to
promote and enrich our cultural en
vironment.
