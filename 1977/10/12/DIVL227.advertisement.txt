A career in law
without law school.
What can you do with only a bachelor's degree?
Now there is a way to bridge the gap between an
undergraduate education and a challenging, responsible
career. The Lawyer's Assistant is able to do work tradi
tionally done by lawyers.
Three months of intensive training can give you the
skills—the courses are taught by lawyers. You choose
one of the seven courses offered—choose the city in
which you want to work.
Since 1970, The Institute for Paralegal Training has
placed more than 2,000 graduates in law firms, banks,
and corporations in over 80 cities.
; If you are a senior of high academic standing and are
interested in a career as a Lawyer's Assistant, we'd like
to meet you.
