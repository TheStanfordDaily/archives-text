# Senate, fees election to commence today

### Sara Lessley 
ASSU Senate elections start today
in six polling places across campus.
In addition to the 41 undergraduate
candidates and the 20 graduate can
didates on the ballot, voters will also
be asked to vote on fee assessments
for an ASSU recycling center and for
the Speakers Bureau.
Undergraduates and graduates
will each elect 10 senators and 10 al
ternates. These elections will be cer
tified regardless of voter turnout,
said Elections Commissioner Sean
Murphy.
However, fee assessments require
a simple majority and a voter turnout
of at least 20 per cent of the student
body to pass. This means approxi
mately 2500 ballots must be cast for
the fee assessment votes to be cer
tified, Murphy said.
Usually about 300 votes are
needed to elect an undergraduate
senator, said ASSU Co-president
Steve Westly, while 100 votes for a
graduate candidate would virtually
assure "a startling first place finish."
Westly added that he expects more
students to turn out and vote, be
cause the "ASSU has been more ac
tive this year, and the COP (Council
of Presidents) has been more vocal."
He added that normally 18 per cent to
25 per cent of the students vote. Last
year's turnout was 2889.
Murphy said he "honestly can't
say" what time campus election re
sults will be in Thursday. Ballots will
be counted by hand, not by compu
ter as was done last year.
"The person who designed the
computer program was no longer in
terested in doing it," Murphy said.
At present 60 labor hours are allo
cated to counting votes. Labor hours

are determined by how many ballots
a person can count and recheck in
one hour, Murphy explained.
The results of the overseas cam
puses ballots will be cabled here Fri
day, he added.
Although three student positions
would be open on the Student Con
duct Legislative Council if it con
vened this quarter, no candidates for
the posts are listed on the ballots.
(The council was active last year in
revising the Honor Code.)
In a letter to President Richard
Lyman earlier this month, ASSU Se
nate Chairman Pat Flinn said no elec
tion will be held for the posts be
cause of "an administrative over
sight."
However, the chairman of the
SCLC, Dr. jarnes McClenahan, said
he foresees no issue in the coming
quarter that would require conven
ing the SCLC.
Flinn added that "not a single stu
dent came in asking for a petition for
the SCLC and there were no inquiries
about it."
If necessary, the ASSU could hold
another election to elect SCLC
members, Flinn said.
Polling areas will be located in var
ious spots on campus. There will be
one in front of the post office and
one by the engineering corner, both
open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wed
nesday and Thursday. During lunch
there will be a polling spot in the
Medical Center.
Several more polls will be situated
near the physics tank from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. and at Escondido on the
corner of Campus and Serra (9 a.m.
to 2 p.m.) and in the inner courtyard
of the GSB (10 a.m. to 2 p.m.).
