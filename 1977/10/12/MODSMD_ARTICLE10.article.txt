# Argument specious in Bakke case
## 
### 
Hilbert Morales

It was with some interest that I read
Richard Fearon's column "Equal
Chance for All — Bakke Decision
Valid" (Daily, Oct. 4).
I find Bakke's argument specious
when one considers that all medical
schools to which he applied rejected
his candidacy. Most admissions
committees use a mosaic of criteria
to select their students. The mosaic
contains testing scores, grades
(especially in the hard sciences of
physics, chemistry, math, and biol
ogy), demonstrated social abilities
and concerns, ability to communi
cate with sympathy and compassion,
emotional stability and maturity, abil
ity to "contribute" to the class, the
confidential opinions of their refer
ences, their personal goals, opinions
of interviewers, etc.
These same admissions commit
tees have the responsibility to (1)
admit no one with a high probability
of failing, (2) to train a professional
who will be of service to society in
general and (3) to insure that the

teaching resources of the institution
are not wasted. Somewhere in this
mosaic of concerns and responsibil
ity, Allan Bakke was found to be "un
acceptable as a candidate."
Thus, Allan Bakke's charge that
UC-Davis had discriminated against
him, in violation of the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, because he was white,
is one of great personal interest to
me.
UC-Davis, in an effort to execute
the social mandate to train physi
cians whose identity and origin were
those of the "disadvantaged" seg
ment of society, was justified in using
race as a criteria and also justified in
allocating 16 per cent of its class to be
filled by "disadvantaged students."
It was, after all, complying with "Af
firmative Action" guidelines and the
requirements of "per capitation"
subsidies. Society has a right and an
obligation to perform "evolutionary
social engineering."
One point that is missed by Bakke
is that as an applicant to a profes
sional school he cannot ever be as
sured of "equal protection." Profes
sional schools have a franchise from
the state and its society to train indi
viduals to become the next profes
sionals. The qualifications presented
here traditionally included race. In
the past if one was a non-white, this
criteria alone served to "de-select"
the non-white candidate. The same
was true if one was a female candi
date.
Let us not forget that not too long
ago, foreign-trained medical
graduates and black physicians were
not permitted to have hospital house
staff privileges, nor to belong to the
American Medical Association. In
fact, black physicians were forced to
organize their own national medical
associations. Individuals of Jewish
heritage were also "de-selected" in
the past. At the moment white
Anglo-Saxon Protestant males must
compete with an applicant pool
which includes a greater cross sec
tion of our pluralistic American soci

ety. We do believe in fair competi
tion, do we not? Let's not create laws
which perpetuate past traditions.
There have been several myths
presented in the media regarding the
medical school process. I would
challenge your news media to begin
a process of public education with
respect to the following four myths,
as I believe the public has a right to
know all facets concerning the pro
cess:
—Myth: "Qualified" Anglo stu
dents are rejected; "unqualified"
minority students are accepted. Fact:
Most criteria (basis for "qualified")
taken separately are invalid in terms
of the end product, i.e., a compe
tent, sensitive clinician who com
municates to his patient in terms of
his/her ethos.
—Myth: Anglos are displaced from
health professional schools by
minorities. Fact: Nationally there has
been a 47 per cent increase in Anglo
admissions since 1968. In fact we
need more medical schools since we
"import" about 5000 foreign-trained

medical graduates per year ("brain
drain"?).
—Myth: Most "unqualified"
minority students admitted because
of affirmative admissions do poorly
in health professional school, and
many drop out. It is a waste of tax
payer's money. Fact: More than 90
per cent graduate and presumably
do become fully licensed.
—Myth: "Once minority students
become trained they will go to sub
urbia and make a lot of money; they
will not return to practice where they
are needed." Fact: Over 80 per cent
do practice in health manpower
shortage areas.
Much is wrong with our health
care delivery system; much is good
about it. The recent ability of medical
schools to select for training as
physicians those competitive indi
viduals who are female or who are
members of minority groups is one
of the positive, simple changes
which must not be abrogated.
