# KZSU, KFJC make joint application

The long wait could be near
ing its end for KZSU's power
increase, according to Jon
Morris, general manager.
In the past, the major
stumbling block to Federal
Communications Commission
approval of a power boost from
40 to 500 watts on FM has been
interference with nearby
Foothill College campus radio
station KFJC.
The latest FCC application,
however, has been made
jointly with KFJC, with each sta
tion asking for a power in
crease. KZSU broadcasts at
90.1 FM, while KFJC is only 0.4
megahertz away at 89.7 FM.
If the increases are ap
proved, neither station's
broadcast range would be af
fected by the other on its cam
pus, and both would have
clearer reception in their own
areas.
In addition, KZSU's signal
would carry as far as South
San Francisco and San Jose with
the power boost, said Morris.
This last application was filed
over a year ago and is the first
to be approved for filing with
the FCC, according to station
management.
KZSU's application for a
power increase in 1972 was not
accepted by the FCC due to
technical errors in the applica
tion, said one station official.
Another application was
voluntarily withdrawn because
KFJC was not party to the
application and the FCC could
have turned down the applica
tion on the grounds of inter
ference, according to the offi
cial.
KZSU has already spent sev
eral hundred dollars for legal
and consulting fees as well as
new equipment to handle the
greater power output.
Most of the new equipment
has already been purchased
except for an air conditioning
unit for the new equipment,
said Morris.
