# SF suit charges bias in IQ testing
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Black
children have been dispropor
tionately segregated in classes
for the mentally retarded be
cause of the use of culturally
biased IQ tests in California
schools, attorneys charged in
federal court here yesterday.
The charges came at the start
of trial on a class action suitthat
may have national impact be
cause of the head-on challenge
of widely-used and time
honored tests of intelligence.
The central issue in the case
is the placement of six black
San Francisco school children
in classes for the "educable
mentally retarded" because of
low scores on standardized IQ
tests.
Attorneys for the youngsters
told U.S. District Judge Robert
Peckham they would show that
the state Department of Educa
tion had "an intention to dis
criminate against black chil
dren" because the IQ tests
used failed to take into account
the language and experience
of blacks.
The hot issue of whether
race affects IQ surfaced in
opening remarks yesterday,
but it was uncertain whether

the genetic controversy would
be argued directly in the case.
Since the suit was filed in
1971, Peckham has ordered
schools in San Francisco and
later across the state to stop
using IQ scores to place blacks
in the special classes, pending
resolution of the case.
When the suit was filed, 66.5
per cent of the students in the
classes were black, while 28.5
per cent of the total school
population were blacks.
The six plaintiffs had scored
below 75 on standard IQ tests.
But the children scored from 17
to 35 points higher when they
were retested by black
psychologists who revised the
wording of the tests to better
reflect the lifestyle of the chil
dren.
Attorneys for the NAACP and
Public Advocates are part of
the legal team for the plaintiffs.
Defendants in the case in
clude both the state and San
Francisco school superinten
dents and the state and city
school boards.
The defense declined open
ing statements yesterday, but
in briefs has said it will argue
the disproportion of blacks in

the classes results from many
factors, including poor nutri
tion and poor home environ
ment.
"The genetic issue is not to
be raised in this case," Joanne
Conda, deputy state attorney
general, told the judge yester
day.

She said the defense now re
futed an argument they raised
in earlier briefs that referred to
the possibility of "a poorer
genetic pool for all races ghet
toized in the inner city" as an
explanation of the higher per
centage of blacks in the clas
ses.

may have national impact be
cause of the head-on challenge
of widely-used and time
honored tests of intelligence.
The central issue in the case
is the placement of six black
San Francisco school children
in classes for the "educable
mentally retarded" because of
low scores on standardized IQ
tests.
Attorneys for the youngsters
told U.S. District Judge Robert
Peckham they would show that
the state Department of Educa
tion had "an intention to dis
criminate against black chil
dren" because the IQ tests
used failed to take into account
the language and experience
of blacks.
The hot issue of whether
race affects IQ surfaced in
opening remarks yesterday,
but it was uncertain whether

the genetic controversy would
be argued directly in the case.
Since the suit was filed in
1971, Peckham has ordered
schools in San Francisco and
later across the state to stop
using IQ scores to place blacks
in the special classes, pending
resolution of the case.
When the suit was filed, 66.5
per cent of the students in the
classes were black, while 28.5
per cent of the total school
population were blacks.
The six plaintiffs had scored
below 75 on standard IQ tests.
But the children scored from 17
to 35 points higher when they
were retested by black
psychologists who revised the
wording of the tests to better
reflect the lifestyle of the chil
dren.
Attorneys for the NAACP and
Public Advocates are part of
the legal team for the plaintiffs.
Defendants in the case in
clude both the state and San
Francisco school superinten
dents and the state and city
school boards.
The defense declined open
ing statements yesterday, but
in briefs has said it will argue
the disproportion of blacks in

the classes results from many
factors, including poor nutri
tion and poor home environ
ment.
"The genetic issue is not to
be raised in this case," Joanne
Conda, deputy state attorney
general, told the judge yester
day.

She said the defense now re
futed an argument they raised
in earlier briefs that referred to
the possibility of "a poorer
genetic pool for all races ghet
toized in the inner city" as an
explanation of the higher per
centage of blacks in the clas
ses.
San Francisco (AP) — Black
children have been dispropor
