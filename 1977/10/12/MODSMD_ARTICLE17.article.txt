New York (AP) — Paul Blair,
inserted in the ninth inning for
his defense, drilled a
inning single into left field to
score Willie Randolph with the
winning run as the New York
Yankees nipped the Los
Angeles Dodgers 4-3 last night
in a thrilling opening game of
the 1977 World Series.
Sparky Lyle retired 11 con
secutive batters after surren
dering a game-tying pinch
single to Lee Lacy in the ninth
and nailed down the victory in
relief of Don Gullett, who
pitched a courageous BV3 in
nings in a tough duel with the
Dodgers' Don Sutton.
When the game went into
extra innings, the Yankees
twice put leadoff men on first
base but were unable to move
them against reliever Mike
Carman as reserve catcher
Jerry Grote thwarted two sac
rifice attempts with dazzling
defensive plays.
In the 12th, Randolph
opened with a double on the
first pitch from Rick Rhoden,
the fifth Los Angeles pitcher.
Rhoden walked Thurman
Munson, who had doubled
home what seemed to be the
winning run four innings ear
lier. That brought up Blair, who
had replaced Reggie Jackson in
right field in the ninth inning.
Again, the Yankees tried to
bunt, but Blair simply couldn't
get the ball down. When the
count went to 2-2, the veteran
outfieldergotthe hit signand
that's exactly what he did, lin
ing a pitch into left field to
bring Randolph dashing home

with the decisive run of the
series opener.
It was the longest opening
game in World Series play and
the 100 th Series triumph in
Yankees history. Few of the
first 99 could have been more
dramatic.
The Dodgers, trailing by a
run going into the ninth, came
back to tie the score on Lacy's
pinch single against Lyle.
Dusty Baker opened the
Dodgers' ninth with a single to
left, only the fifth hit against
Gullett, who had pitched bril
liantly.
Steve Yeager walked — mov
ing Baker, the tying run, into
scoring position.
That finished Gullett, and
Lyle — hero of the American
League playoffs — came on to
face Lacy. It was a showdown
between the Yankees' ace re
liever and a utility man who
batted just .266 in only 75
games all season.
But the utility man won the
confrontation, ripping a single
to left that scored Baker with
the tying run.
New York had gone ahead in
the bottom of the eighth when
Randolph, who had tied the
game at 2-2 in the sixth with a
leadoff home run, opened with
a walk against Dodgers starter
Sutton.
Munson, the Yankees cap
tain, drove the nexi pitch into
the left-field corner for a dou
ble. Randolph was running on
the pitch and scored easily
from first base, putting New
York ahead 3-2.
