# Poloists drown UOP, 15-4

### Brad Brockbank 
Extending its winning streak
to 25 games, the Stanford water
polo team beat the University
of Pacific, 15-4, yesterday at
deGuerre pool.
Junior varsity coach Mike
MacNama, filling in for head
coach Dante Dettamanti who
was attending a meeting, said
the game was a "rather sloppy"
one for the Cards.
"When you play a team
that's not as good, you tend to
play at their level. We did that
today," MacNama said.
The Cards' lackadaisical play
ing was evident from the early
minutes of the game but, as
senior Brian Avery explained,
the team was really looking
forward to Friday's game
against Berkeley.
After a slow first quarter in
which the Cards pulled out to a

3-0 lead, the poloists erupted
for six goals in both the second
and third quarters. Leading
15-3 going into the final period,
MacNama emptied his bench,
letting the second string play
the entire fourth quarter.
Junior Robby Arnold, con
tinuing his hot streak, scored
three goals in the first half of
the game to share leading
scorer honors with sophomore
Michael Phillips, who scored
three in the second half.
Arnold now has scored three
goals in each of the last three
games.
Freshman goalie John Gan
sel, who gave way to freshman
Alan Launerat halftime, had six
saves in two quarters to keep
up his average of three saves
per quarter.
Gansel has also continued to
improve on his ability to come

out of the goal to break up pas
ses and inside water plays,
MacNama said.
Senior Marty Davis, who
made two exceptional passes
that resulted in goals, scored
one himself just at the halftime
buzzer by executing a perfect
lob shot from more than 10
meters out.
"Marty seems to be getting
his shooting eye back," Mac-
Nama said.
If so, Cal may find them
selves having a lot of problems
on Friday. With juniors Arnold
and Doug Burke scoring al
most at will and senior Rick
Johannsen and junior Tom
Angelo consistently putting in
one or two goals per game, the
addition of Davis as a scoring
threat may have the Bears run
ning back to the woods.
