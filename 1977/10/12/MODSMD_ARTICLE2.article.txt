# COP labels charges of impropriety 'unfair'
## 
### 
ASSU Co-President Greg Larson
yesterday labelled as "unfair"
charges that he and other ASSU offi
cials acted improperly in advising
ASSU Elections Commissioner Sean
Murphy to extend the deadline for
filing graduate senate candidacy pet
itions.
It was reported in yesterday's Daily
that some graduate senate candi
dates were upset by the extension
and felt the extension was improper
and politically motivated.
Larson said it was "just not the
case" that he, Council of Presidents
(COP) member Steve Westly and Se
nate Chairman Pat Flinn did some
thing wrong when they advised
Murphy to announce a two-day ex
tension.
The decision was announced by
Murphy Oct. 3.
In the Daily article, graduate se
nate candidate John Paval was
quoted in a manner which intimated
misconduct.
Paval characterized the quotes as
"out of context and slanted to suit
the purposes of a story . . . which
was not mine.
"A smattering of quotations from
an hour-long discussion of the ongo
ing senate campaign was trans
formed into a brief polemic," Paval
said.
Larson explained the extension
was the result of a crisis which de
veloped on the afternoon of Oct. 3,
the original filing deadline.
Murphy told Westly, Larson and
Flynn, all present at the COP offices

at the time, that only nine persons
had filed petitions for candidacy for
the graduate senate seats, Larson
said.
The situation created a constitu
tional conflict because the document
requires a 20-person senate with half
graduate and half undergraduate
representation. Yet it also requires
nine days between the candidacy fil
ing deadline and the election.
"We felt the former was more im
portant," Larson said. As a result, he
said, Westly, he and Flynn recom
mended to Murphy that he extend
the deadline two days.
Larson said they further recom
mended notifying the graduate can
didates and allowing them to alter
their campaign statements during
the extension.
Murphy said he did contact all the
graduates out of fairness to those
who may have rushed in order to
meet the original deadline.
Allegations had been made that
the extension decision was urged by
the COP in order to allow graduates
associated with the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee (SOC) addi
tional time to put together a slate.
Larson stressed that the recom
mendation was apolitical. "The COP
is not endorsing any candidate or
slate of candidates," he said.
"We have individual preferences,
and to deny those preferences exist
is unrealistic," Larson said. "But we
are not and do not support ASSU
supporting any one candidate in any
way that is not available to all candi
