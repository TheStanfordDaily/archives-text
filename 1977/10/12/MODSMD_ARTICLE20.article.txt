# Benjamin likely starter Saturday

Steve Dils, after a fantastic
game last Saturday leading
Stanford to a 32-28 victory over
UCLA, will be back at his nor
mal spot this weekend when
the Cardinals meet
Washington — on the bench.
Stanford coach Bill Walsh
has listed preseason All-
America quarterback Guy Ben
jamin as the probable starter
for Saturday's game in Seattle.
"We expect Guy to play
Saturday," Walsh said Mon
day. "If he's declared fit and is
ready to play, he'll start."
Benjamin missed the UCLA
contest with a sprained knee
which he sustained in the
fourth quarter of the Cards'
Pacific-8 opener Oct. 8 with
Oregon.
The N0.2-ranked passer in
the nation, Benjamin practiced
at full speed with the Cards
Monday and yesterday.
"Guy Benjamin practiced
with the team and participated

in all the drills," Walsh said
after yesterday's practice.
No Christiansen
"We just have one quarter
back each week," Walsh told
sportswriters Monday. "The
importance of having a single
quarterback is not during the
game, but at practice."
Walsh said the single
quarterback theory is a Paul
Brown axiom. Walsh coached
under Brown for eight years
with the Cincinnati Bengals.
The first-year Stanford mentor
added that rotating quarter
backs dilutes the practice time
for the player that starts that
Saturday and does not allow
proper preparation for a game.
Walsh's philosophy is a
marked contrast to his coach
ing counterpart across the Bay,
California's Mike White. White

has used four different quar
terbacks this season and pre
pares as many as three for ac
tion on any given week.
Walsh, on the other hand,
will prepare just one quarter
back for this week's game —
Benjamin.
Feels good
"He (Benjamin) feels right
this minute that he's able to
play," Walsh said. "The doctor
has given him the OK."
Walsh said Benjamin will not
play if he's not 100 per cent
healthy. "We wouldn't jeopar
dize Guy's career for a single
collegiate football game."
Should Benjamin not be
healthy, his understudy Dils
will be waiting in the wings
prepared to direct Stanford's
offensive show.
Last Saturday in his first var

sity start, the 6-foot-2, 180-
pounder completed 24 of 37
passes for 287 yards, one
touchdown and no intercep
tions.
"Steve played an excellent
game," Walsh said. "He threw
the ball well and showed great
poise. He made some very
good decisions on the field."
Nelson, Player of Week
Dils was nominated for the
Pacific-8 Conference Offensive
Player of the Week for his play
Saturday, but that honor went
to teammate Darrin Nelson.
Nelson ran for 189 yards and
two touchdowns. He became
the first freshman in Stanford

annals to rush for more than
100 yards and his yardage was
the third highest total ever
amassed by a Stanford runner
in a single game.
He also caught four passes
for 37 yards and threw the
block which sprung Phil Fran
cis' three-yard touchdown in
the second quarter.
The amazing freshman now
ranks second in the NCAA in
all-purpose rushing (yardage
from runs, pass receptions and
punt and kickoff returns) with
169.8 yards a game, ninth in
pass receiving with five a game
and 26th in rushing with 102.2
yards a contest.
Walk-on punter Brad Fox has
also broken into the NCAA
rankings. His 44.4-yard average
ranks fifth in the nation.
Card notes . . . Nevada
oddsmakers established
Washington as three-point
favorites yesterday.
Steve Howe and Mitch Pleis
have been named co-captains
for Saturday's game. Howe
played what Walsh termed
"the best game of his career"
against UCLA making 12 tack
les from his defensive tackle
spot. Tight end Pleis caught
three passes and was com
mended by Walsh for his out
standing blocking.
