### Chris Haft 
The Stanford women's var
sity volleyball team resumes
action this week with a chal
lenging slate of three games in
three nights.
Coach Art Lambert's women
will visit Santa Clara nnight,
travel to Cal tomorrov. and
then return home for a 7:30
p.m. Maples Pavilion en
counter with USC.
Interestingly, the order of
this week's schedule resem
bles an ascending ladder of ta
lent.
Santa Clara probably won't
be a difficult opponent; Lam
bert terms the Broncos as
"very, very weak." California
will be formidable. The Bears
recently defeated San lose
State, a team favored to win its
league.
USC, however, tops them
all. As the reigning AIAW
champions, the Trojans have
won their last 24 matches. Led
by Debbie Green and Debbie
Landrith, USC will be Stan
ford's toughest opponents this
season.
With the season still young,
the team is still honing its fun
damentals during practices.
This week coach Lambert will
be looking for consistent
execution of the basics, and
even a little more. "I expect
tremendous performances, as
always, and continual im
provement," he said.
The squad is partly hindered
by injuries this week, with Jane
Bassett (twisted ankle), loline
Esparza (arm problems) and
Carol Dougherty (sprained
ankle) below par physically.
Yet Lambert said he believes
they should see some action in
this week's series.
