Black Reps urge reversal of Bakke
Washington — The Supreme Court, preparing to hear argu
ments in a controversial civil rights case, was urged by 11 black
members of Congress yesterday to issue "a strong forthright"
endorsement of affirmative action programs to insure jobs and
schooling for racial minorities.
In an indirect way, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission made
the same plea as it released a report defending such programs
as necessary to compensate minorities and women for past
discrimination.
The Congressional Black Caucus and the commission took
their positions in advance of oral arguments scheduled today in
the Supreme Court in the case of the regents of the University
of California versus Allan Bakke.
The 11 black House members who compose the Congres
sional Black Caucus urged the high court to reverse the Califor
nia decision and affirm the constitutionality of the university
program.
North Yemeni president assassinated
Nicosia, Cyprus — Unidentified assassins killed North Yemeni
President Ibrahim al-Hamdi and his brother, Col. Abdullah
Mohammed al-Hamdi, North Yemen's government-run Sana'a
radio reported.
The radio said a three-man presidential council was formed
immediately after the assassinations yesterday to rule the Arab
country'under the leadership of Maj. Ahmed Hussein al-
Chashmi, who also serves as commander in chief of the armed
forces.
Al-Chashmi will head the council, whose other two members
were identified in the broadcast monitored in Nicosia as Maj.
Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani and Maj. Abdullah Abdul Aalem.
"The council is confident that the people will rally under the

new leadership and safeguard internal security," the radio
quoted the presidential council as saying in a statement to the
nation.
Israel accepts U.S. conference proposal
Jerusalem —The Israeli cabinet accepted "without any dis
senters or reservations" a new U S. proposal for reconvening a
Middle East peace conference at Geneva, Cabinet Secretary
Arieh Naor said last night.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman welcomed
the decision and said the United States will transmit the work
ing paper to the Arab governments.
"We believe the Israeli government decision is a further step
toward working out practical procedures for convening the
Geneva conference by the end of this year," the spokesman
said.
"We note, however, that what has been accepted is still a
working paper which may require further negotiation after the
Arab governments have given their views on it."
The still-secret formula, which would include Palestinians in
a unified Arab delegation at Geneva, was reached last Wednes
day after a six-hour negotiating session between Carter and
Dayan.
Physics, chemistry Nobel Prizes awarded
Stockholm, Sweden — A 78-year-old American known as the
"father of modern magnetism" and his former student at Har
vard shared the Nobel prize for physics yesterday with a Briton.
A Russian-born Belgian was awarded the prize for chemistry.
The Swedish Academy gave 1977 Nobel awards to John H.
Van Vleck, 78, of Harvard University, Philip W. Anderson, 55, of
Princeton University and Bell Laboratories, Sir Nevill F. Mott,
72, of England's Cavendish Laboratory, and llya Prigogine, 60,

of the Free University of Brussels.
The physicists, who will divide a $145,000 prize, were cited tor
research on the electronic structure ot magnetic and "disor
dered" systems — work already applied to development of the
laser, new industrial uses of glass and copper spirals tor birth
control devices.
Prigogine won the $145,000 chemistry prize tor expanding
thermodynamic theory — which deals with transforming heat
into energy — to explain how order can exist within seemingly
disordered environmental systems. An academy member said
the Belgian's research could have a bearing on the develop
ment of solar energy.

Middle East peace conference at Geneva, Cabinet Secretary
Arieh Naor said last night.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman welcomed
the decision and said the United States will transmit the work
ing paper to the Arab governments.
"We believe the Israeli government decision is a further step
toward working out practical procedures for convening the
Geneva conference by the end of this year," the spokesman
said.
"We note, however, that what has been accepted is still a
working paper which may require further negotiation after the
Arab governments have given their views on it."

Physics, chemistry Nobel Prizes awarded
Stockholm, Sweden — A 78-year-old American known as the
"father of modern magnetism" and his former student at Har
vard shared the Nobel prize for physics yesterday with a Briton.
A Russian-born Belgian was awarded the prize for chemistry.
The Swedish Academy gave 1977 Nobel awards to John H.
Van Vleck, 78, of Harvard University, Philip W. Anderson, 55, of
Princeton University and Bell Laboratories, Sir Nevill F. Mott,
