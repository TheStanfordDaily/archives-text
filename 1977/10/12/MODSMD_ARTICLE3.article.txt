# A 						closer look at the Bakke case
## 
### Kurt Cobb News analysis 
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear
oral arguments today in a case de
stined to go down in history
alongside Brown v. The Board of
Education, the 1954 decision which
paved the way for desegregation.
The time, however, the complain
ant is a white male named Allan
Bakke. When Bakke was denied ad
mission to the UC-Davis Med
School, he filed suit contending the
quota system used in admitting
minorities at Davis violated his Four
teenth Amendment right to equal
protection under the law.
The California Supreme Court
ruled 6-1 in his favor saying Bakke
had been discriminated against be
cause of his race.
Now that a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling looms near in the case, prop
onents of affirmative action prog
rams in business, government and
particularly education fear these
programs may have to be disbanded
or at least drastically altered should
the high court uphold Bakke.
The controversy stems from use of
a quota system at Davis in admitting
minority students. Admissions offi
cials set aside 16 out of 100 places for
minority students. Though Bakke
had grades, test scores, and overall
ratings superior to the minority stu
dents accepted he was denied ad
mission in competing for one of the
84 positions allotted to non
minorities.
Davis argues that its quota system
promotes the important goal of di
versity among its students and that
there is a "compelling state interest"
in achieving this for social as well as
educational reasons.
The California Supreme Court dis
agreed and invalidated the use of a
quota system in admissions saying it
violated the Fourteenth Amend
ment.
It directed Davis to seek diversity
by other means such as aggressive
recruiting of qualified minority stu
dents and consideration of disadvan
taged status using criteria other than
race.

Some justices have defended
quota systems aimed at including
minorities. But the problem with
quotas is that they "cut both ways."
Since only a certain number of places
are available, particularly at graduate
and professional school levels, in
clusion of some under a quota sys
tem necessarily means exclusion of
others.
To solve this problem the Califor
nia court suggested expanding the
number of places available in univer
sities so as to accommodate more
minority students, but it did not at
tempt to demonstrate that this would
be feasible.
One curious aspect of the case is
that it has not divided onlookers
along traditional ideological lines. In
fact, liberals have clearly formed two
camps:

Hargadon - 'People will resort to the law for everything
We'll all end up being lawyers or being sued/

—those who feel minorities must
continue to be given preference in
order that they may some day com
pete on an equal basis with the rest of
society.
—those who say the Fourteenth
Amendment must be guarded at all
costs since not to could only mean
ongoing struggles for preference
among all conceivable factions of
society including whites.
Even former Supreme Court Jus
tice William Douglas, a long-time
liberal and supporter of civil rights,
lined up against such systems of pre
ference in a similar case where
Marco De Funis, a white, was denied
admission to the University of
Washington Law School, then admit
ted until the case could be resolved.
But when the U.S. Supreme Court
finally heard the case in 1973 De
Funis was about to graduate and by a
5-4 vote the court decided the case
was moot.
Douglas disagreed and in his dis
senting opinion lashed out against

the justices for side-stepping the
case. Douglas declared, "There is no
constitutional right for any race to be
preferred."
Supporters of affirmative action
say preference has always played an
important role in admissions. Sons
and daughters of alumni receive spe
cial consideration and geography,
cultural diversity, age and even athle
tic ability may all figure into the ad
mission of an applicant. So, the ar
gument goes: Why can't race be a
factor also.
The California court, however,
pointed out that Fourteenth
Amendment protections are ex
tended to persons, not groups, and
"its purpose, of securing equality of
treatment to all, is incompatible with
the premise that some races may be
afforded a higher degree of protec-

tion against unequal treatment than
others."
So varied and numerous are the
issues and arguments resulting from
the Bakke case that Fred Hargadon,
dean of admissions here has likened
it to the 12-faced "dodecahedron" of
Norton Juster's book The Phantom
Tollbooth, a character with a mul
titude of angles and sides.
Since the undergraduate admis
sions office here uses vigorous re
cruitment measures instead of a
quota to gain minority applicants,
Hargadon feels a decision to uphold
Bakke will not seriously affect cur
rent practices in admitting
minorities.
Hargadon says, however, that he is
particularly concerned about two
myths generated by the Bakke con
troversy:
—that because universities have not
vigorously supported Davis in its ef
fort to reverse the decision they do
not care about minority enrollment;
and
—that every minority student was
admitted only because of a prefer
ence system.
The first myth is dangerous be
cause it can become self-fulfilling,
Hargadon says. If minority students
think this way they may not apply
thus making it doubly difficult for
universities to obtain the ethnic di
versity they desire.
The second myth, he says, is sim
ply unfounded. There are large
numbers of minority students here
simply because they competed suc
cessfully with all other applicants in
the admissions process.
Hargadon, who says he is some
what ambivalent about the case,
notes, "It is one thing for the gov
ernment to make sure that people
are not acting in a biased way. It's
another to say they must go beyond

that.
"No one can make you love your
neighbor and once the government
legislates such a policy the reason for
moral suasion disappears. People
will resort to the law for everything.
We'll all end up being lawyers or
being sued."
Hargadon said, "I'm in favor of
working hard for minority enroll
ments. I'm against quotas. I don't
underplay the significance of this
case, however. I am concerned be
cause the issues apply to minorities
and non-minorities alike. There is no
easy solution."
James McClenahan, chairman of
the Minority Admissions Committee
at the Medical School here explained
that the School has a minimum 20 per
cent goal for minority enrollment,
but this goal should not be confused
with a quota. "There have been times
when we haven't met our goal, but
lately we've exceeded it."
At the Law School here a Law Quo
tient Index (LQI) based on grade
point average, LSAT score, and qual
ity of the student's undergraduate
institution is used to evaluate appli
cents' according to Law School Dean
Charles Meyers. Minority applicants
with LQIs within 50 points of the
lowest non-minority applicant ac
cepted are usually admitted, Meyers
has said.
In an amicus curiae brief filed
jointly by the University, Harvard,
Columbia and the University of
Pennsylvania the universities con
tend that "if selective colleges and
universities are forbidden to give
weight to the fact that an applicant is
a member of a racial minority group,
there will be almost certainly an ab
rupt decline in minority enroll
ments."
If the high court's recent record is
any indication of how it will rule, two
cases stand out as possible weather
vanes.
First, the court held in a case con
cerning seniority systems that even
though the effects of such systems
had been discriminatory, such dis
crimination need not be corrected if
it had not been deliberate. In the
Bakke case the university was never
shown to have discriminated delib
erately against any minority group.
Second, the court sanctioned ra
cial quotas in the redrawing of legis
lative districts, but only because the
racially-based redistricting deprived
no person or group of the right to
vote. The court considered such dis
crimination "benign"; while it aided
minority groups in gaining represen
tation it deprived no one of the right
to vote. This is not true in the Bakke
case.
That the court's decision will have
lasting reverberations is of little
doubt. The extent to which its deci
sion will affect civil rights, admissions
policies and quotas in areas of busi
ness and education depend largely on
how widely the court chooses to
apply its decision.
