# At student residences yesterday
## Trustee attend sherry hours 
### Beth Connor 
Members of the Board of Trus
tees participated in sherry hours
at several University residences
yesterday in the first of a series of
informal meetings between trus
tees and students.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president for trustee affairs, ar
ranged to have trustees, including
board President Peter Bing, ex
change questions and ideas with
students.
Hamrdla said his intention was
to "match students with trustees"
in an effort to make both aware of
the approachability of the other.
According to Hamrdla the trus
tees are eager to meet in this in
formal atmosphere. "They really
love it. It's good for them, good
for the students."
Spot checks indicated there
were from 30 to 40 students and
faculty at the various sherry
hours. Hamrdla said he consi
dered that a good turnout and a
workable size.
About 35 students at Cedro
talked with John Young, president
of Hewlett Packard and a trustee
for only four months. Under
graduate Judy Featherstone re
marked that some of the re
sponses were "typical" but added
that Young was informative and
open to questions.
Joe McCoy, house associate
(RA) at Arroyo, was enthusiastic
about meeting with trustee Bar
bara Fineberg, program officer of
Carnegie Corporation of New
York, calling it a "unique oppor
tunity for students."

He added that the freshmen
were especially receptive because
they are generally interested in
meeting "authority-type people"
who can tell them more about the
University and its operations.
Some of the topics discussed
included investment policy, hous
ing (particularly the issue of lifting
the sorority ban on campus), stu
dent representation on the board
and University fund raising.
Peter Bing, visiting Theta Delta
Chi, said he gets student input

through committees designed by
the board but realizes that may
not be a representation of all stu
dents.
He said he is therefore suppor
tive of the sherry hours and
suggested to Hamrdla that further
meetings be arranged.
Hamrdla reported that nine
trustees were involved in yester
day's activities but that at least
eight others demonstrated in
terest for the future.
