The suffering and oppression
under apartheid in South Africa con
tinues. On Sept. 12, Steve Biko, a mod
erate black leader in South Africa, was
murdered while being held in deten
tion by the police. An autopsy
showed his skull was badly crushed.
Biko is only the most recent of the 22
blacks who have died in South Afri
can jails in the last 18 months — not
to mention the hundreds that have
been killed in the streets.
Stanford still owns shares in cor
porations that operate in South Af
rica; corporations like General
Motors, Ford, Standard Oil of Calif.,
and IBM that lend economic and
political support as well as moral
legitimacy to apartheid.
Last spring the Board of Trustees
agreed to the Stanford Committee

for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) demand that a cost-benefit
analysis of the University divesting
itself of corporations that operate in
South Africa be published by Oct. 1.
Today is Oct. 12. The trustees have
had over five months to complete
this report, yet President Richard
Lyman tells us that it won't be ready
until November. Why?
Last spring, the trustees also ag
reed to publish letters sent to the
companies explaining the Universi
ty's abstention (on shareholder pro
xies) along with the corporate re
sponse in the Daily. These letters
have never been published in the
Daily. Why?
This summer, Lyman received sev
eral letters from the South African
embassy in Washington D.C. urging
him to discount student agitation
over South African investments.
What did these letters say? Why ha
ven't they been made public?
Lyman spoke
On Sept. 30, Lyman spoke before
the Academic Council and urged that
"the atmosphere of reasoned debate
permeate the institution." This is
what we've wanted all along. We are
inviting the trustees to debate on
U.S. corporate involvement in South
Africa. Will the trustees finally give
us their reasons why U.S. corpora
tions in South Africa are a "progres
sive force?"
In response to another SCRIP de
mand, the trustees set up the Ad Hoc
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility to rewrite the University's in
vestment guidelines. This committee
is meeting now, but the meetings are
closed and minutes are not released.
However, on KZSU's Campus Con
ference (Oct. 4), Lyman remarked he
had been reading the minutes. Why
does Lyman have access to the mi
nutes while the rest of the Stanford
community does not? Why is some
thing of such importance to the

community secret anyway?
The Ad Hoc Committee on In
vestment Respyisibility is also meet
ing without non-faculty, non
administrative employe representa
tion. Why has such a substantial part
of the Stanford community been
overlooked?
On Mon., Oct. 17, the Ford Motor
Corporation is coming to Stanford to
recruit. On that day there will be a
picket to protest Ford's involvement
in South Africa. Picketing will begin
in the morning at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center and lead
to a rally at noon in White Plaza. The
rally will memorialize the death of
Steve Biko as well as highlight Stan
ford's unwillingness to sever its ties
with apartheid.
While black Africans like Steve
Biko are being killed every day, Stan
ford's trustees drag their heels in
preparing the promised divestment
report and continue to profit from
their shares in apartheid. SCRIP and
the Black Students' Union are
stronger than ever, and with your
support we can end Stanford's com
plicity in South Africa.

In response to another SCRIP de
mand, the trustees set up the Ad Hoc
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility to rewrite the University's in
vestment guidelines. This committee
is meeting now, but the meetings are
closed and minutes are not released.
However, on KZSU's Campus Con
ference (Oct. 4), Lyman remarked he
had been reading the minutes. Why
does Lyman have access to the mi
nutes while the rest of the Stanford
community does not? Why is some
thing of such importance to the

community secret anyway?
The Ad Hoc Committee on In
vestment Respyisibility is also meet
ing without non-faculty, non
administrative employe representa
tion. Why has such a substantial part
of the Stanford community been
overlooked?
On Mon., Oct. 17, the Ford Motor
Corporation is coming to Stanford to
recruit. On that day there will be a
picket to protest Ford's involvement
in South Africa. Picketing will begin
in the morning at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center and lead
to a rally at noon in White Plaza. The
rally will memorialize the death of
Steve Biko as well as highlight Stan
ford's unwillingness to sever its ties
with apartheid.
While black Africans like Steve
Biko are being killed every day, Stan
ford's trustees drag their heels in
preparing the promised divestment
report and continue to profit from
their shares in apartheid. SCRIP and
the Black Students' Union are
stronger than ever, and with your
support we can end Stanford's com
plicity in South Africa.

The suffering and oppression
under apartheid in South Africa con
tinues. On Sept. 12, Steve Biko, a mod
erate black leader in South Africa, was
murdered while being held in deten
tion by the police. An autopsy
showed his skull was badly crushed.
Biko is only the most recent of the 22
blacks who have died in South Afri
can jails in the last 18 months — not
to mention the hundreds that have
been killed in the streets.
Stanford still owns shares in cor
porations that operate in South Af
rica; corporations like General
Motors, Ford, Standard Oil of Calif.,
and IBM that lend economic and
political support as well as moral
legitimacy to apartheid.
Last spring the Board of Trustees
agreed to the Stanford Committee

for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) demand that a cost-benefit
analysis of the University divesting
itself of corporations that operate in
South Africa be published by Oct. 1.
Today is Oct. 12. The trustees have
had over five months to complete
this report, yet President Richard
Lyman tells us that it won't be ready
until November. Why?
Last spring, the trustees also ag
reed to publish letters sent to the
companies explaining the Universi
ty's abstention (on shareholder pro
xies) along with the corporate re
sponse in the Daily. These letters
have never been published in the
Daily. Why?
This summer, Lyman received sev
eral letters from the South African
embassy in Washington D.C. urging
him to discount student agitation
over South African investments.
What did these letters say? Why ha
ven't they been made public?
