Candidates show ignorance
for ecology
I walked into the Stern dining
room Friday afternoon to a most un
appetizing sight — campaign prop
aganda on large (at least 12 inches by
14 inches) yellow, orange and gold
sheets of thick, quality paper.
Regardless of his/her views, I could
never vote for any candidate who
shows such an inexcusable ignor
ance and disregard for ecology. I
would think that the conservation of
paper would be everyone's concern,
especially in California where forest
fires have rampaged.
I have been told by upperclassmen
that the political propaganda has
only just begun. May I suggest cheap
newsprint and a mass recycling cam
paign?
