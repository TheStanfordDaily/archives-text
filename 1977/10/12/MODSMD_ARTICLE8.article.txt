# Briggs Initiative vicious

A photo caption in Wednesday's Daily (Oct. 5) made
reference to the Briggs Initiative as a measure "which is
directed against gay teachers." Such a definition hardly
does justice to the full potential treatment of this most
vicious piece of proposed legislation.
The initiative begins with an affirmation of the respon
sibility of government to support and encourage the
"American family." This represents a dangerous prece
dent on the scope of government intervention in the
private lives of all citizens and one which bodes no good
for any alternative lifestyle.
The wording of the initiative is all past tense in regard
to homosexual activity. For instance, it would require
school boards to "refuse to hire as an employe any
person who has engaged in public homosexual activity
or public homosexual conduct." The lack of specific
time references could provide grounds for dismissal of
any school employe who is alleged to have had a
homosexual experience at almost any point in his or her
life.

Since "public homosexual conduct" includes "the
advocating . . . encouraging, or promoting of private or
public homosexual activity . . . likely to come to the
attention of . . . other employes," it appears that any
non-gay "teacher, teacher's aide, school administrator
or counselor" who is observed expressing support for
gay rights is also subject to dismissal. This represents a
serious restriction, and probably an unconstitutional
one, on freedom of expression.
The Briggs Initiative is a naked attempt by one seg
ment of society to coercively implant its personal con
ception of morality on everyone else's children. It is a
threat to the civil liberties of all people and therefore
should be vigorously opposed by all people regardless
of their personal views on the validity of the homosexual
lifestyle.
