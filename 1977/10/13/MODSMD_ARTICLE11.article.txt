# The
						Palestine problem — a short history
## 
### 
A Palestinian leader once told the
U.N. General Assembly, "For many
years our people have been exposed to
the ravages of war, destruction, and
dispersion. It has paid in the blood of its
sons that which can't even be compen
sated. It has born the burdens of occu
pation, dispersion, eviction, and terror
more uninterruptedly than any other
people. And yet all this has made our
people neither vindictive nor vengeful.
Nor has it caused us to resort to the
racism of our enemies. Nor have we
lost the true method by which friends
and foes are distinguished, for we de
plore all those crimes committed
against the Jews; we also deplore all the
discrimination suffered by them be
cause of their faith."
Many people, particularly those un
familiar with the Palestinian-Israeli con
flict, commonly known as the Arab-
Israeli conflict, may not understand or
believe the seriousness of this state
ment. Nevertheless, the Palestinian
people, uprooted from their land by
the State of Israel, could demonstrate
that "war flares up in Palestine, and yet,
it is in Palestine that peace will be
born."
It is quite difficult, if not impossible
to summarize the history of the con
flict. Jews claim that Palestine was
promised to them by Cod. Palestinians,
though great believers in God, did not
see him in the real-estate business.
The idea of a Jewish state in Palestine
was formally articulated in 18% by an
Austrian, Theodore Herzl, when the
head of the British Zionist Federation,
Dr. Chaim Weizmann, provided access
to the British Government. The famous
"Balfour Declaration" of November 2,
1917, promised British support to the
establishment of a Jewish state in Pales
tine. The declaration also pledged that
the religious and civil rights of the
Arabs in Palestine should be protected,
but this clause was ignored in the years
that followed.
The declaration was rejected by the

Palestinian Arabs. In 1922, the year of
the first census in Palestine, the Arab
population stood at 565,000 compared
with a Jewish population of only 84,000.
By 1940, the Arab population increased,
largely because of a high birth rate, to
1,014,000, while the Jewish population
increased, by both birth and immigra
tion to 464,000. Violent clashes bet
ween the two populations increased as
the immigration of Jews increased. The
British, attempting to respond to the
severe political problems, created by
Jewish immigration and Palestinian re
sistance to the idea of a Jewish state,
formed a group, in 1939, which issued
the famous "White Paper" categorically
stating: "His Majesty's Government
now declares unequivocally that it is
not part of their policy that Palestine
should become part of a Jewish state."
Yet, this document, like many others,
was buried. World War II changed the
realities of the Middle East. Until then,
the World Jewry was responding poorly
to Zionism and the idea of a Jewish
state. Hitler's plan to exterminate
Europe's Jews, however, made the idea
of a Jewish state inevitable. Palestine
was, in the opinions of Zionists, "land
without people for people without
land." But Palestine was the land of the
Palestinians who felt that Hitler's ex
termination program was a great crime
asked why that meant that they should
have to give up their land to the Jews.
Was it not the world's problem, instead
of just their own. Many countries, in
cluding the United States, closed the
doors to the poor Jews for whom
everyone's heart bled — in print, at
least.
In 1947, exhausted by the war and the

Forum

increasing problems in Palestine, the
British Government asked the United
Nations to take the burden. A U.N.
committee on Palestine eventually
submitted a proposal for a partition of
Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab
state, with economic union and a U.N.
trusteeship for Jerusalem and the Holy
Places. The U.N. General Assembly ap
proved the plan in November, 1947, by
a vote of 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions.
The Palestinians, feeling like the "real"
mother watching King Solomon divid
ing her child, decided to reject the
plan. Jews, though promised the
"whole" Palestine by God, accepted a
part of it. President Truman, on April
23, 1948, sent word privately to Dr.
Weizmann that if the Jewish state were
to proclaim its independence at the end
of the mandate, the United States
would immediately recognize it. On
May 14, 1948, accordingly, the state of
Israel proclaimed its independence and
President Truman lived up to his word,
surprising even the U.S. Ambassador to
the U.N. who at the time was still work
ing on the trusteeship policy.
Dr. John Davis, a U.N. Representa
tive, in his book, "The Evasive Peace,"
described the effect of the creation of
Israel: "For the Zionist Jews, May 14,
1948, was a day of triumph and Jubila
tion. For the Arabs, it was a day of bitter
humiliation and of determination to re
claim the precious soil of Palestine."
The high degree of organization of the
World Zionist movement and the dis
organization and lack of leadership of
the Palestinians obscured the fact that
providing a home for the victims of Nazi
Germany created new victims.
In 1948-9 Arab armies, rejecting the

newly founded state of Israel and offer
ing to help the Palestinians, were de
feated by the Israeli armed forces. Is
rael expanded its boundaries, and has
been expanding since, at the further
expense of the Palestinian people, driv
ing most of the Palestinians from their
homes and lands. Zionists and suppor
ters of Israel claim that Palestinians
either ''left" voluntarily or because the
Arab government told them to do so.
Documented history tells us the con
trary. Nevertheless, people often leave
in times of war for safety and shelter,
but they expect to go back to their
home. Palestinians were driven out by
various means, including terrorism.
Israel's current prime minister, Mr.
Menachem Begin, wrote in his book
on the "Irgun," (the terrorist organiza
tion that he commanded during the
1948 attack on the village of Deir Yas
sin), "the Arabs were seized with limit
less panic and started to flee for their
lives. ... In the rest of the country,
too, the Arabs began to flee in terror
even before they clashed with Jewish
forces." The International Red Cross
representative, Jacques de Reynier, re
ported that 254 men, women and chil
dren of Deir Yassin were killed under
"barbarous circumstances." Word of
the slaughter spread throughout Pales
tine, doing more to drive Palestinians
out of their homes than any other single
act.
The 1948 war created one million
Palestinian refugees, uprooted and
homeless. Only 170,000 Palestinians
remained in Israel, to be treated as
"fifth column" and live as second class
citizens.
Palestinians, in the eyes of Israel, dis
appeared from the face of the earth. For
Palestinians, Palestine was always the
land they looked for. "Next year in
Jerusalem," a slogan of Jews for many
years, became the new words for Pales
tinians.
