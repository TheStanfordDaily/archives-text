Thursday is seeking articles on different aspects of different coun
tries around the world — primary news, analysis, essays. We are
especially interested in pieces on the countries of Latin America,
Africa and Southeast Asia — the areas of the world which seldom
receive extensive coverage in the American press. Well-focused
papers written for political science or international relations courses
are welcome. If you are interested or would like to submit an article,
please call Stephen Crolius at 497-4632 or stop by the Daily office.
