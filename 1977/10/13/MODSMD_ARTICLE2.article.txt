Smoking linked to miscarriages
Boston — Women who smoke during pregnancy
are nearly twice as liable as nonsmokers to lose their
babies through spontaneous abortion, a study says.
The researchers recommended that women give
up smoking to increase their chances of havin'g full
pregnancies with normal childbirth. «•
This study, conducted at New York's Columbia
University, adds another argument to the growing
case against smoking during pregnancy. Earlier
studies have shown that babies of women who smoke
are smaller than normal and more likely to die at
birth.
A report on the latest study was published in to
day's issue of the New England journal of Medicine.
The researchers were not sure why women who
smoke have more spontaneous abortions, but they
said there are two main theories. One is that smoking
women eat less than nonsmokers. The other is that
fetuses of smoking women do not get enough oxy
gen.
Researchers compared the smoking habits of 574
women who aborted spontaneously to those of 320
who delivered after full pregnancies.
New urban program becomes law
Washington — The Carter administration's first new
urban program was signed into law yesterday, prom

ising billions for ravaged American cities and their
poor and out of work residents.
The $14.7 billion housing bill includes an expansion
of the Community Development program, with an
emphasis on older cities, as well as more money for
housing programs and rent subsidies for poor
families.
The rent subsidies plus added financial aid to
hard-pressed cities will help an additional 345,000
families find housing at rents they can afford, accord
ing to the Department of Housing and Urban De
velopment.
At the same time, administration officials estimate
the measure will provide a half million jobs in con
struction and related industries where unemploy
ment rates are the highest.
Abortion issue delays benefits
Washington — A congressional deadlock over fed
eral funding of abortions is beginning to cripple un
employment and welfare programs in some states,
the Carter administration said yesterday.
In some jurisdictions, thousands of poor people
and others dependent on government benefits were
threatened with cutoffs of funds beginning today.
And hundreds of federal workers protested loss of
pay held hostage by the dispute.
At stake on Capitol Hill is a $60 billion appropriation

for the departments of Labor and Health, Education
and Welfare. Because the appropriation is stuck in
Congress, those departments ran out of funds on
Sept. 30, the close of the last fiscal year.
Congress is holding up the money while it argues
whether tax funds included in the bill should be used
to pay for abortions under federal medical aid prog
rams.
The full effect that might result from withholding
the appropriations was not known. Labor Secretary
Ray Marshall listed several examples, however. He
said that unless action is taken by Friday, unemploy
ment offices in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Arizona and
Delaware will close, ending jobless insurance be
nefits to three million persons.

Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except coastal fog and low
clouds extending inland locally night and morning. A
little cooler near coast today. Lows upper 40s to mid
50s. Highs 60s to mid 70s near coast, 70s to low 80s
inland. West to northwest winds to 20 mph after
noons.
Smoking linked to miscarriages
Boston — Women who smoke during pregnancy
are nearly twice as liable as nonsmokers to lose their
babies through spontaneous abortion, a study says.
The researchers recommended that women give
up smoking to increase their chances of havin'g full
pregnancies with normal childbirth. «•
This study, conducted at New York's Columbia
University, adds another argument to the growing
case against smoking during pregnancy. Earlier
studies have shown that babies of women who smoke
are smaller than normal and more likely to die at
birth.
A report on the latest study was published in to
day's issue of the New England journal of Medicine.
The researchers were not sure why women who
smoke have more spontaneous abortions, but they
said there are two main theories. One is that smoking
women eat less than nonsmokers. The other is that
fetuses of smoking women do not get enough oxy
gen.
Researchers compared the smoking habits of 574
women who aborted spontaneously to those of 320
who delivered after full pregnancies.
New urban program becomes law
Washington — The Carter administration's first new
urban program was signed into law yesterday, prom

ising billions for ravaged American cities and their
poor and out of work residents.
The $14.7 billion housing bill includes an expansion
of the Community Development program, with an
emphasis on older cities, as well as more money for
housing programs and rent subsidies for poor
families.
The rent subsidies plus added financial aid to
hard-pressed cities will help an additional 345,000
families find housing at rents they can afford, accord
ing to the Department of Housing and Urban De
velopment.
At the same time, administration officials estimate
the measure will provide a half million jobs in con
struction and related industries where unemploy
ment rates are the highest.
Abortion issue delays benefits
Washington — A congressional deadlock over fed
eral funding of abortions is beginning to cripple un
employment and welfare programs in some states,
the Carter administration said yesterday.
In some jurisdictions, thousands of poor people
and others dependent on government benefits were
threatened with cutoffs of funds beginning today.
And hundreds of federal workers protested loss of
pay held hostage by the dispute.
At stake on Capitol Hill is a $60 billion appropriation

for the departments of Labor and Health, Education
and Welfare. Because the appropriation is stuck in
Congress, those departments ran out of funds on
Sept. 30, the close of the last fiscal year.
Congress is holding up the money while it argues
whether tax funds included in the bill should be used
to pay for abortions under federal medical aid prog
rams.
The full effect that might result from withholding
the appropriations was not known. Labor Secretary
Ray Marshall listed several examples, however. He
said that unless action is taken by Friday, unemploy
ment offices in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Arizona and
Delaware will close, ending jobless insurance be
nefits to three million persons.
