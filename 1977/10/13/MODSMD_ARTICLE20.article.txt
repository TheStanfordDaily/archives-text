"On June 24,1950, less than five years after the end
of World War 11, the Korean War begins, American
boys are again sent off in uniforms to die for Liberty,
and a few weeks later, two New York City Jews, Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg, are arrested by the FBI and
charged with having conspired to steal atomic secrets
and pass them to the Russians. They are tried, found
guilty, andon April 5,1951, sentenced by the Judge to
die — thieves of light to be burned by light — in the
electric chair, for it is written that 'any man who is
dominated by demonic spirits to the extent that he
gives voice to apostasy is to be subject to the judge
ment upon sorcerers and wizards.' Then, after the
usual series of permissible sophistries, the various
delaying moves and light-restoring counter-moves,
their fate — as the U.S. Supreme Court refuses for the
sixth and last time to hear the case, locks its doors,
and goes off on holiday — is at last sealed, and it is
determined to burn them in New York City's Times
Square on the night of their fourteenth wedding an
niversary, Thursday, June 18, 1953.
"An Entertainment Committee is appointed,
chairmanned by Cecil B. DeMille, whose latest suc
cess was lastyear's Oscar-winning' Greatest Show on
Earth,' with assistance from Sol Hurok, Dan Topping,
Bernard Baruch, the AEC and Betty Crocker, Conrad
Hilton, whose Albuquerque hotel figured promi
nently in the prosecution's case against the Rosen
bergs, Sam Goldwyn and Walt Disney, Ed Sullivan,
the director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the
various chiefs of staff, Sing Sing Warden Wilfred De
nno, the Holy Six, and many more. They audition
vocalists, disc jockeys, preachers, and stand-up com
ics, view rushes of Uncle Sam's new documentary on
the two little Rosenberg boys intended as a back
projection for the burnings, commission Oliver
Allstorm and His Pentagon Patriots to compose a

special pageant theme song, assign a task force of
experienced sachems to work up a few spontaneous
demonstrations, and hire a Texas high-school march
ing band to play One Fine Day from 'Madame But
terfly,' The Anniversary Waltz, and the theme from
'High Noon,' said to be a particular favorite these
days of President Eisenhower. The President, just
back from a week of moralizing and whoopee in the
Badlands and Oyster Bay, has been visited at the
White House this week by the Singing Cowboy Gene
Autry, and Gene has been invited to render When It's

Twilight on the Trail and Back in the Saddle Again at
the electrocutions. TIME, the National Poet Laureate,
celebrating this spring his own thirtieth birthday, is
asked by the Committee to read a commemorative
poem, an American middleweight championship
bout between Bobo Olson and Paddy Young is ap
pended to the program, and someone hires Harry
James and His Orchestra to play overhead on the
Astor Roof."
All of that is prologue. Thereafter, Richard Nixon, as
sympathetic dunderhead and a likeable personal nar
rator, escorts the reader through a news conference,
a cabinet meeting, a golf match with Uncle Sam at
Burning Tree, and intermezzos that render actual
transcripts of speeches and letters as epic poetry,
dramatic dialogues, and "Human Dignity Is Not For
Sale: A Last Act Sing Sing Opera by Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg."
On Friday of the electrocutions, the Vice-President
is seduced in the Sing Sing Dance Hall by "the
notorius Spy Queen," but his exeunt is not into Os
sining but into the New York City extravaganza.
"Then Times Square breaks into an uproar! A man is
backing bareass out onto the stage from the prison
ers' entrance, his pants in a tangled puddle at his feet,
a crumpled homburg down around his ears, 'I AM A
SCAMP' lipsticked on his butt. The man turns, hop
ping on one foot, blinks in amazement — why it's
—!" Richard Nixon.
And there follows a long, moving, final scene that is
by turns funny and shattering, that gives proof to
Robert Coover's immense talent. For 'The Public
Burning" is a wild, surreal, extraordinary novel, a
fantastic satire on the Communist scare of the '50s
and a wise comment on America's nightmare craving
for spectacle and retributive justice. If the novel is
hard, hard to stay with in the middle, it is only be
cause Coover never lets up; each sentence is honed,
each sly parody is in perfect voice, each succeeding
scene is almost over-rich with his invention and
comic gifts. This is a hugely imaginative work, and in
the long shelf of books about the Rosenbergs, this is
the one that should last. —RON HANSEN
