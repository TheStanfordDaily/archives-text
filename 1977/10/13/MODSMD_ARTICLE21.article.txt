The hero of John Fowles' new novel "Daniel Mar
tin" is an English playwright who has forsaken his
early, nobler ambitions by becoming a screenwriter.
Daniel Martin is a self-proclaimed emotional and
spiritual washout. His travails are presented as the ills
of our age—pathological selfishness, loss of a sense
of the past, fashionable despair obliterating all possi
bility of a more comprehensive vision of fife — and
Fowles proceeds to extricate Dan from his very com
plicated problems, with all their ponderous implica
tions, without taking any shortcuts, over the course
of 629 pages, some of which are very long indeed.
Finally, Fowles does manage to pull it off. The novel
gains momentum as it proceeds, Dan achieves heroic
stature through sheer sincerity, early tedium builds
to resonance and a rich complexity of vision. But. . .
The book begins with an extended flashback to
Martin's boyhood, an elaborately-drawn recounting
of wheat harvest in Devon. A rabbit's hind legs are

sliced off by the reaping machine and the little animal
tries to drag itself away. Daniel kills it, looks into the
pile of rabbit corpses into which he tosses its body:
"And his heart turns, some strange, premonitory
turn, a day when in an empty field he shall weep for
this." Yes. Well. You have to really want to know. For
the first half of the book Fowles expects a large
amount of indulgence from his reader.
The most difficult indulgence to grant is Jenny, the
young English film actress with whom Dan, in his
early 50s, is carrying on an affair when the current
action begins. When jenny says something she
shouldn't, Dan says: "How long is it since you were
spanked?" Or, when she stays up late on a work
night: "If she isn't in bed in one minute she's going to
get what she really deserves. A massive flea in the ear
for coming on set with bags under her eyes." Yuch.
Jenny makes her own "contribution" to the novel
in the form of first-person sections delineating her
view of the relationship and of Dan, i.e. "I still can't
define his essence." Or, reflecting on the night of
their first love-making: "He was lying on the couch,
feet up, staring at the ceiling. I was sitting on the rug
. . . back to the wall, staring at my toes. I was wearing
a shirt, no bra, a long skirt... I was simple, passive,

no games, I let him do what he wanted, responded
just enough to show him I wanted him to do what he
wanted ... I wasn't sure I wanted him for this though
I didn't mind. He didn't say anything. Neither of us
said anything for some time. We just lay there, the
way you come out of a film sometime and you don't
want to talk about it."
If you can get through this embarrassing experi
mentin point of view then you'll be able to handle the
abrupt shifts from third to first person as Fowles
struggles for perspective on Dan and his quest.
Somewhere about page 300 the book takes off; it
simply suffers from an overzealous initial emphasis.
Fowles spends great energy creating for us a vain,
pompous and ponderous middle-aged man — then
proceeds to strip him down to his component parts
and reconstitute him, with insight and compassion.
Dan returns to Oxford at the request of his dying
former brother-in-law and gradually comes to see
that he has vision and guts and heart enough to cor
rect past errors and redirect his life. Daniel Martin
emerges as a character of profound dimensions, en
compassing the terrible rifts of his age but also the
tremendous power to be derived from the richness of
his heritage. —SUSAN WELCH
