# Barrish the image weaver
## Independent filmmaking 
### 
Independent filmmaking is
an endeavor where the aim is
not financial gain but artistic
self-expression. )erry Barrish, a
sculptor turned filmmaker,
exemplifies this creative ideal.
His work is best described as
eclectic, including both
documentary films and short
subjects based on original
screenplays.
Last Saturday night, the Palo
Mto Cultural Center presented
six of ferry's films and lerry
himself to the community.
Heading off the evening was a
short documentary entitled
That's Why I'm A Painter."
This film develops a theme
echoed elsewhere in Barrish's
work, namely, the various ways
in which a person tries to deal
with a handicap or personal
tragedy.
The subject of "That's Why
I'm A Painter" is a man who
possesses no functional arms
or legs yet is completely self
sufficient and successful as a
painter. One could not help
but marvel at this man's posi
tive outlook and his uncanny
ability to create works of art
with only the stump of an arm
to direct the brush.
Barrish's unique style is very
evident in "Painter." He favors
a static camera and often sub
stitutes narration for live
sound. When pressed on this
point, he responds to the ef
fect that camera movement has
a tendency to distract us from
the real message on the sc
reen, which, in his films, is
complete within the static
frame.
lerry's first attempt as a
filmmaker is also worthy of
note. Unusually polished for a
first film, "I Will Be" is based
on a song of the same title by
Harry Chapin. The plot in
volves a deranged young man

who climbs up on a tower arid,
for no apparent reason, shoots
several people and then kills
himself. The film is remarkable
for the way in which the images
and the words of Chapin's
song both reinforce and com
pliment each other, without
one being merely an embel
lishment on the other.
Saturday's program con
cluded with a look at Barrish's
work in progress, a gangster
genre spinoff titled Dan's
Motel." After viewing this
work, I was struck with the in
justice of Barrish's struggle to
finance his projects, simply for
the reason that "Dan's Motel
shows a great talent and insight
on the part of the filmmaker as
well as a formidable grasp on
the tools of his art.
A visually striking film,
"Dan's Motel" virtually as
saults the viewer with a mon
tage with vivid colors and
bizarre shapes. Consider, for
example, the contrast of an
azure blue sky with the glaring
white facade of the motel, the
seedy, claustrophobic atmos

phere inside the motel room
(where most of the film takes
place), and especially the
macabre appearance of the lit
tle cripple who plays the
hero's sidekick. The harsh,
vibrant images in "Dan's
Motel" compare in my mind to
Antonioni's beautiful
camerawork in "The Pas
senger."
As the evening came to a
close, I felt sorry for Barrish
that he was unable to gain the
wide exposure for his films that
he so obviously deserves. If
Jerry Barrish's work is any indi
cation of the quality of inde
pendent filmmaking in this
area, I would highly recom
mend the forthcoming prog
rams introducing local
filmmakers to be presented on
the next three Saturdays of this
month.
The films will be shown at
the Palo Alto Cultural Center
Auditorium, located at 1313
Newell Road. Admission is $2
for adults, $1.50 for students
and senior citizens.
