# Ron Carter's latest
## 
### 
Ron Carter's playing on records is in many ways deceptive.
While he has played on literally hundreds of records with
such jazzmen as Miles Davis, George Benson, Keith Jarrett,
Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter, he has rarely recorded
with the superlative groups he fronts in clubs.
His latest Milestone release "Piccolo" helps to fill this void.
Recorded last March in the fine New York club, Sweet Basil,
Carter plays with his own group — one which has been
causing quite a stir lately among critics and fans. Part of the
controversy stems from the fact that Carter, perhaps the
world's finest acoustic bass player, has abardoned that in
strument in favor of one called the "piccolo bass." This
generally neglected instrument has a more pronounced yet
thinner sound than the traditional bass. The reaction toward
it has not been very favorable.
Although the arrangement of Carter's group is unusual
(two bass players, a pianist and drummer), I find the new
instrumentation quite exciting. Carter is freer and more
melodic than he has been in the past; unlike many bass
players, he definitely makes his presence felt.
One drawback of having two basses can be seen during the
solos of pianist Kenny Barron. The thick accompaniment of
the two basses detracts from Barron's fine playing. This is
indeed a major fault because Barron is one of the most

under-rated pianists around and deserves as much exposure
as he can get. Like Carter his best playing has often been as a
sideman; from his early work with Dizzy Gillespie to his
more recent collaborations with Vusef Lateef and Buddy
Rich, Barron's piano work has always been original and intel
ligent. His work on his own, particularly in his most recent
album "Lucifer" has been, for me, less interesting. Fortu
nately, on this date with Carter his playing is at its best. His
work on "Sun Shower" and on Carter's "Little Waltz" is very
powerful yet lyrical.
The rest of the group is equally capable. Ben Riley is an
excellent, straight-forward drummer who propels the rest of
the group. Buster Williams is a fine bassist whose playing on
"Blue Monk" stands out despite Carter's flamboyant front
work.
The cuts are long, averaging over 10 minutes in length, and
give the musicians an opportunity to stretch out and solo at
length. Occasionally the longer cuts bog down; the advan
tages of hearing the players tackle their musir in a leis'jrsly
manner, however, is worth a momentary lag in the perfor
mance. On the whole, once the listener has become accus
tomed to the unusual instrumentation, he will find "Piccolo"
a very enjoyable album. I hope west coast jazz fans will soon
have a chance to hear this excellent group in concert.
