# Bread & Roses Festival
## 
### 
(Last of two parts)
Sunday afternoon's show
was held in the sun, and had
the appearance of a regular
rock concert, with a much
younger crowd in attendance
than that of the previous even
ing. Clear voiced Josh White Jr.
opened, setting the tone for
what was to be the most con
temporary sounding of the
three concerts. Teri Garthwaite
and Toni Brown, both formerly
of Joy of Cooking, followed.
Backed by Rothermel, Freebo
and Banana, they performed
songs from their new album

and Brown played some fine
guitar.
Next was Richie Havens,
whose guitar beating style
hasn't changed since
Woodstock. Havens, whose
songs included "San Francisco
Bay Blues" and James Taylor's
"Fire and Rain," was followed
by Buffy Sainte-Marie.
The Persuasions, a five-man
a cappella group, followed and
had the audience literally danc
ing in the aisles with their gos
pel sounds and perfectly
blended harmonies.
Things got even funnier
when the next performer,
Country |oe McDonald, intro
duced a new variation of his
famous "Fish Cheer." Explain
ing that he had once been ban
ned from auditoriums for three
years because of the cheer, he
decided to do a new version in
German.

Folk

Maria Muldaur, backed by a
band that included once again
Freebo, Banana and Rother
mel, along with Dave Nicktern
on guitar and Richard Green on
fiddle, performed some of her
more familiar material, includ
ing "Midnight at the Oasis"
and"I Am Woman, W-O-M-
A-N."
Finally, after over 20 hours of
music over the weekend,
festival's final performe; ap
peared: Jackson Browne.
Along with ' n is inimitable
David Lindley,
tirowne did "Jamaica Say You

Will," "Take It Easy," "The Pre
tender" and, with Terry Reid
sitting in on lead vocal, paid
tribute to the festival's folk na
ture with a beautiful version of
Woodie Guthrie "Deportee."
Backstage, a general mood
of contented fatigue prevailed.
Baez lay sprawled on the floor
receiving a massage. Jackson
Browne, who was celebrating
his 29th birthday, munched
birthday cake and played frogs
with his young son. And Mimi
Farina, who had put so much
effort into organizing the festi
val, slouched comfortably on a
sofa.
With both the final
two shows being sellouts., the
fund-raising Festival ot Music
was a hit financially, but more
important, musically as well.

Sunday afternoon's show
was held in the sun, and had
the appearance of a regular
rock concert, with a much
younger crowd in attendance
than that of the previous even
ing. Clear voiced Josh White Jr.
opened, setting the tone for
what was to be the most con
temporary sounding of the
three concerts. Teri Garthwaite
and Toni Brown, both formerly
of Joy of Cooking, followed.
Backed by Rothermel, Freebo
and Banana, they performed
songs from their new album

and Brown played some fine
guitar.
Next was Richie Havens,
whose guitar beating style
hasn't changed since
Woodstock. Havens, whose
songs included "San Francisco
Bay Blues" and James Taylor's
"Fire and Rain," was followed
by Buffy Sainte-Marie.
The Persuasions, a five-man
a cappella group, followed and
had the audience literally danc
ing in the aisles with their gos
pel sounds and perfectly
blended harmonies.
Things got even funnier
when the next performer,
Country |oe McDonald, intro
duced a new variation of his
famous "Fish Cheer." Explain
ing that he had once been ban
ned from auditoriums for three
years because of the cheer, he
decided to do a new version in
German.

Folk

Maria Muldaur, backed by a
band that included once again
Freebo, Banana and Rother
mel, along with Dave Nicktern
on guitar and Richard Green on
fiddle, performed some of her
more familiar material, includ
ing "Midnight at the Oasis"
and"I Am Woman, W-O-M-
A-N."
Finally, after over 20 hours of
music over the weekend,
festival's final performe; ap
peared: Jackson Browne.
Along with ' n is inimitable
David Lindley,
tirowne did "Jamaica Say You

Will," "Take It Easy," "The Pre
tender" and, with Terry Reid
sitting in on lead vocal, paid
tribute to the festival's folk na
ture with a beautiful version of
Woodie Guthrie "Deportee."
Backstage, a general mood
of contented fatigue prevailed.
Baez lay sprawled on the floor
receiving a massage. Jackson
Browne, who was celebrating
his 29th birthday, munched
birthday cake and played frogs
with his young son. And Mimi
Farina, who had put so much
effort into organizing the festi
val, slouched comfortably on a
sofa.
With both the final
two shows being sellouts., the
fund-raising Festival ot Music
was a hit financially, but more
important, musically as well.
