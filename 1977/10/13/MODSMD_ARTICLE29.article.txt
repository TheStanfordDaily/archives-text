# Diebenkorn
## Oakland retrospective for ex-Stanford painter 
### 
The source is honestly
acknowledged; student paint
ings freshly drip carious reds
and pale cobalts. Tense, shiver
ing verticals and dry-brushed
plains bespeak respect. The
admiration of Stanford's pain
ters is for Richard Diebenkorn,
and admiration is new only be
cause we are young and have
not looked before.
A retrospective exhibit,
"Richard Diebenkorn, Paint
ings and Drawings, 1943-1976"
will open Oct. 15 at the Oak
land Museum. Complete and
finely displayed, its 150 paint
ings will elucidate our respect

In 1966 the artist moved
to southern California.
Santa Monica's pure,
salty air provides a trans
luscent sky; Diebenkorn
admires the light more
than any other he has
seen. This light con
ceived the abstract "O
cean Park Series."
Selected from nearly 100
huge canvasses of this
series . . . "Ocean Park"
paintings comprise al
most half of the exhibi
tion.

and dull expectation.
Diebenkorn was raised in
California and educated here.
A teacher as well as a painter,
he began his career as an in
structor at the California
School of Fine Arts in San Fran
cisco.
Diebenkorn was not a starv
ing artist. His work was im
mediately recognized; critics
responded to the integrity and
traditional concept of his art.
Abstract paintings by
Diebenkorn were given their
own show at the Palace of the
Legion of Honor in 1948, and
soon appeared in Life
Magazine.
In the mid-1950s Diebenkorn
began to paint figuratively. In
spired by his friends David Park
and Elmer Bischoff, he painted
blue-shadowed women in
Matisse's Mediterranean
rooms and porches. The Oak
land exhibit includes such fine
paintings as "View from the
Porch," "Woman on Porch "
and "Window."

seen. This light conceived the
abstract "Ocean Park Series."
Selected from the nearly 100
huge canvasses of this series,
"Ocean Park" paintings com
prisealmost half of the exhibit.
Viewed in the space of one
hour, this retrospective has
many fulfilling moments. The
artist's late figure paintings are
a highlight; they exemplify
Diebenkorn's talent as a col
orist and confirm the individu
ality of his study of painted
structures. He seizes Califor
nia's landscape.
Formula-painting seems the
real subject of the "Ocean Park
Series." Everyone of these
paintings, to a large or small
degree recalls a beauty which
Diebenkorn's compulsive per
sonal sensibility has distilled
from landscape.
Critics have called this group
of canvasses "profoundly con
sistent." Certainly, the matur
ity of these canvasses is admir
able, but one may also find
these calculations stifling.
Elmer Bischoff asks that one
compare the Ocean Parks with
