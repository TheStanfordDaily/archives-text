For the third time in four years, an edition of the
Daily has had illegal and unauthorized advertising
inserted into it. Yesterday's Daily contained a polit
ical advertisement printed on yellow paper which
claimed to be signed by a group-called Concerned
Students for a Fair Election and contained de
famatory claims against a political slate of candi
dates for the current ASSU Senate elections and,
once more, against the Daily.
The statement supported the Stanford Organiz
ing Committee (SOC) senate slate, which has de
nied any responsibility for the action (see story,
page 16). .
The Daily takes a dim view of these tactics and is
unalterably opposed to such actions, which seem
especially dirty and hate-filled in light of claims of
"progressivism" and "social committment" which
the leaflet's authors say they espouse.
The Daily objects to this sort of action no matter
what poliljcaj stance a group might take. We view
with great alarm the tendency during this election
for candidates and supporters to wallow in cruel
and libelous statements and actions against eac-b
other.
In the past two incidents of unauthorized adver
tising insertions (both of which occurred on ASSU
election days), the Daily has refrained from making
other than a short statement for fear of unduly
influencing the election results. However, due to
the nature of the charges lodged against senate
candidates, we cannot refrain from action this
time.
The Daily has indisputable proof of the person
who paid for the printing of this vicious piece of
hatred. The Daily also has information which
would lead us to the author of this pamphlet, an
individual who has in the past claimed a committ
ment to non-violence, and evidence indicating at
least 25 other persons were involved.
We hope the students who read the pamphlet
(and also readers of a similar pamphlet printed on
blue paper and signed by the Students Committed
to Individual Freedom) will realize these are just
what they are — the lowest form of political tric
kery — and will accordingly disregard them both.
