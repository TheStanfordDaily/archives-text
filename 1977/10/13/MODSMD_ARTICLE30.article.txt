# Monotypes and photographs
## Concise lines, brushed color, mystery and transformation 
### 
Two shows at the Art Gallery
emphasize series, transforma
tion, and an exploratory ap
proach to image making. The
monotype show, with works by
Lee Altman, Keith Boyle,
Richard Diebenkorn, Lee Col
din, Joseph Coldyne, Frank
Lobdell and Wayne Thiebaud
under the aegis of instructor
Nathan Oliveira, is concur
rently on exhibit with David
Bayles's "Flower Arrange
ments and Other Photo
graphs."
Monotype combines print
and painting processes, yield
ing only one fully saturated im
age, but creating a ghost image
on the printing plate that can
be printed, erased or trans
formed, allowing a range of to
nalities otherwise unavailable
to the artist.
• The technique has been
used since the 17th century,
primarily for experimentation

by painters. Although masters
such as Edgar Degas used the
technique, it fell into disuse
from the 1920s to the 19705.
Oliveira, inspired by a
catalogue of Degas's prints,
began to use the medium
around 1972, encouraging the
other painters in this show to
visit his studio for work ses
sions.
The display provides con
trasts between the cerebral
abstraction of Diebenkorn and
the sensual "Nude" of
Oliveira, between the brilliant
colors of Lobdell, and the sub
dued hues of Goldyne.
Particularly exciting were
Oliveira's "Sites" for their
elegant light and uncharac
teristically sharp detail in a
medium that tends to render
softened edges. Diebenkorn's
abbreviation of light on forms
by use of geometric shapes was
a counterpoint to Thiebaud's
hillscapes.
Thiebaud's prints contain
the same lively fun of his well
known paintings of automat
like displays of food and other
objects. As with his painting,
the prints must be seen to ap
preciate his mastery of color
and light.

Where instructors Boyle and
Lobdell used saturated colors
to create fields on which they
placed organic forms, Goldyne
created bizarre dreamscapes,
with almost invisible hues
created as the image degener
ated from print to print. Gol

dyne commented that the pro
cess allows "mystery" for the
artist in regard to control over
the final result. His other
wordly subject matter gives the
viewer a chance to participate
on another level of the enigma.
Mystery and transformation
also play a significant role in
works by photographer Bayles.
The artist writes that he wanted
to "make pictures whose struc
ture is stable and formal, but
whose content, although seri
ous, is more elusive." As with
paintings by Georgia O'Keefe,
whose work Bayles admires,
one is simultaneously drawn
forward by the material beauty
of the works, and repelled or
mystified by the funereal con
tent.
Using three by four inch
Polaroid "proofs," the artist
composes the arrangements of
white or dark flowers, black or
white veils, satin or gauze. His
large prints were duplicates of
some of the Polaroid images,
yet each work is experienced

differently.
The larger prints (from 8 by
10 to 16 by 20 inches) envelope
the viewer. Variation in sharp
ness of grain causes the mood
to shift from image to image as
well. The objects seem sculp
ted out of the dark, and the
black threatens to swallow
them, adding to the sense of
solemnity.
Polaroid materials yield a
peculiar pinkish-gray tone that
is often unsuitable for a sub
ject. In Bayles' case, it is as if
Polaroid were designed speci
fically for his work. The prints
radiate, allowing a sheen and
tactile quality unattainable in
the larger prints.
Bayles' other photographs
include studies of women, in
some cases incorporating ele
ments from the flower works.
Both shows remain through
December 4. Gallery hours are
10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. on Tues
days through Fridays, and 1 to
4:45 p.m. on weekends.

The artist writes that he wanted
to "make pictures whose struc

paintings by Georgia O'Keefe,
whose work Bayles admires,
one is simultaneously drawn
forward by the material beauty
of the works, and repelled or
mystified by the funereal con
tent.
Using three by four inch
Polaroid "proofs," the artist
composes the arrangements of
white or dark flowers, black or
white veils, satin or gauze. His
large prints were duplicates of
some of the Polaroid images,

differently.
The larger prints (from 8 by
10 to 16 by 20 inches) envelope
the viewer. Variation in sharp
ness of grain causes the mood
to shift from image to image as

ted out of the dark, and the
black threatens to swallow
them, adding to the sense of
solemnity.
Polaroid materials yield a
peculiar pinkish-gray tone that
is often unsuitable for a sub
ject. In Bayles' case, it is as if
Polaroid were designed speci

radiate, allowing a sheen and

Monotype by Thiebaud
Two shows at the Art Gallery
emphasize series, transforma
tion, and an exploratory ap
proach to image making. The
monotype show, with works by
Lee Altman, Keith Boyle,
Richard Diebenkorn, Lee Col
din, Joseph Coldyne, Frank
Lobdell and Wayne Thiebaud
under the aegis of instructor
Nathan Oliveira, is concur
rently on exhibit with David
Bayles's "Flower Arrange
ments and Other Photo
graphs."
Monotype combines print
and painting processes, yield
ing only one fully saturated im
age, but creating a ghost image
on the printing plate that can
be printed, erased or trans
formed, allowing a range of to
nalities otherwise unavailable
to the artist.
• The technique has been
used since the 17th century,
primarily for experimentation

by painters. Although masters
such as Edgar Degas used the
technique, it fell into disuse
from the 1920s to the 19705.
Oliveira, inspired by a
catalogue of Degas's prints,
began to use the medium
around 1972, encouraging the
other painters in this show to
visit his studio for work ses
sions.
The display provides con
trasts between the cerebral
abstraction of Diebenkorn and
the sensual "Nude" of
Oliveira, between the brilliant
colors of Lobdell, and the sub
dued hues of Goldyne.
Particularly exciting were
Oliveira's "Sites" for their
elegant light and uncharac
teristically sharp detail in a
medium that tends to render
softened edges. Diebenkorn's
abbreviation of light on forms
by use of geometric shapes was
a counterpoint to Thiebaud's
hillscapes.
Thiebaud's prints contain
the same lively fun of his well
known paintings of automat
like displays of food and other
objects. As with his painting,
the prints must be seen to ap
preciate his mastery of color
and light.

Where instructors Boyle and
Lobdell used saturated colors
to create fields on which they
placed organic forms, Goldyne
created bizarre dreamscapes,
with almost invisible hues
created as the image degener
ated from print to print. Gol

dyne commented that the pro
cess allows "mystery" for the
artist in regard to control over
the final result. His other
wordly subject matter gives the
viewer a chance to participate
