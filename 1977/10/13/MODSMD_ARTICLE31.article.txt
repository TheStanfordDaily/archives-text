# Students protest Bakke
## 
### Charlie Smith 
More than 250 people rallied
against the Bakke decision in
White Plaza, then marched
around the Quad cheering and
clapping, a little after noon yes
terday.
The crowd listened for about
an hour to speeches calling for
unity and denouncing the
Bakke case, which is currently
before the Supreme Court.
Oral arguments began yester
day.
When Allan Bakke, a white,
was refused admission to the
UC-Davis Medical School in
1974, he sued the university
contending that he had been
discriminated against by a
quota system used in admitting
minorities.
He claimed this discrimina
tion violated his right to equal
protection under law, as
specified in the Fourteenth
Amendment.
'Less qualified'
One of yesterday's speakers,
Keith Archuleta of the Black
Students' Union, claimed that
Bakke wouldn't have been ad
mitted even if there was no
quota system; he was refused
because he was less qualified

than 37 other people on a wait
ing list for the Medical School.
Concerning discrimination,
Archuleta felt that "we must all
pull together" for equalization
of all races.
Rosa Rodriguez of MEChA
outlined the history of the af
firmative action successes in
the past 10 years. She said she
felt that if the Supreme Court
favors Bakke, all previous work
for minorities will be wasted.
She said, "we will remedy this
problem (reverse discrimina
tion) only through grouping
together."
Sharon Malotte of the Native
American Student Association
also spoke out against Bakke.
She said that "the whites have
seen rights go to the Third
World and they don't like it, so
they invent reverse discrimina
tion."
Bruce Chan of the Asian-
American Students Association
said that ethnic classes and
ethnic organizations should be
encouraged, especially for
Asians, who are usually "the
forgotten minority" at Stan
ford.
'Change the place'
Eddie Souza of MEChA told
the crowd that "only by getting

together do we have any help"
defeating the Bakke case.
Sousa claimed that a deci
sion for Bakke would create a
lack of jobs, inadequate social
services and national oppres
sion. He said, "We have an ob
ligation to change the place
(Stanford) instead of having
the place change us."
After the speeches ended,
the demonstrators marched
through White Plaza to the
Quad. They clapped and
chanted cheers like "We are
the people; we are the nation;
there ain't no such thing as re
verse discrimination," "Defeat
Bakke now," and"The people,
united, will never be de
feated."
Several bicyclists and pas
sersby joined in the march.
Several instructors and sec
retaries stopped work and
opened their doors to see the
demonstration first-hand.
The demonstrators then
continued back up to White
Plaza with fists in the air, some
waving their armbands above
their heads. After returning to
the starting point of the march,
the marchers were urged to
continue their demonstration
on Saturday in San Francisco.
