# Election to be investigated
## 
### 
Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy said yesterday
that "the elections commission
is conducting several investiga
tions" of campaign ir
regularities by ASSU senate
candidates.
However, Murphy said, "I
am not prepared to comment
on any of them."
Early yesterday morning,
leaflets pertaining to the elec
tion were inserted in copies of
the Daily without authoriza
tion. The Daily and Murphy are
currently investigating the in
cident.
In addition, charges have
been levied that some senate
candidates have" overspent
their $50 budgets and that clas
srooms have been used for
campaigning.
The leaflets inserted in the
Daily attacked the newspaper
and senate candidate Robert
Docters. Docters has denied all
of the allegations.
The leaflet expressed sup

port for the Stanford Organiz
ing Committee (SOC) slate.
SOC members last night de
nied any connection with the
incident.
Meanwhile, approximately
1400 ballots were cast on the
first day of the ASSU general
election, according to Murphy.
A preliminary count of those
ballots was made yesterday af
ternoon, Murphy said.
"The ballots were counted
and sorted as to the polling
place," he said. No subtotals
for individual candidates were
reported however.
Ballot boxes were opened
after the first day's voting be
cause the ballot boxes must go
out empty to the polls the sec
ond day, Murphy said. The bal
lots are locked and sealed in
the ASSU office to await the
final count, he added.
In order to make the fee as
sessments valid, 20 per cent of
the student body must vote.
With 11,881 students enrolled

that means 2376 votes are
necessary. Almost 1000 voters
will be needed tomorrow to
certify the fee assessments.
A few mistakes were disco
vered yesterday morning,
Murphy added. Tom Faletti's
first name was incorrectly spel
led Tho, and the "yes" and
"no" were omitted from the
second fee assessment.
Although 2500 ballots had
been printed they were recal
led and reprinted before any
undergraduates had voted,
Murphy said.
Also early yesterday morning
a pollwatcher inadvertently
marked the "A" on student
identification cards as students
voted. The correct letter for
voting is "B". However, Mur
phy said that the mistake was
caught and he has a list of the
20 people whose ID cards were
marked incorrectly so that they
cannot vote again. "A" is the
letter used for marking off fee
assessment refunds.

The leaflets inserted in the
Daily attacked the newspaper
and senate candidate Robert
Docters. Docters has denied all
of the allegations.
The leaflet expressed sup

port for the Stanford Organiz
ing Committee (SOC) slate.
SOC members last night de
nied any connection with the
incident.
Meanwhile, approximately
1400 ballots were cast on the
first day of the ASSU general
election, according to Murphy.
A preliminary count of those
ballots was made yesterday af
ternoon, Murphy said.
"The ballots were counted
and sorted as to the polling
place," he said. No subtotals
for individual candidates were
reported however.
Ballot boxes were opened
after the first day's voting be
cause the ballot boxes must go
out empty to the polls the sec
ond day, Murphy said. The bal
lots are locked and sealed in
the ASSU office to await the
final count, he added.
In order to make the fee as
sessments valid, 20 per cent of
the student body must vote.
With 11,881 students enrolled

that means 2376 votes are
necessary. Almost 1000 voters
will be needed tomorrow to
certify the fee assessments.
A few mistakes were disco
vered yesterday morning,
Murphy added. Tom Faletti's
first name was incorrectly spel
led Tho, and the "yes" and
"no" were omitted from the
second fee assessment.
Although 2500 ballots had
been printed they were recal
led and reprinted before any
undergraduates had voted,
Murphy said.
Also early yesterday morning
a pollwatcher inadvertently
marked the "A" on student
identification cards as students
voted. The correct letter for
voting is "B". However, Mur
phy said that the mistake was
caught and he has a list of the
20 people whose ID cards were
marked incorrectly so that they
cannot vote again. "A" is the
letter used for marking off fee
assessment refunds.
Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy said yesterday
that "the elections commission
is conducting several investiga
tions" of campaign ir
regularities by ASSU senate
candidates.
However, Murphy said, "I
am not prepared to comment
on any of them."
Early yesterday morning,
leaflets pertaining to the elec
tion were inserted in copies of
the Daily without authoriza
tion. The Daily and Murphy are
currently investigating the in
cident.
In addition, charges have
been levied that some senate
candidates have" overspent
their $50 budgets and that clas
srooms have been used for
campaigning.
