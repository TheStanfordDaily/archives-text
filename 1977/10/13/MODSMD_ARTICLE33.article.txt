## Illegal billing claimed at Medical Center 
### Andrea James 
Formal charges stating that
the Stanford University Medi
cal Center illegally bills pa
tients have been filed by the
Union of American Physicians
(UAP).
These charges join com
plaints filed in January by Dr.
Eugene Dong, associate pro
fessor of cardiovascular
surgery.
The doctors union and Dong
allege that the medical center
violates a section of the
California Business Code,
which states that medical
schools and institutions may
make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered pa
tients."

The union claims patients
are being seen by professional,
full-time, paid interns and re
sidents, but are paying the
same fees charged by private
physicians.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, pres
ident of UAP and a Stanford
alumnus, issued the formal
compalint by wire to Gov. Jerry
Brown. In his complaint, he
requested the State Board of
Medical Quality Assurance to
immediately begin an investi
gation.
Millions of dollars
"For a number of years," he
said, "Stanford has charged pa
tients for physicians' services.
We believe that many millions
of dollars have been impro
perly paid by patients to Stan
ford.
"The Board of Medical Qual
ity Assurance is quick to take
on an individual physician
when he is accused of wrong
doing," Weinmann stated.
"Now we will see if they are
willing to enforce the law for
the big boys when they get
caught with their hands in the
cookie jar."
Weinmann pointed out at a
press conference held Tuesday
night in San Jose that two of the
19 board members are faculty
personnel at Stanford.
Dong's charges are basically
the same as Weinmann's. He
adds that even though patients
are being billed, Stanford is
still considered a charitable
and non-profit institution.
Both Weinmann and Dong
claim to have several docu
ments proving that their
charges and complaints are
legitimate.
Same as most
Stanford Medical Center of
ficials say they are confident
the medical practice system at

the School of Medicine con
forms with state few.
"As in past statements," said
Spyros Andreopoulos, director
of the medical center news
service, "the University reiter
ates its position that it uses the
same system as most medical
schools. This system is in full
compliance with all laws and is
even routinely evaluated by
federal and state agencies."
Weinmann agreed with An
dreopoulos, saying that col
leges and universities all over
the United States use this same
practice. "That's why we're tak
ing this to a national level," he
said. "The system represents
inflating charges, which is il
legal."
Audited system
Andreopoulos said that this
system has been recognized
and accepted by Medicare,
Medicaid and various insur
ance agencies. He added that
the medical center is subjected
to routine audits by gov
ernmental agencies and pro
fessional fee billings must con
form to standards established
by these agencies.
Andreopoulos described the
billing procedure. The patient
is seen by a full-time, paid resi
dent or intern. Because the re
sident is being taught by a Stan
ford faculty physician, he said,
the physician is legally respon
sible for all the services re
ndered by his student.
Therefore, the patient pays
the physician for services re
ndered, even though the pa
tient may never have seen that
physician.
He added that the physician
does not keep monies paid by
the patients, but turns the fees
over to the medical center for
operation of clinics and
maintenance of facilities.
