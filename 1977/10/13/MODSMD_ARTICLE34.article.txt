# Bonfire approved
## 
### Kevin Burke 
The Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC), voted yesterday after
noon, 11-4, to favor the Big
Game bonfire.
Plans for the bonfire will
continue to be drawn up,
awaiting the final approval of
the Palo Alto fire marshal and
the University administration.
With the worsening drought
conditions in the area, IFC
President Reid Butler said that
much opposition is already
being formed against the bon
fire.
He insisted that "all kinds of
pains will be taken to conform
with what the University wants,
and that the bonfire will defi
nitely not take place if the fire
marshal's approval is not re
ceived."
As of now, the IFC has set a
preliminary time schedule for
the bonfire's organization,
which calls for all plans to be
completed by Oct. 21, and
submitted to the administra
tion for final approval by Oct.
25.
Butler said that he expects all
frats to participate with the
bonfire. The cost of the bonfire
is expected to be about $1700,
and the financing is to come
from IFC dues and donations.
A student police force of 30

frat members will aid the local
police in administering crowd
and controls.
Butler and two other IFC of
ficers have already held a meet
ing with a group of concerned
administrators. Tom
Hornbeak, director of the row,
stated that the reason for the

Frats miss quotas

meeting was to identify the
problems of last year's bonfire
and improve planning of the
event.
Hornbeak also said that the
administration was mainly
concerned with "seeing the
total bonfire package com
pleted and submitted for ap
proval by all concerned — fire
marshal, police, special
events, pollution board, and
the administration — one
month before the bonfire is to
take place."
Hornbeak concluded that
the whole bonfire is "largely
up to the energy and interest of
the IFC, and that in order to be
a success, the must be
well planned and must incor
porate the energies of all the
fraternities."
