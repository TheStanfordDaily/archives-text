# 'Old Stanford Indians never die...'
## 
### 
April 1972. Several Univer
sity buildings are trashed
protesting President Richard
Nixon's decision to mine
Haiphong Harbor and resume
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam. More than 200 de
monstrators are arrested on El
Camino Real in a confrontation
which at times becomes vio
lent. The University has just
finished trying Bruce Franklin,
an English professor accused
of inciting students to take
over the computer center be
cause of work being done on
defense-related projects.
Somewhere in the middle of all
this, President Richard Lyman
finds time to get rid of the In
dian as the University's mas
cot.
Alumni opposing Lyman's
decision, which was almost
lost in the flurry of events that
spring, voiced their feelings in
a number of ways. Conserva
tive students, disagreeing with
the ASSU Senate's February,
1972 vote against the Indian,
began petitioning the student
government for a referendum.
Support for the traditional
mascot eventually centered in
the New Founders League of
Stanford, however, a group of
Bay Area alumni formed just
after Lyman's 1970 appoint
ment to succeed President
Kenneth Pitzer.
More than five years later,
the league is still involved in
the mascot issue, but only by
association. Its real focus is on
the kinds of problems which
brought the group together in
the first place. The story of the
league, then, is partly an athle
tic one,focused on that aspect
of campus life which is typically
the most conservative and
traditionalist. Because of
league members' activities
soon after Lyman's decision
and during the campaign to
reinstate the Indian in 1975, the
story is a political one as well.
But most of all it is the story of a
group of alumni dissatisfied by
a perceived trend toward
abandoning traditional Uni
versity stress on "forming the
whole person" through moral
education in favor of an over
emphasis on relatively sterile
academic achievement.
While individual league
members have been at
the center of the mascot dis
pute and have formed an inde
pendent organization, the
Friends of the Stanford Indian,
to promote the former sym
bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.
Many league members in fact
oppose the Indian mascot, and
others would prefer to
downplay the issue, at least as
long as President Richard
Lyman remains in office.
Lyman has made it clear that
the Indian will never return
during his .tenure and the
Board of Trustees, while in
cluding several reinstatement
advocates, has never shown an
interest in opposing the presi
dent.
Nevertheless, since Lyman's
decision, the Indian has been
and will remain for the
foreseeable future an integral
part of the league's appeal and
the issue which galvanizes
supper! * or , ' ie ' ea B ue as an a '"

the league) there is nothing
that has brought out support
anywhere near that for the In
dian," said Lowell Berry, an
alum in his 70s who hasworked
with the league since the be
ginning. Berry, like league
President Mike Antonacci, a
member of the Class of 1924, is
an Oakland business execu
tive. "Some of our people

would like to drop the Indian
issue, but with the support as
great as it is, we would be
doing our supporters a disser
vice to ignore it," Berry said.
The league's literature, prin
cipally a periodic newsletter
called Stanford's Direction, is
very mascot-oriented despite
the league's decision not to
make reinstatement of the In
dian one of its 10 official goals.
The June 1977 edition, for
example, includes engravings
of native Americans in full
headdress on either side of its
nameplate on the front page,
together with a reproduction
of a painting hanging in the Fa
culty Club portraying a tribal
warrior peering into the dis
tance on horseback. Below the
painting is the slogan, "Old
Stanford Indians Never Die —
Nor Do They Fade Away." In
addition, nearly every issue in
cludes articles referring to the
alleged impropriety of Lyman's
decision, promoting the ver
sion of the February-April 1972
decision period which says a
few radical native Americans
put pressure on Lyman and, in
effect, bamboozled him into
believing that all native Ameri
cans resented the Indian mas
cot.
Berry put the view of most
league members into perspec
tive: "We could call our teams
anything, but once we decided
on a name and made a tradition
of it, why not keep it? Some
people might believe that Le
land Stanford was one of the
greatest and shrewdest and
perhaps most ruthless robber
barons in our history — and he
was — but he acquired a cer
tain nobility by the time he and
his wife decided to establish
the University together.
"In the same way, even
though President Lyman and
the 'Indian' students who op
pose the mascot correctly
point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."
League member Lewis Sulli
van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual
certainty that the mascot will
not return as long as Lyman is
president: "If you really be
lieve in something, do you quit
simply because someone in a
position of authority disag
rees? One person's will in the
case has been dominating the
situation, and we believe we
should continue to promote
our view, which we believe is
the view of a majority of alumni
and faculty members."
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
which spearheaded the effort
to eliminate the symbol and
had spokespersons discuss the
issuewith the ASSU Senateand
Lyman, disagree strongly with
the unofficial league position.
SAIO President David Eisen
berg said the league's view of
native Americans "is totally
wrong. Indians mean people,
not something that can be as
sociated with mascots like
animals. The whole idea is ra
cist and shows the mentality of
pre-civil rights days when
white was supposedly sup
reme and other peoples were
inferior. There is a small native
American community at Stan
*Td and we feel alienated al
ready — vC', hv mak , e ,he Prob
lem worse by mato."?" un
our lives and heritage?"
Regarding the 1972 decision,
Lucia Mele, an SAIO member,
said there was popular support
among students for Lyman's
decision, as shown by the stu
dent senate vote. "There were
a lot of people behind those

who went up and talked," she
said.
Currently, members of the
Friends of the Stanford Indian
group, which largely overlaps
with the league, promote the
mascot by passing out feathers
and literature at football
games. Berry said the young
men who pass out the feathers
are members of the Herbert
Hoover Boys Club in Palo Alto.
"They're doing it gratis — not
one of them is paid to do it.
We've made a contribution to
their organization but that's
all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."
Whenever the mascot issue
has erupted, Eureka lawyer Tim
Williams, who dons headdress
and buckskins to attend tail
gate parties, rallies and games
as "Prince Lightfoot," has been
close to the center of dispute.
Williams, a Yurok, has prom-

oted the position tha. native
Americans support the mascot
and as a native American has
helped the cause of the mas
cot's defenders immensely.
Student native American lead
ers have, in the past, criticized
Williams as a man allowing
himself to be used by whites,
but Williams has replied that
tribal groups with which he is
involved have consistently af
firmed the mascot as a symbol
of pride.
The Indian issue has largely
obscured the "official"
goals of the league and has
turned attention away from
what is essentially a thorough
going conservative criticism of
University policy and process.
The group's 10 official goals in
clude having the Board of Trus
tees restore to itself certain
powers it has relinquished to
Lymai7,' 112 eating a faculty more
philosophically u'. l . ;,nce d bet
ween liberals and conserva"
tives; ending affirmative action
admissions; restoring ROTC
on campus; reestablishing
traditional uses of Memorial

Church; reforming the process
whereby alumni elected eight
members of the Board of Trus
tees by making more informa
tion on candidates available;
and encouraging more partici
pation by alumni in the affairs
of the University.
"We feel there should be
ROTC on campus for those
who want to take it. If we did
have it, there would be an op
portunity for scholarships for
students who now have to de
pend solely on their parents for
support. In addition, we be
lieve that civilian influence on
the military is something worth
keeping and something Stan
ford has an obligation to pro
mote," said Berry.
"I've always been strong for
civilian leadership in the armed
forces, and Stanford has to
provide civilian influence,"
Antonacci agreed.
ROTC at Stanford was a
casualty of the Vietnam Era and
has never been allowed to re
turn, although some students
here have attended ROTC clas
ses at the University of Santa
Clara and at UC-Berkeley,
which have retained the prog
ram. Conservative student
government leaders in the last

few years have occasionally
turned to the ROTC issue dur
ing their campaigns, but no
large-scale effort has been
made to restore it.
The league's more active
members, who are mostly
older white male alumni from
the Bay Area, are frustrated by
what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford
should be a man or woman of
character and integrity as well
as of academic excellence,"
said Berry. "It's an emphasis
today on achievement of the
kind for which you win recog
nition rather than on some of
the character goals we believe
are just as important," said Sul
livan.
"Here we are faced today
with more dishonesty in soci
ety, in the top management of
business, than ever before,"
Berry complained. "That's the
reason we are emphasiz
ing that Memorial Church ac
tivities should be encouraged
much more for the students

than it is today."
Perhaps the key thread run
ning between all these is
sues is that the older, generally
more conservative alumni who
sympathize with the league
(league officials claim to have
over 800 dues-paying mem
bers) feel they are not given
enough say in running the Uni
versity.
"The role of alumni and of
the New Founders League is as
a loyal opposition, making
comment in the areas where
they feel the University is mak
ing a mistake and proposing
constructive change," said Sul
livan. "Friends of the Univer
sity, including alumni, have to
provide support for a non-state
institution," said Berry. "We
think that if we do it loyally, the
feelings of the alumni should
be considered in University
policy." The Alumni Associa
tion is too close to the Univer
sity administration to give
voice to former students' con
cerns, he added.
Alumni Association Presi
dent Bill Stone, who was a
member of the administration
when many of the decisions
the league criticizes were
made, called the Alumni As-

sociation a "cumbersome
mechanism" for alumni lobby
ing efforts. "It's enormously
difficult to define a lobbying
position of an 110,000 member
group spread all over the
world," he said. "What alumni
have to do is make sure that the
association and administration
are aware of the views of indi
vidual alums and alumni
groups, and vote for the
alumni-elected trustees."
Stone complained that de
spite the New Founders
League's position that alumni
are talking but not being
heard, fewer and fewer alums
are taking an interest in help
ing elect the primary policy
making organization here, the
Board of Trustees. "The per
centage of alumni voting on
that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent
in the last election," he said.
Stone discounted the notion,
promoted by the league, that
league members have been ig
nored by the administration. "I
don't think anyone can say
they haven't been given a fair
hearing."

point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."
League member Lewis Sulli
van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual
certainty that the mascot will
not return as long as Lyman is
president: "If you really be
lieve in something, do you quit
simply because someone in a
position of authority disag
rees? One person's will in the
case has been dominating the
situation, and we believe we
should continue to promote
our view, which we believe is
the view of a majority of alumni
and faculty members."
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
which spearheaded the effort
to eliminate the symbol and
had spokespersons discuss the
issuewith the ASSU Senateand
Lyman, disagree strongly with
the unofficial league position.
SAIO President David Eisen
berg said the league's view of
native Americans "is totally
wrong. Indians mean people,
not something that can be as
sociated with mascots like
animals. The whole idea is ra
cist and shows the mentality of
pre-civil rights days when
white was supposedly sup
reme and other peoples were
inferior. There is a small native
American community at Stan
*Td and we feel alienated al
ready — vC', hv mak , e ,he Prob
lem worse by mato."?" un
our lives and heritage?"
Regarding the 1972 decision,
Lucia Mele, an SAIO member,
said there was popular support
among students for Lyman's
decision, as shown by the stu
dent senate vote. "There were
a lot of people behind those

who went up and talked," she
said.
Currently, members of the
Friends of the Stanford Indian
group, which largely overlaps
with the league, promote the
mascot by passing out feathers
and literature at football
games. Berry said the young
men who pass out the feathers
are members of the Herbert
Hoover Boys Club in Palo Alto.
"They're doing it gratis — not
one of them is paid to do it.
We've made a contribution to
their organization but that's
all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."
Whenever the mascot issue
has erupted, Eureka lawyer Tim
Williams, who dons headdress
and buckskins to attend tail
gate parties, rallies and games
as "Prince Lightfoot," has been
close to the center of dispute.
Williams, a Yurok, has prom-

oted the position tha. native
Americans support the mascot
and as a native American has
helped the cause of the mas
cot's defenders immensely.
Student native American lead
ers have, in the past, criticized
Williams as a man allowing
himself to be used by whites,
but Williams has replied that
tribal groups with which he is
involved have consistently af
firmed the mascot as a symbol
of pride.
The Indian issue has largely
obscured the "official"
goals of the league and has
turned attention away from
what is essentially a thorough
going conservative criticism of
University policy and process.
The group's 10 official goals in
clude having the Board of Trus
tees restore to itself certain
powers it has relinquished to
Lymai7,' 112 eating a faculty more
philosophically u'. l . ;,nce d bet
ween liberals and conserva"
tives; ending affirmative action
admissions; restoring ROTC
on campus; reestablishing
traditional uses of Memorial

Church; reforming the process
whereby alumni elected eight
members of the Board of Trus
tees by making more informa
tion on candidates available;
and encouraging more partici
pation by alumni in the affairs
of the University.
"We feel there should be
ROTC on campus for those
who want to take it. If we did
have it, there would be an op
portunity for scholarships for
students who now have to de
pend solely on their parents for
support. In addition, we be
lieve that civilian influence on
the military is something worth
keeping and something Stan
ford has an obligation to pro
mote," said Berry.
"I've always been strong for
civilian leadership in the armed
forces, and Stanford has to
provide civilian influence,"
Antonacci agreed.
ROTC at Stanford was a
casualty of the Vietnam Era and
has never been allowed to re
turn, although some students
here have attended ROTC clas
ses at the University of Santa
Clara and at UC-Berkeley,
which have retained the prog
ram. Conservative student
government leaders in the last

few years have occasionally
turned to the ROTC issue dur
ing their campaigns, but no
large-scale effort has been
made to restore it.
The league's more active
members, who are mostly
older white male alumni from
the Bay Area, are frustrated by
what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford
should be a man or woman of
character and integrity as well
as of academic excellence,"
said Berry. "It's an emphasis
today on achievement of the
kind for which you win recog
nition rather than on some of
the character goals we believe
are just as important," said Sul
livan.
"Here we are faced today
with more dishonesty in soci
ety, in the top management of
business, than ever before,"
Berry complained. "That's the
reason we are emphasiz
ing that Memorial Church ac
tivities should be encouraged
much more for the students

than it is today."
Perhaps the key thread run
ning between all these is
sues is that the older, generally
more conservative alumni who
sympathize with the league
(league officials claim to have
over 800 dues-paying mem
bers) feel they are not given
enough say in running the Uni
versity.
"The role of alumni and of
the New Founders League is as
a loyal opposition, making
comment in the areas where
they feel the University is mak
ing a mistake and proposing
constructive change," said Sul
livan. "Friends of the Univer
sity, including alumni, have to
provide support for a non-state
institution," said Berry. "We
think that if we do it loyally, the
feelings of the alumni should
be considered in University
policy." The Alumni Associa
tion is too close to the Univer
sity administration to give
voice to former students' con
cerns, he added.
Alumni Association Presi
dent Bill Stone, who was a
member of the administration
when many of the decisions
the league criticizes were
made, called the Alumni As-

sociation a "cumbersome
mechanism" for alumni lobby
ing efforts. "It's enormously
difficult to define a lobbying
position of an 110,000 member
group spread all over the
world," he said. "What alumni
have to do is make sure that the
association and administration
are aware of the views of indi
vidual alums and alumni
groups, and vote for the
alumni-elected trustees."
Stone complained that de
spite the New Founders
League's position that alumni
are talking but not being
heard, fewer and fewer alums
are taking an interest in help
ing elect the primary policy
making organization here, the
Board of Trustees. "The per
centage of alumni voting on
that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent
in the last election," he said.
Stone discounted the notion,
promoted by the league, that
league members have been ig
nored by the administration. "I
don't think anyone can say
they haven't been given a fair
hearing."

April 1972. Several Univer
sity buildings are trashed
protesting President Richard
Nixon's decision to mine
Haiphong Harbor and resume
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam. More than 200 de
monstrators are arrested on El
Camino Real in a confrontation
which at times becomes vio
lent. The University has just
finished trying Bruce Franklin,
an English professor accused
of inciting students to take
over the computer center be
cause of work being done on
defense-related projects.
Somewhere in the middle of all
this, President Richard Lyman
finds time to get rid of the In
dian as the University's mas
cot.
Alumni opposing Lyman's
decision, which was almost
lost in the flurry of events that
spring, voiced their feelings in
a number of ways. Conserva
tive students, disagreeing with
the ASSU Senate's February,
1972 vote against the Indian,
began petitioning the student
government for a referendum.
Support for the traditional
mascot eventually centered in
the New Founders League of
Stanford, however, a group of
Bay Area alumni formed just
after Lyman's 1970 appoint
ment to succeed President
Kenneth Pitzer.
More than five years later,
the league is still involved in
the mascot issue, but only by
association. Its real focus is on
the kinds of problems which
brought the group together in
the first place. The story of the
league, then, is partly an athle
tic one,focused on that aspect
of campus life which is typically
the most conservative and
traditionalist. Because of
league members' activities
soon after Lyman's decision
and during the campaign to
reinstate the Indian in 1975, the
story is a political one as well.
But most of all it is the story of a
group of alumni dissatisfied by
a perceived trend toward
abandoning traditional Uni
versity stress on "forming the
whole person" through moral
education in favor of an over
emphasis on relatively sterile
academic achievement.
While individual league
members have been at
the center of the mascot dis
pute and have formed an inde
pendent organization, the
Friends of the Stanford Indian,
to promote the former sym
bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.
Many league members in fact
oppose the Indian mascot, and
others would prefer to
downplay the issue, at least as
long as President Richard
Lyman remains in office.
Lyman has made it clear that
the Indian will never return
during his .tenure and the
Board of Trustees, while in
cluding several reinstatement
advocates, has never shown an
interest in opposing the presi
dent.
Nevertheless, since Lyman's
decision, the Indian has been
and will remain for the
foreseeable future an integral
part of the league's appeal and
the issue which galvanizes
supper! * or , ' ie ' ea B ue as an a '"

the league) there is nothing
that has brought out support
anywhere near that for the In
dian," said Lowell Berry, an
alum in his 70s who hasworked
with the league since the be
ginning. Berry, like league
President Mike Antonacci, a
member of the Class of 1924, is
an Oakland business execu
tive. "Some of our people

would like to drop the Indian
issue, but with the support as
great as it is, we would be
doing our supporters a disser
vice to ignore it," Berry said.
The league's literature, prin
cipally a periodic newsletter
called Stanford's Direction, is
very mascot-oriented despite
the league's decision not to
make reinstatement of the In
dian one of its 10 official goals.
The June 1977 edition, for
example, includes engravings
of native Americans in full
headdress on either side of its
nameplate on the front page,
together with a reproduction
of a painting hanging in the Fa
culty Club portraying a tribal
warrior peering into the dis
tance on horseback. Below the
painting is the slogan, "Old
Stanford Indians Never Die —
Nor Do They Fade Away." In
addition, nearly every issue in
cludes articles referring to the
alleged impropriety of Lyman's
decision, promoting the ver
sion of the February-April 1972
decision period which says a
few radical native Americans
put pressure on Lyman and, in
effect, bamboozled him into
believing that all native Ameri
cans resented the Indian mas
cot.
Berry put the view of most
league members into perspec
tive: "We could call our teams
anything, but once we decided
on a name and made a tradition
of it, why not keep it? Some
people might believe that Le
land Stanford was one of the
greatest and shrewdest and
perhaps most ruthless robber
barons in our history — and he
was — but he acquired a cer
tain nobility by the time he and
his wife decided to establish
the University together.
"In the same way, even
though President Lyman and
the 'Indian' students who op
pose the mascot correctly
point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."

van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual

not return as long as Lyman is

what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford
should be a man or woman of
character and integrity as well
as of academic excellence,"
said Berry. "It's an emphasis
today on achievement of the
kind for which you win recog
nition rather than on some of
the character goals we believe
are just as important," said Sul
livan.
"Here we are faced today
with more dishonesty in soci
ety, in the top management of
business, than ever before,"
Berry complained. "That's the
reason we are emphasiz
ing that Memorial Church ac
tivities should be encouraged
much more for the students

than it is today."
Perhaps the key thread run
ning between all these is
sues is that the older, generally
more conservative alumni who
sympathize with the league
(league officials claim to have
over 800 dues-paying mem
bers) feel they are not given
enough say in running the Uni
versity.
"The role of alumni and of
the New Founders League is as
a loyal opposition, making
comment in the areas where
they feel the University is mak
ing a mistake and proposing
constructive change," said Sul
livan. "Friends of the Univer
sity, including alumni, have to
provide support for a non-state
institution," said Berry. "We
think that if we do it loyally, the
feelings of the alumni should
be considered in University
policy." The Alumni Associa
tion is too close to the Univer
sity administration to give
voice to former students' con
cerns, he added.
Alumni Association Presi
dent Bill Stone, who was a
member of the administration
when many of the decisions
the league criticizes were
made, called the Alumni As-

sociation a "cumbersome
mechanism" for alumni lobby
ing efforts. "It's enormously
difficult to define a lobbying
position of an 110,000 member
group spread all over the
world," he said. "What alumni
have to do is make sure that the
association and administration
are aware of the views of indi
vidual alums and alumni
groups, and vote for the
alumni-elected trustees."
Stone complained that de
spite the New Founders
League's position that alumni
are talking but not being
heard, fewer and fewer alums
are taking an interest in help
ing elect the primary policy
making organization here, the
Board of Trustees. "The per
centage of alumni voting on
that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent
in the last election," he said.
Stone discounted the notion,
promoted by the league, that
league members have been ig
nored by the administration. "I
don't think anyone can say
they haven't been given a fair
hearing."

April 1972. Several Univer
sity buildings are trashed
protesting President Richard
Nixon's decision to mine
Haiphong Harbor and resume
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam. More than 200 de
monstrators are arrested on El
Camino Real in a confrontation
which at times becomes vio
lent. The University has just
finished trying Bruce Franklin,
an English professor accused
of inciting students to take
over the computer center be
cause of work being done on
defense-related projects.
Somewhere in the middle of all
this, President Richard Lyman
finds time to get rid of the In
dian as the University's mas
cot.
Alumni opposing Lyman's
decision, which was almost
lost in the flurry of events that
spring, voiced their feelings in
a number of ways. Conserva
tive students, disagreeing with
the ASSU Senate's February,
1972 vote against the Indian,
began petitioning the student
government for a referendum.
Support for the traditional
mascot eventually centered in
the New Founders League of
Stanford, however, a group of
Bay Area alumni formed just
after Lyman's 1970 appoint
ment to succeed President
Kenneth Pitzer.
More than five years later,
the league is still involved in
the mascot issue, but only by
association. Its real focus is on
the kinds of problems which
brought the group together in
the first place. The story of the
league, then, is partly an athle
tic one,focused on that aspect
of campus life which is typically
the most conservative and
traditionalist. Because of
league members' activities
soon after Lyman's decision
and during the campaign to
reinstate the Indian in 1975, the
story is a political one as well.
But most of all it is the story of a
group of alumni dissatisfied by
a perceived trend toward
abandoning traditional Uni
versity stress on "forming the
whole person" through moral
education in favor of an over
emphasis on relatively sterile
academic achievement.
While individual league
members have been at
the center of the mascot dis
pute and have formed an inde
pendent organization, the
Friends of the Stanford Indian,
to promote the former sym
bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.
Many league members in fact
oppose the Indian mascot, and
others would prefer to
downplay the issue, at least as
long as President Richard
Lyman remains in office.
Lyman has made it clear that
the Indian will never return
during his .tenure and the
Board of Trustees, while in
cluding several reinstatement
advocates, has never shown an
interest in opposing the presi
dent.
Nevertheless, since Lyman's
decision, the Indian has been
and will remain for the
foreseeable future an integral
part of the league's appeal and
the issue which galvanizes
supper! * or , ' ie ' ea B ue as an a '"
fgrnative alum."?.' vo ' ' n
terms ot alumni support i? T
the league) there is nothing
that has brought out support
anywhere near that for the In
dian," said Lowell Berry, an
alum in his 70s who hasworked
with the league since the be
ginning. Berry, like league
President Mike Antonacci, a
member of the Class of 1924, is
an Oakland business execu
tive. "Some of our people

would like to drop the Indian
issue, but with the support as
great as it is, we would be
doing our supporters a disser
vice to ignore it," Berry said.
The league's literature, prin
cipally a periodic newsletter
called Stanford's Direction, is
very mascot-oriented despite
the league's decision not to
make reinstatement of the In
dian one of its 10 official goals.
The June 1977 edition, for
example, includes engravings
of native Americans in full
headdress on either side of its
nameplate on the front page,
together with a reproduction
of a painting hanging in the Fa
culty Club portraying a tribal
warrior peering into the dis
tance on horseback. Below the
painting is the slogan, "Old
Stanford Indians Never Die —
Nor Do They Fade Away." In
addition, nearly every issue in
cludes articles referring to the
alleged impropriety of Lyman's
decision, promoting the ver
sion of the February-April 1972
decision period which says a
few radical native Americans
put pressure on Lyman and, in
effect, bamboozled him into
believing that all native Ameri
cans resented the Indian mas
cot.
Berry put the view of most
league members into perspec
tive: "We could call our teams
anything, but once we decided
on a name and made a tradition
of it, why not keep it? Some
people might believe that Le
land Stanford was one of the
greatest and shrewdest and
perhaps most ruthless robber
barons in our history — and he
was — but he acquired a cer
tain nobility by the time he and
his wife decided to establish
the University together.
"In the same way, even
though President Lyman and
the 'Indian' students who op
pose the mascot correctly
point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."
League member Lewis Sulli
van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual
certainty that the mascot will
not return as long as Lyman is
president: "If you really be
lieve in something, do you quit
simply because someone in a
position of authority disag
rees? One person's will in the
case has been dominating the
situation, and we believe we
should continue to promote
our view, which we believe is
the view of a majority of alumni
and faculty members."
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
which spearheaded the effort
to eliminate the symbol and
had spokespersons discuss the
issuewith the ASSU Senateand
Lyman, disagree strongly with
the unofficial league position.
SAIO President David Eisen
berg said the league's view of
native Americans "is totally
wrong. Indians mean people,
not something that can be as
sociated with mascots like
animals. The whole idea is ra
cist and shows the mentality of
pre-civil rights days when
white was supposedly sup
reme and other peoples were
inferior. There is a small native
American community at Stan
*Td and we feel alienated al
ready — vC', hv mak , e ,he Prob
lem worse by mato."?" un
our lives and heritage?"
Regarding the 1972 decision,
Lucia Mele, an SAIO member,
said there was popular support
among students for Lyman's
decision, as shown by the stu
dent senate vote. "There were
a lot of people behind those

who went up and talked," she
said.
Currently, members of the
Friends of the Stanford Indian
group, which largely overlaps
with the league, promote the
mascot by passing out feathers
and literature at football
games. Berry said the young
men who pass out the feathers
are members of the Herbert
Hoover Boys Club in Palo Alto.
"They're doing it gratis — not
one of them is paid to do it.
We've made a contribution to
their organization but that's
all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."
Whenever the mascot issue
has erupted, Eureka lawyer Tim
Williams, who dons headdress
and buckskins to attend tail
gate parties, rallies and games
as "Prince Lightfoot," has been
close to the center of dispute.
Williams, a Yurok, has prom-

oted the position tha. native
Americans support the mascot
and as a native American has
helped the cause of the mas
cot's defenders immensely.
Student native American lead
ers have, in the past, criticized
Williams as a man allowing
himself to be used by whites,
but Williams has replied that
tribal groups with which he is
involved have consistently af
firmed the mascot as a symbol
of pride.
The Indian issue has largely
obscured the "official"
goals of the league and has
turned attention away from
what is essentially a thorough
going conservative criticism of
University policy and process.
The group's 10 official goals in
clude having the Board of Trus
tees restore to itself certain
powers it has relinquished to
Lymai7,' 112 eating a faculty more
philosophically u'. l . ;,nce d bet
ween liberals and conserva"
tives; ending affirmative action
admissions; restoring ROTC
on campus; reestablishing
traditional uses of Memorial

Church; reforming the process
whereby alumni elected eight
members of the Board of Trus
tees by making more informa
tion on candidates available;
and encouraging more partici
pation by alumni in the affairs
of the University.
"We feel there should be
ROTC on campus for those
who want to take it. If we did
have it, there would be an op
portunity for scholarships for
students who now have to de
pend solely on their parents for
support. In addition, we be
lieve that civilian influence on
the military is something worth
keeping and something Stan
ford has an obligation to pro
mote," said Berry.
"I've always been strong for
civilian leadership in the armed
forces, and Stanford has to
provide civilian influence,"
Antonacci agreed.
ROTC at Stanford was a
casualty of the Vietnam Era and
has never been allowed to re
turn, although some students
here have attended ROTC clas
ses at the University of Santa
Clara and at UC-Berkeley,
which have retained the prog
ram. Conservative student
government leaders in the last

few years have occasionally
turned to the ROTC issue dur
ing their campaigns, but no
large-scale effort has been
made to restore it.
The league's more active
members, who are mostly
older white male alumni from
the Bay Area, are frustrated by
what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford

bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.
Many league members in fact
oppose the Indian mascot, and
others would prefer to
downplay the issue, at least as
long as President Richard
Lyman remains in office.
Lyman has made it clear that
the Indian will never return
during his .tenure and the
Board of Trustees, while in
cluding several reinstatement
advocates, has never shown an
interest in opposing the presi
dent.
Nevertheless, since Lyman's
decision, the Indian has been
and will remain for the
foreseeable future an integral
part of the league's appeal and
the issue which galvanizes
supper! * or , ' ie ' ea B ue as an a '"

the league) there is nothing
that has brought out support
anywhere near that for the In
dian," said Lowell Berry, an
alum in his 70s who hasworked
with the league since the be
ginning. Berry, like league
President Mike Antonacci, a
member of the Class of 1924, is
an Oakland business execu
tive. "Some of our people

would like to drop the Indian
issue, but with the support as
great as it is, we would be
doing our supporters a disser
vice to ignore it," Berry said.
The league's literature, prin
cipally a periodic newsletter
called Stanford's Direction, is
very mascot-oriented despite
the league's decision not to
make reinstatement of the In
dian one of its 10 official goals.
The June 1977 edition, for
example, includes engravings
of native Americans in full
headdress on either side of its
nameplate on the front page,
together with a reproduction
of a painting hanging in the Fa
culty Club portraying a tribal
warrior peering into the dis
tance on horseback. Below the
painting is the slogan, "Old
Stanford Indians Never Die —
Nor Do They Fade Away." In
addition, nearly every issue in
cludes articles referring to the
alleged impropriety of Lyman's
decision, promoting the ver
sion of the February-April 1972
decision period which says a
few radical native Americans
put pressure on Lyman and, in
effect, bamboozled him into
believing that all native Ameri
cans resented the Indian mas
cot.
Berry put the view of most
league members into perspec
tive: "We could call our teams
anything, but once we decided
on a name and made a tradition
of it, why not keep it? Some
people might believe that Le
land Stanford was one of the
greatest and shrewdest and
perhaps most ruthless robber
barons in our history — and he
was — but he acquired a cer
tain nobility by the time he and
his wife decided to establish
the University together.
"In the same way, even
though President Lyman and
the 'Indian' students who op
pose the mascot correctly
point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."
League member Lewis Sulli
van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual
certainty that the mascot will
not return as long as Lyman is
president: "If you really be
lieve in something, do you quit
simply because someone in a
position of authority disag
rees? One person's will in the
case has been dominating the
situation, and we believe we
should continue to promote
our view, which we believe is
the view of a majority of alumni
and faculty members."
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
which spearheaded the effort
to eliminate the symbol and
had spokespersons discuss the
issuewith the ASSU Senateand
Lyman, disagree strongly with
the unofficial league position.
SAIO President David Eisen
berg said the league's view of
native Americans "is totally
wrong. Indians mean people,
not something that can be as
sociated with mascots like
animals. The whole idea is ra
cist and shows the mentality of
pre-civil rights days when
white was supposedly sup
reme and other peoples were
inferior. There is a small native
American community at Stan
*Td and we feel alienated al
ready — vC', hv mak , e ,he Prob
lem worse by mato."?" un
our lives and heritage?"
Regarding the 1972 decision,
Lucia Mele, an SAIO member,
said there was popular support
among students for Lyman's
decision, as shown by the stu
dent senate vote. "There were
a lot of people behind those

who went up and talked," she
said.
Currently, members of the
Friends of the Stanford Indian
group, which largely overlaps
with the league, promote the
mascot by passing out feathers
and literature at football
games. Berry said the young
men who pass out the feathers
are members of the Herbert
Hoover Boys Club in Palo Alto.
"They're doing it gratis — not
one of them is paid to do it.
We've made a contribution to
their organization but that's
all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."
Whenever the mascot issue
has erupted, Eureka lawyer Tim
Williams, who dons headdress
and buckskins to attend tail
gate parties, rallies and games
as "Prince Lightfoot," has been
close to the center of dispute.
Williams, a Yurok, has prom-

oted the position tha. native
Americans support the mascot
and as a native American has
helped the cause of the mas
cot's defenders immensely.
Student native American lead
ers have, in the past, criticized
Williams as a man allowing
himself to be used by whites,
but Williams has replied that
tribal groups with which he is
involved have consistently af
firmed the mascot as a symbol
of pride.
The Indian issue has largely
obscured the "official"
goals of the league and has
turned attention away from
what is essentially a thorough
going conservative criticism of
University policy and process.
The group's 10 official goals in
clude having the Board of Trus
tees restore to itself certain
powers it has relinquished to
Lymai7,' 112 eating a faculty more
philosophically u'. l . ;,nce d bet
ween liberals and conserva"
tives; ending affirmative action
admissions; restoring ROTC
on campus; reestablishing
traditional uses of Memorial

Church; reforming the process
whereby alumni elected eight
members of the Board of Trus
tees by making more informa
tion on candidates available;
and encouraging more partici
pation by alumni in the affairs
of the University.
"We feel there should be
ROTC on campus for those
who want to take it. If we did
have it, there would be an op
portunity for scholarships for
students who now have to de
pend solely on their parents for
support. In addition, we be
lieve that civilian influence on
the military is something worth
keeping and something Stan
ford has an obligation to pro
mote," said Berry.
"I've always been strong for
civilian leadership in the armed
forces, and Stanford has to
provide civilian influence,"
Antonacci agreed.
ROTC at Stanford was a
casualty of the Vietnam Era and
has never been allowed to re
turn, although some students
here have attended ROTC clas
ses at the University of Santa
Clara and at UC-Berkeley,
which have retained the prog
ram. Conservative student
government leaders in the last

few years have occasionally
turned to the ROTC issue dur
ing their campaigns, but no
large-scale effort has been
made to restore it.
The league's more active
members, who are mostly
older white male alumni from
the Bay Area, are frustrated by
what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford
should be a man or woman of
character and integrity as well
as of academic excellence,"
said Berry. "It's an emphasis
today on achievement of the
kind for which you win recog
nition rather than on some of
the character goals we believe
are just as important," said Sul
livan.
"Here we are faced today
with more dishonesty in soci
ety, in the top management of
business, than ever before,"
Berry complained. "That's the
reason we are emphasiz
ing that Memorial Church ac
tivities should be encouraged
much more for the students

than it is today."
Perhaps the key thread run
ning between all these is
sues is that the older, generally
more conservative alumni who
sympathize with the league
(league officials claim to have
over 800 dues-paying mem
bers) feel they are not given
enough say in running the Uni
versity.
"The role of alumni and of
the New Founders League is as
a loyal opposition, making
comment in the areas where
they feel the University is mak
ing a mistake and proposing
constructive change," said Sul
livan. "Friends of the Univer
sity, including alumni, have to
provide support for a non-state
institution," said Berry. "We
think that if we do it loyally, the
feelings of the alumni should
be considered in University
policy." The Alumni Associa
tion is too close to the Univer
sity administration to give
voice to former students' con
cerns, he added.
Alumni Association Presi
dent Bill Stone, who was a
member of the administration
when many of the decisions
the league criticizes were
made, called the Alumni As-

sociation a "cumbersome
mechanism" for alumni lobby
ing efforts. "It's enormously
difficult to define a lobbying
position of an 110,000 member
group spread all over the
world," he said. "What alumni
have to do is make sure that the
association and administration
are aware of the views of indi
vidual alums and alumni
groups, and vote for the
alumni-elected trustees."
Stone complained that de
spite the New Founders
League's position that alumni
are talking but not being
heard, fewer and fewer alums
are taking an interest in help
ing elect the primary policy
making organization here, the
Board of Trustees. "The per
centage of alumni voting on
that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent
in the last election," he said.
Stone discounted the notion,
promoted by the league, that
league members have been ig
nored by the administration. "I
don't think anyone can say
they haven't been given a fair
hearing."

April 1972. Several Univer
sity buildings are trashed
protesting President Richard
Nixon's decision to mine
Haiphong Harbor and resume
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam. More than 200 de
monstrators are arrested on El
Camino Real in a confrontation
which at times becomes vio
lent. The University has just
finished trying Bruce Franklin,
an English professor accused
of inciting students to take
over the computer center be
cause of work being done on
defense-related projects.
Somewhere in the middle of all
this, President Richard Lyman
finds time to get rid of the In
dian as the University's mas
cot.
Alumni opposing Lyman's
decision, which was almost
lost in the flurry of events that
spring, voiced their feelings in
a number of ways. Conserva
tive students, disagreeing with
the ASSU Senate's February,
1972 vote against the Indian,
began petitioning the student
government for a referendum.
Support for the traditional
mascot eventually centered in
the New Founders League of
Stanford, however, a group of
Bay Area alumni formed just
after Lyman's 1970 appoint
ment to succeed President
Kenneth Pitzer.
More than five years later,
the league is still involved in
the mascot issue, but only by
association. Its real focus is on
the kinds of problems which
brought the group together in
the first place. The story of the
league, then, is partly an athle
tic one,focused on that aspect
of campus life which is typically
the most conservative and
traditionalist. Because of
league members' activities
soon after Lyman's decision
and during the campaign to
reinstate the Indian in 1975, the
story is a political one as well.
But most of all it is the story of a
group of alumni dissatisfied by
a perceived trend toward
abandoning traditional Uni
versity stress on "forming the
whole person" through moral
education in favor of an over
emphasis on relatively sterile
academic achievement.
While individual league
members have been at
the center of the mascot dis
pute and have formed an inde
pendent organization, the
Friends of the Stanford Indian,
to promote the former sym
bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.

all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."
Whenever the mascot issue
has erupted, Eureka lawyer Tim
Williams, who dons headdress
and buckskins to attend tail
gate parties, rallies and games
as "Prince Lightfoot," has been
close to the center of dispute.
Williams, a Yurok, has prom-

oted the position tha. native
Americans support the mascot
and as a native American has
helped the cause of the mas
cot's defenders immensely.
Student native American lead
ers have, in the past, criticized
Williams as a man allowing
himself to be used by whites,
but Williams has replied that
tribal groups with which he is
involved have consistently af
firmed the mascot as a symbol
of pride.
The Indian issue has largely
obscured the "official"
goals of the league and has
turned attention away from
what is essentially a thorough
going conservative criticism of
University policy and process.
The group's 10 official goals in
clude having the Board of Trus
tees restore to itself certain
powers it has relinquished to
Lymai7,' 112 eating a faculty more
philosophically u'. l . ;,nce d bet
ween liberals and conserva"
tives; ending affirmative action
admissions; restoring ROTC
on campus; reestablishing
traditional uses of Memorial

Church; reforming the process
whereby alumni elected eight
members of the Board of Trus
tees by making more informa
tion on candidates available;
and encouraging more partici
pation by alumni in the affairs
of the University.
"We feel there should be
ROTC on campus for those
who want to take it. If we did
have it, there would be an op
portunity for scholarships for
students who now have to de
pend solely on their parents for
support. In addition, we be
lieve that civilian influence on
the military is something worth
keeping and something Stan
ford has an obligation to pro
mote," said Berry.
"I've always been strong for
civilian leadership in the armed
forces, and Stanford has to
provide civilian influence,"
Antonacci agreed.
ROTC at Stanford was a
casualty of the Vietnam Era and
has never been allowed to re
turn, although some students
here have attended ROTC clas
ses at the University of Santa
Clara and at UC-Berkeley,
which have retained the prog
ram. Conservative student
government leaders in the last

few years have occasionally
turned to the ROTC issue dur
ing their campaigns, but no
large-scale effort has been
made to restore it.
The league's more active
members, who are mostly
older white male alumni from
the Bay Area, are frustrated by
what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford
should be a man or woman of
character and integrity as well
as of academic excellence,"
said Berry. "It's an emphasis
today on achievement of the
kind for which you win recog
nition rather than on some of
the character goals we believe
are just as important," said Sul
livan.
"Here we are faced today
with more dishonesty in soci
ety, in the top management of
business, than ever before,"
Berry complained. "That's the
reason we are emphasiz
ing that Memorial Church ac
tivities should be encouraged
much more for the students

than it is today."
Perhaps the key thread run
ning between all these is
sues is that the older, generally
more conservative alumni who
sympathize with the league
(league officials claim to have
over 800 dues-paying mem
bers) feel they are not given
enough say in running the Uni
versity.
"The role of alumni and of
the New Founders League is as
a loyal opposition, making
comment in the areas where
they feel the University is mak
ing a mistake and proposing
constructive change," said Sul
livan. "Friends of the Univer
sity, including alumni, have to
provide support for a non-state
institution," said Berry. "We
think that if we do it loyally, the
feelings of the alumni should
be considered in University
policy." The Alumni Associa
tion is too close to the Univer
sity administration to give
voice to former students' con
cerns, he added.
Alumni Association Presi
dent Bill Stone, who was a
member of the administration
when many of the decisions
the league criticizes were
made, called the Alumni As-

sociation a "cumbersome
mechanism" for alumni lobby
ing efforts. "It's enormously
difficult to define a lobbying
position of an 110,000 member
group spread all over the
world," he said. "What alumni
have to do is make sure that the
association and administration
are aware of the views of indi
vidual alums and alumni
groups, and vote for the
alumni-elected trustees."
Stone complained that de
spite the New Founders
League's position that alumni
are talking but not being
heard, fewer and fewer alums
are taking an interest in help
ing elect the primary policy
making organization here, the
Board of Trustees. "The per
centage of alumni voting on
that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent
in the last election," he said.
Stone discounted the notion,
promoted by the league, that
league members have been ig
nored by the administration. "I
don't think anyone can say
they haven't been given a fair
hearing."

April 1972. Several Univer
sity buildings are trashed
protesting President Richard
Nixon's decision to mine
Haiphong Harbor and resume
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam. More than 200 de
monstrators are arrested on El
Camino Real in a confrontation
which at times becomes vio
lent. The University has just
finished trying Bruce Franklin,
an English professor accused
of inciting students to take
over the computer center be
cause of work being done on
defense-related projects.
Somewhere in the middle of all
this, President Richard Lyman
finds time to get rid of the In
dian as the University's mas
cot.
Alumni opposing Lyman's
decision, which was almost
lost in the flurry of events that
spring, voiced their feelings in
a number of ways. Conserva
tive students, disagreeing with
the ASSU Senate's February,
1972 vote against the Indian,
began petitioning the student
government for a referendum.
Support for the traditional
mascot eventually centered in
the New Founders League of
Stanford, however, a group of
Bay Area alumni formed just
after Lyman's 1970 appoint
ment to succeed President
Kenneth Pitzer.
More than five years later,
the league is still involved in
the mascot issue, but only by
association. Its real focus is on
the kinds of problems which
brought the group together in
the first place. The story of the
league, then, is partly an athle
tic one,focused on that aspect
of campus life which is typically
the most conservative and
traditionalist. Because of
league members' activities
soon after Lyman's decision
and during the campaign to
reinstate the Indian in 1975, the
story is a political one as well.
But most of all it is the story of a
group of alumni dissatisfied by
a perceived trend toward
abandoning traditional Uni
versity stress on "forming the
whole person" through moral
education in favor of an over
emphasis on relatively sterile
academic achievement.
While individual league
members have been at
the center of the mascot dis
pute and have formed an inde
pendent organization, the
Friends of the Stanford Indian,
to promote the former sym
bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.
Many league members in fact
oppose the Indian mascot, and
others would prefer to
downplay the issue, at least as
long as President Richard
Lyman remains in office.
Lyman has made it clear that
the Indian will never return
during his .tenure and the
Board of Trustees, while in
cluding several reinstatement
advocates, has never shown an
interest in opposing the presi
dent.
Nevertheless, since Lyman's
decision, the Indian has been
and will remain for the
foreseeable future an integral
part of the league's appeal and
the issue which galvanizes
supper! * or , ' ie ' ea B ue as an a '"
fgrnative alum."?.' vo ' ' n
terms ot alumni support i? T
the league) there is nothing
that has brought out support
anywhere near that for the In
dian," said Lowell Berry, an
alum in his 70s who hasworked
with the league since the be
ginning. Berry, like league
President Mike Antonacci, a
member of the Class of 1924, is
an Oakland business execu
tive. "Some of our people

would like to drop the Indian
issue, but with the support as
great as it is, we would be
doing our supporters a disser
vice to ignore it," Berry said.
The league's literature, prin
cipally a periodic newsletter
called Stanford's Direction, is
very mascot-oriented despite
the league's decision not to
make reinstatement of the In
dian one of its 10 official goals.
The June 1977 edition, for
example, includes engravings
of native Americans in full
headdress on either side of its
nameplate on the front page,
together with a reproduction
of a painting hanging in the Fa
culty Club portraying a tribal
warrior peering into the dis
tance on horseback. Below the
painting is the slogan, "Old
Stanford Indians Never Die —
Nor Do They Fade Away." In
addition, nearly every issue in
cludes articles referring to the
alleged impropriety of Lyman's
decision, promoting the ver
sion of the February-April 1972
decision period which says a
few radical native Americans
put pressure on Lyman and, in
effect, bamboozled him into
believing that all native Ameri
cans resented the Indian mas
cot.
Berry put the view of most
league members into perspec
tive: "We could call our teams
anything, but once we decided
on a name and made a tradition
of it, why not keep it? Some
people might believe that Le
land Stanford was one of the
greatest and shrewdest and
perhaps most ruthless robber
barons in our history — and he
was — but he acquired a cer
tain nobility by the time he and
his wife decided to establish
the University together.
"In the same way, even
though President Lyman and
the 'Indian' students who op
pose the mascot correctly
point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."
League member Lewis Sulli
van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual
certainty that the mascot will
not return as long as Lyman is
president: "If you really be
lieve in something, do you quit
simply because someone in a
position of authority disag
rees? One person's will in the
case has been dominating the
situation, and we believe we
should continue to promote
our view, which we believe is
the view of a majority of alumni
and faculty members."
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
which spearheaded the effort
to eliminate the symbol and
had spokespersons discuss the
issuewith the ASSU Senateand
Lyman, disagree strongly with
the unofficial league position.
SAIO President David Eisen
berg said the league's view of
native Americans "is totally
wrong. Indians mean people,
not something that can be as
sociated with mascots like
animals. The whole idea is ra
cist and shows the mentality of
pre-civil rights days when
white was supposedly sup
reme and other peoples were
inferior. There is a small native
American community at Stan
*Td and we feel alienated al
ready — vC', hv mak , e ,he Prob
lem worse by mato."?" un
our lives and heritage?"
Regarding the 1972 decision,
Lucia Mele, an SAIO member,
said there was popular support
among students for Lyman's
decision, as shown by the stu
dent senate vote. "There were
a lot of people behind those

who went up and talked," she
said.
Currently, members of the
Friends of the Stanford Indian
group, which largely overlaps
with the league, promote the
mascot by passing out feathers
and literature at football
games. Berry said the young
men who pass out the feathers
are members of the Herbert
Hoover Boys Club in Palo Alto.
"They're doing it gratis — not
one of them is paid to do it.
We've made a contribution to
their organization but that's
all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."

are talking but not being

are taking an interest in help

Board of Trustees. "The per

that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent
in the last election," he said.

April 1972. Several Univer
sity buildings are trashed
protesting President Richard
Nixon's decision to mine
Haiphong Harbor and resume
intensive bombing of North
Vietnam. More than 200 de
monstrators are arrested on El
Camino Real in a confrontation
which at times becomes vio
lent. The University has just
finished trying Bruce Franklin,
an English professor accused
of inciting students to take
over the computer center be
cause of work being done on
defense-related projects.
Somewhere in the middle of all
this, President Richard Lyman
finds time to get rid of the In
dian as the University's mas
cot.
Alumni opposing Lyman's
decision, which was almost
lost in the flurry of events that
spring, voiced their feelings in
a number of ways. Conserva
tive students, disagreeing with
the ASSU Senate's February,
1972 vote against the Indian,
began petitioning the student
government for a referendum.
Support for the traditional
mascot eventually centered in
the New Founders League of
Stanford, however, a group of
Bay Area alumni formed just
after Lyman's 1970 appoint
ment to succeed President
Kenneth Pitzer.
More than five years later,
the league is still involved in
the mascot issue, but only by
association. Its real focus is on
the kinds of problems which
brought the group together in
the first place. The story of the
league, then, is partly an athle
tic one,focused on that aspect
of campus life which is typically
the most conservative and
traditionalist. Because of
league members' activities
soon after Lyman's decision
and during the campaign to
reinstate the Indian in 1975, the
story is a political one as well.
But most of all it is the story of a
group of alumni dissatisfied by
a perceived trend toward
abandoning traditional Uni
versity stress on "forming the
whole person" through moral
education in favor of an over
emphasis on relatively sterile
academic achievement.
While individual league
members have been at
the center of the mascot dis
pute and have formed an inde
pendent organization, the
Friends of the Stanford Indian,
to promote the former sym
bol's reinstatement, the league
as a whole has never made
reinstatement an official goal.
Many league members in fact
oppose the Indian mascot, and
others would prefer to
downplay the issue, at least as
long as President Richard
Lyman remains in office.
Lyman has made it clear that
the Indian will never return
during his .tenure and the
Board of Trustees, while in
cluding several reinstatement
advocates, has never shown an
interest in opposing the presi
dent.
Nevertheless, since Lyman's
decision, the Indian has been
and will remain for the
foreseeable future an integral
part of the league's appeal and
the issue which galvanizes
supper! * or , ' ie ' ea B ue as an a '"

the league) there is nothing
that has brought out support
anywhere near that for the In
dian," said Lowell Berry, an
alum in his 70s who hasworked
with the league since the be
ginning. Berry, like league
President Mike Antonacci, a
member of the Class of 1924, is
an Oakland business execu
tive. "Some of our people

would like to drop the Indian
issue, but with the support as
great as it is, we would be
doing our supporters a disser
vice to ignore it," Berry said.
The league's literature, prin
cipally a periodic newsletter
called Stanford's Direction, is
very mascot-oriented despite
the league's decision not to
make reinstatement of the In
dian one of its 10 official goals.
The June 1977 edition, for
example, includes engravings
of native Americans in full
headdress on either side of its
nameplate on the front page,
together with a reproduction
of a painting hanging in the Fa
culty Club portraying a tribal
warrior peering into the dis
tance on horseback. Below the
painting is the slogan, "Old
Stanford Indians Never Die —
Nor Do They Fade Away." In
addition, nearly every issue in
cludes articles referring to the
alleged impropriety of Lyman's
decision, promoting the ver
sion of the February-April 1972
decision period which says a
few radical native Americans
put pressure on Lyman and, in
effect, bamboozled him into
believing that all native Ameri
cans resented the Indian mas
cot.
Berry put the view of most
league members into perspec
tive: "We could call our teams
anything, but once we decided
on a name and made a tradition
of it, why not keep it? Some
people might believe that Le
land Stanford was one of the
greatest and shrewdest and
perhaps most ruthless robber
barons in our history — and he
was — but he acquired a cer
tain nobility by the time he and
his wife decided to establish
the University together.
"In the same way, even
though President Lyman and
the 'Indian' students who op
pose the mascot correctly
point out the terrible problems
that 'Indian' people have now,
we think there was a nobleness
in the 'Indian' leadership
which is worthy of being our
symbol, our source of pride."
League member Lewis Sulli
van summed up the reason for
continuing agitation on the In
dian issue despite the virtual
certainty that the mascot will
not return as long as Lyman is
president: "If you really be
lieve in something, do you quit
simply because someone in a
position of authority disag
rees? One person's will in the
case has been dominating the
situation, and we believe we
should continue to promote
our view, which we believe is
the view of a majority of alumni
and faculty members."
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization,
which spearheaded the effort
to eliminate the symbol and
had spokespersons discuss the
issuewith the ASSU Senateand
Lyman, disagree strongly with
the unofficial league position.
SAIO President David Eisen
berg said the league's view of
native Americans "is totally
wrong. Indians mean people,
not something that can be as
sociated with mascots like
animals. The whole idea is ra
cist and shows the mentality of
pre-civil rights days when
white was supposedly sup
reme and other peoples were
inferior. There is a small native
American community at Stan
*Td and we feel alienated al
ready — vC', hv mak , e ,he Prob
lem worse by mato."?" un
our lives and heritage?"
Regarding the 1972 decision,
Lucia Mele, an SAIO member,
said there was popular support
among students for Lyman's
decision, as shown by the stu
dent senate vote. "There were
a lot of people behind those

who went up and talked," she
said.
Currently, members of the
Friends of the Stanford Indian
group, which largely overlaps
with the league, promote the
mascot by passing out feathers
and literature at football
games. Berry said the young
men who pass out the feathers
are members of the Herbert
Hoover Boys Club in Palo Alto.
"They're doing it gratis — not
one of them is paid to do it.
We've made a contribution to
their organization but that's
all." Berry and Antonacci vig
orously deny reports, which
have appeared in Bay Area
newspapers, that the league is
selling decals with the Indian
symbol. "We're not trying to
peddle anything on the cam
pus at all," Berry said. "Of
course we invite them to make
contributions if they choose,
but that's an entirely different
sort of thing."
Whenever the mascot issue
has erupted, Eureka lawyer Tim
Williams, who dons headdress
and buckskins to attend tail
gate parties, rallies and games
as "Prince Lightfoot," has been
close to the center of dispute.
Williams, a Yurok, has prom-

oted the position tha. native
Americans support the mascot
and as a native American has
helped the cause of the mas
cot's defenders immensely.
Student native American lead
ers have, in the past, criticized
Williams as a man allowing
himself to be used by whites,
but Williams has replied that
tribal groups with which he is
involved have consistently af
firmed the mascot as a symbol
of pride.
The Indian issue has largely
obscured the "official"
goals of the league and has
turned attention away from
what is essentially a thorough
going conservative criticism of
University policy and process.
The group's 10 official goals in
clude having the Board of Trus
tees restore to itself certain
powers it has relinquished to
Lymai7,' 112 eating a faculty more
philosophically u'. l . ;,nce d bet
ween liberals and conserva"
tives; ending affirmative action
admissions; restoring ROTC
on campus; reestablishing
traditional uses of Memorial

Church; reforming the process
whereby alumni elected eight
members of the Board of Trus
tees by making more informa
tion on candidates available;
and encouraging more partici
pation by alumni in the affairs
of the University.
"We feel there should be
ROTC on campus for those
who want to take it. If we did
have it, there would be an op
portunity for scholarships for
students who now have to de
pend solely on their parents for
support. In addition, we be
lieve that civilian influence on
the military is something worth
keeping and something Stan
ford has an obligation to pro
mote," said Berry.
"I've always been strong for
civilian leadership in the armed
forces, and Stanford has to
provide civilian influence,"
Antonacci agreed.
ROTC at Stanford was a
casualty of the Vietnam Era and
has never been allowed to re
turn, although some students
here have attended ROTC clas
ses at the University of Santa
Clara and at UC-Berkeley,
which have retained the prog
ram. Conservative student
government leaders in the last

few years have occasionally
turned to the ROTC issue dur
ing their campaigns, but no
large-scale effort has been
made to restore it.
The league's more active
members, who are mostly
older white male alumni from
the Bay Area, are frustrated by
what they see as a sterile
academic focus of the Univer
sity's programs to the exclu
sion of tradition. "The man or
woman coming out of Stanford
should be a man or woman of
character and integrity as well
as of academic excellence,"
said Berry. "It's an emphasis
today on achievement of the
kind for which you win recog
nition rather than on some of
the character goals we believe
are just as important," said Sul
livan.
"Here we are faced today
with more dishonesty in soci
ety, in the top management of
business, than ever before,"
Berry complained. "That's the
reason we are emphasiz
ing that Memorial Church ac
tivities should be encouraged
much more for the students

than it is today."
Perhaps the key thread run
ning between all these is
sues is that the older, generally
more conservative alumni who
sympathize with the league
(league officials claim to have
over 800 dues-paying mem
bers) feel they are not given
enough say in running the Uni
versity.
"The role of alumni and of
the New Founders League is as
a loyal opposition, making
comment in the areas where
they feel the University is mak
ing a mistake and proposing
constructive change," said Sul
livan. "Friends of the Univer
sity, including alumni, have to
provide support for a non-state
institution," said Berry. "We
think that if we do it loyally, the
feelings of the alumni should
be considered in University
policy." The Alumni Associa
tion is too close to the Univer
sity administration to give
voice to former students' con
cerns, he added.
Alumni Association Presi
dent Bill Stone, who was a
member of the administration
when many of the decisions
the league criticizes were
made, called the Alumni As-

sociation a "cumbersome
mechanism" for alumni lobby
ing efforts. "It's enormously
difficult to define a lobbying
position of an 110,000 member
group spread all over the
world," he said. "What alumni
have to do is make sure that the
association and administration
are aware of the views of indi
vidual alums and alumni
groups, and vote for the
alumni-elected trustees."
Stone complained that de
spite the New Founders
League's position that alumni
are talking but not being
heard, fewer and fewer alums

ing elect the primary policy
making organization here, the
Board of Trustees. "The per
centage of alumni voting on
that subject is trailing off, to
somewhere around 20 per cent

promoted by the league, that

nored by the administration. "I
don't think anyone can say
