# Bakke hearing opens
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Paul Bak
ke's attorney told the Supreme
Court yesterday his client "has
a right not to be discriminated
against because of race." But
Archibald Cox countered that
racial minorities are entitled to
special treatment to offset past
discrimination.
With those arguments, the
opposing attorneys con
fronted the court with the most
important race relations con
troversy to reach it in a genera
tion. The judgment of the nine
justices on Bakke's "reverse
discrimination" case could
have a profound effect on the
future of so-called affirmative
action programs in education
and business across the nation.
Many civil rights leaders and
constitutional scholars believe
the justices' decision could
rank in its impact with the
court's 1954 ruling that out
lawed segregation.
The case drew wide atten
tion, and hundreds of people
lined up outside the court
building as early as Tuesday
evening to be able to see the
session.
"Allan Bakke's position is
that he has a right not to be
discriminated against because
of race," San Francisco attor
ney Reynold Colvin argued in
urging the court to uphold a
ruling by the California Sup
reme Court. The state court
ruled that a special admissions
program used by the Univer
sity of California's medical
school at Davis made Bakke a
victim of racial discrimination
because it allowed less
academically qualified minor
ity students to enter while
excluding Bakke.
Bakke, a 37-year-old Sun
nyvale, Calif., engineer with
the nation's space program,
successfullycontended in state
courts that hewould have been
admitted if the med school had
not set aside 16 of each year's
entering class for minority stu
dents. The university appealed
the California court's ruling,
and Cox, its attorney, argued
that such a program is needed
to aid persons "long victimized
by racial discrimination."
While Cox argued that the
medical school program had
the valid "objective of break
ing down isolation," Colvin
claimed that "race itself is an
improper guide for selection to
the medical school." While
Colvin said the California court
was correct in its finding that
"there were alternatives" to a
race-conscious admissions
policy, Cox contended, "The
other alternatives suggested
simply will not work."
Cox said the program was
"not a quota, at least as I would
use the word."
Many of the justices' ques
tions centered not on the con
stitutional question but one of
federal law. The California
courts found that the program
not only violated the Constitu
tion's 14th Amendment but
also a portion of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 which p; 0 .
hibits racial di^^yimi nation in
programs receiv
ing federal funding.
Chief justice Warren E.
Burger and Justices William J.
Brennan |r. and Byron R. White
asked Colvin and Cox on
whether the case could be de
cided without reference to the
constitutional question. If the
court takes such a route, the
chances of an expected
"landmark" decision would
decline.
