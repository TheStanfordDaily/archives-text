# Frats miss quota
## 
### 
Eight of the 13 fraternities here did not meet their University
pledge quotas this year, according to Tom Hornbeak, assistant
row director.
If this trend continues next year, two frats, Alpha Delta Phi and
Theta Xi, may face inclusion in the housing draw system.
The fraternity system as a whole was asked to pledge 233
"sophomore equivalents," but pledged only 220.5 this year,
Hornbeak said. Because the Delta Tau Delta fraternity was sus
pended last year, the 1976 pledges were counted in this year's
quota. This added nine more sophomore equivalents, making
the final total 229.5.
A sophomore equivalent is a person with two years of guaran
teed University housing remaining. A person with one year of
guaranteed housing remaining counts as half a sophomore equi
valent.
Dave Dick, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) rush chairman, said
that he did not feel that failing to meet the quotas reflected a "lack
of interest in frats, because the number of people going through
spring rush was as many, if not more, than the year before.
"A good deal of the problem was overlapping of bids," Dick
continued. "This caused a situation where two or three frats were
offering bids to the same people, and each person could only
accept one bid."
Unfavorable impressions
According to IFC Vice President Peter McCook, the lack of
pledges "could be due to a whole lot of things. A lot might have to
do with other housing options available. I've also heard of cases
where RAs (house associates) in dorms don't give a favorable
impression of fraterbities."
This year, Alpha Delta Phi pledged only 14.5 sophomore equi
valents, with a 21.5 quota. Theta Xi faced a target of 12.5 sopho
more equivalents, but pledged only five.
"These two houses in particular we need to talk with," com
mented Hornbeak. "It shows in their operation when a house is
that far below their quota. Economically, it's difficult to sustain a
house that has a large number of boarders."
"It was our fault, because we didn't do things that we should
have done," explained Chris Thomas, president of Theta Xi. "We
tried to project an image of being easy-going, which hurt us,
because it turned out we had no image at all."
According to Thomas, "the administration has been making
suggestions" as to how to improve their rush this year and "gen
erally making sure we understand the agreement we have with
them."
Other houses that were between two and 3.5 below quota were
Beta Theta Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Delta Theta and Theta Delta Chi.
The Delts, Delta Upsilon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi and
Zeta Psi were all above their quotas.
Based on regulations set up by the University, there are two
sets of circumstances under which a fraternity can be considered
for placement in the draw.
Placed in draw
First, if the fraternity system misses its overall quota for two
consecutive years, the house furthest below its target has a
chance of being placed in the draw. This provision does not apply
this year because the frat system has met its quota for the past two
years.
Second, if a fraternity performs poorly for three out of four
consecutive years, it may be placed in the draw. Performing
poorly means missing the quota by more than 10 per cent when
the fraternity system makes its overall quota or missing its quota
at all when the fraternity system does not make its quota.
Last year, both Alpha Delts and Theta Xi missed their quota by
more than 10 per cent. "If etther one misses their quota this
spring we will be put in a position to consider much more seri
ously if they should be put in the draw," Hornbeak said.

them."
Other houses that were between two and 3.5 below quota were
Beta Theta Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Delta Theta and Theta Delta Chi.
The Delts, Delta Upsilon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi and
Zeta Psi were all above their quotas.
Based on regulations set up by the University, there are two
sets of circumstances under which a fraternity can be considered
for placement in the draw.
Placed in draw
First, if the fraternity system misses its overall quota for two
consecutive years, the house furthest below its target has a
chance of being placed in the draw. This provision does not apply
this year because the frat system has met its quota for the past two
years.
Second, if a fraternity performs poorly for three out of four
consecutive years, it may be placed in the draw. Performing
poorly means missing the quota by more than 10 per cent when
the fraternity system makes its overall quota or missing its quota
at all when the fraternity system does not make its quota.
Last year, both Alpha Delts and Theta Xi missed their quota by
more than 10 per cent. "If etther one misses their quota this
spring we will be put in a position to consider much more seri
ously if they should be put in the draw," Hornbeak said.

Eight of the 13 fraternities here did not meet their University
pledge quotas this year, according to Tom Hornbeak, assistant
row director.
If this trend continues next year, two frats, Alpha Delta Phi and
Theta Xi, may face inclusion in the housing draw system.
The fraternity system as a whole was asked to pledge 233
"sophomore equivalents," but pledged only 220.5 this year,
Hornbeak said. Because the Delta Tau Delta fraternity was sus
pended last year, the 1976 pledges were counted in this year's
quota. This added nine more sophomore equivalents, making
the final total 229.5.
A sophomore equivalent is a person with two years of guaran
teed University housing remaining. A person with one year of
guaranteed housing remaining counts as half a sophomore equi
valent.
Dave Dick, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) rush chairman, said
that he did not feel that failing to meet the quotas reflected a "lack
of interest in frats, because the number of people going through
spring rush was as many, if not more, than the year before.
"A good deal of the problem was overlapping of bids," Dick
continued. "This caused a situation where two or three frats were
offering bids to the same people, and each person could only
accept one bid."
Unfavorable impressions
According to IFC Vice President Peter McCook, the lack of
pledges "could be due to a whole lot of things. A lot might have to
do with other housing options available. I've also heard of cases
where RAs (house associates) in dorms don't give a favorable
impression of fraterbities."
This year, Alpha Delta Phi pledged only 14.5 sophomore equi
valents, with a 21.5 quota. Theta Xi faced a target of 12.5 sopho
more equivalents, but pledged only five.
"These two houses in particular we need to talk with," com
mented Hornbeak. "It shows in their operation when a house is
that far below their quota. Economically, it's difficult to sustain a
house that has a large number of boarders."
"It was our fault, because we didn't do things that we should
have done," explained Chris Thomas, president of Theta Xi. "We
tried to project an image of being easy-going, which hurt us,
because it turned out we had no image at all."
According to Thomas, "the administration has been making
suggestions" as to how to improve their rush this year and "gen
erally making sure we understand the agreement we have with
them."
