# Woodward canceled
## 
### 
An appearance by journalist
Bob Woodward originally
scheduled for October 14 by
the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE)
has been canceled, according
to Rick Weber, co-director of
SCOPE.
Woodward may still appear
at the University sometime in
the future, said Weber, but
SCOPE, with an offer of help
from the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, is now concentrating
more seriously on getting Ben
Bradlee, editor of the
Washington Post, as a re
placement for Woodward. Ac
cording to Chuck Nelson, di
rector of the Speakers Bureau,
Bradlee will probably appear
here on November 14, though
contract negotiations have not
yet been finalized.
According to Weber, SCOPE
began negotiations with
Woodward during the sum
mer. After setting October 14
as the date for his appearance,
Weber contacted Nelson for
possible assistance and fund
ing from the Speakers Bureau.
Nelson said that after examin
ing the funding situation, he
decided that raising the unpre
cedented $4000 honorarium,
plus personal expenses and
publicity costs, which Wood
ward demanded by Oct. 14,

would be impossible.
Nelson said that Wood
ward's booking agency,
American Program Bureau, has
been known to renege on con
tracts in the past. He said the
Speakers Bureau would prefer
to avoid such incidents as the
Harold Wilson appointment
last year. The Speakers Bureau
made an arrangement with APB
to have Wilson, former British
Prime Minister, speak here,
only to discover later that Wil
son had no intention of coming
to the United States.
Nelson therefore refused
any Speakers Bureau aid for
the Woodward appearance.
In the meantime, Weber
said, he doubted he could
bring the event off successfully
by October 14. According to
Weber, when the Speakers
Bureau withdrew, SCOPE de
cided that its chances had di
minished to such an extent that
"in the best interests of the
students" the appearance
should be canceled or post
poned.
Nelson said Bradlee, be
cause of his greater experience
and higher position on the
Post, should be a better
speaker than Woodward, and
"besides, he costs only $2500
and Woodward is $5000."
