# Maritime Preference Bill
## Another Carter scandal? 
### 
Doug Bandow

President jimmy Carter's white
armor has become badly tarnished as
of late, with the Lance affair being
only one of many factors. There have
been a number of other serious de
partures from the promised "new
morality" in government.
For example, Carter's campaign
did not pay for several corporate
plane rides —which would be illegal
if they were considered to be corpo
rate contributions. Two top State
Department Carter appointees,
Hodding Carter 111 and Patricia De
rian, are members of a group that has
applied for the license for a lucrative
Mississippi TV station — creating a
major conflict of interest.
Jody Powell, the White House
press secretary, got caught en
couraging the publication of false in
formation on Sen. Charles Percy (R
-III.), and Carter staffers signed bogus
travel vouchers to gain interest-free
"loans" at taxpayer expense during
the transition. And despite Carter's
observation that "all federal judges
and prosecutors should be ap
pointed strictly on the basis of merit,
without any consideration of politi
cal aspect or influence," he has re
placed several highly-regarded Re
publican U.S. attorneys, such as
Samuel Skinner of Chicago (whose
retention was supported by all three
newspapers and a group of 19 law
professors).
Worst scandal
However, the worst scandal has
not yet received the media attention
that it deserves, because of the Lance
affair. Carter has decided to back the
Maritime Preference Bill, which
would require that at least 9.5 per
cent of all oil imports be carried by
American tankers.
Carter's support, which is to pay
off the maritime unions for their
$100,000 in 1976 campaign contribu
tions, bears a striking resemblance to
former President Nixon's support in
1971 for higher milk price supports in
exchange for political contributions.
That blatant political pay-off was
roundly denounced — as it should
have been: it is again time to fight a
gross abuse by special interests and a
president.
Carter and Rep. John Murphy (D-
N.Y.), the chairman of the House
Merchant Marines and Fisheries
Committee, have both been acutely
embarrassed by the whole episode,
and have therefore tried to stifle de
bate on the issue. Carter administra
tion officials, and maritime union
leaders, refused to testify before the

committee.
Murphy, who has received over
$29,000 this year toward the re
election campaign, then killed Rep.
Paul McCloskey's (R-Menlo Park) ef
forts to subpoena the witnesses (in
earlier days this sort of behavior was
known as stone-walling).
Democrats write
Thirty-one House Democrats
wrote the Rules Committee Chair
man, and requested that the bill be
kept off the floor until the witnesses
could be examined. They noted that:
"We don't think any bill should be
rammed through without full oppor
tunity for testimony from all con
cerned viewpoints."
Rep. Andrew jacobs (D-lnd.), a lib
eral Democrat, appeared before the
committee seeking to have a report
"that is balanced — that tells the
truth." Nevertheless, the committee
voted to send it to the floor.
This bill, which Carter so badly
wants to hide, would cost the tax
payers over $600 million, according
to the General Accounting Office, or
even as much as $800 million, accord
ing to a june 17, 1977 memorandum
by Treasury Secretary Michael Blu
menthal It would create a few
thousand jobs at a cost to the tax
payers of up to $111,000 each — and
the government already subsidizes
ship construction and pays 73 per
cent of each seaman's salary.
Carter publicly based his support
on the interests of "national sec
urity," despite the acknowledge
ment by the Defense Department
that getting oil — not tankers — dur
ing a time of war would be the prob
lem. It is revealing to look at the im
pressive array of opponents: Treas
ury Secretary Blumenthal, the State
Department, the Office of Manage
ment and Budget, the Defense De
partment, the Economic Policy
Group, the League of Women Vot
ers, and Common Cause.
Revealing memoranda
But more revealing still are the in
ternal memoranda leaked to Rep.
McCloskey, which detailed the
rationale of Carter's decision. The
memoranda acknowledge that the
bill, if passed, would violate treaties
with 30 different countries, lessen
the gross national product, increase
unemployment, invite retaliation, be
difficult to administer, cost taxpayers
up to $800 million, and would
amount to protectionism.
However, the arguments against
the bill fell before the payment of
political debts. Carter accepted the

rationale of Stu Eizenstat and Bill
Johnson, who in a memorandum
dated June 23, 1977, recommended
that: "While we feel that cargo pre
ference is a flawed concept, it ap
pears to be the only immediately av
ailable alternative that can signific
antly strengthen the maritime indus
try. In light of your commitment to
the industry and the likelihood that
rejection of cargo preference will be
seen as a broken promise, we sup
port the limited cargo preference op
tion outlined above."
It will take a major effort to defeat
the bill. Maritime interests invested
over $1 million in contributions to
congressmen last year and a bill was
passed in 1974 setting a 30 per cent
minimum, which was thankfully vet
oed by then-President Ford. But it
can, and should, be done. Everyone
in the Stanford community should
do all they can to arouse their elected
officials to defeat this egregiously
expensive political pay-off. Our hero
on the white charger is no more.
