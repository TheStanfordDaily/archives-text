Divestment analysis
In Wednesday's Daily (Oct. 12),
Lloyd Dixon, etal., raise the spectre
of delay in publishing an analysis of
the costs and benefits of the Univer
sity divesting itself and excluding
holding securities of corporations
with assets in South Africa. It has al
ready been reported earlier in the
Daily that such an analysis was virtu
ally complete and a report would be
made in a matter of weeks.
The analysis, being done in my of
fice, has taken considerable time and
effort, the more so given that we
have no prior studies or precedent to
build upon. The authors knew this,
and further I believe they under
stood we are trying to finish our
study as quickly as possible.
I can only interpret their com
ments, therefore, as a manipulative
technique to stir up the emotions of
Daily readers, in direct contraven
tion to their stated desire for
reasoned debate.

Saturday seating
How long will the fraternities be
permitted to dictate seating ar
rangements in the Stanford student
section at football games? Armed
with phony out-dated or
homemade "Student Police"
badges, a few thugs stake out a claim
of over 200 choice seats for their
cronies (rows 30-40 between the 40-
yard lines at last Saturday's UCLA
game), cheating those students who
have waited patiently in line for those
seats.
These well-muscled goons (repre
senting Zeta Psi and Phi Delta Theta
among others) aggressively patrol
the perimeter of their claim using in
timidation tactics to discourage
those who arrive early in order to get
desirable seats.
An appeal to the Fundamental
Standard should be enough to con
vince anyone that this offensive be
havior has no place on campus.
Dispatching one uniformed patrol
man would suffice to eradicate this
outrageous land grab.
Alternatively, we propose a
randomly-assigned block seating
scheme which would guarantee each
student ticket-holder a reserved seat
regardless of arrival time. This
method is used successfully across
the country at major and minor
schools to assure equity of seating,
while allowing groups of students to
sit together if they so desire.
The details of the plan are thus: at
some time before each home game,

those students planning to attend
the game must validate their ticket to
that game by acquiring a randomly
assigned reserved seat in the student
section.
To accommodate those wishing to
enjoy the games with friends, tickets
might be assigned in groups up to
(say) 20, upon presentation of
sufficient tickets. These blocs
would also be randomized, so that
students get good seats for some
games, 'poor' seats for others. Much
time is saved on game day, and no
one must put up with the hassle of
arguing with some turkey trying to
save the whole student section for
his 100 "friends."

Racism close to home
As interests in corporate invest
ment policies in South Africa are re
kindled for the 1977-78 school year,
allow me to relight a case of racism
that has flickered over the years and
which is a lot closer to home: racism
in construction projects at Stanford,
as shown by the information below.
Whereas there may be some im
provement in the absolute number
of all minorities employed on con
struction contracts, the fact is that
there has not been a satisfactory
growth in the number of black
employes. Moreover, particular
trade unions are continuing not to
employ blacks.
In 1976, more than 1000 man-hours
were accumulated on the following
job classifications and none of them
were by black workers: supervisory,
asbestos workers, bricklayers,
lathers, painters, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers and tile
setters (ceramic).
From January to June 1977, no
black workers were employed in the
following classifications: supervis
ory, asbestos workers, bricklayers,
caulkers, concrete workers (labor
ers), electricians, electrician appren
tices, floor tilers (carpet layers), hod
carriers, lathers, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers, sheet
metal workers' apprentices, sprink
ler fitter apprentices, and tapers.
This problem has been brought to
the University's and the President's
attention over the last three or four
years, and the results have been the
same. This can only be described as
neglect, or willful financing of racism
on Stanford's construction projects
— many of which are in process. This
is to be expected; after all, what's
more important than building? Stan

ford was rocky before Bakke!

'Nerdism'
Your marvelous article on "Ner
dism" (Daily, Oct. 6) correctly directs
the reader toward the emotional
price one often pays for "type-A"
competitiveness and an undeniable
price in physical health over the
years.
There are other performance
related problems as well from an
emphasis on peer competition. I saw
a recent investigation which showed
that negative attitudes of "math anx
iety" are well developed by the
fourth grade in nearly all children.
Hence it is an inescapable conclu
sion that the elementary school's
traditional hurry-up, peer
competitive, teacher-judgemental
setting produces real disability in
most people (even in most Stanford
nerds) for thinking in ways which are
even rudimentarily numerical in
their daily lives and in their work.
Most everybody gets their first big
dose of Nerdism training before they
are very far into the first grade. Since
most parents demand such an orien
tation to learning and socialization,
and since most teachers love to do it
to the children, the real struggle for
mental and physical health in this
country is in the elementary school
and in the home.
We mustn't forget tnat we at Stan
ford are the ones who survived our
early mad-house experiences in the
schools. Imagine what happened to
everybody else. Crowing up in
America is dangerous to your health.

Israeli relations
The country is beginning to
agonize over a crucial, and
cruciform, dilemma: a special rela
tion to Israel based on an equal
commitment to intertraditional
fraternity — reinforced by the urgent
need to co-exist with Russia (plus our
energy problems).
As usual in such dilemmas, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and the rest of the
country are fated to choose a middl
ing solution and hope for the best.
The Israelis' plausible fear of an
nihilation will cause them and their
supporters much anguish, but it is
hard to see the administration choos
ing otherwise than to give the Pales
tinians a chance at a state followed by
accommodation in the area based on
Soviet-American cooperation. We
are going to have to sweat it out.

Meanwhile, it is ironic that Kis
singer took so much heat for doing
precisely what Brzezinski is doing:
working things out with Russia. The
new emphasis on human rights was,
no doubt, supposed to make this de
aling more palatable. But it remains
to be seen whether our great cultural
tradition, western civilization itself,
will survive in the hand of the new
leaders, let alone Israel.

Racism close to home
As interests in corporate invest
ment policies in South Africa are re
kindled for the 1977-78 school year,
allow me to relight a case of racism
that has flickered over the years and
which is a lot closer to home: racism
in construction projects at Stanford,
as shown by the information below.
Whereas there may be some im
provement in the absolute number
of all minorities employed on con
struction contracts, the fact is that
there has not been a satisfactory
growth in the number of black
employes. Moreover, particular
trade unions are continuing not to
employ blacks.
In 1976, more than 1000 man-hours
were accumulated on the following
job classifications and none of them
were by black workers: supervisory,
asbestos workers, bricklayers,
lathers, painters, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers and tile
setters (ceramic).
From January to June 1977, no
black workers were employed in the
following classifications: supervis
ory, asbestos workers, bricklayers,
caulkers, concrete workers (labor
ers), electricians, electrician appren
tices, floor tilers (carpet layers), hod
carriers, lathers, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers, sheet
metal workers' apprentices, sprink
ler fitter apprentices, and tapers.
This problem has been brought to
the University's and the President's
attention over the last three or four
years, and the results have been the
same. This can only be described as
neglect, or willful financing of racism
on Stanford's construction projects
— many of which are in process. This
is to be expected; after all, what's
more important than building? Stan

ford was rocky before Bakke!

'Nerdism'
Your marvelous article on "Ner
dism" (Daily, Oct. 6) correctly directs
the reader toward the emotional
price one often pays for "type-A"
competitiveness and an undeniable
price in physical health over the
years.
There are other performance
related problems as well from an
emphasis on peer competition. I saw
a recent investigation which showed
that negative attitudes of "math anx
iety" are well developed by the
fourth grade in nearly all children.
Hence it is an inescapable conclu
sion that the elementary school's
traditional hurry-up, peer
competitive, teacher-judgemental
setting produces real disability in
most people (even in most Stanford
nerds) for thinking in ways which are
even rudimentarily numerical in
their daily lives and in their work.
Most everybody gets their first big
dose of Nerdism training before they
are very far into the first grade. Since
most parents demand such an orien
tation to learning and socialization,
and since most teachers love to do it
to the children, the real struggle for
mental and physical health in this
country is in the elementary school
and in the home.
We mustn't forget tnat we at Stan
ford are the ones who survived our
early mad-house experiences in the
schools. Imagine what happened to
everybody else. Crowing up in
America is dangerous to your health.

Israeli relations
The country is beginning to
agonize over a crucial, and
cruciform, dilemma: a special rela
tion to Israel based on an equal
commitment to intertraditional
fraternity — reinforced by the urgent
need to co-exist with Russia (plus our
energy problems).
As usual in such dilemmas, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and the rest of the
country are fated to choose a middl
ing solution and hope for the best.
The Israelis' plausible fear of an
nihilation will cause them and their
supporters much anguish, but it is
hard to see the administration choos
ing otherwise than to give the Pales
tinians a chance at a state followed by
accommodation in the area based on
Soviet-American cooperation. We
are going to have to sweat it out.

Meanwhile, it is ironic that Kis
singer took so much heat for doing
precisely what Brzezinski is doing:
working things out with Russia. The
new emphasis on human rights was,
no doubt, supposed to make this de
aling more palatable. But it remains
to be seen whether our great cultural
tradition, western civilization itself,
will survive in the hand of the new
leaders, let alone Israel.

Divestment analysis
In Wednesday's Daily (Oct. 12),
Lloyd Dixon, etal., raise the spectre
of delay in publishing an analysis of
the costs and benefits of the Univer
sity divesting itself and excluding
holding securities of corporations
with assets in South Africa. It has al
ready been reported earlier in the
Daily that such an analysis was virtu
ally complete and a report would be
made in a matter of weeks.
The analysis, being done in my of
fice, has taken considerable time and
effort, the more so given that we
have no prior studies or precedent to
build upon. The authors knew this,
and further I believe they under
stood we are trying to finish our
study as quickly as possible.
I can only interpret their com

technique to stir up the emotions of
Daily readers, in direct contraven

Saturday seating
How long will the fraternities be
permitted to dictate seating ar
rangements in the Stanford student
section at football games? Armed
with phony out-dated or
homemade "Student Police"
badges, a few thugs stake out a claim
of over 200 choice seats for their
cronies (rows 30-40 between the 40-
yard lines at last Saturday's UCLA
game), cheating those students who
have waited patiently in line for those
seats.
These well-muscled goons (repre
senting Zeta Psi and Phi Delta Theta
among others) aggressively patrol
the perimeter of their claim using in
timidation tactics to discourage
those who arrive early in order to get
desirable seats.
An appeal to the Fundamental
Standard should be enough to con
vince anyone that this offensive be
havior has no place on campus.
Dispatching one uniformed patrol
man would suffice to eradicate this
outrageous land grab.
Alternatively, we propose a
randomly-assigned block seating
scheme which would guarantee each
student ticket-holder a reserved seat
regardless of arrival time. This
method is used successfully across
the country at major and minor
schools to assure equity of seating,
while allowing groups of students to
sit together if they so desire.
The details of the plan are thus: at
some time before each home game,

those students planning to attend
the game must validate their ticket to
that game by acquiring a randomly
assigned reserved seat in the student
section.
To accommodate those wishing to
enjoy the games with friends, tickets
might be assigned in groups up to
(say) 20, upon presentation of
sufficient tickets. These blocs
would also be randomized, so that
students get good seats for some
games, 'poor' seats for others. Much
time is saved on game day, and no
one must put up with the hassle of
arguing with some turkey trying to
save the whole student section for

traditional hurry-up, peer
competitive, teacher-judgemental
setting produces real disability in
most people (even in most Stanford

their daily lives and in their work.
Most everybody gets their first big
dose of Nerdism training before they
are very far into the first grade. Since
most parents demand such an orien

mental and physical health in this
country is in the elementary school

We mustn't forget tnat we at Stan

Israeli relations
The country is beginning to
agonize over a crucial, and
cruciform, dilemma: a special rela
tion to Israel based on an equal
commitment to intertraditional
fraternity — reinforced by the urgent
need to co-exist with Russia (plus our
energy problems).
As usual in such dilemmas, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and the rest of the
country are fated to choose a middl
ing solution and hope for the best.
The Israelis' plausible fear of an
nihilation will cause them and their
supporters much anguish, but it is
hard to see the administration choos
ing otherwise than to give the Pales
tinians a chance at a state followed by
accommodation in the area based on
Soviet-American cooperation. We
are going to have to sweat it out.

Meanwhile, it is ironic that Kis
singer took so much heat for doing
precisely what Brzezinski is doing:
working things out with Russia. The
new emphasis on human rights was,
no doubt, supposed to make this de
aling more palatable. But it remains
to be seen whether our great cultural
tradition, western civilization itself,
will survive in the hand of the new
leaders, let alone Israel.

Divestment analysis
In Wednesday's Daily (Oct. 12),
Lloyd Dixon, etal., raise the spectre
of delay in publishing an analysis of
the costs and benefits of the Univer
sity divesting itself and excluding
holding securities of corporations
with assets in South Africa. It has al
ready been reported earlier in the
Daily that such an analysis was virtu
ally complete and a report would be
made in a matter of weeks.
The analysis, being done in my of
fice, has taken considerable time and
effort, the more so given that we
have no prior studies or precedent to
build upon. The authors knew this,
and further I believe they under
stood we are trying to finish our
study as quickly as possible.
I can only interpret their com
ments, therefore, as a manipulative
technique to stir up the emotions of
Daily readers, in direct contraven
tion to their stated desire for
reasoned debate.

Saturday seating
How long will the fraternities be
permitted to dictate seating ar
rangements in the Stanford student
section at football games? Armed
with phony out-dated or
homemade "Student Police"
badges, a few thugs stake out a claim
of over 200 choice seats for their
cronies (rows 30-40 between the 40-
yard lines at last Saturday's UCLA
game), cheating those students who
have waited patiently in line for those
seats.
These well-muscled goons (repre
senting Zeta Psi and Phi Delta Theta
among others) aggressively patrol
the perimeter of their claim using in
timidation tactics to discourage
those who arrive early in order to get
desirable seats.
An appeal to the Fundamental
Standard should be enough to con
vince anyone that this offensive be
havior has no place on campus.
Dispatching one uniformed patrol
man would suffice to eradicate this
outrageous land grab.
Alternatively, we propose a
randomly-assigned block seating
scheme which would guarantee each
student ticket-holder a reserved seat
regardless of arrival time. This
method is used successfully across
the country at major and minor
schools to assure equity of seating,
while allowing groups of students to
sit together if they so desire.
The details of the plan are thus: at
some time before each home game,

those students planning to attend
the game must validate their ticket to
that game by acquiring a randomly
assigned reserved seat in the student
section.
To accommodate those wishing to
enjoy the games with friends, tickets
might be assigned in groups up to
(say) 20, upon presentation of
sufficient tickets. These blocs
would also be randomized, so that
students get good seats for some
games, 'poor' seats for others. Much
time is saved on game day, and no
one must put up with the hassle of
arguing with some turkey trying to
save the whole student section for
his 100 "friends."

Racism close to home
As interests in corporate invest
ment policies in South Africa are re
kindled for the 1977-78 school year,
allow me to relight a case of racism
that has flickered over the years and
which is a lot closer to home: racism
in construction projects at Stanford,
as shown by the information below.
Whereas there may be some im
provement in the absolute number
of all minorities employed on con
struction contracts, the fact is that
there has not been a satisfactory
growth in the number of black
employes. Moreover, particular
trade unions are continuing not to
employ blacks.
In 1976, more than 1000 man-hours
were accumulated on the following
job classifications and none of them
were by black workers: supervisory,
asbestos workers, bricklayers,
lathers, painters, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers and tile
setters (ceramic).
From January to June 1977, no
black workers were employed in the
following classifications: supervis
ory, asbestos workers, bricklayers,
caulkers, concrete workers (labor
ers), electricians, electrician appren
tices, floor tilers (carpet layers), hod
carriers, lathers, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers, sheet
metal workers' apprentices, sprink
ler fitter apprentices, and tapers.
This problem has been brought to
the University's and the President's
attention over the last three or four
years, and the results have been the
same. This can only be described as
neglect, or willful financing of racism
on Stanford's construction projects
— many of which are in process. This
is to be expected; after all, what's
more important than building? Stan

ford was rocky before Bakke!

Your marvelous article on "Ner

the reader toward the emotional
price one often pays for "type-A"

There are other performance
related problems as well from an
emphasis on peer competition. I saw
a recent investigation which showed
that negative attitudes of "math anx
iety" are well developed by the
fourth grade in nearly all children.
Hence it is an inescapable conclu

have no prior studies or precedent to
build upon. The authors knew this,
and further I believe they under
stood we are trying to finish our
study as quickly as possible.
I can only interpret their com

technique to stir up the emotions of
Daily readers, in direct contraven
tion to their stated desire for
reasoned debate.

Saturday seating
How long will the fraternities be
permitted to dictate seating ar
rangements in the Stanford student
section at football games? Armed
with phony out-dated or
homemade "Student Police"
badges, a few thugs stake out a claim
of over 200 choice seats for their
cronies (rows 30-40 between the 40-
yard lines at last Saturday's UCLA
game), cheating those students who
have waited patiently in line for those
seats.
These well-muscled goons (repre
senting Zeta Psi and Phi Delta Theta
among others) aggressively patrol
the perimeter of their claim using in
timidation tactics to discourage
those who arrive early in order to get
desirable seats.
An appeal to the Fundamental
Standard should be enough to con
vince anyone that this offensive be
havior has no place on campus.
Dispatching one uniformed patrol
man would suffice to eradicate this
outrageous land grab.
Alternatively, we propose a
randomly-assigned block seating
scheme which would guarantee each
student ticket-holder a reserved seat
regardless of arrival time. This
method is used successfully across
the country at major and minor
schools to assure equity of seating,
while allowing groups of students to
sit together if they so desire.
The details of the plan are thus: at
some time before each home game,

those students planning to attend
the game must validate their ticket to
that game by acquiring a randomly
assigned reserved seat in the student
section.
To accommodate those wishing to
enjoy the games with friends, tickets
might be assigned in groups up to
(say) 20, upon presentation of
sufficient tickets. These blocs
would also be randomized, so that
students get good seats for some
games, 'poor' seats for others. Much
time is saved on game day, and no
one must put up with the hassle of
arguing with some turkey trying to
save the whole student section for
his 100 "friends."

Racism close to home
As interests in corporate invest
ment policies in South Africa are re
kindled for the 1977-78 school year,
allow me to relight a case of racism
that has flickered over the years and
which is a lot closer to home: racism
in construction projects at Stanford,
as shown by the information below.
Whereas there may be some im
provement in the absolute number
of all minorities employed on con
struction contracts, the fact is that
there has not been a satisfactory
growth in the number of black
employes. Moreover, particular
trade unions are continuing not to
employ blacks.
In 1976, more than 1000 man-hours
were accumulated on the following
job classifications and none of them
were by black workers: supervisory,
asbestos workers, bricklayers,
lathers, painters, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers and tile
setters (ceramic).
From January to June 1977, no
black workers were employed in the
following classifications: supervis
ory, asbestos workers, bricklayers,
caulkers, concrete workers (labor
ers), electricians, electrician appren
tices, floor tilers (carpet layers), hod
carriers, lathers, plasterer's appren
tices, sheet metal workers, sheet
metal workers' apprentices, sprink
ler fitter apprentices, and tapers.
This problem has been brought to
the University's and the President's
attention over the last three or four
years, and the results have been the
same. This can only be described as
neglect, or willful financing of racism
on Stanford's construction projects
— many of which are in process. This
is to be expected; after all, what's
more important than building? Stan

ford was rocky before Bakke!

'Nerdism'
Your marvelous article on "Ner
dism" (Daily, Oct. 6) correctly directs
the reader toward the emotional
price one often pays for "type-A"
competitiveness and an undeniable
price in physical health over the
years.
There are other performance
related problems as well from an
emphasis on peer competition. I saw
a recent investigation which showed
that negative attitudes of "math anx
iety" are well developed by the
fourth grade in nearly all children.
Hence it is an inescapable conclu
sion that the elementary school's
traditional hurry-up, peer
competitive, teacher-judgemental
setting produces real disability in
most people (even in most Stanford
nerds) for thinking in ways which are
even rudimentarily numerical in
their daily lives and in their work.
Most everybody gets their first big
dose of Nerdism training before they
are very far into the first grade. Since
most parents demand such an orien
tation to learning and socialization,
and since most teachers love to do it
to the children, the real struggle for
mental and physical health in this
country is in the elementary school
and in the home.
We mustn't forget tnat we at Stan
ford are the ones who survived our
early mad-house experiences in the
schools. Imagine what happened to
everybody else. Crowing up in
America is dangerous to your health.

Israeli relations
The country is beginning to
agonize over a crucial, and
cruciform, dilemma: a special rela
tion to Israel based on an equal
commitment to intertraditional
fraternity — reinforced by the urgent
need to co-exist with Russia (plus our
energy problems).
As usual in such dilemmas, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and the rest of the
country are fated to choose a middl
ing solution and hope for the best.
The Israelis' plausible fear of an
nihilation will cause them and their
supporters much anguish, but it is
hard to see the administration choos
ing otherwise than to give the Pales
tinians a chance at a state followed by
accommodation in the area based on
Soviet-American cooperation. We
are going to have to sweat it out.

Meanwhile, it is ironic that Kis
singer took so much heat for doing
precisely what Brzezinski is doing:
working things out with Russia. The
new emphasis on human rights was,
no doubt, supposed to make this de
aling more palatable. But it remains
to be seen whether our great cultural
tradition, western civilization itself,
will survive in the hand of the new
leaders, let alone Israel.
