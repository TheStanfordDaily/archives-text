# Legal structure called for?
## Utilitarian autos are needed 
### 
Larry Lemke

Within the last few months, the
long-simmering congressional de
bate over how to treat the "gas
guzzling" American car was heated
up again. There is so little consensus
in Congress — and the nation in gen
eral — that the choice appears to be
between taxing the gas-guzzler out
of existence or enshrining it.
This ambivalence once again un
derlines a fact: for a nation that has
invested so much of its cultural and
economic well-being in the institu
tion of the privately-owned au
tomobile, we are remarkably un
sophisticated, inexpert and dilatory
in coming to terms with it.
This is not surprising since, for
most of the history of the au
tomobile, we have enjoyed cheap
fuel, free of foreign policy implica
tions, and relatively sparse popula
tion. Under these conditions,
everyone could indulge his or her
own automotive fantasies without an
excessive cost to society. Such is
clearly not the case now or in the
foreseeable future.

To its credit, it is true that Congress
has decreed that the automobile
fleet must increase its fuel economy
to an average of 27.5 miles per gallon
(mpg) by the year 1985. However, if
mileage is measured as the Environ
mental Protection Agency does now,
that figure will translate to more like
20 mpg in real-life conditions. In any
case, as a nation, we can, and should,
produce better vehicles than the
ones Detroit and Washington have
planned for us.
What the public, the auto makers,
and the legislators should recognize
is that we are trying to drag an early
twentieth-century technological
paradigm into the twenty-first cen
tury and it is failing us as we try to
force it ever harder.
When the private automobile was
first made into a consumer item in
this country it was thought by the
auto makers — probably correctly —
that the automobile had to be all
things to all people.
Consequently they have devoted
their best efforts to building

general-purpose vehicles; the same
car that a farmer uses to carry home a
hay bale from the feed store can be
used by a city dweller to go to and
from the opera. In both cases each
owner is buying and carrying around
some capability that he is not using
very much of the time. Multiply this
example by the tens of millions of
cars in service and society must pay a
high price for this luxury.
Legal structure
What is needed is a legal structure
to force the auto makers to offer for
sale only cars which actually have a
high degree of utility in performing a
specific transportation task. The pub
lic would then be forced to make ra
tional decisions in purchasing and
operating cars based on actual in
tended use instead of advertising
hoopla. Needless to say, the en
gineering problems associated with
this approach would probably be
small compared to the problem of
overcoming the political and emo
tional resistance, but the rewards
would ultimately be worth it.
With a sufficient influx of imagina
tion and technological advance, such
vehicles need not be drab and un
comfortable. Instead, there could be
an actual increase in comfort, con
venience, and economy. There is
probably no reason, for instance,
why a vehicle built as a highway
cruiser could not carry six adults in
comfort and safety at 70 miles per
hour and still get more than 30 mpg.
On the other hand, a commuter/
inner city car might carry two or three
people, take up minimal road and
parking space, have a cleaner
exhaust, and get more than 40 mpg'.
We should not, however, expect
both cars to do both tasks equally
well or resemble each other in size,

shape, motive power, emissions
standards, range, etc. Nor should we
expect either to resemble the Chev
rolet Impala we've come to know and
love.
Capitulation
When the long gasoline lines of
several years ago forced a public
awareness of our vulnerability, it
seems there was an unspoken capitu
lation in the face of the challenge.
Virtually no decision-maker or
opinion-molder of any consequence
has had enough imagination or cour
age to entertain any other belief than
that we are inevitably and perpetu
ally stuck with our chrome-plated
land-barges. Everyone agrees that
we'll just have to drive slower and
drive fewer miles.
While this passive acceptance is in
keeping with the presently fashiona
ble mood of despair with respect to
technology, it is very much out of
character with the history of this na
tion. We seem to have very quickly
passed over the point that travelling
less and travelling slower are not
necessarily desirable goals by them
selves but are only consequences of
our present choice of vehicles and
fuels. The object is to use less fuel
and fewer natural resources in per
sonal transportation.
The point is that we should not au
tomatically and mindlessly assume
that somehow technology — in the
form of the automobile — is failing us
and we are slipping into the twilight
of our civilization. What is really
happening is that we are failing to
use the correct technology for the
job; if we make a few intelligent de
cisions in the near future, owning a
car might even be fun again.

of existence or enshrining it.
This ambivalence once again un
derlines a fact: for a nation that has
invested so much of its cultural and
economic well-being in the institu
tion of the privately-owned au
tomobile, we are remarkably un
sophisticated, inexpert and dilatory
in coming to terms with it.
This is not surprising since, for
most of the history of the au
tomobile, we have enjoyed cheap
fuel, free of foreign policy implica
tions, and relatively sparse popula
tion. Under these conditions,
everyone could indulge his or her
own automotive fantasies without an
excessive cost to society. Such is
clearly not the case now or in the
foreseeable future.

To its credit, it is true that Congress
has decreed that the automobile
fleet must increase its fuel economy
to an average of 27.5 miles per gallon
(mpg) by the year 1985. However, if
mileage is measured as the Environ
mental Protection Agency does now,
that figure will translate to more like
20 mpg in real-life conditions. In any
case, as a nation, we can, and should,
produce better vehicles than the
ones Detroit and Washington have
planned for us.
What the public, the auto makers,
and the legislators should recognize
is that we are trying to drag an early
twentieth-century technological
paradigm into the twenty-first cen
tury and it is failing us as we try to
force it ever harder.
When the private automobile was
first made into a consumer item in
this country it was thought by the
auto makers — probably correctly —
that the automobile had to be all
things to all people.
Consequently they have devoted
their best efforts to building

general-purpose vehicles; the same
car that a farmer uses to carry home a
hay bale from the feed store can be
used by a city dweller to go to and
from the opera. In both cases each
owner is buying and carrying around
some capability that he is not using
very much of the time. Multiply this
example by the tens of millions of
cars in service and society must pay a
high price for this luxury.
Legal structure
What is needed is a legal structure
to force the auto makers to offer for
sale only cars which actually have a
high degree of utility in performing a
specific transportation task. The pub
lic would then be forced to make ra
tional decisions in purchasing and
operating cars based on actual in
tended use instead of advertising
hoopla. Needless to say, the en
gineering problems associated with
this approach would probably be
small compared to the problem of
overcoming the political and emo
tional resistance, but the rewards
would ultimately be worth it.
With a sufficient influx of imagina
tion and technological advance, such
vehicles need not be drab and un
comfortable. Instead, there could be
an actual increase in comfort, con
venience, and economy. There is
probably no reason, for instance,
why a vehicle built as a highway
cruiser could not carry six adults in
comfort and safety at 70 miles per
hour and still get more than 30 mpg.
On the other hand, a commuter/
inner city car might carry two or three
people, take up minimal road and
parking space, have a cleaner
exhaust, and get more than 40 mpg'.
We should not, however, expect
both cars to do both tasks equally
well or resemble each other in size,

shape, motive power, emissions
standards, range, etc. Nor should we
expect either to resemble the Chev
rolet Impala we've come to know and
love.
Capitulation
When the long gasoline lines of
several years ago forced a public
awareness of our vulnerability, it
seems there was an unspoken capitu
lation in the face of the challenge.
Virtually no decision-maker or
opinion-molder of any consequence
has had enough imagination or cour
age to entertain any other belief than
that we are inevitably and perpetu
ally stuck with our chrome-plated
land-barges. Everyone agrees that
we'll just have to drive slower and
drive fewer miles.
While this passive acceptance is in
keeping with the presently fashiona
ble mood of despair with respect to
technology, it is very much out of
character with the history of this na
tion. We seem to have very quickly
passed over the point that travelling
less and travelling slower are not
necessarily desirable goals by them
selves but are only consequences of
our present choice of vehicles and
fuels. The object is to use less fuel
and fewer natural resources in per
sonal transportation.
The point is that we should not au
tomatically and mindlessly assume
that somehow technology — in the
form of the automobile — is failing us
and we are slipping into the twilight
of our civilization. What is really
happening is that we are failing to
use the correct technology for the
job; if we make a few intelligent de
cisions in the near future, owning a
car might even be fun again.

This is not surprising since, for
most of the history of the au
tomobile, we have enjoyed cheap
fuel, free of foreign policy implica
tions, and relatively sparse popula
tion. Under these conditions,
everyone could indulge his or her
own automotive fantasies without an
excessive cost to society. Such is
clearly not the case now or in the
foreseeable future.

To its credit, it is true that Congress
has decreed that the automobile
fleet must increase its fuel economy
to an average of 27.5 miles per gallon
(mpg) by the year 1985. However, if
mileage is measured as the Environ
mental Protection Agency does now,
that figure will translate to more like
20 mpg in real-life conditions. In any
case, as a nation, we can, and should,
produce better vehicles than the
ones Detroit and Washington have
planned for us.
What the public, the auto makers,
and the legislators should recognize
is that we are trying to drag an early
twentieth-century technological
paradigm into the twenty-first cen
tury and it is failing us as we try to
force it ever harder.
When the private automobile was
first made into a consumer item in
this country it was thought by the
auto makers — probably correctly —
that the automobile had to be all
things to all people.
Consequently they have devoted
their best efforts to building

general-purpose vehicles; the same
car that a farmer uses to carry home a
hay bale from the feed store can be
used by a city dweller to go to and
from the opera. In both cases each
owner is buying and carrying around
some capability that he is not using
very much of the time. Multiply this
example by the tens of millions of
cars in service and society must pay a
high price for this luxury.
Legal structure
What is needed is a legal structure
to force the auto makers to offer for
sale only cars which actually have a
high degree of utility in performing a
specific transportation task. The pub
lic would then be forced to make ra
tional decisions in purchasing and
operating cars based on actual in
tended use instead of advertising
hoopla. Needless to say, the en
gineering problems associated with
this approach would probably be
small compared to the problem of
overcoming the political and emo
tional resistance, but the rewards
would ultimately be worth it.
With a sufficient influx of imagina
tion and technological advance, such
vehicles need not be drab and un
comfortable. Instead, there could be
an actual increase in comfort, con
venience, and economy. There is
probably no reason, for instance,
why a vehicle built as a highway
cruiser could not carry six adults in
comfort and safety at 70 miles per
hour and still get more than 30 mpg.
On the other hand, a commuter/
inner city car might carry two or three
people, take up minimal road and
parking space, have a cleaner
exhaust, and get more than 40 mpg'.
We should not, however, expect
both cars to do both tasks equally
well or resemble each other in size,

shape, motive power, emissions
standards, range, etc. Nor should we
expect either to resemble the Chev
rolet Impala we've come to know and
love.
Capitulation
When the long gasoline lines of
several years ago forced a public
awareness of our vulnerability, it
seems there was an unspoken capitu
lation in the face of the challenge.
Virtually no decision-maker or
opinion-molder of any consequence
has had enough imagination or cour
age to entertain any other belief than
that we are inevitably and perpetu
ally stuck with our chrome-plated
land-barges. Everyone agrees that
we'll just have to drive slower and
drive fewer miles.
While this passive acceptance is in
keeping with the presently fashiona
ble mood of despair with respect to
technology, it is very much out of
character with the history of this na
tion. We seem to have very quickly
passed over the point that travelling
less and travelling slower are not
necessarily desirable goals by them
selves but are only consequences of
our present choice of vehicles and
fuels. The object is to use less fuel
and fewer natural resources in per
sonal transportation.
The point is that we should not au
tomatically and mindlessly assume
that somehow technology — in the
form of the automobile — is failing us
and we are slipping into the twilight
of our civilization. What is really
happening is that we are failing to
use the correct technology for the
job; if we make a few intelligent de
cisions in the near future, owning a
car might even be fun again.

Within the last few months, the
long-simmering congressional de
bate over how to treat the "gas
guzzling" American car was heated
up again. There is so little consensus
in Congress — and the nation in gen
eral — that the choice appears to be
between taxing the gas-guzzler out
of existence or enshrining it.
This ambivalence once again un
derlines a fact: for a nation that has
invested so much of its cultural and
economic well-being in the institu
tion of the privately-owned au
tomobile, we are remarkably un
sophisticated, inexpert and dilatory
in coming to terms with it.
This is not surprising since, for
