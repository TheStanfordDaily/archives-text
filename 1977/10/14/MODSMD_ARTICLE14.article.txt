# Canal treaty is a poor solution
##

The recently-negotiated agree
ment on the Panama Canal is likely to
be a divisive political issue in coming
months. Unfortunately, the partisan
controversy is likely to blind many
people to the fact that it is a bad tre
aty, a treaty contrary to the demands
of both expediency and morality.
Part of the agreement gives the Un
ited States the right to intervene at
any time necessary to protect the
neutrality of the canal. To give
Panama control of the canal but add
that Washington has the right to re
take control whenever it deems
necessary is to invite future friction
and conflict between the two na
tions.
Treaty spells conflict
The treaty's supporters grant
Panama's right to the canal, but the
treaty does not give Panama control
for more than two decades. To
acknowledge the Panamanians' right
to the canal but to wait 23 years to
give them control is to invite the
Panamanians to unilaterally seize the
canal before the year 2000. Again, the
treaty spells not peace but conflict.
Pragmatically, then, the agree
ment is a disaster. Even more flawed
are its alleged moral foundations.
Rightful ownership of land (or
other natural resources) originates in
some persons "mixing their labor"
with the land — i.e., through produc
tive human labor making virgin re
sources of value to human beings. It
is precisely this principle which jus
tifies agrarian reform in much of the
Third World: present ownership ti
tles are too often the product of past
military/feudal conquests, not of
originary labor.
Moral claim
In the case of the canal and the
Canal Zone, it was the American

government and its employes who
transformed a worthless wilderness
into a valuable aid to transportation
and commerce. The only moral claim
to the canal rests with those who
created it.
The claim that the people of
Panama have a right to the canal is
based on the crudest and most
chauvinistic form of nationalism.
One could as well argue that any
property of Toyota or (Anglo-Dutch)
Shell Oil located in America should
rightfully be confiscated and given to
the people of America.
National boundaries are an arbit
rary creation of historical accident.
The accident of a person's having
been born within the boundaries of
the Republic of Panama does not give

him any right to a canal — in the
creation of which he played no part
— simply because that canal also
happens to be located within the
boundaries of Panama.
There may be some good reasons
for America's getting rid of the canal:
any large governmental installation
located within territory controlled by
another government is a possible
cause of conflict and war. However,
the proposed treaty is not a solution.
It portends not peace but war; it is
founded not on morality but on
sophistry. It is a bad treaty, and it
should be rejected by the Senate and
by the American people.
