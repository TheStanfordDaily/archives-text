# In elephant-naping
## Police zero in on 'brutes' 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — An American
firm whose 6-ton, 12-foot-tall
elephant is being held by
armed kidnapers for $1500 ran
som in the Burmese jungle said
yesterday that police are clos
ing in on the brutes.
Police in Burma and Thailand
have already arrested three
men in the case, including a
Mr. Pong, who is thought to be
the mastermind of the scheme,

said a spokesman for Atlanta
based Munford, Inc.
The elephant was stolen
Sept. 30 from a work camp in
Thailand just a few miles from
Burma by men using automatic
rifles and hustled across the
border.
The company spokesman
said he didn't know how many
others are involved or exactly
where they had managed to

hide a 6-ton elephant.
It is one of several owned by
the firm and used to harvest
rattan vine from the jungles of
southern Thailand. The vine is
used in furniture that is man
ufactured in Bangkok and then
shipped to Munford's stores in
the United States.
"The elephant is about 12
feet high and extremely well
trained," said Munford
spokesman Jim Cassels, who
was in Bangkok shortly after
the theft was reported. He said
the firm had paid $3000 for the
elephant two months ago.
"One of the people arrested
is a Mr. Pong, who had been an
elephant consultant to us,"
Cassels said. "He really knew
elephants, and I guess he knew
he had picked out a good one
for us."
Elephants are the work ani
mals of Thailand and Burma
and they are used for forest
work, much as tractors are
used in fields in other parts of
the world.
"I guess they thought there
wouldn't be much cooperation
from the Burmese police," he
said. "But stealing elephants
just isn't done very much out
there, and I'm sure one of the
reasons the Burmese police are
cooperating so much is that
they don't want such as that to
get out of hand.
