# UC frats warned after antisemitism

Berkeley (AP) â€” Fraternity
row at the University of
California, which has survived
everything from the depres
sion to the turbulent demonst
rations of the 19605, is being
threatened with extinction if
fraternity members continue
to harass Jews.
Chancellor Albert Bowker
warned the Inter-Fraternity
Council Wednesday that cam
pus privileges and university
staff assistance to fraternities
and sororities at Berkeley
would be cut off if vandalism
against Jewish organizations
continues.
In a letter to John Cunha,
president of the council,
Bowker said recent vandalism
against Hillel Foundation, a
Jewish youth organization, led

him to believe members of
Creek houses were continuing
to harass Jews on campus.
Repeated acts of harassment
last spring, including crudely
painted swastikas and verbal
taunts referring to Hitler, were
blamed on fraternity men liv
ing in nearby Greek houses.
"It now appears to me,"
Bowker wrote, "that there are,
in fact, residents of the frater
nity row area who are making a
point to harass and be a nui
sance to these two religious
organizations,
Bowker threatened to go to
the Creek organizations' na
tional leadership with his com
plaint.
Cunha said he didn't know
whether fraternities were re
sponsible for the vandalism.
