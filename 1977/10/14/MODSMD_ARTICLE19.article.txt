# Dow calls pesticide exposure levels safe
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Acknowledging
that a pesticide linked to sterility among
chemical workers can cause cancer, Dow
Chemical Co. officials asserted yesterday
that exposure levels they set were
adequate to prevent any harm to workers.
But they made it clear that regular con
tact with the skin combined with failure to
scrub it off thoroughly could result in med
ical problems.
"As far as we know, it's a carcinogen,"
said Perry Gehring, Dow's chief to
xicologist. "It's a registered poison.
You're damned stupid if you think you're
going to handle this chemical like water."
The spokesman for Dow, one of two
major domestic producers of dib
romochloropropane (DBCP), testified at
the second of four days of hearings on the
pesticide. Its production was halted in Au
gust after nearly 100 men who worked with
it were found to be sterile.
Gehring, however, said the risk of

cancer or birth defects from eating DBCP
residues on vegetables and fruit is "nil."
He criticized formulas used by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to pre
dict new cancer cases among people who
eat produce that grows in or near the
ground and is treated with DBCP. The pes
ticide is used to kill worms that nibble crop
roots.
Gehring defended exposure levels set
by federal agencies as adequate to protect
workers from inhaling dangerous
amounts of DBCP. And he said if workers
followed Dow rules about washing chemi
cals immediately off their skin, there was
no danger from the pesticide.
Workers at Dow's plant in Magnolia,
Ark., have reportedly said that when pro
duction of DBCP began there several years
ago they "got it all over our hands, all over
our boots and you'd splash it on your pant
legs."
Gehring also said he believed the steril

ity experienced by chemical workers as a
result of DBCP was probably only tempor
ary, unless they were exposed to such
large amounts that their sperm-producing
cells were killed. In that case, their testi
cles would atrophy or lose weight, he said.
Yesterday's testimony also showed that
Dow's own "data sheet" on DBCP, which
was on file for workers to inspect, did not
mention possible sterility or cancer from
overexposure to the pesticide.
Dated July 1976, it said that overexpo
sure could cause injuries to the lungs, liver
and kidneys and respiratory irritations.
Etcyl Blair, director of health research
for Dow, said the sheet was prepared at
Dow headquarters in Midland, Mich. Its
preparation followed research published
in 1961 by a Dow toxicologist that said
DBCP caused sterility in animals and, a
separate 1973 animal study by the National
Cancer Institute that found it caused
stomach and mammary cancer.

by federal agencies as adequate to protect
workers from inhaling dangerous
amounts of DBCP. And he said if workers
followed Dow rules about washing chemi
cals immediately off their skin, there was
no danger from the pesticide.
Workers at Dow's plant in Magnolia,
Ark., have reportedly said that when pro
duction of DBCP began there several years
ago they "got it all over our hands, all over
our boots and you'd splash it on your pant
legs."
Gehring also said he believed the steril

ity experienced by chemical workers as a
result of DBCP was probably only tempor
ary, unless they were exposed to such
large amounts that their sperm-producing
cells were killed. In that case, their testi
cles would atrophy or lose weight, he said.
Yesterday's testimony also showed that
Dow's own "data sheet" on DBCP, which
was on file for workers to inspect, did not
mention possible sterility or cancer from
overexposure to the pesticide.
Dated July 1976, it said that overexpo
sure could cause injuries to the lungs, liver
and kidneys and respiratory irritations.
Etcyl Blair, director of health research
for Dow, said the sheet was prepared at
Dow headquarters in Midland, Mich. Its
preparation followed research published
in 1961 by a Dow toxicologist that said
DBCP caused sterility in animals and, a
separate 1973 animal study by the National
Cancer Institute that found it caused
stomach and mammary cancer.
San Francisco (AP) — Acknowledging
that a pesticide linked to sterility among
chemical workers can cause cancer, Dow
Chemical Co. officials asserted yesterday
that exposure levels they set were
adequate to prevent any harm to workers.
But they made it clear that regular con
tact with the skin combined with failure to
scrub it off thoroughly could result in med
ical problems.
"As far as we know, it's a carcinogen,"
said Perry Gehring, Dow's chief to
xicologist. "It's a registered poison.
You're damned stupid if you think you're
going to handle this chemical like water."
The spokesman for Dow, one of two
major domestic producers of dib
romochloropropane (DBCP), testified at
the second of four days of hearings on the
pesticide. Its production was halted in Au
gust after nearly 100 men who worked with
it were found to be sterile.
Gehring, however, said the risk of

cancer or birth defects from eating DBCP
residues on vegetables and fruit is "nil."
He criticized formulas used by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to pre
dict new cancer cases among people who
eat produce that grows in or near the
ground and is treated with DBCP. The pes
ticide is used to kill worms that nibble crop
roots.

by federal agencies as adequate to protect
workers from inhaling dangerous
amounts of DBCP. And he said if workers

cals immediately off their skin, there was
