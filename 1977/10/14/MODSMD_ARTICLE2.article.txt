# Women's Week schedule set
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Workshops, films, speakers and
cultural events under the theme "Vi
sions and Revisions: The Women's
Movement Today," will be held here
next Tuesday through Saturday as
part of a student-initiated project
known as Women's Week.
"This is not just a week for people
who already consider themselves
feminists," said Karen Cohn, a Wo
men's Week coordinator. "We want
to help other people have a better
understanding of the word
'feminism.' I think that people are
going to find some niche that they
will feel comfortable with."
Another main purpose, said Cohn,
is "to give a feminist analysis of the
education process and content."
Workshops
Wednesday is specifically devoted
to feminist education, featuring two
workshops and an evening panel
discussion.
Cohn said that the workshops are
intended to be "nonhierarchical,
with less division between profes
sors and students" and will stress
"using everyday experiences to for
mulate theories."
The week's events begin with a
public lecture by Rita Mae Brown on
"Success: The Double-Edged
Sword," a speech about "the chang
ing dynamics created by the success
of the women's movement." Brown
is the author of the book "Rubyfruit
jungle" and a leading feminist
strategist. Her free lecture will be
held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8
p.m. next Tuesday.

A special workshop on "Women
and the Farmworkers Movement"
will be held Thursday afternoon in
Tresidder Union, featuring Jessie De
La Cruz, co-founder of National Land
for the People and first female field
organizer for the United Farm Work
ers, and Anne Loftis, co-author of
"Long Time Coming: The Struggle to
Unionize the America's Farm Work
ers."
In addition, there will be an art and
photography exhibit of the farmwor
kers' struggle by Mary Anne Halibur
ton.
Concert
Women's Week concludes with a
concert Saturday night starring Mar
gie Adam and Malvina Reynolds.
Reynolds is well-known for her songs
"What Have They Done with the
Rain?" and "Little Boxes" as well as
her role in the antiwar struggle.
Adam is a pianist, singer and song
writer whose music reflects the
feminist movement.
Tickets for the performance are on
sale now in the ASSU and SWOPSI
offices, and also at several commun
ity bookstores.
According to Cohn, at least 50
people participated in planning
Women's Week. The project origi
nated in a SWOPSI course last spring
on ""Strategies Within Feminism,"
said Cohn.
Positive feedback
"The project was originally a one
day event, but the feedback was so
positive that the project grew from
one day to one week," Cohn
explained.

Cohn said that she expects Din
kelspiel Auditorium to be full to
capacity for both the opening lecture
and the closing concert, but said "it's
hard to estimate how many will at
tend the workshops."
"I expect that there will be a lot of
community participation," com
mented Cohn, "but I want to em
phasize that the events are entirely
open to everyone — people who al
ready feel alignments with feminism
and people who don't.
"This week will be a cultural ex
perience which is different because
it is not male-oriented. It should be a
unique exception for those who
come in contact with it," Cohn con
cluded.

of the women's movement." Brown

A special workshop on "Women

Concert
Women's Week concludes with a
concert Saturday night starring Mar
gie Adam and Malvina Reynolds.
Reynolds is well-known for her songs
"What Have They Done with the
Rain?" and "Little Boxes" as well as
her role in the antiwar struggle.
Adam is a pianist, singer and song
writer whose music reflects the
feminist movement.
Tickets for the performance are on
sale now in the ASSU and SWOPSI
offices, and also at several commun
ity bookstores.
According to Cohn, at least 50
people participated in planning
Women's Week. The project origi
nated in a SWOPSI course last spring
on ""Strategies Within Feminism,"
said Cohn.
Positive feedback
"The project was originally a one
day event, but the feedback was so
positive that the project grew from
one day to one week," Cohn
explained.

Cohn said that she expects Din
kelspiel Auditorium to be full to
capacity for both the opening lecture
and the closing concert, but said "it's
hard to estimate how many will at
tend the workshops."
"I expect that there will be a lot of
community participation," com
mented Cohn, "but I want to em
phasize that the events are entirely
open to everyone — people who al
ready feel alignments with feminism
and people who don't.
"This week will be a cultural ex
perience which is different because
it is not male-oriented. It should be a
unique exception for those who
come in contact with it," Cohn con
cluded.
Workshops, films, speakers and
cultural events under the theme "Vi
sions and Revisions: The Women's
Movement Today," will be held here
next Tuesday through Saturday as
part of a student-initiated project
known as Women's Week.
"This is not just a week for people
who already consider themselves
feminists," said Karen Cohn, a Wo
men's Week coordinator. "We want
to help other people have a better
understanding of the word
'feminism.' I think that people are
going to find some niche that they
will feel comfortable with."
Another main purpose, said Cohn,
is "to give a feminist analysis of the
education process and content."
Workshops
Wednesday is specifically devoted
to feminist education, featuring two
workshops and an evening panel
discussion.
Cohn said that the workshops are
intended to be "nonhierarchical,
with less division between profes
sors and students" and will stress
"using everyday experiences to for
mulate theories."
