# Disco dancing hits town
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Upon entering Tresidder Un
ion's upstairs lounge on Tues
day or Wednesday night, you
might believe you've arrived at
a disco. From 8 to 9 on these
nights, Craig Sander offers a
non-credit course in bumping,
heart-thumping disco dancing.
Response from community
residents and university stu
dents has been "excellent," he
said. He surveyed the approx
imately 55 persons enrolled in
the first class last Tuesday. Al
though the enrollment is pre
dominantly female, instructor
Sander claims partnering is not
a problem.
"Most dances can be learned
alone and even though an im
portant aspect of dancing is
working with partners, we'll be
able to trade off and work
things out," he said.
Sander plans to concentrate
on club dancing because
"that's where the fun is."
"We'll probably do the hus
tle at the first ciass because
everyone wants to learn it, but
since line dancing isn't done
much anymore, our main focus
will be on the dances that are
currently done in the Bay
Area," Sander said.
He elaborated that disco
dances are fairly uniform
throughout the country, and
that it is the music that dictates

the moves.
' Disco moves are always
changing because the music is
always changing. Disco danc
ing actually evolved from ball
room and swing dancing and
still contains elements of
swing, although the style is
smoother," said Sander.
Like other dances, Sander
maintains that most of disco
dancing is learned through ex
perience. "Disco dancing is
fun. It's important because it's
popularand a good channel for
meeting people. After all, what
fun is going to a club to just sit
around and drink?"
Sander's students seem to
mirror this attitude. When
asked why they signed up for
the class, students com
mented:
"It'd be nice to know how to
dance at discos."
"I think it'll be good exer
cise."
Some prospective students
were disenchanted. Their re
marks ranged from,"I need
more exercise than disco danc
ing. Maybe ballet would be
better. . ." to "I'd like to see
what goes on in the class be
fore I pay my ten dollars."
Apparently Sander operates
under the policy that if you
want to dance you've got to pay
the piper; or in this case —
Sander.

portant aspect of dancing is
working with partners, we'll be
able to trade off and work
things out," he said.
Sander plans to concentrate
on club dancing because
"that's where the fun is."
"We'll probably do the hus
tle at the first ciass because
everyone wants to learn it, but
since line dancing isn't done
much anymore, our main focus
will be on the dances that are
currently done in the Bay
Area," Sander said.
He elaborated that disco
dances are fairly uniform
throughout the country, and
that it is the music that dictates

the moves.
' Disco moves are always
changing because the music is
always changing. Disco danc
ing actually evolved from ball
room and swing dancing and
still contains elements of
swing, although the style is
smoother," said Sander.
Like other dances, Sander
maintains that most of disco
dancing is learned through ex
perience. "Disco dancing is
fun. It's important because it's
popularand a good channel for
meeting people. After all, what
fun is going to a club to just sit
around and drink?"
Sander's students seem to
mirror this attitude. When
asked why they signed up for
the class, students com
mented:
"It'd be nice to know how to
dance at discos."
"I think it'll be good exer
cise."
Some prospective students
were disenchanted. Their re
marks ranged from,"I need
more exercise than disco danc
ing. Maybe ballet would be
better. . ." to "I'd like to see
what goes on in the class be
fore I pay my ten dollars."
Apparently Sander operates
under the policy that if you
want to dance you've got to pay
the piper; or in this case —
Sander.

Francisco crowds with their new-learned steps.
Upon entering Tresidder Un
ion's upstairs lounge on Tues
day or Wednesday night, you
might believe you've arrived at
a disco. From 8 to 9 on these
nights, Craig Sander offers a
non-credit course in bumping,
heart-thumping disco dancing.
Response from community
residents and university stu
dents has been "excellent," he
said. He surveyed the approx
imately 55 persons enrolled in
the first class last Tuesday. Al
though the enrollment is pre
dominantly female, instructor
Sander claims partnering is not
a problem.
"Most dances can be learned
alone and even though an im
portant aspect of dancing is
working with partners, we'll be
able to trade off and work
things out," he said.
