# Bug Me
## 
### Doug Yoshida 
Some months ago I wrote to the Bug Me col
umn with an inquiry about the feasibility of hav
ing cyclists use bells on their bicycles. I recall
this used to be the rule in Holland and I still have
a pre World War II Dutch bike with a bell at
tached to the handlebars.
My letter was never printed in Bug Me - and
now I am writing in the hope that a safety cam
paign can be mounted before someone is very
seriously hurt on campus or even killed. This
actually happend a few years ago when two cyc
lists collided at night near Stern Hall.
If one of the students zipping in and out of
traffic and riding up in back of pedestrians on
campus without giving any warning should hit
one of us and injure us, what are the consequ
ences? Could that student and his/her parents, if
he or she was a minor, be sued for $100,000-in
other words, do pedestrians have the right of
way on campus?
It is a distinct hazard for my husband, myself,
and the older residents of the Pearce Mitchell
House to walk down Mayfield and Lasuen Mall
as far as the post office or the bookstore.
Before his death a short time ago, the very
distinguished retired editor of the New Republic,
Bruce Bliven '10, asked me to write to Bug Me
about the problem. Now his widow walks from
Kingscote to the post office, and I'm sure she
wonders if she will get there and back without
being hit.
It is for her, and others of all ages that I am
addressing this SOS to you. Perhaps you would
be willing to publish a report of bicycle accidents
that occurred on the campus last year.

This letter should be heeded by all bicyclists.
There is a problem with both pedestrian and
bicyclist safety on campus. Pedestrians feel
helpless against the onslaught of bicycles, and
anyone who has driven at night knows how hard
jt is to see a bicyclist who is riding without a
light.
The police department put out a comic book
called "Sprocket Man" which illustrated various
aspects of bicycle safety.
If you are in an accident, as a pedestrian can
you sue? Well, Glen Schofield, an attorney at the
ASSU Legal Counseling Office, says the matter is
rather complicated. It would depend upon the
facts of the circumstances involved. Also, the
question of negligence would need to he
evaluated. If you should be involved in an acci
dent and have questions concerning your
rights, Scofield suggests you contact an attor
ney. Stanford students can make use of the
ASSU Legal Counseling Office by calling 497-
3381.
I understand that at one time Stanford had
rooter trains which carried students to the L.A.
area football game of each season.
Are there any rooter trains or buses running
down to the Stanford vs. USC game in
November? If so, who does one contact to re
serve a seat?
-AW
Neither the Athletic Department nor the
Bowman Alumni Association has any rooter
buses heading down to L.A. for the game. The
only other possibility would be if any student
living groups are privately sponsoring one.
