# 'Fingerprint on history'
## Waiting at the Bakke hearing 
### Kathy Ellison 
Washington, D.C. — The very
first people in line had arrived
at 4 p.m. By 1 a.m. a line of at
least 150 people sprawled
down the white steps of the
Supreme Court Building.
The line wound far around
the corner. They played cards
and backgammon, ate brow
nies and Kentucky Fried Chic
ken and read novels and law
texts. Law students were in the
majority Wednesday morning
as legal buffs lined up trying to
get seats for the U.C. Board of
Regents vs. Allan Bakke.
The first four in line — Mark,
Haydn, Allan and David — had
driven up from the University
of Virginia Law School. Inter
viewed near midnight Tues
day, they claimed they had
come "purely for historical
reasons."
By 6 a.m. Wednesday, hav
ing been asked the same ques
tion again and again by repor
r ters from such news-gatherers
as UPI, AP, The Washington
f|Star, the Washington Post and
i'the Afro-American News, they

were apolitical no longer. By
then they freely admitted to a
pro-regents stance.
But by then, they were also
cheering on the Old Town
clock each time it chimed
another long hour.
Lists
In the beginning people or
ganized themselves, compiling
lists of places in line, polling
each other on their opinions
on affirmative action, and
standing in line for each other
during frantic runs to get cof
fee.
But the list became con
fused, the pollsters were ac
cused of corruption and the
line became poorly defined
with head-to-head sleeping
bags, card players and stray
lumps of bedding.
Across the street, a group of
about 20 Howard University
law students chanted "affirma
tive action, affirmative action."
They kept it up until 2 a.m.
A woman walked around
with a bearded man announc
ing, "Cod is here, would you
like to meet him?"

At 5 a.m., when the first seri
ous-looking cars began to
stream down the street, a
group of police starting shout
ing and jostling people awake.
"If I can't sleep why should
you," joked one.
Supreme Court guards tried
to impose order on the masses
insisting that people "either
stand up or sit up."
Amid feeble political argu
ments, more games of hearts
and more runs for coffee, the
clock chimed seven and it
began to grow lighter.
By 9 a.m. some 250 people
had been forced into a close
rigid line, a strong wind had
become icy and policemen yel
led at people to "stay off the
stairs."
TV crews
The network television news
crews had set themselves up
and were asking members of
the crowd for their opinions
"about Bakke."
The crowd became excited at
the idea of waiting for so long
and not getting a seat. Its
former cooperation turned to
suspicion and hostility against
"newcomers." Groups of
people burst through lines of
policemen and, once at the top
of the stairs, found their way to
the chambers.
The quick transition from the
chilling wind to the stuffy heat
was too much for some people
and they dozed off.
Archibald Cox was the first to
speak on behalf of the regents.
He declared that there could
be "no racially blind stand
which will draw more than a
trickle of minority students
into the mainstream of profes
sions."
Sharp questions
He was questioned sharply,
especially by Justice William
Rehnquist on such points as
whether he meant under
graduate or graduate students
in particular.
Solicitor General Wade
McCree spoke next.
"The full dimension of the
Fourteenth Amendment prin
ciple of equal protection is that
it should help persons who are
held back to be brought up to
the starting line," he said.
Bakke's attorney, Reynold
Coldin, spoke next. He said
that U.C. Davis Dean of Admis
sions had promised not to in
terview anyone with a GPA
lower than 2.5, but in fact had
interviewed students whose

averages were far lower.
During the testimony, the
nine justices swung vigorously
back and forth in their high
backed chairs. At one point
Rehnquist swung so energeti
cally that he rebounded loudly.
There were countless lead
ing questions on seemingly in
significant points. It was almost
hard to believe that 200 people
had shivered all night for the
chance of sitting in the stuffy
room and listening to ex
changes many of them did not
understand.
On the other hand, the feel
ing that "we were witnessing
history" — and "stomping on
racism" was infectious.
Nobody will know just what
is what as regards the Bakke
cise "until maybe next Feb
ruary or even )une" according
to a staff member at the Sup
reme Court information office.
And until then and perhaps
afterwards some 300 people
should be excused if they feel
they have left their thumbprint
on history and the U.S. judicial
process.
