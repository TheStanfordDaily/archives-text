# Redwood Park may double
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Legisla
tion to nearly double the size
of the Redwood National Park
in northern California at a cost
of $359 million won the ap
proval of the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Com
mittee yesterday.
The committee's 15-2 vote
paved the way for full Senate
action on the bill, which is
supported by the Carter ad
ministration. A similar measure
has been approved by a House
committee.
The bill would add 48,000
acres to the 56,535-acre park.
Most of the new area lies south
and east of the existing park.
At the same time, the com
mittee voted to give the in
terior secretary the power to
acquire an additional 30,000
acres farther to the southeast,
an area encompassing the
watershed that flows into the
park.
