Led by the offensive punch
of Peter Phillips and )on Hecht,
the Stanford soccer team beat
Sonoma State 8-0 yesterday.
The Cardinals have now scored
23 points while holding their
opponents scoreless in the last
three games, and raised their
season record to 4-6-1.
Although the final score
sounds convincingly lopsided,
Stanford didn't get into the
game until Phillips scored with
10 minutes remaining in the
tirst half. For the previous 35
minutes, the Cards were men
tally relaxed and lacked crisp
ball movement.
"The first 35 minutes I was in
panic, a little apprehensive,"
Stanford coach Nelson Lodge
said. "You play very casual and

there's no intensity, no drive,
no finish on the shots. Re
minds me of a cat playing with a
mouse."
"The one problem we had
was playing down to their
(Sonoma's) ability," Lodge
said. "The team was not
executing well, we were play
ing a very mechanical type of
game. They (the Cards)
evaluated their opponent and
realized that they were a step
better and would rather be
pretty than functional."
Stanford took a 3-0 halftime
lead on scores by Phillips and
Hecht.
The contrast between the
two halves was striking. The
Cards had 16 shots-on-goal in
the first half, scoring on only
three. It took 35 minutes to

score in the first stanza, but
only four minutes into the sec
ond half Hecht scored again.
Other Card goals came from
Jim Melamed, Paul
Kozachenko, Bill Allstetter and
Teddy Robinson. Allstetter's
goal was an exceptional show
of teamwork, with a double as
sist by Mike Epperson and Bill
Hoffenburg.
Stanford meets Stanislaus
State Saturday.
"It's going to be a tough
game," Lodge said. "They beat
San Francisco State soundly,
3-1, and we're playing them up
there." Stanford played SFS,
losing 2-1 in overtime, so
Saturday's game with Stanis
laus will test the Cards' im
provement over the last two
weeks.
