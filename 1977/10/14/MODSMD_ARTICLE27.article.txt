Stanford will host San Jose
State's football squad Nov. 12 if
the Spartans still have a team
three weeks hence. San Jose
has lost 12 starters to injuries in
the first five games of the sea
son.
"I feel like we should be re
porting our injuries to the Red
Cross instead of the media,"
said San Jose coach Lynn Stiles
earlier this week.
Remember the former USC
football coach who said he'd
like to beat Stanford 2000-0?
He's beginning to find out
what it's like to be on the other
side of the score.
John McKay, former Trojan
head honcho, was acting like a
spoiled child who didn't get his
way after his Tampa Bay Buc
caneers lost their 18th straight
regular season game. The Bucs
have yet to win a league game.
After Tampa Bay's 10-0 loss to
Washington Sunday, Redskin

defensive tackle Bill Brundige
said, "Sooner or later McKay
has to learn that his old USC
offense won't work in this
league. He's not playing Stan
ford now. Running from that
l-formation on third-and-10
makes no sense."
McKay responded: "Any
body in his right mind who says
the l-formation won't work is
an idiot. What formation was
Washington in out there when
they scored their first
touchdown? What the hell
does Bill Brundige know about
football? A dumb-ass tackle
down on all fours probably
doesn't know the offensive set
and probably doesn't care."
McKay termed criticisms of
his coaching "silly-ass com
ments." He told writers earlier
this week: "I'm going to tell
you something and I want you
to listen to me. None of you
know anything about foot
ball."
