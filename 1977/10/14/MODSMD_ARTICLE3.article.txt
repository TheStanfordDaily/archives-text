# More thought-provoking
## MCAT objectives modified 
### Lisa Gomer 
The newly designed Medical Col
lege Aptitude Test (MCAT), departs
dramatically from the old one, ac
cording to Diane Norman, senior
administrative assistant to the Medi
cal School Committee on Admis
sions.
Differences between the two tests
are based on a change in testing ob
jectives. The old MCAT was oriented
toward measuring general ability
with the limited objective of predict
ing success in the basic medical sci
ences, according to "The Preprofes
sional Handbook" published by the
Academic Information Center.
Norman said she believes the new
MCAT will test more innate ability,
and will be reflective of recent col
lege course work. She said she hopes
the new MCAT will not ask only
academic questions, but also more
thought-provoking ones which the
students will be facing as physicians.
Future performance
The new MCAT was developed by
the Association of American Medical
Colleges to deal with a growing need
to link admission decisions based on
the test to the future performance of
physicians.
The test was developed by the
American Institutes for Research in
the Behavioral Sciences, a private,
nonprofit organization under the di
rection of the AAMC. A cooperative
writing and review process of test
questions by professors and stu
dents was employed.
The basic goals of the test as stated
in the new MCAT Information Pam
phlet are:
— The development of a means of
assessing achievement levels and
expected prerequisites which are re
levant to the study and practice of

medicine;
— The design of an instrument
which would assess a precisely iden
tified base of content found in all test
forms, and also have the capacity to
respond to a changing base of scien
tific knowledge; and
— The development of a test
whose results would identify
strengths and weaknesses and thus
aid in the counseling of nominees.
Science section
Specifically, the new test has a
large science section divided into
three sub-sections, designed to test
achievement at the first-year level.
The new 15-point scoring system will
be used to rate each part indepen
dently, whereas the old MCAT had
composite grading.
A second section of the new MCAT
deals with science problems, testing
basic skills in using scientific know
ledge to solve problems in biology,
chemistry and physics.
Skills analysis is the basis of the last
two sections, according to the New
MCAT Student Manual, published by
the AAMC. Reading skills and quan
titative analysis are tested separately
during the day-long exam.
Sections on general information
and verbal ability are no longer a part
of the test, according to the hand
book.
Charles Brown, a fourth-year med
ical student at the Medical School,
said he believes the old MCAT was
difficult only because it did not test
knowledge acquired at the university
level. Brown said, "I probably would
have done better if I had taken the
test right after high school."
Frustrating
Donald Lum, a senior, took the
new MCAT last spring and found it to
be more frustrating than difficult.

"The most frustrating thing was the
amount of time allotted to each sec
tion," he said.
"Some parts had too much time
allotted while in others there was not
enough." Lum also said he felt a high
school knowledge of biology and
physics was adequate for the exam,
but that more advanced work in
chemistry was needed.
Another senior, Scott Katz, said
the test was "deceptively easy." He
said students were overprepared in
the sciences since the MCAT only
emphasized the more basic scientific
principles and their applications.
Concerning the predictive values
of the two tests, Brown said he could
see no predictive value in the old test
beyond the first two years of medical
school. Brown also said that he
thought the general information sec
tion ot the old MCAT was the only
redeeming factor of the test.
"There is no way to measure how
well a person will interact with his
patients," he said.
Lum also said the test would not
have a predictive value beyond the
first years. He suggested that to im
prove this, the test should pose essay
questions dealing with values and
ethics.
Review course
Brown and Lum both reviewed
their class notes, while Katz took an
intensive tive-week review course
which met all day every Saturday.
Katz said, "The preparatory class
helped me by familiarizing me with
the style of questions, by teaching
me how to read the directions, and
by giving me self-conlidence.

said, "the general reaction by stu
dents is that it is too lons."

Asst. AIC Director Anne Coxon
said, "the general reaction by stu
dents is that it is too lons."
The newly designed Medical Col
lege Aptitude Test (MCAT), departs
dramatically from the old one, ac
cording to Diane Norman, senior
administrative assistant to the Medi
cal School Committee on Admis
sions.
Differences between the two tests
are based on a change in testing ob
jectives. The old MCAT was oriented
toward measuring general ability
with the limited objective of predict
ing success in the basic medical sci
ences, according to "The Preprofes
sional Handbook" published by the
Academic Information Center.
Norman said she believes the new
MCAT will test more innate ability,
and will be reflective of recent col
lege course work. She said she hopes
the new MCAT will not ask only
academic questions, but also more
thought-provoking ones which the
students will be facing as physicians.
Future performance
The new MCAT was developed by
the Association of American Medical
Colleges to deal with a growing need
to link admission decisions based on
the test to the future performance of
physicians.
The test was developed by the
American Institutes for Research in
the Behavioral Sciences, a private,
nonprofit organization under the di
rection of the AAMC. A cooperative
writing and review process of test
questions by professors and stu
dents was employed.
The basic goals of the test as stated
in the new MCAT Information Pam
phlet are:
— The development of a means of
assessing achievement levels and
expected prerequisites which are re
levant to the study and practice of

medicine;
— The design of an instrument
which would assess a precisely iden
tified base of content found in all test
forms, and also have the capacity to
respond to a changing base of scien
tific knowledge; and
— The development of a test
whose results would identify
strengths and weaknesses and thus
aid in the counseling of nominees.
Science section
Specifically, the new test has a
large science section divided into
three sub-sections, designed to test
achievement at the first-year level.
The new 15-point scoring system will
be used to rate each part indepen
dently, whereas the old MCAT had
composite grading.
A second section of the new MCAT
deals with science problems, testing
basic skills in using scientific know
ledge to solve problems in biology,
chemistry and physics.
Skills analysis is the basis of the last
two sections, according to the New
MCAT Student Manual, published by
the AAMC. Reading skills and quan
titative analysis are tested separately
during the day-long exam.
Sections on general information
and verbal ability are no longer a part
of the test, according to the hand
book.
Charles Brown, a fourth-year med
ical student at the Medical School,
said he believes the old MCAT was
difficult only because it did not test
knowledge acquired at the university
level. Brown said, "I probably would
have done better if I had taken the
test right after high school."
Frustrating
Donald Lum, a senior, took the
new MCAT last spring and found it to
be more frustrating than difficult.

"The most frustrating thing was the
amount of time allotted to each sec
tion," he said.
"Some parts had too much time
allotted while in others there was not
enough." Lum also said he felt a high
school knowledge of biology and
physics was adequate for the exam,
but that more advanced work in
chemistry was needed.
Another senior, Scott Katz, said
the test was "deceptively easy." He
said students were overprepared in
the sciences since the MCAT only
emphasized the more basic scientific
principles and their applications.
Concerning the predictive values
of the two tests, Brown said he could
see no predictive value in the old test
beyond the first two years of medical
school. Brown also said that he
thought the general information sec
tion ot the old MCAT was the only
redeeming factor of the test.
"There is no way to measure how
well a person will interact with his
patients," he said.
Lum also said the test would not
have a predictive value beyond the
first years. He suggested that to im
prove this, the test should pose essay
questions dealing with values and
ethics.
Review course
Brown and Lum both reviewed
their class notes, while Katz took an
intensive tive-week review course
which met all day every Saturday.
Katz said, "The preparatory class
helped me by familiarizing me with
the style of questions, by teaching
me how to read the directions, and
by giving me self-conlidence.
