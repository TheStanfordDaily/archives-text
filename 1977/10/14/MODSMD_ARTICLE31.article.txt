# Cards go north for dogfight
## 
### David Georgette 
What ever happened to
"Husky fever?"
That was the term the Uni
versity of Washington came up
with to spearhead a promo
tional drive for Husky football
this season.
But based on the Huskies'
performance so far, the Stan
ford Cardinals won't be facing
any rabid dogs tomorrow af
ternoon on the shores of Lake
Washington in a Pacific-8 foot
ball game (1:30 p.m., KSFO 560
AM, KZSU 90.1 FM). No, the
Huskies have been playing
more like defanged beagles.
The Huskies were tabbed as
one of the top three Pac-8
teams, and second in the na
tion by one poll, before the
season started. But a 1-3 mark
in nonconference action
against average opponents left
Husky coach Don James say
ing, "It was nice to get into the
conference 'cause we played
so bad in nonconference."
Granted, two of the losses
(Syracuse, 22-20, and Min
nesota, 19-17) came on field
goals in the last few seconds.
But as James said, "We haven't
been very consistent. The
things we had hoped to do

we've been greatly disap
pointed in."
Last week, though, the Hus
kies showed what they are cap
able ot, taking advantage of six
Oregon miscues on their way
to a 54-0 romp over the Ducks.
Before the season, James
was quoted as saying, "I think
we have been picked to finish a
little too high in some of the
preseason articles, but I hope
we are Pacific-8 contenders.
We must beat some of the
California teams."
Huskies' chance
A win over 4-1 Stanford (2-0
in the Pac-8) could catapult the
Huskies to their predicted
heights, but James doesn't ex
pect the task to be made easier
by Stanford turnovers. "We
haven't played anyone that's
close to Stanford," he said.
"It's really difficult to prepare
for them. They have so many
formations and the amazing
thing is they don't make mis
takes. The Seahawks (Seattle's
NFL team) ought to be playing
them instead of us."
James' praise for the Cards
has been reciprocated this
week by Stanford coach Bill
Walsh's comments on the
Huskies.

"We're concerned about
Washington," said Walsh.
"Looking at comparative
scores, they'd be a 44-point
favorite (Stanford defeated
Oregon 20-10). Before the sea
son, they had confidence in
going to the Rose Bowl. We're
gonna try to avoid a 54-0 kind of
loss, and have a chance to win
the game."
The bookmakers seem to be
lieve what Walsh has been say
ing. The Huskies were installed
as three-point favorites, some
thing James called "amazing."
Another figure that could be
deceptive is the Huskies'
conference-leading mark in
pass defense. They've allowed
just 77.4 yards per game but
only 75 passes have been
thrown against them. Overall
the Husky defense, led by All-
America candidate Dave
Browning at right tackle and
defensive backs Nesby Glas
gow and Kyle Heinrich, is rated
third in the conference.
"We've not given up a lot of
points," said James, "but
we've given up a lot of yards."
Benjamin is back
Guy Benjamin, now second
in the conference in passing to
UCLA's Rick Bashore, will start

at quarterback for the Cardi
nals.
With Benjamin directing the
attack, the Cardinal offense
will need to come up with good
gains on first down to keep the
Husky defense off-balance.
"They have supposedly the
best pass defense in the con
ference," said Walsh. "With
that in mind, we better be able
to run the ball. We have to have
diversity in what we do. We're
just not a powerful team."
The player who gives the
Card offense most of its diver
sity is halfback Darrin Nelson,
the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 25 catches and its third
leading rusher with a 102.2 av
erage per game.
Walsh called Washington
"an excellent fundamentally
coached football team. They
know exactly what they want to
do."
Moon's the man
The Huskies use a lot of roll
outs and short dropbacks in
their passing attack. The man
who does the throwing is
6-foot-3, 200-pound senior
Warren Moon. He is third in
both passing and total offense
in the Pac-8. "He's coming
along," said James. "He's not
to his potential yet, but he's
getting there."
The Huskies' top receiver is
Gary Briggs, who has 18 recep
tions. The Huskies have speed
to burn on the other side in the
person of Robert "Spider"
Gaines, who wears No. 93 be
cause, according to Walsh, he
runs the 100 in 9.3. Gaines has
12 catches for 271 yards this
season.
The Huskies have more
speed behind Moon. "They
have men who can go all the
way at fullback and tailback,"
said Walsh. The top Husky
runner is sophomore Ron Gip
son, sixth in the conference
with a 4.5 average to go with his
9.9 speed. The other Husky
runners include senior Ron
Rowland, who gained 1002
yards last season, sophomore
Joe Steele (255 yards on 56 car
ries this year) and freshman
Kyle Stevens from San Jose.
Stevens and Glasgow combine
to give Washington a pair of
fine kick returners.
The speed the Huskies have
in the skill positions could
mean trouble for Card defen
ders. "We lack-team speed on
defense," said Walsh. "But
we've compensated for it ex
tremely well."
Added compensation might
be needed because Stanford's
main man on defense, middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino, is
slowed by a leg injury.
From what Walsh has been
saying this week, it sounds like
the Cards are in for a real dog
fight in Seattle. "We're not a
team that can propel itself to
any greatness," he said. "We
hope to derail the Huskies."
But really, one gets the feel
ing Walsh knows the Cards
should be able to handle the
Huskies.

way at fullback and tailback,"
said Walsh. The top Husky
runner is sophomore Ron Gip
son, sixth in the conference
with a 4.5 average to go with his
9.9 speed. The other Husky
runners include senior Ron
Rowland, who gained 1002
yards last season, sophomore
Joe Steele (255 yards on 56 car
ries this year) and freshman
Kyle Stevens from San Jose.
Stevens and Glasgow combine
to give Washington a pair of
fine kick returners.
The speed the Huskies have
in the skill positions could
mean trouble for Card defen
ders. "We lack-team speed on
defense," said Walsh. "But
we've compensated for it ex
tremely well."
Added compensation might
be needed because Stanford's
main man on defense, middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino, is
slowed by a leg injury.
From what Walsh has been
saying this week, it sounds like
the Cards are in for a real dog
fight in Seattle. "We're not a
team that can propel itself to
any greatness," he said. "We
hope to derail the Huskies."
But really, one gets the feel
ing Walsh knows the Cards
should be able to handle the
Huskies.
What ever happened to
"Husky fever?"
That was the term the Uni
versity of Washington came up
with to spearhead a promo
tional drive for Husky football
this season.
But based on the Huskies'
performance so far, the Stan
ford Cardinals won't be facing
any rabid dogs tomorrow af
ternoon on the shores of Lake
Washington in a Pacific-8 foot
ball game (1:30 p.m., KSFO 560
AM, KZSU 90.1 FM). No, the
Huskies have been playing
more like defanged beagles.
The Huskies were tabbed as
one of the top three Pac-8
teams, and second in the na
tion by one poll, before the
season started. But a 1-3 mark
in nonconference action
against average opponents left
Husky coach Don James say
ing, "It was nice to get into the
conference 'cause we played
so bad in nonconference."
Granted, two of the losses
(Syracuse, 22-20, and Min
nesota, 19-17) came on field
goals in the last few seconds.
But as James said, "We haven't
been very consistent. The
things we had hoped to do

we've been greatly disap
pointed in."
Last week, though, the Hus
kies showed what they are cap
able ot, taking advantage of six
Oregon miscues on their way
to a 54-0 romp over the Ducks.
Before the season, James
was quoted as saying, "I think
we have been picked to finish a
little too high in some of the
preseason articles, but I hope
we are Pacific-8 contenders.
We must beat some of the
California teams."
Huskies' chance
A win over 4-1 Stanford (2-0
in the Pac-8) could catapult the
Huskies to their predicted
heights, but James doesn't ex
pect the task to be made easier
by Stanford turnovers. "We
haven't played anyone that's
close to Stanford," he said.
"It's really difficult to prepare
for them. They have so many
formations and the amazing
thing is they don't make mis
takes. The Seahawks (Seattle's
NFL team) ought to be playing
them instead of us."
James' praise for the Cards
has been reciprocated this
week by Stanford coach Bill
Walsh's comments on the
Huskies.

"We're concerned about
Washington," said Walsh.
"Looking at comparative
scores, they'd be a 44-point
favorite (Stanford defeated
Oregon 20-10). Before the sea
son, they had confidence in
going to the Rose Bowl. We're
gonna try to avoid a 54-0 kind of
loss, and have a chance to win
the game."
The bookmakers seem to be
lieve what Walsh has been say
ing. The Huskies were installed
as three-point favorites, some
thing James called "amazing."
Another figure that could be
deceptive is the Huskies'
conference-leading mark in
pass defense. They've allowed
just 77.4 yards per game but
only 75 passes have been
thrown against them. Overall
the Husky defense, led by All-
America candidate Dave
Browning at right tackle and
defensive backs Nesby Glas
gow and Kyle Heinrich, is rated
third in the conference.
"We've not given up a lot of
points," said James, "but
we've given up a lot of yards."
Benjamin is back
Guy Benjamin, now second
in the conference in passing to
UCLA's Rick Bashore, will start

at quarterback for the Cardi
nals.
With Benjamin directing the
attack, the Cardinal offense
will need to come up with good
gains on first down to keep the
Husky defense off-balance.
"They have supposedly the
best pass defense in the con
ference," said Walsh. "With
that in mind, we better be able
to run the ball. We have to have
diversity in what we do. We're
just not a powerful team."
The player who gives the
Card offense most of its diver
sity is halfback Darrin Nelson,
the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 25 catches and its third
leading rusher with a 102.2 av
erage per game.
Walsh called Washington
"an excellent fundamentally
coached football team. They
know exactly what they want to
do."
Moon's the man
The Huskies use a lot of roll
outs and short dropbacks in
their passing attack. The man
who does the throwing is
6-foot-3, 200-pound senior
Warren Moon. He is third in
both passing and total offense
in the Pac-8. "He's coming
along," said James. "He's not
to his potential yet, but he's
getting there."
The Huskies' top receiver is
Gary Briggs, who has 18 recep
tions. The Huskies have speed
to burn on the other side in the
person of Robert "Spider"
Gaines, who wears No. 93 be
cause, according to Walsh, he
runs the 100 in 9.3. Gaines has
12 catches for 271 yards this
season.
The Huskies have more
speed behind Moon. "They
have men who can go all the
way at fullback and tailback,"
said Walsh. The top Husky
runner is sophomore Ron Gip
son, sixth in the conference
with a 4.5 average to go with his
9.9 speed. The other Husky

sity is halfback Darrin Nelson,
the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 25 catches and its third
leading rusher with a 102.2 av
erage per game.
Walsh called Washington
"an excellent fundamentally
coached football team. They
know exactly what they want to
do."
Moon's the man
The Huskies use a lot of roll
outs and short dropbacks in
their passing attack. The man
who does the throwing is
6-foot-3, 200-pound senior
Warren Moon. He is third in
both passing and total offense
in the Pac-8. "He's coming
along," said James. "He's not
to his potential yet, but he's
getting there."
The Huskies' top receiver is
Gary Briggs, who has 18 recep
tions. The Huskies have speed
to burn on the other side in the
person of Robert "Spider"
Gaines, who wears No. 93 be
cause, according to Walsh, he
runs the 100 in 9.3. Gaines has
12 catches for 271 yards this
season.
The Huskies have more
speed behind Moon. "They
have men who can go all the
way at fullback and tailback,"
said Walsh. The top Husky
runner is sophomore Ron Gip
son, sixth in the conference
with a 4.5 average to go with his
9.9 speed. The other Husky
runners include senior Ron
Rowland, who gained 1002
yards last season, sophomore
Joe Steele (255 yards on 56 car
ries this year) and freshman
Kyle Stevens from San Jose.
Stevens and Glasgow combine
to give Washington a pair of
fine kick returners.
The speed the Huskies have
in the skill positions could
mean trouble for Card defen
ders. "We lack-team speed on
defense," said Walsh. "But
we've compensated for it ex
tremely well."
Added compensation might
be needed because Stanford's
main man on defense, middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino, is
slowed by a leg injury.
From what Walsh has been
saying this week, it sounds like
the Cards are in for a real dog
fight in Seattle. "We're not a
team that can propel itself to
any greatness," he said. "We
hope to derail the Huskies."
But really, one gets the feel
ing Walsh knows the Cards
should be able to handle the
Huskies.
What ever happened to
"Husky fever?"
That was the term the Uni
versity of Washington came up
with to spearhead a promo
tional drive for Husky football
this season.
But based on the Huskies'
performance so far, the Stan
ford Cardinals won't be facing
any rabid dogs tomorrow af
ternoon on the shores of Lake
Washington in a Pacific-8 foot
ball game (1:30 p.m., KSFO 560
AM, KZSU 90.1 FM). No, the
Huskies have been playing
more like defanged beagles.
The Huskies were tabbed as
one of the top three Pac-8
teams, and second in the na
tion by one poll, before the
season started. But a 1-3 mark
in nonconference action
against average opponents left
Husky coach Don James say
ing, "It was nice to get into the
conference 'cause we played
so bad in nonconference."
Granted, two of the losses
(Syracuse, 22-20, and Min
nesota, 19-17) came on field
goals in the last few seconds.
But as James said, "We haven't
been very consistent. The
things we had hoped to do

we've been greatly disap
pointed in."
Last week, though, the Hus
kies showed what they are cap
able ot, taking advantage of six
Oregon miscues on their way
to a 54-0 romp over the Ducks.
Before the season, James
was quoted as saying, "I think
we have been picked to finish a
little too high in some of the
preseason articles, but I hope
we are Pacific-8 contenders.
We must beat some of the
California teams."
Huskies' chance
A win over 4-1 Stanford (2-0
in the Pac-8) could catapult the
Huskies to their predicted
heights, but James doesn't ex
pect the task to be made easier
by Stanford turnovers. "We
haven't played anyone that's
close to Stanford," he said.
"It's really difficult to prepare
for them. They have so many
formations and the amazing
thing is they don't make mis
takes. The Seahawks (Seattle's
NFL team) ought to be playing
them instead of us."
James' praise for the Cards
has been reciprocated this
week by Stanford coach Bill
Walsh's comments on the
Huskies.

"We're concerned about
Washington," said Walsh.
"Looking at comparative
scores, they'd be a 44-point
favorite (Stanford defeated
Oregon 20-10). Before the sea
son, they had confidence in
going to the Rose Bowl. We're
gonna try to avoid a 54-0 kind of
loss, and have a chance to win
the game."
The bookmakers seem to be
lieve what Walsh has been say
ing. The Huskies were installed
as three-point favorites, some
thing James called "amazing."
Another figure that could be
deceptive is the Huskies'
conference-leading mark in
pass defense. They've allowed
just 77.4 yards per game but
only 75 passes have been
thrown against them. Overall
the Husky defense, led by All-
America candidate Dave
Browning at right tackle and
defensive backs Nesby Glas
gow and Kyle Heinrich, is rated
third in the conference.
"We've not given up a lot of
points," said James, "but
we've given up a lot of yards."
Benjamin is back
Guy Benjamin, now second
in the conference in passing to
UCLA's Rick Bashore, will start

at quarterback for the Cardi
nals.
With Benjamin directing the
attack, the Cardinal offense
will need to come up with good
gains on first down to keep the
Husky defense off-balance.
"They have supposedly the
best pass defense in the con
ference," said Walsh. "With
that in mind, we better be able
to run the ball. We have to have
diversity in what we do. We're
just not a powerful team."
The player who gives the
Card offense most of its diver
sity is halfback Darrin Nelson,
the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 25 catches and its third
