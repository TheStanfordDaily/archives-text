# Packer joins staff soothsayers
## 
### 
The Daily staff and Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon
took a beating in last week's
football picks. The staff con
sensus and Hargadon picked
only two of the five games
right, so the Daily sportswriters
have brought in a ringer from
the English Dept. to change
their momentum.
Assoc. Prof. Nancy Packer,
winner of the 1977 Lloyd Din
kelspiel teaching award and an
avid football follower, has ag
reed to join Daily forecasters
this week.
"The Beavers are coming off
a highly satisfying win in which
they successfully totalled
BYU's Cifford Nielsen.
Strangely, all six Cal quarter
backs called in sick this week.
Nonetheless: Cal 24, Oregon
State 20.
"Coach John Robinson of
USC has been mysteriously ab
sent from practice all week. A
Daily stringer for the Tus

caloosa News claims that he
saw Robinson meditating
cross-legged at the feet of
guru Maharishi Bryant. Thus:
USC 41, Oregon 7.
"The stats tell this one.
Quarterback Jack Thompson
has completed 53.9 per cent of
his passes against teams with a
right-handed middle
linebacker, but only 52.8 per
cent of his passes against teams
with a left-handed middle
linebacker. UCLA all the way.
UCLA 27, Washington State 10.
"Having failed history in col
lege, coach Bill Walsh is
doomed to repeat Jack Christ
iansen's mistake of allowing a
two-quarterback problem to
emerge. A clever fellow, how
ever, Walsh has devised a new
offense in which he uses both
at once. Benjamin and Dils will
alternate playing the Lone
some Quarterback position in
a wide formation. How can
they lose? Stanford 31,
Washington 14."
