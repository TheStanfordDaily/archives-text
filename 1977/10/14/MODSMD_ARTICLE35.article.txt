# Stanford Invite hosts standout running field
## 
### 
Many of the nation's top dis
tance runners will test their
legs and lungs against the Stan
ford Golf Course tomorrow
when the Cardinal cross coun
try teams host the 13th annual
Stanford Invitational Cross
Country Meet.
"We definitely have a star
studded field for this year's
meet," Stanford cross country
coach Marshall Clark said.
Olympians Paul Geis, Dun
can Macdonald and Mike Boit
and teams from Texas-El Paso
and UC-lrvine pace the
talented 13-team, 125-runner
field which will set out across
the 10,000-meter course at 10
a.m.
UTEP claimed the last two
NCAA cross country titles
while Irvine won the NCAA Di
vision II meet last year. The
Miners are rated No. 2 in the
nation while the Anteaters are
ranked fourth.
UTEP, which won the invita
tional two years ago, brings its
foreign legion to the Farm. The
Miners are paced by Mexican
Rudolfo Gomez, who rep
resented the Americas team in
the 10,000 meters at the World
Cup Meet in September where
he beat Frank Shorter. El Paso
also has six Kenyans, foremost

among them James Munyala,
the NCAA steeplechase
champion.
Ralph Serna, winner of last
year's Invitational, and AAU
1500-meter titlist Steve Scott,
currently the United States' top
miler, will spur Irvine in its bid
to upset UTEP.
While Clark said he will be
surprised if anyone breaks the
course record of 29:18 set by
Washington State's Henry
Rono in the 1976 Pacific-8
Championships, he indicated
that spectators might look for
sub-iO-minute times.
"Look for Duncan and Geis
to go out on the pace early,"
Clark said. "Gomez will prob
ably pick up stride in the mid
dle of the race."
Stanford's women, winners
of back-to-back invitationals
the last two weekends, face
eight other teams in a five
kilometer race at 9 a.m. West
Valley Track Club, winner of a
dual meet with the Cardinals
three weeks ago, is the pre
race favorite but Stanford will
look to improve upon last
year's second-place Invita
tional showing.
Both races begin and end by
the second tree.

Valley Track Club, winner of a
dual meet with the Cardinals
three weeks ago, is the pre
race favorite but Stanford will
look to improve upon last
year's second-place Invita
tional showing.
Both races begin and end by
the second tree.

Stanford's Bill Haldeman ascends a grassy knoll in last year's Stanford
Invitational Cross Country meet. Haldeman and the Cardinals host
the Invitational tomorrow on the Stanford Golf Course. Sophomore
Haldeman figures to be one of the top Card finishers.
Many of the nation's top dis
tance runners will test their
legs and lungs against the Stan
ford Golf Course tomorrow
when the Cardinal cross coun
try teams host the 13th annual
Stanford Invitational Cross
Country Meet.
"We definitely have a star
studded field for this year's
meet," Stanford cross country
coach Marshall Clark said.
Olympians Paul Geis, Dun
can Macdonald and Mike Boit
and teams from Texas-El Paso
and UC-lrvine pace the
talented 13-team, 125-runner
field which will set out across
the 10,000-meter course at 10
a.m.
UTEP claimed the last two
NCAA cross country titles
while Irvine won the NCAA Di
vision II meet last year. The
Miners are rated No. 2 in the
nation while the Anteaters are
ranked fourth.
UTEP, which won the invita
tional two years ago, brings its
foreign legion to the Farm. The
Miners are paced by Mexican
Rudolfo Gomez, who rep
resented the Americas team in
the 10,000 meters at the World
Cup Meet in September where
he beat Frank Shorter. El Paso
also has six Kenyans, foremost

among them James Munyala,
the NCAA steeplechase
champion.
Ralph Serna, winner of last
year's Invitational, and AAU
1500-meter titlist Steve Scott,
currently the United States' top
miler, will spur Irvine in its bid
to upset UTEP.
While Clark said he will be
surprised if anyone breaks the
course record of 29:18 set by
Washington State's Henry
Rono in the 1976 Pacific-8
Championships, he indicated
that spectators might look for
sub-iO-minute times.
"Look for Duncan and Geis
to go out on the pace early,"
Clark said. "Gomez will prob
ably pick up stride in the mid
dle of the race."
Stanford's women, winners
of back-to-back invitationals
the last two weekends, face
eight other teams in a five
kilometer race at 9 a.m. West
Valley Track Club, winner of a
dual meet with the Cardinals
three weeks ago, is the pre
race favorite but Stanford will
look to improve upon last
year's second-place Invita
tional showing.
