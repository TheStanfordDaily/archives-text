### Marcia Hadeler 
Contrary to popular be
lief, a lot of Stanford stu
dents scored last week.
In coed intramural foot
ball the Hurlburt Haywires
beat Larkin I in the highest
scoring game of the week.
The Haywires credit their
victory to quarterback Paul
Spath and receiver joe Can
non, who caught a
touchdown pass and picked
off four interceptions. One
of Hurlburt's star receivers,
Peggy Christiansen,
cracked a finger in the game
and will probably sit out the
rest of the season.
The Leftovers, another
coed team, is particularly
proud of its "unusual ball
handling." Comprised of

four men and five women,
mostly rugby players, team
captain Carl Edwards said,
"We use a lot of lateral pas
ses and our rugby condi
tioning allows us to out-run
the other teams." In their
first two victories the Lef
tovers have outscored their
opponents, 62-6.
Women's football
In the women's division
of IM football, Eucalypto
showed some good moves
against Roble, as did FTLS
against the Donnerettes.
Betsy Lough and Cathy
Murphy of FTLS contributed
to a good defensive team ef
fort, sacking the Don
nerette quarterback several
times in the game.
Stephanie Calef returned an

interception tor a
touchdown. The FTLS
players are all past and pre
sent Stanford women's bas
ketball players.
Women's volleyball
She had a 103-degree
temperature. Her teammate
had never played doubles
before. But the two of them
had played together since
high school said Shivonne
Byrne, Carol Major's vol
leyball partner.
"We played a challenging
and exciting game against
last year's IM volleyball
champions Ellen Merrick
and Melle Meyer," said
Byrne. In both games,
Byrne-Majors came back
from behind 7-1, 5-1 to beat
Merrick-Meyer 15-11, 15-9.
