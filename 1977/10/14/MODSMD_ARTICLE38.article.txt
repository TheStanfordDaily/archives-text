# Tai chi – revitalizing your inner self
## 
### Caryn Coulter 
Boxing shadows and baby
breathing; who ever would
have thought to resort to such
pastimes in search of alterna
tive energy sources? While
Stanford geology experts drill
for petroleum and coal
seekers shovel for fuel, a
heretofore little known energy
theorist guards his secret to
what he believes is the cheapest
and most convenient power
source. What's more, his sec
ret is not a new one. The dis
covery dates back to 228 A.D.
Master Tsuei (pronounced
"tree") Wei is offering his sec
ret to the Stanford-Palo Alto
community on Sunday. With
out realizing it, you may al
ready be familiar with his spe
cialty, tai chi ch'uan, or the an
cient art of shadow boxing, as
Westerners have dubbed it.
If you have ever awaken at
the crack of dawn to gaze upon
a person's strange slow
motion performance in the
middle of the field outside
your window, you may have
witnessed a demonstration of
tai chi. The physical moves ap
pear excruciatingly slow and
gracefully calculated. The mo
tions are synchronized with a

breathing pattern which
sounds like a light whistling
breeze.
Natural
Upon such a sight, one
would wonder whether one of
the Stanford "tarm" animals
has escaped. In fact, one
would not be too far oft. The
natural poses of animals and
birds are used to describe the
movements and forms of tai

chi, said Tsuei through his in
terpreter, Joseph Ku. This is
why one may observe stork
like wingspreads and eagle
alert postures.
Tai chi is a Taoist means of
transforming tension into
energy, a means passed down
from the Vang family of ancient
China, said Tsuei. One of the
essential components is the
source of the energy.
Tsuei calls it "ch'i" (like the
"ki" in aikido), and he labels it

"the lifegiving force." This
mysterious "ch'i," related to
breathing is said to develop
once the 127 tai chi movements
are mastered and performed
with a high degree of concent
ration and deliberate breathing,
said the master.
Meditation
This art is not a branch of
kung fu, nor does it stem from
karate, aikido, judo or any of

the action-oriented martial arts
to which Americans are accus
tomed. Rather, most of the
above practices were born of
tai chi itself, including trans
cendental meditation.
Tai chi, as a total art, is a form
of self-discipline and self
defense which has its founda
tion in the 2000-year-old
philosophy of Yin and Vang
from the "Book of l-Ching"
(Changes). Its goal is to attain
physical, emotional and men
tal health through an extraor
dinary control of mind, brea
thing and body movement.
Tsuei considers himself "a
friend of tai chi," having
traveled half the globe spread
ing its practice, during and
since the Sino-Japanese con
flict in 1931. Tsuei describes
the significance of the Taoist or
tai chi circle symbol as it relates
to his particular form of exer
cise:
"This Circle contains two
equal parts of an even balance
of all opposites: The dark part
— the Yin, negative and
feminine, softness and inactiv
ity; the light part — the Yang,
positive and masculine, firm
ness and activity. Sometimes
there is a small black circle in
the light part and a small light
circle in the dark part, which
means that everything includes
the opposite.
The whole
"The tai chi circle with both
halves in it represents the

whole, ... as in our move
ments of tai chi ch'uan: one
hand goes up, the other drops
down; one leg takes on the
weight, the other is empty;
while the arms move in circles
and the hands are continu
ously grasping the Yin and
Yang, like holding a ball.
Movement follows movement,
moving to its opposite con
tinuously and without end."
It all sounds very nice, but
how can action-oriented
Americans adapt to such a
philosophical form of condi
tioning? Definitely not a com
petitive sport, the tai chi doc
trine falls into the same categ
ory of individual activities as
jogging or weight training. Its
added appeal of emphasis

upon mental health and emo
tional clarity is actually similar
to that which was embodied in
the so-called "inner tennis
movement."
Tai chi may not seem like a
conventional answer to
academic stress, but Tsuei, at
age 51, is able to infect stu
dents with his own enthusiasm
in a variety of ways. His tai chi
prescription is tailor-made
to meet the needs he perceives
in the individuals who ap
proach him for training.
For example, he recom
mended breathing exercises
and specific tai chi movements
to ammeliorate the ailing voice
pattern and physical imbalance
of the writer of this story.

To demonstrate the power of
"ch'i," Twuei began to breath
through his diaphragm. He
pointed to the "field of elixir"
or tan tien, about two inches
below his navel, designating its
alternating fullness and cavity,
and repeated in broken En-

glish, "Baby . . . baby brea
thing . . . breathe like baby
breathe. .
Soon, by applying one's
hands to his right thigh as he
indicated, one could feel the
thigh expanding.
The same enlargement, in
rhythm with his deep inhaling
and exhaling, was later ob
served in his calves and his
lower arms. The exaggerted
pulsation appeared to be more
than a simple muscle contrac
tion. The precise nature of ch'i
is a medical mystery even to
Tsuei.
The master does insist that
"proper diaphragmatic brea
thing will stimulate blood cir

culation, speed up the process
of metabolism and improve the
assimilation of oxygen, which
in turn brings harmony to
glandular and nervous sys
tems."
Citing the value of tai chi, of
"the supreme ultimate," Tsuei

draws an analogy to our local
lifestyle:
"Imagine getting on to a
freeway, where you can't slow
down. Even once you get off
that freeway you are still go
mg. . . going. . . going. . ."
Tsuei's claim is that tai chi
provides the perfect formula
for mental relief and physical
control, things even Stanford
students could use once in a
while.
Tsuei has 400-500 students in
the Bay Area. He will de
monstrate his tai chi at 3 p.m.
Sunday at the Chinese Com
munity Center, 3065
Middlefield.

Its goal is to attain physical, emotional
and mental health through control of
mind, breathing and body movement.
Tsuei believes the art relieves tension in
the body and provides mental calm, br
inging the body into harmony with itself.

traveled half the globe spread
ing its practice, during and
since the Sino-Japanese con
flict in 1931. Tsuei describes
the significance of the Taoist or
tai chi circle symbol as it relates
to his particular form of exer
cise:
"This Circle contains two
equal parts of an even balance
of all opposites: The dark part
— the Yin, negative and
feminine, softness and inactiv
ity; the light part — the Yang,
positive and masculine, firm
ness and activity. Sometimes
there is a small black circle in
the light part and a small light
circle in the dark part, which
means that everything includes
the opposite.
The whole
"The tai chi circle with both
halves in it represents the

whole, ... as in our move
ments of tai chi ch'uan: one
hand goes up, the other drops
down; one leg takes on the
weight, the other is empty;
while the arms move in circles
and the hands are continu
ously grasping the Yin and
Yang, like holding a ball.
Movement follows movement,
moving to its opposite con
tinuously and without end."
It all sounds very nice, but
how can action-oriented
Americans adapt to such a
philosophical form of condi
tioning? Definitely not a com
petitive sport, the tai chi doc
trine falls into the same categ
ory of individual activities as
jogging or weight training. Its
added appeal of emphasis

upon mental health and emo
tional clarity is actually similar
to that which was embodied in
the so-called "inner tennis
movement."
Tai chi may not seem like a
conventional answer to
academic stress, but Tsuei, at
age 51, is able to infect stu
dents with his own enthusiasm
in a variety of ways. His tai chi
prescription is tailor-made
to meet the needs he perceives
in the individuals who ap
proach him for training.
For example, he recom
mended breathing exercises
and specific tai chi movements
to ammeliorate the ailing voice
pattern and physical imbalance
of the writer of this story.

To demonstrate the power of
"ch'i," Twuei began to breath
through his diaphragm. He
pointed to the "field of elixir"
or tan tien, about two inches
below his navel, designating its
alternating fullness and cavity,
and repeated in broken En-

glish, "Baby . . . baby brea
thing . . . breathe like baby
breathe. .
Soon, by applying one's
hands to his right thigh as he
indicated, one could feel the
thigh expanding.
The same enlargement, in
rhythm with his deep inhaling
and exhaling, was later ob
served in his calves and his
lower arms. The exaggerted
pulsation appeared to be more
than a simple muscle contrac
tion. The precise nature of ch'i
is a medical mystery even to
Tsuei.
The master does insist that
"proper diaphragmatic brea
thing will stimulate blood cir

culation, speed up the process
of metabolism and improve the
assimilation of oxygen, which
in turn brings harmony to
glandular and nervous sys
tems."
Citing the value of tai chi, of
"the supreme ultimate," Tsuei

draws an analogy to our local
lifestyle:
"Imagine getting on to a
freeway, where you can't slow
down. Even once you get off
that freeway you are still go
mg. . . going. . . going. . ."
Tsuei's claim is that tai chi
provides the perfect formula
for mental relief and physical
control, things even Stanford
students could use once in a
while.
Tsuei has 400-500 students in
the Bay Area. He will de
monstrate his tai chi at 3 p.m.
Sunday at the Chinese Com
munity Center, 3065
Middlefield.

Its goal is to attain physical, emotional
and mental health through control of
mind, breathing and body movement.
Tsuei believes the art relieves tension in
the body and provides mental calm, br
inging the body into harmony with itself.

Boxing shadows and baby
breathing; who ever would
have thought to resort to such
pastimes in search of alterna
tive energy sources? While
Stanford geology experts drill
for petroleum and coal
seekers shovel for fuel, a
heretofore little known energy
theorist guards his secret to
what he believes is the cheapest
and most convenient power
source. What's more, his sec
ret is not a new one. The dis
covery dates back to 228 A.D.
Master Tsuei (pronounced
"tree") Wei is offering his sec
ret to the Stanford-Palo Alto
community on Sunday. With
out realizing it, you may al
ready be familiar with his spe
cialty, tai chi ch'uan, or the an
cient art of shadow boxing, as
Westerners have dubbed it.
If you have ever awaken at
the crack of dawn to gaze upon
a person's strange slow
motion performance in the
middle of the field outside
your window, you may have
witnessed a demonstration of
tai chi. The physical moves ap
pear excruciatingly slow and
gracefully calculated. The mo
tions are synchronized with a

breathing pattern which
sounds like a light whistling
breeze.
Natural
Upon such a sight, one
would wonder whether one of
the Stanford "tarm" animals
has escaped. In fact, one
would not be too far oft. The
natural poses of animals and
birds are used to describe the
movements and forms of tai

chi, said Tsuei through his in
terpreter, Joseph Ku. This is
why one may observe stork
like wingspreads and eagle
alert postures.
Tai chi is a Taoist means of
transforming tension into
energy, a means passed down
from the Vang family of ancient
China, said Tsuei. One of the
essential components is the
source of the energy.
Tsuei calls it "ch'i" (like the
"ki" in aikido), and he labels it

"the lifegiving force." This
mysterious "ch'i," related to
breathing is said to develop
once the 127 tai chi movements
are mastered and performed
with a high degree of concent
ration and deliberate breathing,
said the master.
Meditation
This art is not a branch of
kung fu, nor does it stem from
karate, aikido, judo or any of

the action-oriented martial arts
to which Americans are accus
tomed. Rather, most of the
above practices were born of
tai chi itself, including trans
cendental meditation.
Tai chi, as a total art, is a form
of self-discipline and self
defense which has its founda
tion in the 2000-year-old
philosophy of Yin and Vang
from the "Book of l-Ching"
(Changes). Its goal is to attain
physical, emotional and men
tal health through an extraor
dinary control of mind, brea

culation, speed up the process
of metabolism and improve the
assimilation of oxygen, which
in turn brings harmony to
glandular and nervous sys
tems."
Citing the value of tai chi, of
"the supreme ultimate," Tsuei

draws an analogy to our local
lifestyle:
"Imagine getting on to a
freeway, where you can't slow
down. Even once you get off
that freeway you are still go
mg. . . going. . . going. . ."
Tsuei's claim is that tai chi
provides the perfect formula
for mental relief and physical
control, things even Stanford
students could use once in a
while.
Tsuei has 400-500 students in
the Bay Area. He will de
monstrate his tai chi at 3 p.m.
Sunday at the Chinese Com
munity Center, 3065
Middlefield.

Its goal is to attain physical, emotional
and mental health through control of
mind, breathing and body movement.
Tsuei believes the art relieves tension in
the body and provides mental calm, br
inging the body into harmony with itself.

Boxing shadows and baby
breathing; who ever would
have thought to resort to such
pastimes in search of alterna
tive energy sources? While
Stanford geology experts drill
for petroleum and coal
seekers shovel for fuel, a
heretofore little known energy
theorist guards his secret to
what he believes is the cheapest
and most convenient power
source. What's more, his sec
ret is not a new one. The dis
covery dates back to 228 A.D.
Master Tsuei (pronounced
"tree") Wei is offering his sec
ret to the Stanford-Palo Alto
community on Sunday. With
out realizing it, you may al
ready be familiar with his spe
cialty, tai chi ch'uan, or the an
cient art of shadow boxing, as
Westerners have dubbed it.
If you have ever awaken at
the crack of dawn to gaze upon
a person's strange slow
motion performance in the
middle of the field outside
your window, you may have
witnessed a demonstration of
tai chi. The physical moves ap
pear excruciatingly slow and
gracefully calculated. The mo
tions are synchronized with a

breathing pattern which
sounds like a light whistling
breeze.
Natural
Upon such a sight, one
would wonder whether one of
the Stanford "tarm" animals
has escaped. In fact, one
would not be too far oft. The
natural poses of animals and
birds are used to describe the
movements and forms of tai

chi, said Tsuei through his in
terpreter, Joseph Ku. This is
why one may observe stork
like wingspreads and eagle
alert postures.
Tai chi is a Taoist means of
transforming tension into
energy, a means passed down
from the Vang family of ancient
China, said Tsuei. One of the
essential components is the
source of the energy.
Tsuei calls it "ch'i" (like the
"ki" in aikido), and he labels it

"the lifegiving force." This
mysterious "ch'i," related to
breathing is said to develop
once the 127 tai chi movements
are mastered and performed
with a high degree of concent
ration and deliberate breathing,
said the master.
Meditation
This art is not a branch of
kung fu, nor does it stem from
karate, aikido, judo or any of

the action-oriented martial arts
to which Americans are accus
tomed. Rather, most of the
above practices were born of
tai chi itself, including trans
cendental meditation.
Tai chi, as a total art, is a form
of self-discipline and self
defense which has its founda
tion in the 2000-year-old
philosophy of Yin and Vang
from the "Book of l-Ching"
(Changes). Its goal is to attain
physical, emotional and men
tal health through an extraor
dinary control of mind, brea
thing and body movement.
Tsuei considers himself "a
friend of tai chi," having
traveled half the globe spread
ing its practice, during and
since the Sino-Japanese con
flict in 1931. Tsuei describes
the significance of the Taoist or
tai chi circle symbol as it relates
to his particular form of exer
cise:
"This Circle contains two
equal parts of an even balance
of all opposites: The dark part
— the Yin, negative and
feminine, softness and inactiv
ity; the light part — the Yang,
positive and masculine, firm
ness and activity. Sometimes
there is a small black circle in
the light part and a small light
circle in the dark part, which
means that everything includes
the opposite.
The whole
"The tai chi circle with both
halves in it represents the

whole, ... as in our move
ments of tai chi ch'uan: one
hand goes up, the other drops
down; one leg takes on the
weight, the other is empty;
while the arms move in circles
and the hands are continu
ously grasping the Yin and
Yang, like holding a ball.
Movement follows movement,
moving to its opposite con
tinuously and without end."
It all sounds very nice, but
how can action-oriented
Americans adapt to such a
philosophical form of condi
tioning? Definitely not a com
petitive sport, the tai chi doc
trine falls into the same categ
ory of individual activities as
jogging or weight training. Its
added appeal of emphasis

upon mental health and emo
tional clarity is actually similar
to that which was embodied in
the so-called "inner tennis
movement."
Tai chi may not seem like a
conventional answer to
academic stress, but Tsuei, at
age 51, is able to infect stu
dents with his own enthusiasm
in a variety of ways. His tai chi
prescription is tailor-made
to meet the needs he perceives
in the individuals who ap
proach him for training.
For example, he recom
mended breathing exercises
and specific tai chi movements
to ammeliorate the ailing voice
pattern and physical imbalance
of the writer of this story.

To demonstrate the power of
"ch'i," Twuei began to breath
through his diaphragm. He
pointed to the "field of elixir"
or tan tien, about two inches
below his navel, designating its
alternating fullness and cavity,
and repeated in broken En-

glish, "Baby . . . baby brea
thing . . . breathe like baby
breathe. .
Soon, by applying one's
hands to his right thigh as he
indicated, one could feel the
thigh expanding.
The same enlargement, in
rhythm with his deep inhaling
and exhaling, was later ob
served in his calves and his
lower arms. The exaggerted
pulsation appeared to be more
than a simple muscle contrac
tion. The precise nature of ch'i
is a medical mystery even to
Tsuei.
The master does insist that
"proper diaphragmatic brea
thing will stimulate blood cir

culation, speed up the process
of metabolism and improve the
assimilation of oxygen, which
in turn brings harmony to

transforming tension into
energy, a means passed down
from the Vang family of ancient
China, said Tsuei. One of the
essential components is the
source of the energy.
Tsuei calls it "ch'i" (like the
"ki" in aikido), and he labels it

"the lifegiving force." This
mysterious "ch'i," related to
breathing is said to develop
once the 127 tai chi movements
are mastered and performed
with a high degree of concent
ration and deliberate breathing,
said the master.
Meditation
This art is not a branch of
kung fu, nor does it stem from
karate, aikido, judo or any of

the action-oriented martial arts
to which Americans are accus
tomed. Rather, most of the
above practices were born of
tai chi itself, including trans
cendental meditation.
Tai chi, as a total art, is a form
of self-discipline and self
defense which has its founda
tion in the 2000-year-old
philosophy of Yin and Vang
from the "Book of l-Ching"
(Changes). Its goal is to attain
physical, emotional and men
tal health through an extraor
dinary control of mind, brea
thing and body movement.
Tsuei considers himself "a
friend of tai chi," having
traveled half the globe spread
ing its practice, during and
since the Sino-Japanese con
flict in 1931. Tsuei describes
the significance of the Taoist or
tai chi circle symbol as it relates
to his particular form of exer
cise:
"This Circle contains two
equal parts of an even balance
of all opposites: The dark part
— the Yin, negative and
feminine, softness and inactiv
ity; the light part — the Yang,
positive and masculine, firm
ness and activity. Sometimes
there is a small black circle in
the light part and a small light
circle in the dark part, which
means that everything includes
the opposite.
The whole
"The tai chi circle with both
halves in it represents the

whole, ... as in our move
ments of tai chi ch'uan: one
hand goes up, the other drops
down; one leg takes on the
weight, the other is empty;
while the arms move in circles
and the hands are continu
ously grasping the Yin and
Yang, like holding a ball.
Movement follows movement,
moving to its opposite con
tinuously and without end."
It all sounds very nice, but
how can action-oriented
Americans adapt to such a
philosophical form of condi
tioning? Definitely not a com
petitive sport, the tai chi doc
trine falls into the same categ
ory of individual activities as
jogging or weight training. Its
added appeal of emphasis

upon mental health and emo
tional clarity is actually similar
to that which was embodied in
the so-called "inner tennis
movement."
Tai chi may not seem like a
conventional answer to
academic stress, but Tsuei, at
age 51, is able to infect stu
dents with his own enthusiasm
in a variety of ways. His tai chi
prescription is tailor-made
to meet the needs he perceives
in the individuals who ap
proach him for training.
For example, he recom
mended breathing exercises
and specific tai chi movements
to ammeliorate the ailing voice
pattern and physical imbalance
of the writer of this story.

To demonstrate the power of
"ch'i," Twuei began to breath
through his diaphragm. He
pointed to the "field of elixir"
or tan tien, about two inches
below his navel, designating its
alternating fullness and cavity,
and repeated in broken En-

glish, "Baby . . . baby brea
thing . . . breathe like baby
breathe. .
Soon, by applying one's
hands to his right thigh as he
indicated, one could feel the
thigh expanding.
The same enlargement, in
rhythm with his deep inhaling
and exhaling, was later ob
served in his calves and his
lower arms. The exaggerted
pulsation appeared to be more
than a simple muscle contrac
tion. The precise nature of ch'i
is a medical mystery even to
Tsuei.
The master does insist that
"proper diaphragmatic brea
thing will stimulate blood cir

culation, speed up the process
of metabolism and improve the
assimilation of oxygen, which
in turn brings harmony to
glandular and nervous sys
tems."
Citing the value of tai chi, of
"the supreme ultimate," Tsuei

draws an analogy to our local
lifestyle:
"Imagine getting on to a
freeway, where you can't slow
down. Even once you get off
that freeway you are still go
mg. . . going. . . going. . ."
Tsuei's claim is that tai chi
provides the perfect formula
for mental relief and physical
control, things even Stanford
students could use once in a
while.
Tsuei has 400-500 students in
the Bay Area. He will de
monstrate his tai chi at 3 p.m.
Sunday at the Chinese Com
munity Center, 3065
Middlefield.

Its goal is to attain physical, emotional
and mental health through control of
mind, breathing and body movement.
Tsuei believes the art relieves tension in
the body and provides mental calm, br
inging the body into harmony with itself.
