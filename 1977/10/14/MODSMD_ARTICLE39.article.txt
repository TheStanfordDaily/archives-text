Carter to protect energy plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter plans
to move quickly and personally to protest his
embattled energy program from an oil and gas
industry he compares to potential war pro
fiteers.
In a nationally broadcast news conference
yesterday, Carter said he feared industry ef
forts to end federal controls that regulate fuel
prices could turn into "the biggest ripoff in
history."
Because of a major assault in the Senate
against his top-priority energy legislation, "I
am going to devote most of my time the next
few weeks . . . trying to make sure we have a
fair and adequate energy package."
Asked why he has not threatened to break
up oil companies through divestiture to club
them into his camp, Carter said, "I am not
trying to threaten anybody or use a club."
Carter also said that despite strong opposi
tion he sees no reason to rewrite the Panama
Canal treaty. But he acknowledged that it may
be necessary to clarify the pact's security pro
visions to win Senate ratification.
Carter said that a statement probably would
be issued after his scheduled meeting here
today with Panama's leader, Gen. Omar Tor
rijos, "to make sure we have a common ag
reement on what the treaty means."
Gunmen hijack Lufthansa plane
Larnaca, Cyprus — Gunmen demanding the
"release of all comrades detained in West
German prisons" hijacked a Lufthansa jetliner
with 92 persons aboard yesterday, refueled in
Rome and on Cyprus, and then flew if to Bah
rain*
The Larnaca control tower said the two
engine Boeing 737 was permitted to land on
the island emirate in the Persian Gulf at 3:52
a.m. today (8:52 p.m. EDT yesterday), three
hours after it left here.
The jet had passed over Lebanon, Syria, Iraq
and Kuwait, raising speculation in each coun
try it would try to land there. Kuwaiti au
thorities said the pilot made a pass at their
airport, which was blocked to prevent it from
landing, then continued on toward Bahrain.
A special Lufthansa relief plane touched
down at Larnaca early today. Airport officials
said it had 52 persons on board, including a
backup crew for the hijacked plane and sec
urity and medical personnel.
The 737 was commandeered over the French

Riviera by at least two men who pulled guns on
the pilot. The plane had left the Spanish island
of Mallorca on a scheduled flight to Frankfurt.
3 Americans win Nobel prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Three Americans,
pioneers in the study of hormones and their
effects on the human body, won the 1977
Nobel prize for medicine yesterday.
The award went to Rosalvn Yalow, Roger
Guillemin and Andrew Schally, and brought to
five the number of American prize winners in
this year's competition so far. The prize for
economics will be announced today.
Yalow, 56, of the Veterans Administration
Hospital in The Bronx, N.Y., is the second
woman to win the medicine prize, and the first
in three decades.
The New York-born mother of two children
won half the $145,000 award for research in
endocrinology, the study of glands and the
hormones they produce, and for development
of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.
"This was pioneering work of the highest
level. It had enormous impact," said the
awarding faculty, the Royal Caroline Institute
of Medicine in Stockholm.
The other half of the 1977 prize for medicine
was shared by Guillemin, 53, dean of the Salk
Institute in San Diego, Calif., and Schally, 50,
of the Veterans Administration Hospital in
New Orleans, La.
In independent research over the past two
decades, the French-born Guillemin and the
Polish-born Schally, arrived at similar results in
competitive studies of peptide hormone pro
duction of the brain.
Congress continues aid debate
Washington — Congress gave itself more
time yesterday to resolve lengthy disputes
over abortion and foreign aid without cutting
off benefits for welfare recipients and
paychecks for thousands of federal workers.
The House and Senate, moving quickly,
each passed by voice vote a continuing resolu
tion to provide salaries and operating money
through Oct. 31 for the departments of Labor
and Health, Education and Welfareand related
agencies.
The resolution must be signed by President
Jimmy Carter to take effect.
The Labor-HEWappropriations bill has been
held up because of a dispute over use of fed
eral money to pay for abortions for poor wo
men. The money for foreign aid programs has

been held up mainly by a dispute over aid to
seven nations, although that point apparently
has been settled.
In addition to covering the Labor and HEW
departments, the resolution passed by Con
gress covers operations and salaries for the
foreign aid program and the federal contribu
tion to the District of Columbia government.
In all cases the money will be provided at the
same spending rate as in fiscal year 1977, which
ended Sept. 30.
The agencies involved have technically been
without money since then. Officials had plan
ned to continue assistance programs like wel
fare and unemployment benefits indefinitely
and experts say the lack of new funds caused
minimal disruptions in providing services.
Carter refutes import quotas
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
the steel industry yesterday that he won't im
pose the import quotas it wants to boost sag
ging profits because there is no such "simplis
tic, quick or painless solution" to the indus
try's problems.
"We can't afford to erect barriers around our
nation," the president declared.
But he said "free trade has to be fair trade"
and noted that laws against the dumping of

foreign goods on the American market at far
below production costs "have not been vigor
ously enforced."
"I have not been aware of this derogation of
duty until just this week," the president said.
"We're going to do something about it. . .but
we need your help."
Carter spoke to a White House meeting of
steel executives, members of Congress, union
leaders and representatives of environmental
and consumer groups concerned about flag
ging steel sales and closing plants.
The president indicated the administration
might decide to take additional legal action
against foreign producers accused of dumping
their steel in this country.
The Treasury already has held that five
Japanese producers illegally dumped carbon
steel products in the U.S. market at prices 24
per cent below production costs.
If the International Trade Commission de
termines that U.S. industry was harmed, pen
alty duties can be ordered on the imported
products.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except patchy fog near
coast night and morning. Lows 50s. Highs mid
70s and 80s except in upper 60s near the coast.

"We can't afford to erect barriers around our
nation," the president declared.
But he said "free trade has to be fair trade"
and noted that laws against the dumping of

foreign goods on the American market at far
below production costs "have not been vigor
ously enforced."
"I have not been aware of this derogation of
duty until just this week," the president said.
"We're going to do something about it. . .but
we need your help."
Carter spoke to a White House meeting of
steel executives, members of Congress, union
leaders and representatives of environmental
and consumer groups concerned about flag
ging steel sales and closing plants.
The president indicated the administration
might decide to take additional legal action
against foreign producers accused of dumping
their steel in this country.
The Treasury already has held that five
Japanese producers illegally dumped carbon
steel products in the U.S. market at prices 24
per cent below production costs.
If the International Trade Commission de
termines that U.S. industry was harmed, pen
alty duties can be ordered on the imported
products.

Carter to protect energy plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter plans
to move quickly and personally to protest his
embattled energy program from an oil and gas
industry he compares to potential war pro
fiteers.
In a nationally broadcast news conference
yesterday, Carter said he feared industry ef
forts to end federal controls that regulate fuel
prices could turn into "the biggest ripoff in
history."
Because of a major assault in the Senate
against his top-priority energy legislation, "I
am going to devote most of my time the next
few weeks . . . trying to make sure we have a
fair and adequate energy package."
Asked why he has not threatened to break
up oil companies through divestiture to club
them into his camp, Carter said, "I am not
trying to threaten anybody or use a club."
Carter also said that despite strong opposi
tion he sees no reason to rewrite the Panama
Canal treaty. But he acknowledged that it may
be necessary to clarify the pact's security pro
visions to win Senate ratification.
Carter said that a statement probably would
be issued after his scheduled meeting here
today with Panama's leader, Gen. Omar Tor
rijos, "to make sure we have a common ag
reement on what the treaty means."
Gunmen hijack Lufthansa plane
Larnaca, Cyprus — Gunmen demanding the
"release of all comrades detained in West
German prisons" hijacked a Lufthansa jetliner
with 92 persons aboard yesterday, refueled in
Rome and on Cyprus, and then flew if to Bah
rain*
The Larnaca control tower said the two
engine Boeing 737 was permitted to land on
the island emirate in the Persian Gulf at 3:52
a.m. today (8:52 p.m. EDT yesterday), three
hours after it left here.
The jet had passed over Lebanon, Syria, Iraq
and Kuwait, raising speculation in each coun
try it would try to land there. Kuwaiti au
thorities said the pilot made a pass at their
airport, which was blocked to prevent it from
landing, then continued on toward Bahrain.
A special Lufthansa relief plane touched
down at Larnaca early today. Airport officials
said it had 52 persons on board, including a
backup crew for the hijacked plane and sec
urity and medical personnel.
The 737 was commandeered over the French

Riviera by at least two men who pulled guns on
the pilot. The plane had left the Spanish island
of Mallorca on a scheduled flight to Frankfurt.
3 Americans win Nobel prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Three Americans,
pioneers in the study of hormones and their
effects on the human body, won the 1977
Nobel prize for medicine yesterday.
The award went to Rosalvn Yalow, Roger
Guillemin and Andrew Schally, and brought to
five the number of American prize winners in
this year's competition so far. The prize for
economics will be announced today.
Yalow, 56, of the Veterans Administration
Hospital in The Bronx, N.Y., is the second
woman to win the medicine prize, and the first
in three decades.
The New York-born mother of two children
won half the $145,000 award for research in
endocrinology, the study of glands and the
hormones they produce, and for development
of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.
"This was pioneering work of the highest
level. It had enormous impact," said the
awarding faculty, the Royal Caroline Institute
of Medicine in Stockholm.
The other half of the 1977 prize for medicine
was shared by Guillemin, 53, dean of the Salk
Institute in San Diego, Calif., and Schally, 50,
of the Veterans Administration Hospital in
New Orleans, La.
In independent research over the past two
decades, the French-born Guillemin and the
Polish-born Schally, arrived at similar results in
competitive studies of peptide hormone pro
duction of the brain.
Congress continues aid debate
Washington — Congress gave itself more
time yesterday to resolve lengthy disputes
over abortion and foreign aid without cutting
off benefits for welfare recipients and
paychecks for thousands of federal workers.
The House and Senate, moving quickly,
each passed by voice vote a continuing resolu
tion to provide salaries and operating money
through Oct. 31 for the departments of Labor
and Health, Education and Welfareand related
agencies.
The resolution must be signed by President
Jimmy Carter to take effect.
The Labor-HEWappropriations bill has been
held up because of a dispute over use of fed
eral money to pay for abortions for poor wo
men. The money for foreign aid programs has

been held up mainly by a dispute over aid to
seven nations, although that point apparently
has been settled.
In addition to covering the Labor and HEW
departments, the resolution passed by Con
gress covers operations and salaries for the
foreign aid program and the federal contribu
tion to the District of Columbia government.
In all cases the money will be provided at the
same spending rate as in fiscal year 1977, which
ended Sept. 30.
The agencies involved have technically been
without money since then. Officials had plan
ned to continue assistance programs like wel
fare and unemployment benefits indefinitely
and experts say the lack of new funds caused
minimal disruptions in providing services.
Carter refutes import quotas

The House and Senate, moving quickly,
each passed by voice vote a continuing resolu
tion to provide salaries and operating money
through Oct. 31 for the departments of Labor
and Health, Education and Welfareand related
agencies.
The resolution must be signed by President
Jimmy Carter to take effect.
The Labor-HEWappropriations bill has been
held up because of a dispute over use of fed
eral money to pay for abortions for poor wo
men. The money for foreign aid programs has

been held up mainly by a dispute over aid to
seven nations, although that point apparently
has been settled.
In addition to covering the Labor and HEW
departments, the resolution passed by Con
gress covers operations and salaries for the
foreign aid program and the federal contribu
tion to the District of Columbia government.
In all cases the money will be provided at the
same spending rate as in fiscal year 1977, which
ended Sept. 30.
The agencies involved have technically been
without money since then. Officials had plan
ned to continue assistance programs like wel
fare and unemployment benefits indefinitely
and experts say the lack of new funds caused
minimal disruptions in providing services.
Carter refutes import quotas
Washington — President Jimmy Carter told
the steel industry yesterday that he won't im
pose the import quotas it wants to boost sag
ging profits because there is no such "simplis
tic, quick or painless solution" to the indus
try's problems.
"We can't afford to erect barriers around our
nation," the president declared.
But he said "free trade has to be fair trade"
and noted that laws against the dumping of

foreign goods on the American market at far
below production costs "have not been vigor
ously enforced."
"I have not been aware of this derogation of
duty until just this week," the president said.
"We're going to do something about it. . .but
we need your help."
Carter spoke to a White House meeting of
steel executives, members of Congress, union
leaders and representatives of environmental
and consumer groups concerned about flag
ging steel sales and closing plants.
The president indicated the administration
might decide to take additional legal action
against foreign producers accused of dumping
their steel in this country.
The Treasury already has held that five
Japanese producers illegally dumped carbon
steel products in the U.S. market at prices 24
per cent below production costs.
If the International Trade Commission de
termines that U.S. industry was harmed, pen
alty duties can be ordered on the imported
products.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except patchy fog near
coast night and morning. Lows 50s. Highs mid
70s and 80s except in upper 60s near the coast.
Carter to protect energy plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter plans
to move quickly and personally to protest his
embattled energy program from an oil and gas
industry he compares to potential war pro
fiteers.
In a nationally broadcast news conference
yesterday, Carter said he feared industry ef
forts to end federal controls that regulate fuel
prices could turn into "the biggest ripoff in
history."
Because of a major assault in the Senate
against his top-priority energy legislation, "I
am going to devote most of my time the next
few weeks . . . trying to make sure we have a
fair and adequate energy package."
Asked why he has not threatened to break
up oil companies through divestiture to club
them into his camp, Carter said, "I am not
trying to threaten anybody or use a club."
Carter also said that despite strong opposi
tion he sees no reason to rewrite the Panama
Canal treaty. But he acknowledged that it may
be necessary to clarify the pact's security pro
visions to win Senate ratification.
Carter said that a statement probably would
be issued after his scheduled meeting here
today with Panama's leader, Gen. Omar Tor
rijos, "to make sure we have a common ag
reement on what the treaty means."
Gunmen hijack Lufthansa plane
Larnaca, Cyprus — Gunmen demanding the
"release of all comrades detained in West
German prisons" hijacked a Lufthansa jetliner
with 92 persons aboard yesterday, refueled in
Rome and on Cyprus, and then flew if to Bah
rain*
The Larnaca control tower said the two
engine Boeing 737 was permitted to land on
the island emirate in the Persian Gulf at 3:52
a.m. today (8:52 p.m. EDT yesterday), three
hours after it left here.
The jet had passed over Lebanon, Syria, Iraq
and Kuwait, raising speculation in each coun
try it would try to land there. Kuwaiti au
thorities said the pilot made a pass at their
airport, which was blocked to prevent it from
landing, then continued on toward Bahrain.
A special Lufthansa relief plane touched
down at Larnaca early today. Airport officials
said it had 52 persons on board, including a
backup crew for the hijacked plane and sec
urity and medical personnel.
The 737 was commandeered over the French

Riviera by at least two men who pulled guns on
the pilot. The plane had left the Spanish island
of Mallorca on a scheduled flight to Frankfurt.
3 Americans win Nobel prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Three Americans,
pioneers in the study of hormones and their
effects on the human body, won the 1977
Nobel prize for medicine yesterday.
The award went to Rosalvn Yalow, Roger
Guillemin and Andrew Schally, and brought to
five the number of American prize winners in
this year's competition so far. The prize for
economics will be announced today.
Yalow, 56, of the Veterans Administration
Hospital in The Bronx, N.Y., is the second
woman to win the medicine prize, and the first
in three decades.
The New York-born mother of two children
won half the $145,000 award for research in
endocrinology, the study of glands and the
hormones they produce, and for development
of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.
"This was pioneering work of the highest
level. It had enormous impact," said the
awarding faculty, the Royal Caroline Institute
of Medicine in Stockholm.
The other half of the 1977 prize for medicine
was shared by Guillemin, 53, dean of the Salk
Institute in San Diego, Calif., and Schally, 50,
of the Veterans Administration Hospital in
New Orleans, La.
In independent research over the past two
decades, the French-born Guillemin and the
Polish-born Schally, arrived at similar results in
competitive studies of peptide hormone pro
duction of the brain.
