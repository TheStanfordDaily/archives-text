The SOC slate came close to
sweeping last night's ASSU Senate
elections with six undergraduate
SOC members elected as first
senators and four undergraduates
elected as alternates in the unofficial
results released by Elections Com
missioner Sean Murphy.
In the graduate elections all six
SOC members were voted in as
senators.
With a record 3306 students voting
in the election, Tom McCormack
came in number one with 999 votes.
"That's an incredible amount,"
said Senate Chairman Pat Flinn.
"That means at least one in three
undergraduates voting voted for
him," Murphy said.
Fee Assessments results were not
completed last night because of lack
of time. However, "with about 1000
ballots already tabulated, both were
well ahead and enough people had

certainly voted to certify" the as
sessments, added Murphy.
Paid ballot counters worked from
about 3 p.m. to midnight counting
ballots, subtotaling votes tor indi
vidual candidates and making the
final count, all by hand.
"A double check was made of all
computations," Murphy said.
Between one tenth and one quar
ter of one per cent was the amount of
error allowed for every 100 ballots,
Murphy added.
"That's an acceptable amount of
slippage in a hand count," he said.
However, last night's election re
sults are "incomplete," Murphy ad
ded. The overseas campus results,
expected sometime today, "may af
fect results."
"What we got back tonight is in
complete and there is no way around
it."
Murphy said he hopes to be able to
add the overseas totals to the campus
vote sometime today or over the
weekend and present the results at
the first meeting of the Senate on
Thursday.
"The first order of business" for
the Senate is to certify the results of
the election, Murphy said. The se
nate chairman will be elected there
after.
"Certification is generally a formal
ity, but the Senate does have the
power not to certify," said Greg Lar
son, ASSU co-president. "There is
definitely an incentive there for them
to certify the results," Larson added.
The election turnout was "huge,"
Murphy said. In contrast to the 2889
students who voted last year, 3306
voted this week. About 2686 under
graduates and 620 graduate students
turned in ballots.
Graduate senators compiled vote
totals ranging from 100 to 200. Usu
ally, 100 votes for a graduate candi
date will virtually assure a startling

first place finish," said ASSU Co-
President Steve Westly Tuesday
night.
Elections tor Student Conduct
Legislative Council members were
not held. However, Flinn said Wed
nesday that it isn't anticipated that
the SCLC will meet this quarter.
