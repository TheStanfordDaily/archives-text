Plans for a $1 million Stanford
Hospital nursery renovation are cur
rently in the engineering and design
stages, a Medical Center spokesman
announced yesterday.
lames McNally, director of
facilities tor the Medical Center, said
finalized plans for the neo-natal nur
sery renovation should go before the
Board of Trustees in December.
Construction is planned to begin in
late spring 1978.
The nursery, located on the third
floor of the East Nursing Wing of the
Medical Center, currently holds 18
bassinets and occupies 3600 square
feet of floor space.
Renovation plans call for "demoli
tion and rebuilding" of the nursery,
with the new facility housing 25 bas
sinets and occupying 4700 square
feet.
"We plan to supply the nursery
with improved equipment and
technology, a blood-gas lab, offices
and a conference room, McNallv
said. "The center currently has suffi
cient staff for the planned nursery, so
there will be no new hiring of per
sonnel."
The nursery is an intensive care
unit for infants. Critically ill newborn
infants who cannot be treated in the
normal maternity department are
taken to this area.
The nursery serves as a referral
point for various medical centers in
northern California, according to
McNally. Infants are transported
here tor immediate treatment.
"We've had many infants deli
vered to us by helicopter," McNally
said. There are many hospitals in
California that cannot provide the
needed treatment for the infants. We
have found the nurserv frequently
has an overcensus of infant patients.
The expansion is a necessity for Stan
ford Medical Center."
