# In Columbia riot trial
## Weatherman plea-bargains 
### 
New York (AP) — In a deal with the
prosecution, Mark Rudd, the student
firebrand who became a fugitive
leader of the radical Weather Under
ground, pleaded guilty to a mis
demeanor, and went free yesterday
for his part in the 1968 student rioting
at Columbia University.
He still faces felony charges in
Chicago, however, stemming from
the 1969 street demonstrations that
became known as the "Days of
Rage." He is free without bail in the
case there.
Rudd, now 30, surfaced a month
ago after seven years as a fugitive.

He has not explained where he was
in those years, and he has kept silent
to the public about his feelings since
he came out of hiding. He main
tained that silence yesterday.
When he reappeared from hiding,
Rudd was quickly charged with crim
inal trespass in the Columbia student
uprising, and bail-jumping and
obstruction of government administ
ration in its aftermath. All are mis
demeanors carrying a total maximum
jail sentence of 27 months.
However, Dist. Atty. Robert
Morgenthau made a deal whereby
Rudd pleaded guilty only to criminal
trespass, while the other two charges
were dropped.
Rudd then faced a maximum sen
tence of 90 days, or a $1000 fine. But
Criminal Court Judge Milton Wil
liams set the defendant free, after
Asst. Dist. Atty. Nancy Ryan said his
action had the "consent and ac
quiescence" of her office.
Rudd never has publicly revealed
details of his fugitive travels through
the Weather Underground. Four
teen of its members still are sought.
The Columbia University uprising
was sparked by the Students for a
Democratic Society, of which Rudd
was a leader. That group sub
sequently split into factions, one of
which became the Weather Under
ground, a tight and secret group that
took to violent action and Marxist
rhetoric.
In 1969, when the SDS split, Rudd
became one of the original leaders of

the clandestine Weather Under
ground. He jumped bail and disap
peared the following year.
The Weather Underground has
claimed responsibility for a variety ot
violent acts of political sabotage.
Rudd was the object of an inten
sive FBI search during his years as a
fugitive. But he surrendered on his
own initiative Sept. 14.
