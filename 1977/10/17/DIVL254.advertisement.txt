COME TO WORK
FOR AMERICA
Are they starting the revolution without you? The
Peace Corps and VIST A are not about to revolt, but a
lot of changes are being made. For the last few years,
for instance, Peace Corps became something of an
elitist organization. If you didn't have a master's or
Ph.D., or at least a bachelor's in a very special discip
line, you could practically forget it.
No longer. While there's still a place for the highly
educated or experienced, today's Peace Corps and
VISTA are looking for more. Primarily, they're looking
for dedicated and motivated self starters. And a
sense of understanding and compasssion for the
poor and the powerless, plus an interest in social
change, will help, too.
Stanford students will have a chance to learn first
hand about the new Peace Corps and VISTA this
week. Recruiters will be at White Plaza all week from
10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily. In addition, particularly
for Stanford seniors and graduate students who de
sire in-depth interviews, they'll be headquartered at
the Career Planning and Placement Center on Mon
day and Tuesday, Oct. 17 and 18. Interested stu
dents should try to sign up in advance for these
interviews.
The recruiters also plan to show a variety of Peace
Corps and VISTA films. They may be seen on Tues
day, Oct. 18, continuously from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
at Room 132, Tresidder Hall.
Peace Corps/VISTA. Come to work for America.
