# 'Joy of Fixing' draws 200
## 
### Elvira Pelaez 
Fixing things helps one to keep
his senses in this relatively insane
world, said William Leland, direc
tor of the Action Research Liason
Office during a talk held here
Saturday as part of the Joy of Fix
ing — A Day-Long Fair Devoted to
Repair.
Leland's talk, entitled "Personal
Freedom Through Fixing," was
one of five which, along with
workshops and booths, made up
the program for the fair.
The fair, sponsored by the
Alumni Association and held at
Bishop Auditorium, drew 200 per
sons, a figure which "surprised"
Marion Player, program director
for the Continuing Education sec
tion of the association.
She said about 56 per cent of
those pre-registered were wo
men, but Player said that figure
was below what she had ex
pected.
"A lot of women held back . . .
because they haven't been
brought up to do this (fix things),"

she said.
But seeing the results of fixing
something quickly is satisfying,
she said. "It makes your children
think you're really hot stuff."
Fixing is "working with
energy," Leland said. "One needs
to tune in to that energy," to be
able to work with it.
Leland said he and a partner
spent a year building a three
domed house. Each dome is 15
feet high and is constructed to use
solar energy to heat the house.
Leland spoke of the psychic re
wards of being self-reliant in a
"technologically specialized soci
ety" as part of his talk.
Other talks included:
—"Fear of Fixing" by Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. James Ada
ms and Harold Leavitt, Walter
Kenneth Kilpatrick Professor of
Organizational Behavior and
Psychology at the Business
School.
—"How I Learned to Love Re
pair: Vignettes from Experience"

by Assoc. Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Robert Piziali, Asst. Sociol
ogy Prof. Gerald Talley, and Med
ical School Clinical Anesthesia
Prof. Charles Whitcher.
—"The Art of Fixing" by Art
Prof. Keith Boyle, and
—"Where Do You Go From
Here. . .theJoy of Fixing!"by the
persons who conducted the ear
lier talks.
For2'/2 hours after lunch, work
shops were set up dealing with
repair of bikes, cars, motorcycles
and household appliances,
among others.
Registration for the event was
$10.
Player said she was happy and
surprised at the media response
to the event.
According to Player, News
week, the New York Times, and a
large number of local newspapers
covered the event.
Player said that, despite a good
response, she doubted the event
would be repeated.

Fixing things helps one to keep
his senses in this relatively insane
world, said William Leland, direc
tor of the Action Research Liason
Office during a talk held here
Saturday as part of the Joy of Fix
ing — A Day-Long Fair Devoted to
Repair.
Leland's talk, entitled "Personal
Freedom Through Fixing," was
one of five which, along with
workshops and booths, made up
the program for the fair.
The fair, sponsored by the
Alumni Association and held at
Bishop Auditorium, drew 200 per
sons, a figure which "surprised"
Marion Player, program director
for the Continuing Education sec
tion of the association.
She said about 56 per cent of
those pre-registered were wo
men, but Player said that figure
was below what she had ex
pected.
"A lot of women held back . . .
because they haven't been
brought up to do this (fix things),"

she said.
But seeing the results of fixing
something quickly is satisfying,
she said. "It makes your children
think you're really hot stuff."
Fixing is "working with
energy," Leland said. "One needs
to tune in to that energy," to be
able to work with it.
Leland said he and a partner
spent a year building a three
domed house. Each dome is 15
feet high and is constructed to use
solar energy to heat the house.
Leland spoke of the psychic re
wards of being self-reliant in a
"technologically specialized soci
ety" as part of his talk.
Other talks included:
—"Fear of Fixing" by Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. James Ada
ms and Harold Leavitt, Walter

Organizational Behavior and
Psychology at the Business
School.
