# Johnson offers Afro-Jazz dance class

Watching Rodney Johnson
do some modern jazz steps is
like watching a panther jump
ing on its prey. There is no
wasted movement and the ex
citement generated seems
boundless.
And when Johnson speaks
about the modern Afro-Black
American jazz dance class he
teaches each Monday night, he
fairly glows with enthusiasm.
"I calj the class Beginning
Modern Afro-Jazz. It incorpo
rates contemporary Black
American dance and African
dance. Modern dance tends to
extend some of the more de
fined African movements,"
said Johnson.
Johnson, his trim, muscular
torso at ease on a Lagunita din
ing hall chair, said he would
also like to teach some isola
tion movements.
Isolation movements
"Isolation means moving
only certain parts of the body,
like the head or shoulders, in
syncopation," he explained.
"It's possible to isolate two
parts of the body and move
them in two different rhythms.
It is extremely difficult to move
them alone and nothing else,"

he said as he adroitly swayed
his shoulders and head in
exactly two different rhythms.
Teaching a class from 8:30 to
10 p.m. in Ujamaa lounge this
quarter was a natural spin-off
from the informal choreog
raphy and body movement
session he gave at the Stanford
campus in Cliveden, England
this summer.
"We used to meet three
times a week, from 5:30 to 6:30
(in the evenings). There were
about 10 people in the class.
They told me that I had to offer
the same thing here, too," said
Johnson, with a modest smile.
First try
His first taste of contempor
ary jazz dance came during fall
quarter of his freshman year.
"It was an African-Haitian
dance class taught by Janice
Miller here at Stanford," said
Johnson. "I just went to sit it on
it, see what it was all about.
Then I got up, took off my

shoes and gave it a try. I told
myself, 'Maybe I'll come
again.' " And he hasn't stop
ped dancing since.
Winter quarter of his
freshman year, he participated
in the dance production,
"Evolution of Black Dance"
which featured traditional Afri
can dance, the cakewalk of
American plantation origin,
the jitterbug and jive of the
Harlem renaissance, the '60s
twist, pony and walking-the
dog and today's disco move
ments.
Johnson also studied some
jazz in Hollywood, San Fran
cisco and Oakland, partici
pated in the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre production of
"Pearly," and the spring pro
duction of "Carmen Jones,"
and "Out of Shadows" by the
Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts.
"I'd like to do a production

this spring called 'Sound
track,' " said Johnson. He said
it would be original interpreta
tions to music from plays, mus
icals and films.
The senior International
Relations/African-Afro Ameri
can Studies major said he
would like to study culture and
dance in Haiti or Jamaica.
"So much of Afro American
and African dancing stresses
the rhythm and the use of
music. Especially in Afro jazz,
the dancing is done for jazz.
The two (music and dance)
must come together.
"African dance is done to the
drum. The drum drives you
and you drive the drum.
There's the same trade-off in
contemporary jazz. The music
and dancer are challenging
each other."
In tune
Kathleen Sanders, who at
tends Johnson's body move
ment class in Ujamaa lounge

weekday mornings, said
Johnson "is enthusiastic and
good to follow. He teaches us
to stretch and do movements
across the floor. We put to
gether little dance steps into a
single dance number."
The morning class members,
grooving to Marvin Caye's
"I've Got to Give It Up," usu
ally end up cheering each
other on and applauding each
time a particularly snazzy step
is executed with due finesse.
Johnson said the steps he
teaches are those he picked up
from various shows and in
structors spiced with "a little of
my own touch and flavor."
"It's good to wake up to (an
exercise class)," said Sanders.
"I'm more in touch with my
body. It makes the day go bet
ter."
When one dances, "it's for
the music, you're doing it for
music," said Johnson. "You
just can't help but get into it."
