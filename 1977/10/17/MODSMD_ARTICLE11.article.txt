# Anti-business better than uncertainty
## Execs want econ policy 
### 
Hot Springs, Va. (AP) â€” Top
businessmen say the best thing
President Jimmy Carter could
do for the economy is spell out
a consistent economic prog
ram, even if it is anti-business.
"Markets can handle good
and bad news but not uncer
tainty," said Irving Shapiro,
chairman of the DuPont Co.
"Even if we don't agree with
the program, we'll know where
we're going."
At their tyvice-yearly meeting
this weekend, corporation
chairmen were not hostile to
Carter, the first Democratic
president in eight years. In
stead, the 120-member Busi
ness Council expressed confu
sion about the president's
economic plans.
"Business is looking for an
economic strategy, articulated
in a way we can understand it.
The market is not hearing
that," said Reginald jones,
chairman of General Electric
Co.
The Carter administration
has set targets of reducing un
employment from 6.9 per cent
to less than five per cent by
1981 and keeping economic
growth at five per cent next
year.
However, the businessmen
said that 9ince the economy
may not reach the targets, they
would like Carter to set out
concrete economic proposals,
as he has done on energy, to
meet his goals.
Administration officials

acknowledge that uncertainty
may be contributing to the
stock market's slide. But they
contend that uncertainty is in
evitable, given Carter's de
tailed programs on energy,
welfare and other issues.
"There is an awful lot on the
front burner," said Robert
Strauss, Carter's special trade
representative. "When you
seek progress, you must in
evitably create some uncer
tainty."
Part of the uncertainty at the
moment rests with Carter's tax
program, which is still being
worked out. The businessmen
said they favor a $22 billion tax
cut, about the size Carter is
considering. But they want a

permanent cut they can plan
for, rather than temporary
boosts for the economy.
Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.),
chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, told
the businessmen the legisla
tion will have to be trimmed to
such basics as tax simplifica
tion, capital formation and rate
reductions if it is to pass next
year.
Despite their dislike of the
uncertain economic climate,
businessmen had no com
plaints about their relationship
with the administration. Busi
ness Council representatives
were pleased with the recep
tion they received at a meeting
with Carter three weeks ago.
