# Schools sued for malpractice
## 
### 
Newark, N.J. (AP) â€” Malprac
tice suits, traditionally lodged
against doctors and lawyers,
are being filed against
educators in increasing num
bers as parents and students
seek compensation for impro
per and inadequate schooling.
Two education malpractice
suits are known in New Jersey
and there are similar cases in
New York and California.
The case of Thomas McNeil,
a tree trimmer from Map
lewood, is scheduled to be
heard next April in Superior
Court in Essex County.
The Garden State's other

educational malpractice suit
also is in Essex, involving a
Livingston couple suing the
school board for failing to clas
sify their neurologically
impaired 11-year-old son.
McNeil, who graduated from
Columbia High School in 1974,
claims failure by the
Maplewood-South Orange
school board to diagnose and
treat a reading disability that
has left him functionally illiter
ate and confined him to low
paying menial jobs.
Steven Eisdorfer, an attorney
at the Education Law Center
here, said the easiest educa

tion malpractice suits to argue
involve failing to identify a
specific handicap or failing to
place a student in the wrong
specialized class.
Suits against schools for fail
ing to provide enough know
ledge are more difficult to
prove because there are no
clear cut guidelines, even
though basic skills tests are
given in grades 3, 6, 9 and 11.
Under Eisdorfer's theory,
the New Jersey suits appear to
have some chance of succeed
ing, while the California and
New York suits dealing in
generalities have less chance.
