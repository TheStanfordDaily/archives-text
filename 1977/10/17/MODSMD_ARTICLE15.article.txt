# Bakke decision debated at Tresidder
## 
### Jon Levitow 
The controversy over the
"reverse discrimination" case
of Allan Bakke moved to a local
forum Friday as six persons
took to the podium to debate
issues of the case.
Speaking before a capacity
crowd at a Tresidder meeting
room, debaters discussed the

decision of the California Sup
reme Court to uphold a lower
court decision to admit Allan
Bakke to the medical school at
the University of California at
Davis (UCD.)
Bakke contended he was
denied admission to the school
because he was white, citing a
quota system which he said al
lows less qualified minorities
to be admitted.
Speakers favoring upholding
the California decision in
cluded Political Science Prof.
Robert Horn, law student
Doug Bandow and Contra
Costa Community College
Philosophy Prof. Pasquale
Anania.
United Stanford Employees
union member Lise Giraud,
law student and Revolutionary
Students Brigade member
Bruce Hamm and law student
)oe Acosta all spoke against
the California court decision.
ASSU Co-president Glenn
Jordan moderated the discus
sion.
Horn opened the debate say
ing that as a "question ... of
constitutional law," the Bakke

"question is a relatively narrow
one."
He said he believed his own
personal feelings and opinions
were immaterial in the dispute,
since the "most fundamental
constitutional rule" needing
support was that the "right to
equal protection under the law
is a personal, individual right."
criticized the UCD ad
mission system as a "stark, ab
solute, flat-out, racial and
ethnic quota, not a simple af
firmative action program."
Horn said "a decision for
Bakke would not destroy any
affirmative action programs"
and would not affect minority
admissions. He said this view is
shared by Wilson Riles, state
superintendent of schools.
Bandow echoed Horn's posi
tion that the Bakke decision
must be viewed as a legal,
rather than a social, question.
He also claimed that under the
UCD system, the "potential for
misuse is very great."
Anania said he felt the need
for affirmative action "for
anybody who is disadvan
taged." He said a "pernicious
amount of discrimination is
going on whilly-nilly all over
the U.S. and people are being
hurt by it," but that the "Uni
versity could not prove that it
did not discriminate against
Bakke because of his race."
Acosta argued that the Sup
reme Court is the "supreme
guardian of minority rights,"

and it must protect any class
which cannot protect itself.
He said "reverse discrimina
tion as a legal term is invalid.''
Bakke might have sued UCD
challenging age or geographi
cal distribution quotas, Acosta
said, but that Bakke knew such
a case would be dismissed.
Acosta said the "State of
California stands to win either
way" the case goes, for it will
either be able to re-evaluate its
affirmative action programs or
discard them entirely, which
he said "to people in the power
structure, ain't too bad."
Giraud called any relaxation
of effort in solving the in
equalities among races and the
sexes "law flying in the face of
justice." She also said there
was "no way" a pro-Bakke de
cision would not deal a mortal
blow to affirmative action-type
programs.
Hamm reaffirmed that "af
firmative action based on race
is absolutely necessary" and
spoke of a "critical need" for
minority professors, "over 50
per cent" of which return to
minority communities. He cal
led the Bakke case "an attack
on minorities to clear the way
for other attacks."
In the long question and
answer session following these
statements the panelists and
audience talked largely about
the condition of minority edu
with the wuny pnihlomn.
