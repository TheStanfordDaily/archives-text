# Long-gainers break Stanford
## Huskies subdue Cards, 45-21 
### David Georgette 
Seattle, Wash. — All season Stanford
coach Bill Walsh has been saying the Car
dinals lack overall team speed. Saturday
this deficiency was graphically illustrated
on the hard, damp artificial surface of
Husky Stadium.
"Every time I looked up, someone was
running in the endzone," said
Washington coach Don James.
And most of the time it was a purple
and-gold clad Washington Husky who was
doing the running as Washington stunned
Stanford in a Pacific-8 scoring orgy, 45-21.
The scoreboard fireworks were concen
trated during an 11 Vi-minute stretch of the
second half during which 49 points were
chalked up, 28 of them by the Huskies.
The biggest score came when halfback
Joe Steele took a pitchout from quarter
back Warren Moon, swept the Cardinal
right side and outran two Stanford defen
sive backs 83 yairds down the sideline for
six points. The play, executed almost
exactly as an offensive coach would diag
ram it on a chalkboard, pushed the Hus
kies to a 10-point advantage which they
never relinquished.
Cards too slow
"Our lack of speed hurt us," said Walsh,
"just like it did against UCLA."
The touchdown by Steele, who finished
with 177 yards on 29 carries, came on the
first play from scrimmage after the Huskies
had seen a 17-point lead masterfully disas
sembled by the passing of Cardinal quar
terback Guy Benjamin.
He passed on 36 of 46 plays in the sec
ond half, completing 23 for 310 yards, in
cluding three touchdown passes to James
Lofton. Benjamin just missed breaking the
collegiate record for most yards passing in
a half held by North Texas State's Steve
Ramsey who threw for 321 yards against
Southwest Louisiana in 1969.
"Guy played with great poise under ad
verse conditions," said Walsh. "When
things are clicking with him (Benjamin),"
said Husky defensive back Nesby Glas
gow, "he's the best of the best."
Benjamin started clicking when he got a
bottled-up Cardinal offensive going with a
5-for-5 performance for 70 yards in a de
termined, seven-play drive late in the third
quarter. The completions went to wide re
ceivers Bill Kellar and Lofton, with Lofton
scoring on a 10-yard pass.
Benjamin and Lofton collaborated again
on the first play of the fourth quarter for a
42-yard score to cap a 49-yard, six-play
drive after the Huskies had been backed
up in their own end.
Lofton and Kellar both ran fly patterns
from a slot right formation and Lofton

reached over Glasgow, an All-Pac-8 choice
last season, for the ball and the score.
Glasgow, the second-leading punt re
turner in the conference, got even with
the Cards three minutes later when he
gathered in an end-over-end punt by Brad
Fox, cut to his right behind a wall of bloc
kers and broke into the open for a 73-yard
touchdown.
"The ball was just ahead of the cover
age," said James. Glasgow said the key to
the return was "hesitating, sucking 'em to
the middle and then getting to the wall.
Once I got to the wall, I knew it was all
over."
But the scoring wasn't.
TD called back
After an apparent touchdown by Glas
gow on an interception return was nul
lified by a Husky personal foul, Benjamin
connected with Kellar on the right side for
26 yards. Two plays later Benjamin nailed
Lofton with a scoring pass fey the third
time — a 19-yard strike on a post pattern.
"Lofton's just too good," said James.
Lofton's 192 yards on 12 receptions set a
Stanford record for most yards receiving in
a game.
Three plays after the Huskies got the ball
back, lightning — in the form of fullback
Ron Gipson — struck again. Catching
Stanford in a blitz, Gipson broke through
the middle, veered to the left and galloped
59 yards for another Husky score.
The Huskies put an end to the scoring
onslaught on the next series when Stan
ford halfback Darrin Nelson was dropped
for no gain by tackle Dave Browning on a
fourth-and-two situation at the Husky 27.
Salt in the wound
The final Husky points — a 29-yard pass
interception return by Greg Grimes with
41 seconds left — merely gave the
Washington fans more reason to cheer the
Huskies' first win over Stanford since 1966.
"I was delighted to see our defense get
on the board twice," said James. "We are
doing the things we have to do."
In the first half, Stanford certainly didn't
do what it has to do to win. The Cards were
unable to get good gains on first down
and, faced with passing situations, were
unable to handle the Husky blitzes.
Benjamin had trouble setting up to pass
in the first half because he was backpedal
ling instead of taking his normal drop due
to an injury to his left knee from the Ore
gon game.
"He (Benjamin) wasn't getting himself
set to throw," said Walsh. "We weren't
picking up the blitzes well. We had our
receivers open all day."
At half, the Cardinals made adjustments
to handle the blitzes, and in the second

half Benjamin returned to his usual style of
dropping back — retreating sideways.
By the second half, the other element
hampering the Card offense was taken
care of, too. During the first half the artifi
cial surface was wet from a watering it re
ceived prior to the game. Lofton slipped a
few times while going for passes that in
most cases he would have caught.
But the Card most affected by the damp
surface was Nelson. He was held to 35
yards on 10 carries in the first half, and
ended up with 45 yards for the game.
Take to the air
But the reason the Cards got moving in
the second half was more than the dried
off field. "We just started throwing more,
that's all," said Lofton. "We figured out
exactly what we wanted to do," Walsh
said.
What Stanford did was use varied forma
tions to exploit the Husky defense.
In the first half, Stanford contained the
Husky offense, which consisted of Steele,
Cipson and Toussaint Tyler running bet
ween the tackles.
Steele contributed the most to establish
ing the Husky running game, carrying
eight times on a 10-play drive which gave
the Huskies their first score on a 26-yard
field goal by Steve Robbins.
The Huskies' big offensive play of the
first half came with under a minute left
when Robert "Spider" Caines broke open
on a post pattern for a 41-yard gain to the
Stanford seven. On the next play, Steele
swept night end and hurdled over a group
of Cardinal tacklers at the goal line.
The Huskies extended their lead in the
middle of the third quarter after escaping
from a dangerous situation.
The Huskies found themselves on their
1-yard line after the officials ruled Stanford
had downed a punt which appeared to go
into the end zone. The Huskies blasted
their way out of the hole, going the length
of the field in 14 plays.
Moon completed all four of his passes
on the drive, working over the outside of
the Cards' secondary.
"They were having big cushions on our
receivers," Moon said. The score came on
a 26-yard pass to Caines, who burned the
Cards' defensive backfield on a post from
the right side.
"Warren checked it off and called the
right play," said James. "We have confi
dence in Warren. We were throwing deep
in our own territory."
But it wasn't Moon's passing that made
the difference. As Kellar said, "They got
the big play — three in a row. They had
three big plays. You really can't do any
thing about that."
