# Bears snap 25-game win skein
## Cal stops Card poloists 
### Brad Brockbank 
After 25 straight wins without
a loss, the Stanford water polo
team was defeated by fired-up
California, 7-4, Friday in Ber
keley.
From the opening whistle
the Bears charged into control
taking a 2-1 lead at the end of
the first quarter. By the end of
the third quarter the Bears led
6-2 to the delight of the home
crowd.
In the final period the Cards
scored two goals but a shot by
Cal freshman Kevin Robertson
stopped the comeback effort.
"Cal played a good game,"
said Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti. "They did a good job

of shutting down (junior) Doug
Burke. They also played good
defense on the extra-man situ
ations and stopped our outside
shots. We missed a lot of scor
ing opportunities."
Kickouts also hurt the Cards
as junior Tom Angelo fouled
out before halftime and Burke
followed early in the fourth
period. Four of Cal's goals
came on man-up situations.
Junior Robby Arnold con
tinued his hot streak, scoring
two of Stanford's four goals.
Freshman John Gansel had
nine saves in the goal and
made two steals as well. Senior
Rick Johannsen, • who scored
the Cards' last goal of the

game, did so despite playing
most of the second half with
two kickout fouls charged to
him. One more would have put
him out of the game along with
Angelo and Burke.
The pool at Cal is smaller
than the Cards' home facility at
deGuerre and this presented
Stanford's poloists with prob
lems. Being a fast-breaking
team, the Cardsplay better in a
larger pool where they have
more room to swim.
Arnold, visibly upset after
the loss, had a simpler explana
tion for the defeat.
"We just didn't come ready
to play the game," he said.
The Cards face the Bears
again Nov. 19 at deGuerre be
fore the Big Game. Friday the
poloists travel south for games
with Long Beach State and UC-
Irvine.
