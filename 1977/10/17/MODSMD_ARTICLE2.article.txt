# Campus pizzeria to open soon
## 
### Ted Gioia 
After almost a year of planning, "La
Pizzeria," a project of Stanford's La
Casa Italiana, will soon be open to
the public. Oct. 22 has been set as a
tentative date for the grand opening.
"Of all the house projects we con
sidered," says Matt Cobb, "the idea
of a pizzeria seemed the most sensi
ble. It gives us an opportunity not
only to explore an important aspect
of Italian culture, but also allows us
to share it with the rest of the cam
pus.
"Consequently, what we're trying
to offer is not just a pizza but a bit of
Italian life," adds Cobb, who, serving

as fundraiser, employerand planner,
was instrumental in getting "La Piz
zeria" off the ground.
The layout and style of the pizzeria
will be important in giving it the ex
pected Italian atmosphere. The pizza
makers, as in Italy, will be in full view,
Italian-oriented entertainment will
be provided by house members and
all of the employes will be bilingual.
The most Italian element of all,
however, will probably be found in
the kitchen. Peter Witt, a student
here and the head cook, spent this
past summer as cook in a pizzeria in
Italy.
Helping him will be Jim Hartley,

who, during a recent trip to Italy,
studied pizza-making methods
throughout the country.
"House enthusiasm for 'La Piz
zeria' is high," says house fellow An
namaria Napolitano. "House mem
bers showed a good deal of determi
nation in overcoming the obstacles
in their way."
The main difficulty "La Pizzeria"
faced was purchasing a pizza oven
and having its installation approved.
"The problem with most ovens,"
says Witt, "is that they are unable to
sustain temperatures high enough
for making a good pizza."

Consequently, La Casa Italiana was
obliged to find a way to pay for their
$1600 pizza oven. Through donations
and loans from house members the
sum was finally collected. "Our
facilities now are excellent in every
way," Witt says.
" 'La Pizzeria' will be non-profit,"
Cobb says. "Any profits we make
will go back into the house."
"La Pizzeria" will be open on
Saturdays, probably from 5 p.m. until
midnight, and is expected to attract
much of its business from students
returning from the football games
and evening films.

however, will probably be found in
the kitchen. Peter Witt, a student
here and the head cook, spent this
past summer as cook in a pizzeria in
Italy.
Helping him will be Jim Hartley,

who, during a recent trip to Italy,
studied pizza-making methods
throughout the country.
"House enthusiasm for 'La Piz
zeria' is high," says house fellow An
namaria Napolitano. "House mem
bers showed a good deal of determi
nation in overcoming the obstacles
in their way."
The main difficulty "La Pizzeria"
faced was purchasing a pizza oven
and having its installation approved.
"The problem with most ovens,"
says Witt, "is that they are unable to
sustain temperatures high enough
for making a good pizza."

Consequently, La Casa Italiana was
obliged to find a way to pay for their
$1600 pizza oven. Through donations
and loans from house members the
sum was finally collected. "Our
facilities now are excellent in every
way," Witt says.
" 'La Pizzeria' will be non-profit,"
Cobb says. "Any profits we make
will go back into the house."
"La Pizzeria" will be open on
Saturdays, probably from 5 p.m. until
midnight, and is expected to attract
much of its business from students
returning from the football games
and evening films.
