# No. 1-rated Southern Cal sweeps spikers in three
## 
### Bill Burger 
Card volleyball coach Art
Lambert said before Friday
night's match that No.
1-ranked USC "might be a little
out of our league" at this point
of the season. Well, Lambert
could not have been more ac
curate in his assessment of the
matchup as the spikers lost
15-6,15-3,15-3, in a disappoint
ing showing.
Stanford got off to an in
spired start in the first game,
taking a 5-1 lead before the
sleeping Trojans reeled off
streaks of eight and six points,
interrupted by a lone Card
score, to win 15-6.
USC, which has not lost a
game all year, seldom gave
Stanford an opportunity to
score in the second game by
controlling the ball with sup
erbly placed serves on the way
to a 15-3 win.
Lambert summed up the
Cards' performance saying,
"We got served off the floor."
The Trojans brought only six
players to the match due to in
juries to two of the team's top
eight players. A junior varsity
reserve who was scheduled to
make the trip pulled a ham
string the night before the
match and did not make the
trip.
A serious injury to any of the
USC players would have forced
the team to forfeit the match.
These problems, though,
did not seem to daunt USC's

players all of whom are
freshmen and sophomores.
The third game was a carbon
copy of the second with the
Trojans dominating play on the
way to another 15-3 win.
Debbie Green, USC's setter
who made this month's cover
of Volleyball magazine, placed
her sets perfectly all night mak
ing her teammates' spikes
easier to drive home.
An unusual sight after the
match was the group of fans
around Green waiting for au
tographs from one of the coun
try's top players.
An understandably dis
turbed Lambert said, "They're
good, but not 12 points better
than we are.
"They (the Stanford players)
were awed by USC and they
shouldn't be. The players
didn't have a sense of intensity
and tenacity. When they do get
that, they'll give anyone a good
match."
USC assistant coach Dale
Flickinger said he had seen

several of Stanford's players
compete inTiigh school. "They
do have some good athletes
and they hit pretty well," said
Flickinger, "but I thought
they'd pass a little better than
they did."
Lambert concurred, saying,
"If you can't pass you can't set
the ball. And if you can't set
you'll never be able to hit it
well. And that's what hap
pened tonight."
But looking back on the
match, it was apparent that
USC's talented and experi
enced players were as much
the difference between the
two teams as was Stanford's
lack of "intensity."
All of the Trojan women have
been on the junior national
team and some have played on
the senior national team.
These facts make it no won
der that USC fields the best col
legiate team in the country. It is
also no wonder that USC
players are asked to sign autog
raphs after their matches.
