# Stanford booters win fourth straight

### Dean Eyre 
Modesto â€” In a well
matched confrontation Stan
ford held on to a 2-1 lead
Saturday to turn back a deter
mined Stanislaus soccer team.
The win, fourth in a row for the
Cards, lifted their season re
cord to 5-6-1.
Stanford kept possession of
the ball for most of the first
half, but was unable to break
through the tenacious Stanis
laus defense.
"It was a classic struggle,"
Stanford coach Nelson Lodge
said. "In the 0-0 first half we
played a controlling game, but
we were not scoring. We
penetrated their defense by
sending (Danny) McNevin
through, who scored the first
goal.
"Danny was our best player,
and scored the best goal of the
season," Lodge said.
The freshman striker logged
his fourth score of the season
eight minutes into the second
half.
"That felt great," McNevin
said. "When I hit it I knew it
was in because I got mobbed.
When I got the guy in a one
on-one, I faded one way and
went the other way and just
belted it."
Two minutes after McNe
vin's shot Mark Triska sent the
ball into the goal to put Stan
ford ahead 2-0.
Just as it appeared that Stan
ford had control of the game

Stanislaus came roaring back
with a different notion in mind.
Dave Harrison scored with an
assist from Marty McKinsey for
the final tally of the game.
Stanislaus coach Al Tasco
said, "I thought it was a very
exciting game; we had some
chances. If we had a little luck it
could very easily have been
3-2."
Bobby Bonaparte, Stanford
alum and member of last year's
soccer squad said, "I think
Stanford's victory was (due to)
the sterling defensive effort of
Greg Delgado, the goalkeep
ing of Craig Ueland, the offen
sive thrusts of Danny McNevin
and the overall cohesiveness of
team play."
The -fundamental errors
which cost the Cards earlier
games were nearly eliminated
against Stanislaus.
"It was our best game from a
tactical point of view," Lodge
said. "We were moving the
ball; we adjusted to the small
field. One of the things we
were doing poorly (at San
Francisco State's small field)
was jamming the ball through
the middle and strong side."
By taking the ball to the wings,
the Cards proved they had
learned from their mistakes.
In last Friday's soccer article
a goal by striker Jim Hines was
omitted.
Stafford travels to Sac
ramento State Tuesday for an 8
p.m. game.
