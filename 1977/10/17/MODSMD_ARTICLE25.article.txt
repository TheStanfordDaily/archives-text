# Scotchers beat Chico, fall to California
## 
### 
The Stanford field hockey
team rebounded from a 2-1 de
feat at the hands of California
Friday to down Chico State 2-0
Saturday. The scotchers'
weekend split makes them 2-1
in the Northern California In
tercollegiate Athletic Confer
ence.
"We have a group of women
developing very well," Stan
ford coach Barbara Longstreth
said, "and I felt we were ready
for Berkeley."
But the scrappy Cal team
capitalized on lapses in the
Cardinal defense to score
twice and pinned the first con
ference loss on Stanford.
"We were not functioning as
well as we should have,"
Longstreth said. "We lacked
concentration and allowed
them to get loose in the strik
ing circle."

The offense, like the de
fense, had problems. "We had
21 shots on goal but only one
wound up in the cage,"
Longstreth said.
Saturday Stanford had an
impressive first half scoring
two goals — one by Kelly Wes
terwick and the other by Alison
King — and allowing Chico
only 33 seconds of penetration
time within the Cardinal 25-
yard line.
"It was an extremely effec
tive half," Longstreth said of
the first stanza. "The second
half was not nearly as effective.
We have yet to put together
two good halves."
Buffy Berger recorded her
second shutout of the season.
The scotchers travel to San
Jose State Saturday for a 10
a.m. contest with the Spartans.
