Hiring rules revisions urged
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, told
by a federal task force that discrimination in
hiring is still "a pervasive phenomenon in
American life," is being urged to consolidate
enforcement of all federal bans against such
discrimination in a single agency.
The task force, making its report as Carter
prepares to send a civil rights reorganization
plan to Congress, also said equal employment
programs were "hampered by inadequate
leadership at the top, poor management at
some of the major agencies and inadequate
funding.
"It should come as no surprise, therefore,
that discrimination in employment on the
basis of factors such as race, national origin,
sex, age and handicap is still a pervasive
phenomenon in American life," said the task
force of the Office of Management and
Budget.
Employers now must deal with 18 depart
ments and agencies in meeting nearly 40 equal
employment opportunity requirements pre
scribed by law, executive orders or regula
tions, according to a draft of the recommenda
tions, a copy of which was obtained by The
Associated Press.
If Carter adopts the recommendations, he
will make a major start in consolidating the
policies of hiring discrimination in the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
But for two years, the Labor Department
would continue to enforce an executive order
that prohibits racial and religious discrimina
tion in hiring, while EEOC would be responsi
ble for age and sex discrimination.
Hijacked jet lands in Somalia
Frankfurt, West Germany — A hijacked West
German airliner with 87 hostages and four ter
rorists aboard landed in Somalia early Mon
day, and the West German radio said one of
the five crew members was reported dead.
The broadcast said a secretary in the Infor
mation Ministry in Mogadishu, the Somali cap
ital, said she saw the body of a crew member
believed to be the 37-year-old pilot, Juergen
Schumann.
The secretary said the crewman was shot and
killed after the plane landed in Mogadishu, the
radio report said.
The Lufthansa Boeing 737 was flown to
Mogadishu, on the northeast coast of Africa,

after an overnight stop in Aden and the failure
of the West German government to meet the
hijackers' demands.
It was the hijacked plane's sixth stop since
two armed, Arabic-speaking men and two
women commandeered the Majorca-to-
Frankfurt flight over France four days ago. It
landed first in Rome, then went on to Nicosia,
Bahrain, Dubai and Aden.
Somalia was one of the three countries the
hijackers named as destinations for the 13 ter
rorists they demanded be freed from West
German and Turkish prisons. But West Ger
man government sources said Somalia as well
as the other two — South Yemen and Vietnam
— refused to accept the prisoners if they were
freed.
Korean bribe hearings begin
Washington — Public hearings begin this
week in the House investigation of alleged
South Korean influence buying, and Congress
may take final action on boosting the minimum
wage to $3.35 by 1981.
Congress also moves into one of the final,
but difficult, stages of action on most of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's energy package: trying to
find a compromise between the House and
Senate versions.
The calendars also call for House action on a
bill to refinance dwindling Social Security
funds and Senate action to outlaw child por
nography.
Former South Korean intelligence and em
bassy officers are to give firsthand, public tes
timony at hearings Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday on the alleged influence-buying opera
tions in Congress.
The witnesses include Kim Sang Keun, a
former Korean Central Intelligence Agency of
ficer accused of helping conduct the most re
cent operation with $600,000 supplied by the
KCIA.
They also include a former Korean embassy
information director, Lee Jai Hyon, who says
he once saw former Ambassador Kim Dong jo
stuffing $100 bills into envelopes with the exp
lanation that he had to "make a delivery" to
Capitol Hill.
Grand jury indictments name nearly 30 con
gressmen as being involved, but accuses only
one of them, former Rep. Richard Hanna (D-
Calif.), of wrongdoing.

Bing Crosby burial tomorrow
Los Angeles — The body of crooner Bing
Crosby is expected in Los Angeles tonight and
will be buried after simple religious rites to
morrow, a family spokesman said.
The late singer's press agent, Maury Fola
dare, said yesterday that the body, accom
panied by Crosby's 19-year-old son Harry,
would be flown this morning from Madrid,
Spain. Crosby died there after a round of golf
with three Spanish professionals Friday.
Crosby, who was a Catholic, will be buried in
a family plot at Holy Cross Cemetery in Los
Angeles, near his parents and first wife, Dixie
Lee, who died of cancer in 1952.
Carter faces bomb protest
Washington — Protesters against the neut
ron bomb disrupted services yesterday at
tended by President Jimmy Carter. Some were
gagged, wrestled down in the pews and
thrown out of the church by ushers. Carter
said later the demonstrators were "fine young
people."
"I agree with their objective in eliminating
nuclear weapons," the president told repor
ters. "I think they were mistaken in trying to
disrupt the church services.
"But the Secret Service didn't feel I was in
danger, and neither did I."
Five of the demonstrators, who interrupted
the services with a statement opposing de
ployment of the neutron bomb, were arrested
and taken to a police station, three of them in
handcuffs.
Police Lt. Donald Foreit said the five were
being booked for "disturbing a religious con
gregation."
The neutron bomb is a high-radiation, low
impact weapon, designed principally as a mis
sile warhead. Because of the large amount of
radiation it emits, it is highly effective in killing
human beings. Its relative small explosion
leaves buildings intact.
Joan Little escapes from jail
Raleigh, N.C. — Joan Little, who escaped
from a prison over the weekend, was under
too much pressure because of publicity she
drew two years ago when she was acquitted in
the death of a jailer she said had assaulted her,
an attorney says.

Durham attorney Jerry Paul, who success
fully defended Little in her 1975 murder trial,
said she called him late Friday night and told
him "there was something she really had to
talk to me about."
Little, serving a 7-to-10-year sentence on a
burglary conviction, escaped from the North
Carolina Correction Center for Women on
Saturday. She had been turned down for
parole last December but was scheduled to be
considered again for release in a month.
The likelihood of her being granted parole
was not good, however, because of what
prison officials said were infractions of work
release program rules committed by Little.
Prison officials say they do not know how
she got away, but officials said a friend of Lit
tle's was released from the prison not long
before the escape was discovered at 6:30 p.m.,
when dormitory doors were locked.
Before the lock-in, inmates are free to move
around the grounds of the prison, a complex
of several buildings on tree-shaded grounds
surrounded by an eight-foot chain link fence.
Some officials speculated Saturday that Little
may have scaled the fence to escape.
