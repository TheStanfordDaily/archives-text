# E.F. Hutton listens ... to Jonathan Krass
## 
### Lane Webster 
Shunning the melee of Wall Street,
ace stockbroker Jonathan Krass plies
his trade in Palo Alto by day and
teaches at Stanford one night a week
because, he says, "it's a lot of fun."
Of all 2600 E.F. Hutton account
executives, Krass was the number
one commission-earning retail
broker for the month of August, ac
cording to his colleague Peter Cerra.
This honor is "comparable to being
named the number one ballplayer in
the nation," Gerra said.
Asked whether personality or skill
makes a stockbroker successful,
Krass replied, "Both of the above.
Integrity is the single most important
factor. After that, these two things
are needed: intelligence and a wil
lingness to work. If you're bright and
lazy you won't make it; if you're
dumb and industrious you'll proba
bly fail too. Expend energy on behalf
of people and you'll do a good job."
Different approach
Krass has been doing a good job
for 15 years. After graduation from
Williams College in Massachusetts,
he took some graduate business
courses in New York and completed
a six month brokerage training
school.
But something more than educa
tion, something unique, propels a
man to the top of his trade.
Krass first attributed his achieve
ment to "hard work." Later, he qual
ified that, saying, "Hard work is not
as true as a different investment
philosophy. It's twofold: one, I in
troduce my clients to professional
decision makers and two, my clients
have diversified their investments
into a professionally-managed diver
sified commodity account rather

than dollars and dollar-related in
vestments such as stocks and
bonds."
"Jon is a very professional
broker," said David Nee, who, like
Krass, is a vice president of E.F. Hut
ton. "He uses his strong mental
capacities very well."
Non-profit
Krass says he does not teach the
class to boost his own business.
"Less than three per cent of my
clients are students," he said. "You'd
starve to death getting students
under 21 to invest."
Neither does Krass get paid for
teaching. "People who teach Under
graduate Specials and SWOPSI
courses receive no compensation for
their services," said Laura Selznick,
coordinator of Undergraduate Spe
cials. "People teach out of the good
ness of their hearts because they like
students or for whatever other
reasons of their own." She added,
"Jon's been teaching the class longer
than I've been here" — for eight
years, to be exact.
Sitting in on that class is the only
way to find out why he teaches. Last
week, the bearded, jovial Krass
treated his students to a riproaring
Monday night. He began asking if
anyone had two Big Came tickets to
sell. "What's your price?" yelled one
presumptive student. "It's negoti
able," Krass said with a smirk.
With similar vim Krass dishes out
more relevant questions, checking
to see if his material is being di
gested. Mere understanding is not
what he wants from his students; he
wants commitment.
No wallflowers
On a question of whether shortsel
ling is "bullish or bearish" (profitable

or not), Krass wanted every individu
al's hand raised in favor of one view
or the other. Half the hands didn't
move. Unsatisfied, he conducted a
second round of hand-raising, weed
ing out any sheepishness or apathy in
his class.
"I think this class will be challeng
ing to my beliefs — about Christian
ity," said one student as he fingered
the first book Krass assigned, Ayn
Rand's "Atlas Shrugged."
The book portrays a coterie of
"free-spirited" capitalists, unwilling
to be lured into government
imposed programs. Instead they
create a new social order, swearing
by the oath "... I will never live for
the sake of another man, nor ask
another man to live for mine."
Stand
"I think the book had value in crys
tallizing where the students stand on
money," Krass said. "It's thought
provoking."
His first writing assignment did the
same. Each student had to entitle it
"Money, Myself and Others," be
ginning the paper with the word "I."
Krass doesn't get fuzzy with his
students. His slick style simplifies
everything.
"A bank is a store," he lectured. "A
lot of stores compete with each
other. If you have a hard time with
your bank, take your business to
another store."
One girl had trouble understand
ing how supply and demand nets a
price. Krass stopped his lecture to
lucidly ask, "Well, would you cut
your hair for a million dollars?"
"Yes," was the meek reply.
"How 'bout for five?"

"No."
"Somewhere in there we'd get a
price," said Krass.
Duty
Switching to another topic, Krass
said, "I have a sign in my office. It
reads: Tax evasion is a crime; tax av
oidance is a duty. There's a differ
ence." he explained. "With tax eva
sion you go to jail; with tax avoidance
you are performing a civic duty
which you can hire someone to do
for you."
"The Constitution says, 'The indi
vidual is required to pay a minimum
of taxes.' Tax avoidance is the game
you play to see what that is."
Someone wanted to know the rule
for allotting votes when stock is sold
short. For example, 103 people vote
on 100 shares of stock, after three
shares have been sold short.
Honest Krass was frank: "I don't
know,"he admitted. "I've been try
ing to find that out from the New
York Stock Exchange for years."
After that, a furor arose over
another aspect of shortselling.
"What don't you understand?"
Krass asked a student.
"Is it immoral?" Laughter erupted.
Typical stockbroker
Student reaction to Krass ranged
from "great, great lecturer — amaz
ing!" to "typical stockbroker."
One characterized Krass' style
"abrupt and curt" adding, "but I
guess it's kinda inherent to the pro
fession." Another rendered a
harsher judgment. "You'd define
him as a capitalist pig," he said, "if
you were a socialist."
Though some held back their
praise, others were intellectually in
