# Senators, supporters admit role in 'anonymous' leaflets
## 
### Dan Fiduccia 
Several ASSU senators-elect and
their supporters have admitted their
roles in improprieties during the re
cent senate campaign and election.
The admitted actions include lying
to ASSU Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy, and the printing and
dissemination of pamphlets signed
by non-partisan groups that did not
list their members' names but which
were actually printed by people close
to the campaigns of many candi
dates.
Don Barton, campaign manager
for ASSU Senator-elect Dan
Livingston, Alternate Senator-elect
Kevin Childress and candidate John
Hart, admitted yesterday that he lied
twice to Murphy last week concern
ing a pamphlet printed on blue
paper.
The leaflet, signed by "Students
Committed to Individual Freedom,"
urged students not to vote for the
Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) slate of 10 undergraduate
candidates.
Any foreknowledge?
Barton said yesterday that, when
questioned by Murphy Thursday, he
denied any foreknowledge by
Livingston, Childress, or Hart of the
leaflet. Barton also told Murphy that
he picked up the leaflet from the
printer, when in fact Childress had
picked it up and paid for it.
Barton then called the printer and
instructed him to say that Barton had
picked up the leaflet. However, later
that afternoon, Barton told Murphy
that all three candidates did indeed
have foreknowledge of the leaflet.
Childress said Saturday that he lied
to the Daily the first time the Daily
questioned him about his involve
ment in the blue pamphlet. Childress
had at first denied any involvement
in the printing of the pamphlet.
"Don (Barton) told me to say I did
not pick up the pamphlet at the
printer's., and that Don would take
the responsibility and tell Sean
(Murphy) and the Daily," said Chil
dress.

Childress also admitted that he
lied to Murphy when Murphy ques
tioned him Wednesday about the
pamphlet.
"I said I had no involvement. That
was a lie," said Childress.
Childress said he lied because he
didn't wish to influence the voting on
Thursday. He added that he planned
to tell the truth between the end of
the election and the certification of
the election results, which he be
lieved would be this Thursday.
Childress said he was prepared to
tell the truth Friday, but "no one
asked me."
Childress said that even though he
picked up the pamphlet, he did not
read it until after it was distributed.
No names, no cost
Discussing the pamphlet, Chil
dress said "I thought it was trash."
Childress explained why no names
appeared on the pamphlet.
"Barton said if there were no
names on it, we wouldn't have to list
it as an expense and it would benefit
all 31 non-SOC candidates equally."
The Conservative Students Union
(CSU) will reimburse Childress, he
said. Barton is the CSU president.
Barton and Livingston said yester
day that the pamphlet will not be
listed as a Livingston slate expense
when they turn over their campaign
records to Murphy today.
"There were no names on it any
where, and it benefited the other 31
candidates. However, we will accept
it as an expense if Murphy insists,
and we will still be under the cam
paign limit," said Barton.
Ad hoc committee
Livingston said he didn't see any
reason for listing names on the blue
sheet or explaining his involvement
in it during the campaign.
"I didn't think it was important,"
said Livingston.
"Maybe the CSU should be listed
on it, but maybe they didn't agree
with it," added Livingston.
Barton said Students Committed
to Individual Freedom is an ad hoc
CSU committee.
Livingston said, "What Barton did
for CSU and what he did as campaign
manager were two different things."
Livingston also named the 10 stu
dents who distributed the pamphlet,
who are CSU members, members of
Sigma Chi and some freshmen.
'I approved'
Even though "I entirely approved
of the flyer," Livingston said it would
not be listed as an expense for his
campaign.
"There's no way it can be charged
to us. How can it possibly be part of
our campaign? We didn't print it with
our names and we didn't distribute it
with our names," explained
Livingston.
Livingston said if the pamphlet will
be charged as an expense, then it
should be divided by 31 and charged
against all 31 non-SOC candidates.

Livingston added, "The blue sheet
was not libelous, not sexist, not ra
cist, not accusatory and not illegally
distributed."
ASSU Alternate Senator-elect
David Catanzarite, a member of the
SOC undergraduate slate, discussed
the activities regarding the blue leaf
let and said yesterday, "Putting it out
and not signing it was pretty under
handed. I'm upset things like that
should happen at Stanford."
Catanzarite said he was unsure
what action should be taken against
the individuals involved, but said
"it's fair to do something about it."
ASSU Senator-elect Rick Levy said
yesterday he was "disturbed" by the
blue leaflet, and he thought it
"should be charged to (the
Livingston slate's) finances."
Levy, also of SOC, said the matter
was now "up to the elections com
mission."

Chris Hables Gray, a Stanford
alumnus who was associated with
the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) and who used to live at Col
umbae House, has admitted that he
wrote and paid for the printing of a
leaflet printed on yellow paper and
signed by "Concerned Students for a
Fair Election."
Gray acknowledged Wednesday
his signature on a printer's invoice
for the pamphlet, which attacked
candidate Rob Docters and his slate
and urged students to vote for the
SOC slate. The leaflet was inserted
into copies of Wednesday's Daily
without authorization.
However, Gray told KZSU Wed
nesday evening the Daily staff was
responsible for the pamphlet and
had vandalized its own paper.
Gray, who works for ARC'S news
paper, Against the Grain, and still oc
casionally resides at Columbae, also
admitted inserting unpaid adver
tisements into the Daily in 1975.
Other members of Columbae were
involved in insertions of flyers in the
Daily in 1974 and 1975.
SOC denies knowledge
The SOC slate, three of whose
members live at Columbae and one
of whom is an ARC member, denied
Wednesday any knowledge or re
sponsibility for the pamphlet and its
insertion into the Daily.
The yellow leaflet began by stating
that "this has been the most vicious
Senate campaign that we know of"
and ended with "(t)his leaflet was
produced by an informal group. Not
all of us will vote for the SOC slate
but we all respect the campaign they
have run and the high ideals they
hold. Please vote on the issues — not
the lies."
Gray said Wednesday that 25
others helped him to disseminate the
leaflets.

Livingston said, "What Barton did
for CSU and what he did as campaign
manager were two different things."
Livingston also named the 10 stu
dents who distributed the pamphlet,
who are CSU members, members of
Sigma Chi and some freshmen.
'I approved'
Even though "I entirely approved
of the flyer," Livingston said it would
not be listed as an expense for his
campaign.
"There's no way it can be charged
to us. How can it possibly be part of
our campaign? We didn't print it with
our names and we didn't distribute it
with our names," explained
Livingston.
Livingston said if the pamphlet will
be charged as an expense, then it
should be divided by 31 and charged
against all 31 non-SOC candidates.

Livingston added, "The blue sheet
was not libelous, not sexist, not ra
cist, not accusatory and not illegally
distributed."
ASSU Alternate Senator-elect
David Catanzarite, a member of the
SOC undergraduate slate, discussed
the activities regarding the blue leaf
let and said yesterday, "Putting it out
and not signing it was pretty under
handed. I'm upset things like that
should happen at Stanford."
Catanzarite said he was unsure
what action should be taken against
the individuals involved, but said
"it's fair to do something about it."
ASSU Senator-elect Rick Levy said
yesterday he was "disturbed" by the
blue leaflet, and he thought it
"should be charged to (the
Livingston slate's) finances."
Levy, also of SOC, said the matter
was now "up to the elections com
mission."
Yellow poster
Chris Hables Gray, a Stanford
alumnus who was associated with
the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) and who used to live at Col
umbae House, has admitted that he
wrote and paid for the printing of a
leaflet printed on yellow paper and
signed by "Concerned Students for a
Fair Election."
Gray acknowledged Wednesday
his signature on a printer's invoice
for the pamphlet, which attacked
candidate Rob Docters and his slate
and urged students to vote for the
SOC slate. The leaflet was inserted
into copies of Wednesday's Daily
without authorization.
However, Gray told KZSU Wed
nesday evening the Daily staff was
responsible for the pamphlet and
had vandalized its own paper.
Gray, who works for ARC'S news
paper, Against the Grain, and still oc
casionally resides at Columbae, also
admitted inserting unpaid adver
tisements into the Daily in 1975.
Other members of Columbae were
involved in insertions of flyers in the
Daily in 1974 and 1975.
SOC denies knowledge
The SOC slate, three of whose
members live at Columbae and one
of whom is an ARC member, denied
Wednesday any knowledge or re
sponsibility for the pamphlet and its
insertion into the Daily.
The yellow leaflet began by stating
that "this has been the most vicious
Senate campaign that we know of"
and ended with "(t)his leaflet was
produced by an informal group. Not
all of us will vote for the SOC slate
but we all respect the campaign they
have run and the high ideals they
hold. Please vote on the issues — not
the lies."
Gray said Wednesday that 25
others helped him to disseminate the
leaflets.
The ASSU election by-laws appa
rently do not forbid anonymous leaf
lets.
Several ASSU senators-elect and
their supporters have admitted their
roles in improprieties during the re
cent senate campaign and election.
The admitted actions include lying
to ASSU Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy, and the printing and
dissemination of pamphlets signed
by non-partisan groups that did not
list their members' names but which
were actually printed by people close
to the campaigns of many candi
dates.
Don Barton, campaign manager
for ASSU Senator-elect Dan
Livingston, Alternate Senator-elect
Kevin Childress and candidate John
Hart, admitted yesterday that he lied
twice to Murphy last week concern
ing a pamphlet printed on blue
paper.
The leaflet, signed by "Students
Committed to Individual Freedom,"
urged students not to vote for the
Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) slate of 10 undergraduate
candidates.
Any foreknowledge?
Barton said yesterday that, when
questioned by Murphy Thursday, he
denied any foreknowledge by
Livingston, Childress, or Hart of the
leaflet. Barton also told Murphy that
he picked up the leaflet from the
printer, when in fact Childress had
picked it up and paid for it.
Barton then called the printer and
instructed him to say that Barton had
picked up the leaflet. However, later
that afternoon, Barton told Murphy
that all three candidates did indeed
have foreknowledge of the leaflet.
Childress said Saturday that he lied
to the Daily the first time the Daily
questioned him about his involve
ment in the blue pamphlet. Childress
had at first denied any involvement
in the printing of the pamphlet.
"Don (Barton) told me to say I did
not pick up the pamphlet at the
printer's., and that Don would take
the responsibility and tell Sean
(Murphy) and the Daily," said Chil
dress.

Childress also admitted that he
lied to Murphy when Murphy ques
tioned him Wednesday about the
pamphlet.
"I said I had no involvement. That
was a lie," said Childress.
Childress said he lied because he
didn't wish to influence the voting on
Thursday. He added that he planned
to tell the truth between the end of
the election and the certification of
the election results, which he be
lieved would be this Thursday.
Childress said he was prepared to
tell the truth Friday, but "no one
asked me."
Childress said that even though he
picked up the pamphlet, he did not
read it until after it was distributed.
No names, no cost
Discussing the pamphlet, Chil
dress said "I thought it was trash."
Childress explained why no names
appeared on the pamphlet.
"Barton said if there were no
names on it, we wouldn't have to list
it as an expense and it would benefit
all 31 non-SOC candidates equally."
The Conservative Students Union
(CSU) will reimburse Childress, he
said. Barton is the CSU president.
Barton and Livingston said yester
day that the pamphlet will not be
listed as a Livingston slate expense
when they turn over their campaign
records to Murphy today.
"There were no names on it any
where, and it benefited the other 31
candidates. However, we will accept
it as an expense if Murphy insists,
and we will still be under the cam
paign limit," said Barton.
Ad hoc committee
Livingston said he didn't see any
reason for listing names on the blue
sheet or explaining his involvement
in it during the campaign.
"I didn't think it was important,"
said Livingston.
"Maybe the CSU should be listed
on it, but maybe they didn't agree
with it," added Livingston.
Barton said Students Committed
to Individual Freedom is an ad hoc
CSU committee.
Livingston said, "What Barton did

by non-partisan groups that did not
list their members' names but which
were actually printed by people close
to the campaigns of many candi
dates.
Don Barton, campaign manager
for ASSU Senator-elect Dan
Livingston, Alternate Senator-elect
Kevin Childress and candidate John
Hart, admitted yesterday that he lied
twice to Murphy last week concern
ing a pamphlet printed on blue
paper.
The leaflet, signed by "Students
Committed to Individual Freedom,"
urged students not to vote for the
Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) slate of 10 undergraduate
candidates.
Any foreknowledge?
Barton said yesterday that, when
questioned by Murphy Thursday, he
denied any foreknowledge by
Livingston, Childress, or Hart of the
leaflet. Barton also told Murphy that
he picked up the leaflet from the
printer, when in fact Childress had
picked it up and paid for it.
Barton then called the printer and
instructed him to say that Barton had
picked up the leaflet. However, later
that afternoon, Barton told Murphy
that all three candidates did indeed
have foreknowledge of the leaflet.
Childress said Saturday that he lied
to the Daily the first time the Daily
questioned him about his involve
ment in the blue pamphlet. Childress
had at first denied any involvement
in the printing of the pamphlet.
"Don (Barton) told me to say I did
not pick up the pamphlet at the
printer's., and that Don would take
the responsibility and tell Sean
(Murphy) and the Daily," said Chil
dress.

Childress also admitted that he
lied to Murphy when Murphy ques
tioned him Wednesday about the
pamphlet.
"I said I had no involvement. That
was a lie," said Childress.
Childress said he lied because he
didn't wish to influence the voting on
Thursday. He added that he planned
to tell the truth between the end of
the election and the certification of
the election results, which he be
lieved would be this Thursday.
Childress said he was prepared to
tell the truth Friday, but "no one
asked me."
Childress said that even though he
picked up the pamphlet, he did not
read it until after it was distributed.
No names, no cost
Discussing the pamphlet, Chil
dress said "I thought it was trash."
Childress explained why no names
appeared on the pamphlet.
"Barton said if there were no
names on it, we wouldn't have to list
it as an expense and it would benefit
all 31 non-SOC candidates equally."
The Conservative Students Union
(CSU) will reimburse Childress, he
said. Barton is the CSU president.
Barton and Livingston said yester
day that the pamphlet will not be
listed as a Livingston slate expense
when they turn over their campaign
records to Murphy today.
"There were no names on it any
where, and it benefited the other 31
candidates. However, we will accept
it as an expense if Murphy insists,
and we will still be under the cam
paign limit," said Barton.
Ad hoc committee
Livingston said he didn't see any
reason for listing names on the blue
sheet or explaining his involvement
in it during the campaign.
"I didn't think it was important,"
said Livingston.
"Maybe the CSU should be listed
on it, but maybe they didn't agree
with it," added Livingston.
Barton said Students Committed
to Individual Freedom is an ad hoc
CSU committee.
Livingston said, "What Barton did
for CSU and what he did as campaign
manager were two different things."
Livingston also named the 10 stu
dents who distributed the pamphlet,
who are CSU members, members of
Sigma Chi and some freshmen.
'I approved'
Even though "I entirely approved
of the flyer," Livingston said it would
not be listed as an expense for his
campaign.
"There's no way it can be charged
to us. How can it possibly be part of
our campaign? We didn't print it with
our names and we didn't distribute it
with our names," explained
Livingston.
Livingston said if the pamphlet will
be charged as an expense, then it
should be divided by 31 and charged
against all 31 non-SOC candidates.

Livingston added, "The blue sheet
was not libelous, not sexist, not ra
cist, not accusatory and not illegally
distributed."
ASSU Alternate Senator-elect
David Catanzarite, a member of the
SOC undergraduate slate, discussed
the activities regarding the blue leaf
let and said yesterday, "Putting it out
and not signing it was pretty under
handed. I'm upset things like that
should happen at Stanford."
Catanzarite said he was unsure
what action should be taken against
the individuals involved, but said
"it's fair to do something about it."
ASSU Senator-elect Rick Levy said
yesterday he was "disturbed" by the
blue leaflet, and he thought it
"should be charged to (the
Livingston slate's) finances."
Levy, also of SOC, said the matter
was now "up to the elections com
mission."
Yellow poster
Chris Hables Gray, a Stanford
alumnus who was associated with
the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) and who used to live at Col
umbae House, has admitted that he
wrote and paid for the printing of a
leaflet printed on yellow paper and
signed by "Concerned Students for a
Fair Election."
Gray acknowledged Wednesday
his signature on a printer's invoice
for the pamphlet, which attacked
candidate Rob Docters and his slate
and urged students to vote for the
SOC slate. The leaflet was inserted
into copies of Wednesday's Daily
without authorization.
However, Gray told KZSU Wed
nesday evening the Daily staff was
responsible for the pamphlet and
had vandalized its own paper.
Gray, who works for ARC'S news
paper, Against the Grain, and still oc
casionally resides at Columbae, also
admitted inserting unpaid adver
tisements into the Daily in 1975.
Other members of Columbae were
involved in insertions of flyers in the
Daily in 1974 and 1975.
SOC denies knowledge
The SOC slate, three of whose
members live at Columbae and one
of whom is an ARC member, denied
Wednesday any knowledge or re
sponsibility for the pamphlet and its
insertion into the Daily.
The yellow leaflet began by stating
that "this has been the most vicious
Senate campaign that we know of"
and ended with "(t)his leaflet was
produced by an informal group. Not
all of us will vote for the SOC slate
but we all respect the campaign they
have run and the high ideals they
hold. Please vote on the issues — not
the lies."
Gray said Wednesday that 25
others helped him to disseminate the
leaflets.

Even though "I entirely approved
of the flyer," Livingston said it would
not be listed as an expense for his
campaign.
"There's no way it can be charged
to us. How can it possibly be part of
our campaign? We didn't print it with
our names and we didn't distribute it
with our names," explained
Livingston.
Livingston said if the pamphlet will
be charged as an expense, then it
should be divided by 31 and charged
against all 31 non-SOC candidates.

Livingston added, "The blue sheet
was not libelous, not sexist, not ra
cist, not accusatory and not illegally
distributed."
ASSU Alternate Senator-elect
David Catanzarite, a member of the
SOC undergraduate slate, discussed
the activities regarding the blue leaf
let and said yesterday, "Putting it out
and not signing it was pretty under
handed. I'm upset things like that
should happen at Stanford."
Catanzarite said he was unsure
what action should be taken against
the individuals involved, but said
"it's fair to do something about it."
ASSU Senator-elect Rick Levy said
yesterday he was "disturbed" by the
blue leaflet, and he thought it
"should be charged to (the
Livingston slate's) finances."
Levy, also of SOC, said the matter
was now "up to the elections com
mission."
Yellow poster
Chris Hables Gray, a Stanford
alumnus who was associated with
the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) and who used to live at Col
umbae House, has admitted that he
wrote and paid for the printing of a
leaflet printed on yellow paper and
signed by "Concerned Students for a
Fair Election."
Gray acknowledged Wednesday
his signature on a printer's invoice
for the pamphlet, which attacked
candidate Rob Docters and his slate
and urged students to vote for the
SOC slate. The leaflet was inserted
into copies of Wednesday's Daily
without authorization.
However, Gray told KZSU Wed
nesday evening the Daily staff was
responsible for the pamphlet and
had vandalized its own paper.
Gray, who works for ARC'S news
paper, Against the Grain, and still oc
casionally resides at Columbae, also
admitted inserting unpaid adver
tisements into the Daily in 1975.
Other members of Columbae were
involved in insertions of flyers in the
Daily in 1974 and 1975.
SOC denies knowledge
The SOC slate, three of whose
members live at Columbae and one
of whom is an ARC member, denied
Wednesday any knowledge or re
sponsibility for the pamphlet and its
insertion into the Daily.
The yellow leaflet began by stating
that "this has been the most vicious
Senate campaign that we know of"
and ended with "(t)his leaflet was
produced by an informal group. Not
all of us will vote for the SOC slate
but we all respect the campaign they
have run and the high ideals they
hold. Please vote on the issues — not
the lies."
Gray said Wednesday that 25
others helped him to disseminate the
leaflets.
The ASSU election by-laws appa
rently do not forbid anonymous leaf
lets.
