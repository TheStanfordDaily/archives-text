# The
						case in South Africa
## 'Why protest Ford?' 
### 
Laura Carlsen

Today, the Ford Motor Company
will come to the placement center for
job interviews. The Stanford Com
mittee for a Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) is calling for a protest
at noon. The demonstration will also
be a memorial for the recently mur
dered black leader, Steve Biko. But
why protest fcyfdl
Last May it was Stanford's refusal
to vote its $5 million in Ford stock for
that corporation's withdrawl from
South Africa that precipitated the
sit-in and arrest of 294 protesters at
the Old Union. The case of Ford in
South Africa is a classic example of
the support U.S. corporations give to
the minority white regime and the
system of apartheid.
Ford's role
Ford has a major car and truck
plant near Port Elizabeth. In 1976 it
produced 33,638 cars and trucks ac
counting for 15 per cent of the South
African market. Annual sales average
over $200 million a year. We can look
at a number of areas to see Ford's
role in South Africa: sales to the gov
ernment, employment practices,
and their general contribution to the
economy.
Ford sells cars and trucks directly
to the South African police and milit
ary establishment; over $20 million
dollars worth in the last 10 years. Re
cently, for example, Ford sold 17
transport buses to the Defense Force
of South Africa. But Ford does more
than sell cars and trucks. They have
licensed Oto Melara, a major Italian
arms manufacturer, to produce a
version of the M-113A1 armored per
sonnel carrier that is sold directly to
South Africa in direct violation of the
United Nations arms embargo
against South Africa. The United
States has completely endorsed this
embargo. Armored cars are a key
part of the anti-demonstration arse
nal of the South African authorities
and were used extensively during the
Soweto uprising as well as in de
monstrations since then. Over 150 of
them are Fords.
Employment .practices
What about Ford's employment
practices? While less than 13 per cent
of South Africa's workers are white,
nearly 50 per cent of Ford's are. Dur
ing the recent recession Ford laid off

75 workers (September 1976), and all
were blacks. In 1976, the company
brags, it moved three Africans and 19
coloreds into salaried positions (as
opposed to hourly). But it also
moved 219 whites to salaried posi
tions. This is their idea of affirmative
action. In the same spirit, no doubt,
they are giving specialized educa
tional training for 30 Africans and 16
coloreds . . . and 126 whites.
Ford magnaminously sets its
minimum wage for Africansat subsis
tence level. In June of 1976 this was
26 Rand for 40 hours, or 81 cents an
hour.
Overall impact
It should be clear by now that
Ford's first interest is not social jus
tice or even the welfare of its black
and colored (or white, for that mat
ter) workers. But what is the overall
impact of Ford and the other U.S.
auto manufacturers on the South Af
rican economy? A report being
prepared by the South African
Catalyst Project describes the South
African automobile industry:
"Not only has this industry's size
and its contribution to the Gross Na
tional Product (GNP) been growing
rapidly, but its strategic importance
has also increased. In the late 1960's
it was described by a leading South
African economist as '. . . the gov
ernment's chosen instrument for
achieving the crucial sophistication
of industrialization over the next de
cade, when gold mining is expected
to decline in significance.'
"By 1970 the motor industry was
contributing seven per cent of South
Africa's GNP, and providing approx
imately 14 per cent of total invest
ment in the economy. In addition,
the motor industry has a great affect
on many other related industries,
and is therefore a key determinant of
the general health of the manufactur
ing sector.
"In 1968, a Standard Bank publica
tion stated: 'The motor industry is
one of the most dynamic forces in
the expanding South African
economy. . . Its future pattern of
growth will affect the whole
economy.' Total capital investment in

this industry was-estimated at $430
million in 1970; two-thirds of this
amount was invested since 1960, and
of this, over 60 per cent was Ameri
can."
Crucial role
So Ford plays a crucial role in the
South African economy. Inciden
tally, all major plants in South Africa
have contingency plans for conver
sion to purely military production
during national emergencies. Ford's
plant is no exception.
Ford should withdraw from South
Africa as countless black, colored,
and Asian groups there have de
manded. These groups include the
South African Student's Association
(founded by Steve Biko), The Indian
Congress, The African National Con
gress, The Pan Africanist Congress of
Azania, the Black People's Conven
tion, and the Colored Labor Party of
South Africa.
Ford should not be permitted to
recruit at Stanford because it prac
tices discrimination based on race in
its employment policies in South Af
rica and this violates the guidelines
of the placement center. We also
protest to let them know that the
growing call for their Withdrawa'l
from South Africa is not about to die
down.
