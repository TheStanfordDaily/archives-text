The first paragraph of French Prof.
Robert Cohn's letter (Daily, Oct. 14)
should have read as follows:
The country is beginning to
agonize over a crucial, and
cruciform, dilemma: a special rela
tion to Israel based on the aspiring
and freedom-loving )udeo-Christian
tradition; an equal commitment to
international fraternity â€” reinforced
by the urgent need to co-exist with
Russia (plus our energy problems).
