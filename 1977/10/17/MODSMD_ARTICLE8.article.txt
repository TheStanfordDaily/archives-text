Pizza perusings
It is obvious to me that American
pizza parlors don't know the first
thing about pizza. I'm referring not
only to your article on a pizza parlor
in the October 11th issue, but also to
the whole chain of pizza parlors that
have invaded this country since the
early '50s.
They've exploited a very profitable
market and have made a lot of
money, but quite frankly their pizza
bears little and often no resemblance
to the delicacy that I can remember
eating the year I was in Italy as a stu
dent or this summer when I was
working construction near Venice.
The true Italian pizza, just as it was
created in Naples five hundred years
ago, is a simple baked dish, about
nine inches across, made of a thinly
spread (and never rolled) dough and
covered with olive oil, oregano, and
tomato sauce — basta.
True, today there are more ex
travagant toppings on the market,
even in Italy; but at most an Italian
pizza would blend maybe one or two
ingredients to give that pure, simple
Italian flavor that's become a national
tradition. In other words, you will
never find a pickle, oyster, and an
chovy pizza in Italy, no matter how
hard you look. Nor will you find a bad

pizza ... in Italy, that is.
It might be worth mentioning that
when my Italian brother and sister
came to visit me last year, the only
thing they didn't like about America
was the night we went out to eat
pizza.
Maybe it's just because they've
been doing it longer in Italy — five
hundred years is a long time. Experi
ence is important, and in 30 years the
Italians still haven't learned how to
run their government; how can we
expect American business to put out
a good pizza in 25? |im Hart|ey

Leaflet response
Referring to the leaflet distributed
on October 12,1977 by the so called
' 'Concerned Students For a Fair Elec
tion" (CSFFE), and regardless of the
fact that this group is unknown to the
Stanford community, and of the fact
that their leaflet has been illegally
distributed, and has been disclaimed
by the Daily; I find this leaflet particu
larly offensive to the Palestinians,
Arabs, and liberation fighters all
around the world.
The struggle of the Palestinian
people has been recognized
worldwide and accepted as just and

fair. Even the United States govern
ment, which has traditionally held a
not-too-friendly attitude towards the
Palestinians, has come recently to
recognize the Palestinians' right to a
national homeland.
By labeling the Palestinian libera

tion fighters "terrorists," the CSFFE,
in its unfortunate attempt to rid itself
of the charge of radicalism, has
committed a shockingly unjust and
prejudiced mistake.
