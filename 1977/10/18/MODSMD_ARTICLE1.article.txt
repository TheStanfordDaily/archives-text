## Rally ends at Lyman's office 
### Will Nixon 
About 200 people gathered in front
of President Richard Lyman's office
early yesterday afternoon as a list of
seven questions about the Universi
ty's investment policies was nailed to
the door.
Lyman was in Washington D.C.
and not expected back until late last
night. His assistant, Jean Fetter, said,
"I will give the list to President Lyman
first thing Tuesday morning."
The gathering in front of Lyman's
office followed a noon rally in White
Plaza. Mike lennings, a member of
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP),
opened the rally by saying they were
gathered there to commemorate the
death of the South African student
leader Steve Biko and to protest the
presence of the Ford Motor Co. on
campus.
Recruiters at the Career Planning
and Placement Center being pro
tested were from the Ford Aerospace
Co. in Palo Alto. "We are owned by
Ford, butweessentially have nothing
to do with them," said Vic Land of the
company.
"We don't have anything to do
with South Africa, Ford or the pro
test," Land added.
"Steve Biko was a combination of
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King in
the same person to the South African
people," said speaker Mike Dawson
of the Stanford Workers Organized
to Defeat Apartheid (SWODA).
"His assassination is a double
blow, but it did not stop the libera
tion movement in South Africa, it
only added more fuel to the fire,"
added Dawson.
Biko died in prison of a broken
skull after being beaten by South Af
rican police, said Candi Wallace, a
SCRIP member who also addressed

the rally. Biko founded the South Af
rican Students Organization, added
Wallace.
"Over the past few years dozens of
student leaders have disappeared,"
Wallace said.
Quoting from a statement made by
Biko last December, Keith Archuleta
of the Black Student Union read
"Heavy investments in the South Af
rican economy and bilateral trade
with South Africa are amongst the
sins of which America is accused."
Wallace said Ford pays its black
workers in South Africa about 80
cents an hour, which is the govern
ment's subsistence wage. "Pos

sibilities for blacks to advance in Ford
in South Africa just don't exist."
Wallace said, "Companies like
Ford silently support the apartheid
system."
Hampshire College and the Uni
versity of Massachusetts have di
vested their holdings in companies
involved in South Africa, Wallace
said.
Following committee hearings on
the same issue, the University of Il
linois Board of Trustees last month
voted to cast their stock proxies in
favor of shareholder proposals to
terminate further investment in

Students commemorating the death of South African stu
dent leader Steve Biko marched to President Richard Ly
man's office yesterday following a noon rally in White
South Africa, prudently withdraw all
current investment in South Africa
and provide information about cor
porate activities in South Africa.
In addition, the Illinois trustees
said they would communicate with
corporate management "expressing
opposition to all corporate activity
which supports and/or furthers the
policy of apartheid in South Africa."
"Stanford's continuing involve
ment is a direct insult to the Stanford
black community," said speaker
Rodney Johnson, co-president of the
Black Student Union.
The large poster on the president's
office door called for publication of
corporate replies to letters from the
trustees concerning apartheid, dis
closure of letters from the South Af
rican embassy on this issue, and
open meetings of the committee cur
rently reviewing the University's in
vestment responsibility policy. It also
called for inclusion of employe rep
resentatives on the committee and
publication of its minutes.

test," Land added.
"Steve Biko was a combination of
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King in
the same person to the South African
people," said speaker Mike Dawson
of the Stanford Workers Organized
to Defeat Apartheid (SWODA).
"His assassination is a double
blow, but it did not stop the libera
tion movement in South Africa, it
only added more fuel to the fire,"
added Dawson.
Biko died in prison of a broken
skull after being beaten by South Af
rican police, said Candi Wallace, a
SCRIP member who also addressed

the rally. Biko founded the South Af
rican Students Organization, added
Wallace.
"Over the past few years dozens of
student leaders have disappeared,"
Wallace said.
Quoting from a statement made by
Biko last December, Keith Archuleta
of the Black Student Union read
"Heavy investments in the South Af
rican economy and bilateral trade
with South Africa are amongst the
sins of which America is accused."
Wallace said Ford pays its black
workers in South Africa about 80
cents an hour, which is the govern
ment's subsistence wage. "Pos

sibilities for blacks to advance in Ford
in South Africa just don't exist."
Wallace said, "Companies like
Ford silently support the apartheid
system."
Hampshire College and the Uni
versity of Massachusetts have di
vested their holdings in companies
involved in South Africa, Wallace
said.
Following committee hearings on
the same issue, the University of Il

voted to cast their stock proxies in

list of questions about University investment policies to
Lyman's door.

Students commemorating the death of South African stu
dent leader Steve Biko marched to President Richard Ly
man's office yesterday following a noon rally in White
South Africa, prudently withdraw all
current investment in South Africa
and provide information about cor
porate activities in South Africa.
In addition, the Illinois trustees
said they would communicate with
corporate management "expressing
opposition to all corporate activity
which supports and/or furthers the
policy of apartheid in South Africa."
"Stanford's continuing involve
ment is a direct insult to the Stanford
black community," said speaker
Rodney Johnson, co-president of the
Black Student Union.
The large poster on the president's
office door called for publication of
corporate replies to letters from the
trustees concerning apartheid, dis
closure of letters from the South Af
rican embassy on this issue, and
open meetings of the committee cur
rently reviewing the University's in
vestment responsibility policy. It also
called for inclusion of employe rep
resentatives on the committee and
publication of its minutes.
About 200 people gathered in front
of President Richard Lyman's office
early yesterday afternoon as a list of
seven questions about the Universi
ty's investment policies was nailed to
the door.
Lyman was in Washington D.C.
and not expected back until late last
night. His assistant, Jean Fetter, said,
"I will give the list to President Lyman
first thing Tuesday morning."
The gathering in front of Lyman's
office followed a noon rally in White
Plaza. Mike lennings, a member of
Stanford Committee for a Responsi
ble Investment Policy (SCRIP),
opened the rally by saying they were
gathered there to commemorate the
death of the South African student
leader Steve Biko and to protest the
presence of the Ford Motor Co. on
campus.
Recruiters at the Career Planning
and Placement Center being pro
tested were from the Ford Aerospace
Co. in Palo Alto. "We are owned by
Ford, butweessentially have nothing
to do with them," said Vic Land of the
company.
"We don't have anything to do
with South Africa, Ford or the pro
test," Land added.
