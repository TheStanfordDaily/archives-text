# Women's Week open to all
##

Wagner, Lupi

Today, the first day of Women's
Week, marks the culmination of over
five months of planning and organiz
ing by a collective of women at Stan
ford. Its theme, "Visions and Revi
sions: The Women's Movement,"
will be presented through a variety of
formats, including lectures, panel
presentations, experiential work
shops and cultural events.
Bringing together people from a

broad range of occupations, organi
zations and academic disciplines,
Women's Week will hopefully help
both men and women in the Stanford
and surrounding community de
velop a fuller understanding of
feminism and the feminist perspec
tive.
All too often, people misconceive
the purpose and goals of the move
ment. The media has portrayed
feminists as angry, frustrated women
intent on burning bras and desiring
coed toilets. Needless to say, these
distorted images have nothing to do
with the growing women's move
ment.
Participants in Women's Week will
discover that feminism is in fact a
world view applicable to every aspect
of one's life. Feminism entails a un
ique political perspective that en
compasses that which has tradition
ally been defined as personal, e.g.
relationships, lifestyles, and at
titudes. Women's Week illustrates
this breadth with workshops on such
diverse topics as Organizing
Childcare Centers, Language and
Sexism, Class and Race in the Wo
men's Movement, and Women in
Midage.
Women of any age
The week has a space for women of
any age, marital status, race, or de
gree of personal and/or political
orientation with respect to the
movement. This breadth also facili
tates the exchange of views between
women and men from different
perspectives and backgrounds. This
function has operated in the plan
ning stages as the collective of
women students who initiated the
week worked with community
people in such organizations as the
Mid-Peninsula Women's Union and
Up Press and with persons in various
parts of the University.
One aspect of the week that is par
ticularly relevant to Stanford stu
dents occurs tomorrow; most of the
workshops and lectures throughout
the day and evening are devoted
specifically to feminist education.

Traditionally, academic institutions,
like Stanford, have been developed
and controlled primarily by men.
Thus, they have functioned to dis
seminate and maintain male values
and attitudes and to socialize indi
viduals into acceptable masculine
and feminine roles.
Feminist education is a radically
different approach to learning. It al
lows for an integration of analytic
and experiential learning by remov
ing the rigid barriers between
academic study and personal experi
ence. It also attempts to replace
competition with collaboration and
to remove the hierarchical structures
between students, staff and faculty.
Feminist education
Feminist education, along with the
other diverse areas which encom
pass the women's movement are
not, however, only for women.
As Kate Millet says, "We have to
completely redefine what it means to
be either male or female, and throw
out everything that is not human."
Men are urged to actively involve
themselves in Women's Week, for it
offers an excellent opportunity to
examine the confinements of their
own traditional sex roles and inter
personal relationships. After all, men
hold up half the sky, too.
Still, an essential aspect of Wo
men's Week is that it allows feminist
women from different perspectives
and backgrounds to exchange views
and local women's groups to get bet
ter acquainted. Through the process
of this interaction, women can con
tinue to develop a methodology
which encompasses all levels of ac
tion and serves to undermine sexism
and further the creation of a different
society and culture.
By putting active members of the
movement in touch with each other,
Women's Week will bring women
focusing on specialized interests to
gether to identify overall perspec
tives and visions for the future.
