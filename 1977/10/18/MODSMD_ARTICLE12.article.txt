# Living off the Farm
## 
### Laura Ost 
For you believers, and for
people with housing draw
number 4999, there is Life Off
the Farm.
And yes, even for you non
believers, there is Life Off the
Farm.
"Life Off the Farm" is a new,
62-page booklet published by
the Office of Residential Edu
cation (Res Ed), which offers
extensive and useful informa
tion to the Stanford commun
ity, particularly foreign, trans
fer and off-campus students.
The guide tells you how to
find a house and how to live
there without getting evicted
or going broke. (Did you know
it is illegal for more than 3 unre
lated persons to live together
in Menlo Park?) It also details
how to get around if you don't
own an internal combustion
engine (take ME 101 and build
one), and where to shop and
eat (no, it doesn't have a good
recipe for lasagne).
"While it's timely now,
there's a lot of information
that's going to be useful for
quite a while," emphasizes
Alive Supton, who helped pre
pare the book. She added that
Res Ed invites reactions and
suggestions, and wants to hear
from people interested in
working on nextyear's version.
This is only the third annual
edition, the first two having
been much smaller and less
professionally done.
Editor Elliot Klein calls the
book "as close as anyone has
come to doing a guidebook for
the mid-peninsula." Illustra
tions include photographs
from the Stanford Archives,
some from around the turn of
the century, interspersed with
recent shots, such as Lake
Lagunita when it was still a lake
(fastbecomingantiquated)and
the Clearing House crush, plus
well-drawn maps of the Palo
Alto area and San Francisco.
Also included are lists of es
sential and helpful organiza
tions and a glossary for those
who get confused by such
animals as TGR, PTR, OATQ,
Dink and Res Ed. (Terminal
Graduate Registration, Permit
to Register, Once Around the
Quad and Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, respectively.)
The guide sells for $1.50, and
is available at the bookstore or
Res Ed on the third floor of Old
Union.
