## Frisbee zips on 
### Sue Goldfarb 
Frisbee players of Stanford
University, take heed: With
proper training and practice
you may wind up a national
frisbee champion!
Tom Mcßann, regional di
rector of the International Fris
bee Association and a national
frisbee champion claims, "Al
though I always dreamed of
becoming a professional
athlete, I really didn't concen
trate on frisbee. I threw one
around in college, but I didn't
really get serious till after col
lege when I moved out west."
When he arrived in Califor
nia, Mcßann joined the Inter
national Frisbee Association by
sending in the back of a frisbee
box and he became involved
in frisbee demonstrations and
competition.
Criteria
The criteria for becoming a
champion are established in
tournament competition.
Events are for individual and
team effort and include dis
tance, throw-run-and-catch,
accuracy, freestyle,
maximum-time-aloft, frisbee
golf, ultimate frisbee and guts
frisbee.
Tournaments are held all
year long and the competition
culminates in the World
Championships, held at the
Rose Bowl in August. Although
some tournaments are
sweetened with money prizes,

Mcßann holds that "tourna
ments result from a desire for
competition, enjoyment and
exchange of skills."
As a frisbee champion,
Mcßann encourages participa
tion by teaching classes. He
and Chris Wright are offering a
class on campus through the
ASSU this quarter. The first
meeting will be held next
Monday at 3 p.m. in Tresidder
Union.
The class will cover the dif
ference between models and
brands of frisbees, teach the
basic skills as well as advanced
technique of frisbee and the
history of frisbee develop
ment.
The class will consist of films,
lectures, readings, guest ap
pearance demonstrations, and
indoor gymnasium activities.
For all
"The name of the couse is
Frisbee For All, and that's just
what it is. We will build upon
the skills of our students, and
supply beginners with the
basics," said Mcßann.
Wright, a graduate student
in the math department, took
one of Mcßann's early classes
and has become an outstand
ing frisbee player.
"Our aim is to build confi
dence so that more people can
enjoy frisbee. For more ad
vanced students the pos
sibilities are unlimited because
freestyle frisbee is truly an art
form," said Wright.
Infants
But competition and instruc
tion are only two of Mcßann's
duties. He has used frisbee as a
form of therapy in working
with infants, senior citizens
and mentally handicapped in
dividuals. He set up a frisbee
golf course on Stanford cam
pus two years ago.
He runs tournaments, sets
up clubs in the Bay Area and
organizes halftime and pre
game demonstrations for pre

fessional sporting events. In
addition, Mcßann was the as
sistant author in volume I of
"Frisbee By The Masters," and
is the co-author of volume 11,
and he is the editor of a na
tional magazine, "Frisbee
World."
Frisbee's popularity has
grown immensely in the last
four years. Mcßann explains,
"It's excellent exercise besides
being a simple, healthy, un
ique, inexpensive and creative
form of sport and recreation. I
love seeing more people get
involved in frisbee, because
the more individuals who play,
the more innovation and varia
tion there is."
Intercollegiate
Frisbee is an intercollegiate
sport in the East, "because they
have better organization
there," said Mcßann It is both
an intramural and intercol
legiate sport on this campus.
Training occupies two to
three hours of Mcßann's day.
As in other sports, practice is
essential to keep on top of the
game. He usually practices
specific events by placing a
stack of 112 risbees at his side, and
throwing them.
Freestyle events include a
wide range of stunts.
"I throw a frisbee the full
length of the basketball court
and put it through the hoop,
and at the San Jose State versus
Stanford football game I will
throw an eighty yard field goal
during the halftime exhibition.
The possibilities of frisbee are
unlimited," said Mcßann.
Frisbee players around cam
pus concur with Mcßann that
the possibilities are endless.
One proclaimed, "I plan to
take the class anyway. You can
never stop learning new and
challenging stunts as long as
you keep experimenting. Get
ting ideas from others is the
best way to further personal
inventiveness."
