Germans save 86 hostages
Bonn, West Germany — West German com
mandos stormed a hijacked Lufthansa jetliner
under cover of darkness at Somalia's
Mogadishu airport early today, rescued all 36
hostages aboard and killed at least three of the
four hijackers, officials reported.
The commandos stormed the plane through
emergency exits on both wings, a technique
they had practiced on a similar plane, a Lufth
ansa spokesman said. He said there was some
shooting, but details of the raid were sketchy.
Informed sources said the raiders found that
the hijackers had placed explosives inside the
plane and poured gasoline on the carpeting,
but apparently had no time to ignite them.
The sources said the hostages were buckled
in their seats. The Lufthansa spokesman said
4here was no panic, and the passengers were
quickly evacuated down inflatable slides.
A Lufthansa spokesman said three of the
hijackers were shot to death and a fourth seri
ously wounded. Boelling initially said all four
hijackers had been killed, but he later said the
report has not been confirmed.
Boelling said the raid was "a very serious
lesson" for hijackers around the world, and he
thanked Somalia's Marxist government for
helping the lightning assault.
The Germans attacked less than two hours
before the hijackers threatened to blow up the
plane unless their demands were met.
- One West German government official said
he felt "relief, but tempered relief. We must
remember that the pilot was killed and they
still have Hanns Martin Schleyer. We don't
know what happened to him."
In Washington, President Jimmy Carter con
gratulated the West German government for
the "courage of their decision" in staging the
assault.
Boston arson ring uncovered
Boston — A former captain of the Boston Fire
Department's arson squad and a retired state
police arson detective were among more than
a dozen persons arrested yesterday in what
officials called the most extensive arson-for
hire ring ever uncovered.
"The magnitude of the case, as it developed,
shocked us because of the number of respect
able people involved," said an aide to state
Attv. Gen. Francis Bellotti.

A Suffolk County grand jury returned 120
secret indictments against 33 persons last
week, charging them with crimes ranging from
arson, fraud and conspiracy to manslaughter
and murder.
He said the indictments stemmed from a
four-month-long investigation of 150 suspici
ous fires in Boston, suburban Revere and
Chelsea, which is adjacent to Boston, between
1973 and 1976.
Three persons died in the fires, and four of
the persons arrested yesterday were indicted
on murder charges in the deaths. Bellotti
would not identify those charged with murder.
Bellotti said the investigation uncovered
corruption in the state fire marshal's office, the
Boston Fire Department arson squad and fire
departments in Boston and Chelsea. He attri
buted the corruption to what he called an on
going practice of using arson squads as "a
dumping ground for retired officers."
An aide to Bellotti said the investigation was
begun after investigators realized that certain
names appeared frequently in suspicious fire
reports.
Carter pushes pact facts
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, rally
ing allies yesterday in his fight for ratification of
the Panama Canal treaty, told a new committee
laden with veterans from past diplomatic bat
tles that the American people don't know the
facts about the pact.
"This is one of the most important and most
difficult and perhaps most controversial inter
national steps our country has taken," Carter
told members of the Committee of Americans
for the Canal Treaties, who met with him at the
White House.
"I know you are convinced what we do this
year and next year about the treaty will have
far-reaching impact not only on ourselves as
we relate to Panama but to the entire Western
Hemisphere, indeed perhaps to the world.
"It's crucial to me that the American people
understand the facts about the treaty, which so
far have not been successfully promulgated,"
the president said. He thanked the committee
for its bipartisan effort to mount what it calls "a
national program of education" about the
need to ratify the pact.
The committee is headed by Averell Harri
man, former ambassador to Moscow and a
one-time ambassador at large who has served

past administrations on missions around the
world. It includes business and labor leaders,
former military officers and senior officials in
several past administrations.
They will become part of Carter's fight to win
ratification of the canal treaty in the Senate,
where it is opposed by conservatives. Carter,
who has said much of his future clout in Con
gress on foreign policy matters is riding on
approval of the pact, also has acknowledged
that ratification is in doubt.
The president spoke to the panel during a
busy day at the White House.
The treaty committee banded together spec
ifically to support the pact, which actually con
sists of two agreements, yielding control of the
canal to the Panamanians by the year 2000 and
guaranteeing the United States the permanent
right to defend the neutrality of the waterway.
Carter said the panel grew out of a recent
breakfast meeting at the White House or
ganized by a ratification task force headed by
presidential assistant Hamilton Jordan. But
aides said its members organized formally
without further White House involvement.
Crosby mourned in New York
New York — Three thousand worshipers fil
led St. Patrick's Cathedral for a Mass in Bing
Crosby's memory yesterday, while a crucifix
topped coffin bearing the singer's body was
being flown home for burial.
Terence Cardinal Cooke described Crosby,
who died Friday of a heart attack following a
golf match in Madrid, Spain, as "a man ... of
warm presence and outstanding talents ... a
man loved by millions." The service in New
York was one of several Masses that have been
held on two continents since the death of the
world-famous entertainer, a Roman Catholic.
A commercial flight bearing Crosby's dark
brown coffin, accompanied by his 19-year-old
son Harry, was due in New York at midafter
noon. From there it was to be flown to Los
Angeles for private services and burial today in
suburban Westwood.
UC admissions plan supported
Berkeley — University of California graduate
and professional schools should continue giv
ing preferential treatment to minorities unless
the courts forbid it, a UC task force said yes

terday.
The task force also recommended reducing
the emphasis on standardized test scores in
graduate admissions.
But the task force, commissioned by UC
President David Saxon, recommended that
graduate and professional schools, including
medical schools, consider ethnic status and
economic disadvantage in admissions deci
sions.
"Membership in a minority group is, with
few exceptions, important evidence that an
applicant has faced, and will continue to face, a
variety of discriminations. This is an over
whelming sociological fact about our society."
Jackson views energy bill
Washington — Sen. Henry )ackson, chair
man of the Senate Energy Committee, raised
the possibility yesterday that Congress may
approve a compromise energy bill this year
that omits natural gas pricing.
Keeping price controls on natural gas but at
higher levels is a major element of President
jimmy Carter's energy program. The House
approved that, but the Senate voted to lift the
controls after two years.
Jackson (D-Wash.) said the White House
seems unwilling to accept any compromise
that contains natural gas deregulation, even
gradual. "The administration is going to be
very tough and I'm pleased," he said.
But getting a bill out of a House-Senate con
ference committee endorsing the president's
proposal for continued controls will be dif
ficult in view of the Senate vote, Jackson
acknowledged.
Meanwhile, Carter told a special Cabinet
meeting on energy legislation to stress the im
portance he attaches to his energy plan and the
consequences of failure to win its approval.
