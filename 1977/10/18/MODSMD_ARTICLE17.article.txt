### Rumor of War By Philip Caputo 
The common myth is that Lyndon Johnson,
Robert McNamara and even Richard Nixon were
"casualties" of the Vietnam War.
But the dead Vietnamese and Americans at Da
Nang and Chu Lai, whose mangled corpses lie
half-buried in now-peaceful fields or under
crosses in American cemeteries, are the reality
destroying that myth. The cost of war is local as
well as global, personal as well as political, and
no one has given a fuller picture of it than Philip
Caputo in "A Rumor of War."
Caputo is no pacifist bent on keeping America
out of world conflict by exposing U.S. atrocities
in Indochina. The polemic, if any, he offers
about the war comes between the lines as he
recounts the year he spent enduring the con
flict.
Now a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter for the
Chicago Tribune, who had more than a small
part in exposing Illinois politics in 1972, Caputo
was a student at a small midwestern college in
1963, full of wanderlust and the inflated view of
American power typical of the era.
He saw an opportunity to prove his manhood
in the U.S. Marine Corps, and by March 1964 he
was landing with the First Marine Expeditionary
Brigade, the first full-blown American combat
unit sent to the war.
From the outset, Caputo's experience as a
boot lieutenant is exemplary of the war as a
whole for Americans. The brigade is assigned to
guard the airfield at Da Nang "to free our Viet
namese comrades-in-arms for offensive opera
tions." But in fact, the South Vietnamese spent
more time fighting among themselves or avoid
ing hazardous duty than going for the enemy's
throat.
The result was that a group of Americans, with
Caputo as one of the leaders, spent months "on
the perimeter" peering over the lips of foxholes
at night, shooting at birds which were the

closest things to life outside the field, and wait
ing for the inevitable attack by the unseen op
ponent.
The only breaks in the monotony came "on pat
rol" in the hills around Da Nang, as the marines
effectively set themselves up as targets to draw
Viet Cong fire on the hope that the enemy might
finally show itself long enough to take a shot.
Caputo spends the bulk of his effort trying to
explain the mental and emotional metamor
phosis he underwent while leading patrols and
serving as the"officer of the dead" behind the
lines, coldly compiling casualty lists for higher
ups who used them as grist for promotions.
When he left the United States, Caputo was a
youthful braggart. By the time he completed his
year-long tour of duty, he was an old man, ex
pecting death around the corner, watching his
best friends succumb to the war. The energy was
gone: if he was physically fit it was only slackly to
place boot before boot, his eyes hugging the
ground in pope of seeing the thin nylon thread
across the trail before the grenade at its end
exploded.
Finally, he portrays more vividly than could
anyone with only a second-hand view of the war
the callousness into which the men of both sides
degenerated. Men who, in a calmer time, would
have been shocked at a simple disturbance of
suburban peace, are moved in their frustration
with the pointlessness of the conflict and the
willingness of the U.S. command to consider as
"the enemy " nearly any dead Vietnamese male
between 13 and 60, to destroy with impunity.
The ultimate act of callousness falls to Caputo
himself, who faces a murder charge after one of
the Vietnamese civilians his men dispatched to
increase the casualty figures turns out to have
had friends. Shortly after exoneration on a tech
nicality, Caputo escapes from the war and from
his old age, returning to a land where men of 24
are still considered wet behind the ears. But he
and his country had undergone an aging from
which they have yet to recover.
