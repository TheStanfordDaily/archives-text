In a day when there appears to be as many different
kinds of books on photography as there are photo
graphers, John Hedgecoe's new book, "The Photo
grapher's Handbook" stands out.
Perhaps a bit ambitious in range — as the preface
bodly states, "This book is designed to explain the
full scope of photography" — the book nevertheless
does a good job in covering a wide variety of topics in
the field.
Hedgecoe believes that the way to explain photo
graphy is by illustrated examples and he does this
with no less than 1250 photographs, drawings and
charts. The publisher spared no expense in making
excellent reproductions of black and white and color
originals, while the drawings are clear and easy to
understand.
However, because of the amount of lavish illustra
tions, the pages are often overcrowded with exam
ples.
Basic and beginners
The book's format is laid out with the beginner in
mind. Starting with chapters on the camera and the

various accessories that go with it, Hedgecoe then
covers both black and white and color film proces
sing and printing.
Instead of just explaining the basic techniques,
Hedgecoe goes on to cover some of the problems
that an intermediate photographer might come up
against. Lighting, composition and controlling cam
era movement are some of the topics Hedgecoe tack
les with the intermediate photographer in mind.
Hedgecoe does not stop there either. For the ad
vanced photographer, there are chapters on photo
graphing people, studio techniques and special dar
kroom techniques. The book is also cross refer
enced.
Factual
Hedgecoe keeps from clouding the text with per
sonal opinions on the "best" way to approach the
subject by sticking to the facts. For example, a section
on black and white printing contains only the baisc
material a photographer would need to know. The
reader is shown one print in various stages of proces
sing. The illustrations are a critical part of this chapter
because the text alone cannot explain all the stages in
print making.
Photography is loaded wtih technical jargon. Some
handbooks wallow in it, often confusing the reader.
Hedgecoe avoids this trap by including and illus
trated glossary. By using cross references and a glos
sary, the author allows the reader to gain as little or as
much information on a topic as she or he desires.
No product bias
Most how-to books are written by camera manufac
turers and therefore have an inherent bias. "The
Photographer's Handbook" is written without pro
duct bias which helps it remain fairly objective in this

highly commercial field.
For a book of this scope, Hedgecoe is probably the
most qualified photographer/author to handle it. A
Professor of Photography at the Royal College of Art
in London, his work has appeared in magazines in
Europe and the U.S. He has also written "Book of
Photography" and co-authored "Photography," a
textbook used in many classrooms.
While there are many manuals on various aspects
of photography, "The Photographer's Handbook" is
probably the most objective and thorough on the
market today.
