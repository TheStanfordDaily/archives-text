# Socialism, being oblong, etc....
## The 						newest cartoonists 
### 
Whether it is the
result of ever
creeping socialism,
a further decline in
Western Civiliza
tion, both of the
above or neither,
something is hap
pening to American
humor again.
It has evolved in
the past from
slapstick to one-line
to political, and
now foul humor
appears to be taking
hold. Where just a
few years ago we
found clean-cut,
mildly incisive, on
the-road-for Texaco
types delivering
logical coherent
quips, there now

lurk ''oblong and
obsequious" stran
gers who periodi
cally halt the act and
announce that they
intend to suck
nearby pianos
through a straw.
Strange, we
think, but not un
expected.
In keeping with this appa
rent evolution The Daily herein
presents a survey of recent ef
forts by three artists at the
forefront of the movement —
Gahan Wilson, B. Kliban and
Ralph Steadman. All have pub
lished books of cartoons in an
effort to cash in on our de
pravities. What follows is a test
ing of their relative mettle.
Gahan Wilson
Gahan Wilson is the best
known of the grotesque car
toonists. "I Paint What I See"
(Simon and Schuster; $3.95) is
a collection of work originally
appearing in National Lam

poon, Playboy, Punch, Look,
and Fantasy and Science Fic
tion. Unlike Steadman and Kli
ban, Wilson always uses the
conventional forms (the car
toon is square, the punchline is
a punchline, and the charac
ters are charmingly ugly).
Still, he has his ways. In
cluded in the collection are
classics such as Miss Emmy's
discovery of the object that has
been clogging her fireplace
since December (a twisted,
burnt, scarred cornsp of Santa
Claus); a large man deciding
between a preparation that will
eliminate fleas, one that will

take care of ticks, and one that
will kill the dog itself; and two
doctors stumbling upon a
maternity ward escape at
tempt (the nurse has been
bound and gagged, and the
babies are crav/ling furtively
around the corner).
"What I See" might seem a
little bland to close followers of
the art, as Wilson, despite his
instincts, is unable to com
pletely overcome handicaps
such as good taste and re
straint, but for the uninitiated it
might be a good idea. Very
good in fact — one ought not

into a realm not profitable or
enjoyable — boredom. There
is enough in "Whack" to make
buying it a good idea, but if you
haven't seen "Eat," do that first
("Eat" contains the all-time
classic, "Fat Man Sitting on the
President's Face").
Ralph Steadman
Then there is Ralph Stead
man. Ralph Steadman is unlike
any cartoonist in the history of
cartoons. His collection is cal
led "America," but it runs with
a warning note which reads
"What you see in these draw
ings, of course, is not vou
Americans. They are terrible
