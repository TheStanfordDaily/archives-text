approach Messers Kliban and
Steadman unprepared.
"Whack Your Porcupine"
(Workman Publishing, $2.95),
is B. Kliban's latest effort, fol
lowing "Cat" and "Never Eat
Anything Bigger Than Your
Head." As has been said, his
efforts are somewhat less de
cent than most expect, but this
is outweighed by their extreme
funniness. Kliban titles most of
his work ("Monroe is visited by
the Oral Hygiene Fairy"; "Bus
Station Pest"; "First Contact
with the Bean Tribe"), or runs
them as episodes in answer
to-be-continued saga (" 'Mon
Dieu! My automobile has been
eaten by rats,' exclaimed Ted,
with equal fluency in both lan
guages"). He seems to be get
ting awfully libidinous, as well
— "Whack" has far more of the
"Genitals of the Universe" var
iety than anything previous.
Unfortunately the book oc
casionally moves beyond dis
gust, revulsion, and hatred i

propaganda and obviously the
ravings of a demented scrib
bler."
The book also includes an in
troductory conversation with
Dr. Hunter S. Thompson on
the merits of Steadmanesque
inventions. It runs, in part, as
follows:
HST: I am sitting here look
ing at Ralph's book. Its terrible,
a really rotten thing to pub
lish. . .
EE: What's wrong with it?
HST: I hate to go into the
details. This scatological scene
here, with sex organs and
things. .
It is appropriate, of course,
that Thompson do the intro
duction to America. Steadman
got started when he illustrated
the Doctor's "Fear and Loath
ing" books — indeed, many of
the illustrations are taken
therefrom. America sells for
$6.95 and is published by Ran
dom House. «
