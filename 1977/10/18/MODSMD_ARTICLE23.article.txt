# 'Feminist' novels: two unworthy 'classics'
## 
### 
A fair number of mediocre
novels published in the name
of feminism have been proc
laimed masterpieces or impor
tant books by people who
know better. This is unfortu
nate, both for feminism and for
literature.
These novels are as predict
able as the last word in a good
cliche. The woman struggles to
extract herself from the
clutches of the male chauvinist
society, trying to gain "libera
tion" by the final chapter. The
novel is replete with flashbacks
to her childhood. We can see
the evil done by her parents
and by her first boyfriend.
In her struggle the woman
with selfish abandon often
ruins the lives of the people
around her, but as readers we
aren't bothered terribly be
cause the casualties are blood
less stock characters: the pas
sive mother; the overly protec
tive father; the well-meaning,
but dumb husband; the cruel
husband and the male lover
who fails his heroine because,
after all, he's still a male.
Her salvation can come only
from within and only with the
assistance of other women.
This is not to belittle the
women who have tried to im
prove their lives. In fact, it is
the importance of their efforts
that demands better literary
coverage.
Rita Mae Brown's best seller,
"Rubyfruit Jungle," is way
ahead of the pack in several re
spects, but it suffers from an
overdose of propagandizing.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is the
story of how lesbian Molly Bolt
fights her battles with the
world and, given her sexual
bias and her personality, has
plenty of battles to fight. Some
of them are just plain funny

and others are just plain sad.
There is plenty of good old
fashioned plot in this book and
the reader glides easily along
from one episode to the next,
rooting for Molly all the way.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is semi
autobiographical which may
account for its sensitivity and
depth.
The book avoids other writ
ers' pitfalls. Brown's charac
ters, for example, are whole
and complex people and Mol
ly's relationships with them
have all the complexities of real
human emotional involve
ments. Male and female
characters are drawn with ba
lanced sympathy and ven
geance.
Molly, an illegitimate child,
is adopted by a childless
couple in rural Pennsylvania.
Molly's childhood pranks
make it clear from the start that
she's not the traditional, sweet
little girl.
She moves with her family to
Florida and becomes a "star" in
high school, winning athletic
and academic trophies. Her
high school is unconventional
only in that she is sleeping with
the football player and the
cheerleader.
Molly wins a scholarship to
the University of Florida at
Gainesville, but her formal
academic career is interrupted
when her relationship with her
roommate is discovered. She
returns home only to be kicked
out by her mother who she de
scribes as politically "to the
right of Genghis Kahn." Molly
heads for New York to seek her
fortune in a series of adven
tures and misadventures.
Two things mar this book.
Moily is never hurt by any of
these trials. She is always
tough, always deviant, always

collected enough to rattle off
witty diatribes.
Also, there is not one happy
heterosexual in the book. Cer
tainly, Brown has encountered
one soul who hasn't been de
stroyed by heterosexuality.
Perhaps her own bitter experi
ences have distorted her vis
ion; maybe she honestly
doesn't believe there are any
happy heterosexuals.
But Rita Mae Brown is
neither naive nor stupid. What
she is, however, is a radical
lesbian who has written that
lesbianism is not only a sexual
act, but also a political choice.
Women can only gain control,
Brown says, by giving up
heterosexuality, because the
basis of heterosexuality is that
men are dominant.
Since a contented or well
adjusted heterosexual would
not make this point, Brown
simply doesn't include any.
What happens is that Brown
loses some of her credibility,
particularly with heterosexuals
whose experiences contradict
her version of sexual politics.
Brown's politics obstruct her
literary achievement. This
happens too often in the fic
tion feminists are writing.
Literary quality need not be
scarificed to politics. Joan Did
ion's "A Book of Common
Prayer," published last March,
addresses feminist concerns
while maintaining high literary
standards.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is a complex novel about Char
lotte Amelia Douglas, an
upper-middle class Californian
whose daughter has exploded
a bomb in the Transamerica
Building and burned an LlOll
on the Utah desert, all in the
name of "the revolution."
Charlotte has adventures

too. During her 40 years, she
elopes with a degenerate gent
leman of the first order then
leaves him without explana
tion. She marries a successful
lawyer, a decent sort who
cleans up after everyone else.
Charlotte leaves him to
travel with her first husband.
After her daughter bombs the
bank, and she has had the child
of her second husband while
with her first, Charlotte takes
the prematurely-born child to
South America to die.
She lands in Boca Grande

where she becomes involved
in its Banana Republic politics
by sleeping with two of the
political contenders and is kil
led in their revolution.
This is certainly a fair amount
of living for any individual, but
Charlotte doesn't really live it.
She is detached in her own
universe. Charlotte revises her
memories to suit each situation
or her mood. She doesn't re
ally lie because the line bet
ween the "real" original ex
perience and her versions of it
is never clear. The price Char
lotte pays for her own world is
any self-awareness she might
have gained. She has no sense
of her historical, political or
sexual involvements. Charlotte
is, at once, the ultimate victim
and the only person really in
control.
The book is also the story of
the narrator, an older Ameri
can woman who married into a
powerful Boca Grande family
and who is dying of cancer
when she meets Charlotte. She
is a scientist who turns to art
because she finds that the sci
entific method fails when it
comes to understanding Char
lotte.
She shows us Charlotte be

cause she can give us "the
molecular structure of the pro
tein which defined Charlotte."
There are certain things we
can't be told; we have to see
them. They can't be explained,
only demonstrated.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is the demonstration. The re
sult is an effective psychologi
cal study of two women. Did
ion is a skillful writer. Whereas
Brown's book marches along
to a chronological beat, Did
ion's glides back and forth snif
fing for clues.
Although Didion is, first of
all, a writer, she is not apoliti
cal. Her political sense, how
ever, is quite different from
Brown's. In an interview
printed in the "New York

Times Literary bupplement"
she told Sara Davidson, "In the
life of the body politic the ac
tual involvement is going on
underneath, and I am in
terested in what's going on
underneath."
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is not a political novel; yet, if
read thoughtfully, it can have
political implications, however
subtle. The movement Didion
is starting is in the mind, not on
the streets.
There is no reason why
women can't produce higher
quality fiction that we've seen,
although there are many good
reasons why they haven't. One
may be that we haven't insisted
on it.

tion" by the final chapter. The
novel is replete with flashbacks
to her childhood. We can see
the evil done by her parents
and by her first boyfriend.
In her struggle the woman
with selfish abandon often
ruins the lives of the people
around her, but as readers we
aren't bothered terribly be
cause the casualties are blood
less stock characters: the pas
sive mother; the overly protec
tive father; the well-meaning,
but dumb husband; the cruel
husband and the male lover
who fails his heroine because,
after all, he's still a male.
Her salvation can come only
from within and only with the
assistance of other women.
This is not to belittle the
women who have tried to im

the importance of their efforts
that demands better literary
coverage.
Rita Mae Brown's best seller,
"Rubyfruit Jungle," is way
ahead of the pack in several re
spects, but it suffers from an
overdose of propagandizing.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is the
story of how lesbian Molly Bolt
fights her battles with the
world and, given her sexual
bias and her personality, has
plenty of battles to fight. Some
of them are just plain funny

and others are just plain sad.
There is plenty of good old
fashioned plot in this book and
the reader glides easily along
from one episode to the next,
rooting for Molly all the way.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is semi
autobiographical which may
account for its sensitivity and
depth.
The book avoids other writ
ers' pitfalls. Brown's charac
ters, for example, are whole
and complex people and Mol
ly's relationships with them
have all the complexities of real
human emotional involve
ments. Male and female
characters are drawn with ba
lanced sympathy and ven
geance.
Molly, an illegitimate child,
is adopted by a childless
couple in rural Pennsylvania.
Molly's childhood pranks
make it clear from the start that
she's not the traditional, sweet
little girl.
She moves with her family to
Florida and becomes a "star" in
high school, winning athletic
and academic trophies. Her
high school is unconventional
only in that she is sleeping with
the football player and the
cheerleader.
Molly wins a scholarship to
the University of Florida at
Gainesville, but her formal
academic career is interrupted
when her relationship with her
roommate is discovered. She
returns home only to be kicked
out by her mother who she de
scribes as politically "to the
right of Genghis Kahn." Molly
heads for New York to seek her
fortune in a series of adven
tures and misadventures.
Two things mar this book.
Moily is never hurt by any of
these trials. She is always
tough, always deviant, always

collected enough to rattle off
witty diatribes.
Also, there is not one happy
heterosexual in the book. Cer
tainly, Brown has encountered
one soul who hasn't been de
stroyed by heterosexuality.
Perhaps her own bitter experi
ences have distorted her vis
ion; maybe she honestly
doesn't believe there are any
happy heterosexuals.
But Rita Mae Brown is
neither naive nor stupid. What
she is, however, is a radical
lesbian who has written that
lesbianism is not only a sexual
act, but also a political choice.
Women can only gain control,
Brown says, by giving up
heterosexuality, because the
basis of heterosexuality is that
men are dominant.
Since a contented or well
adjusted heterosexual would
not make this point, Brown
simply doesn't include any.
What happens is that Brown
loses some of her credibility,
particularly with heterosexuals
whose experiences contradict
her version of sexual politics.
Brown's politics obstruct her
literary achievement. This
happens too often in the fic
tion feminists are writing.
Literary quality need not be
scarificed to politics. Joan Did
ion's "A Book of Common
Prayer," published last March,
addresses feminist concerns
while maintaining high literary
standards.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is a complex novel about Char
lotte Amelia Douglas, an
upper-middle class Californian
whose daughter has exploded
a bomb in the Transamerica
Building and burned an LlOll
on the Utah desert, all in the
name of "the revolution."
Charlotte has adventures

too. During her 40 years, she
elopes with a degenerate gent
leman of the first order then
leaves him without explana
tion. She marries a successful
lawyer, a decent sort who
cleans up after everyone else.
Charlotte leaves him to
travel with her first husband.
After her daughter bombs the
bank, and she has had the child
of her second husband while
with her first, Charlotte takes
the prematurely-born child to
South America to die.
She lands in Boca Grande

where she becomes involved
in its Banana Republic politics
by sleeping with two of the
political contenders and is kil
led in their revolution.
This is certainly a fair amount
of living for any individual, but
Charlotte doesn't really live it.
She is detached in her own
universe. Charlotte revises her
memories to suit each situation
or her mood. She doesn't re
ally lie because the line bet
ween the "real" original ex
perience and her versions of it
is never clear. The price Char
lotte pays for her own world is
any self-awareness she might
have gained. She has no sense
of her historical, political or
sexual involvements. Charlotte
is, at once, the ultimate victim
and the only person really in
control.
The book is also the story of
the narrator, an older Ameri
can woman who married into a
powerful Boca Grande family
and who is dying of cancer
when she meets Charlotte. She
is a scientist who turns to art
because she finds that the sci
entific method fails when it
comes to understanding Char
lotte.
She shows us Charlotte be

cause she can give us "the
molecular structure of the pro
tein which defined Charlotte."
There are certain things we
can't be told; we have to see
them. They can't be explained,
only demonstrated.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is the demonstration. The re
sult is an effective psychologi
cal study of two women. Did
ion is a skillful writer. Whereas
Brown's book marches along
to a chronological beat, Did
ion's glides back and forth snif
fing for clues.
Although Didion is, first of
all, a writer, she is not apoliti
cal. Her political sense, how
ever, is quite different from
Brown's. In an interview
printed in the "New York

Times Literary bupplement"
she told Sara Davidson, "In the
life of the body politic the ac
tual involvement is going on
underneath, and I am in
terested in what's going on
underneath."
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is not a political novel; yet, if
read thoughtfully, it can have
political implications, however
subtle. The movement Didion
is starting is in the mind, not on
the streets.
There is no reason why
women can't produce higher
quality fiction that we've seen,
although there are many good
reasons why they haven't. One
may be that we haven't insisted
on it.

but dumb husband; the cruel
husband and the male lover
who fails his heroine because,
after all, he's still a male.
Her salvation can come only
from within and only with the
assistance of other women.
This is not to belittle the
women who have tried to im
prove their lives. In fact, it is
the importance of their efforts
that demands better literary
coverage.
Rita Mae Brown's best seller,
"Rubyfruit Jungle," is way
ahead of the pack in several re
spects, but it suffers from an
overdose of propagandizing.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is the
story of how lesbian Molly Bolt
fights her battles with the
world and, given her sexual
bias and her personality, has
plenty of battles to fight. Some
of them are just plain funny

and others are just plain sad.
There is plenty of good old
fashioned plot in this book and
the reader glides easily along
from one episode to the next,
rooting for Molly all the way.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is semi
autobiographical which may
account for its sensitivity and
depth.
The book avoids other writ
ers' pitfalls. Brown's charac
ters, for example, are whole
and complex people and Mol
ly's relationships with them
have all the complexities of real
human emotional involve
ments. Male and female
characters are drawn with ba
lanced sympathy and ven
geance.
Molly, an illegitimate child,
is adopted by a childless
couple in rural Pennsylvania.
Molly's childhood pranks
make it clear from the start that
she's not the traditional, sweet
little girl.
She moves with her family to
Florida and becomes a "star" in
high school, winning athletic
and academic trophies. Her
high school is unconventional
only in that she is sleeping with
the football player and the
cheerleader.
Molly wins a scholarship to
the University of Florida at
Gainesville, but her formal
academic career is interrupted
when her relationship with her
roommate is discovered. She
returns home only to be kicked
out by her mother who she de
scribes as politically "to the
right of Genghis Kahn." Molly
heads for New York to seek her
fortune in a series of adven
tures and misadventures.
Two things mar this book.
Moily is never hurt by any of
these trials. She is always
tough, always deviant, always

collected enough to rattle off
witty diatribes.
Also, there is not one happy
heterosexual in the book. Cer
tainly, Brown has encountered
one soul who hasn't been de
stroyed by heterosexuality.
Perhaps her own bitter experi
ences have distorted her vis
ion; maybe she honestly
doesn't believe there are any
happy heterosexuals.
But Rita Mae Brown is
neither naive nor stupid. What
she is, however, is a radical
lesbian who has written that
lesbianism is not only a sexual
act, but also a political choice.
Women can only gain control,
Brown says, by giving up
heterosexuality, because the
basis of heterosexuality is that
men are dominant.
Since a contented or well
adjusted heterosexual would
not make this point, Brown
simply doesn't include any.
What happens is that Brown
loses some of her credibility,
particularly with heterosexuals
whose experiences contradict
her version of sexual politics.
Brown's politics obstruct her
literary achievement. This
happens too often in the fic
tion feminists are writing.
Literary quality need not be
scarificed to politics. Joan Did
ion's "A Book of Common
Prayer," published last March,
addresses feminist concerns
while maintaining high literary
standards.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is a complex novel about Char
lotte Amelia Douglas, an
upper-middle class Californian
whose daughter has exploded
a bomb in the Transamerica
Building and burned an LlOll
on the Utah desert, all in the
name of "the revolution."
Charlotte has adventures

too. During her 40 years, she
elopes with a degenerate gent
leman of the first order then
leaves him without explana
tion. She marries a successful
lawyer, a decent sort who
cleans up after everyone else.
Charlotte leaves him to
travel with her first husband.
After her daughter bombs the
bank, and she has had the child
of her second husband while
with her first, Charlotte takes
the prematurely-born child to
South America to die.
She lands in Boca Grande

where she becomes involved
in its Banana Republic politics
by sleeping with two of the
political contenders and is kil
led in their revolution.
This is certainly a fair amount
of living for any individual, but
Charlotte doesn't really live it.
She is detached in her own
universe. Charlotte revises her
memories to suit each situation
or her mood. She doesn't re
ally lie because the line bet
ween the "real" original ex
perience and her versions of it
is never clear. The price Char
lotte pays for her own world is
any self-awareness she might
have gained. She has no sense
of her historical, political or
sexual involvements. Charlotte
is, at once, the ultimate victim
and the only person really in
control.
The book is also the story of
the narrator, an older Ameri
can woman who married into a
powerful Boca Grande family
and who is dying of cancer
when she meets Charlotte. She
is a scientist who turns to art
because she finds that the sci
entific method fails when it
comes to understanding Char
lotte.
She shows us Charlotte be

cause she can give us "the
molecular structure of the pro
tein which defined Charlotte."
There are certain things we
can't be told; we have to see
them. They can't be explained,
only demonstrated.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is the demonstration. The re
sult is an effective psychologi
cal study of two women. Did
ion is a skillful writer. Whereas
Brown's book marches along
to a chronological beat, Did
ion's glides back and forth snif
fing for clues.
Although Didion is, first of
all, a writer, she is not apoliti
cal. Her political sense, how
ever, is quite different from
Brown's. In an interview
printed in the "New York

Times Literary bupplement"
she told Sara Davidson, "In the
life of the body politic the ac
tual involvement is going on
underneath, and I am in
terested in what's going on
underneath."
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is not a political novel; yet, if
read thoughtfully, it can have
political implications, however
subtle. The movement Didion
is starting is in the mind, not on
the streets.
There is no reason why
women can't produce higher
quality fiction that we've seen,
although there are many good
reasons why they haven't. One
may be that we haven't insisted
on it.

A fair number of mediocre
novels published in the name
of feminism have been proc
laimed masterpieces or impor

know better. This is unfortu

literature.
These novels are as predict
able as the last word in a good
cliche. The woman struggles to
extract herself from the
clutches of the male chauvinist
society, trying to gain "libera

novel is replete with flashbacks
to her childhood. We can see
the evil done by her parents
and by her first boyfriend.
In her struggle the woman
with selfish abandon often
ruins the lives of the people
around her, but as readers we

cause the casualties are blood

"Rubyfruit Jungle," is way
ahead of the pack in several re
spects, but it suffers from an
overdose of propagandizing.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is the
story of how lesbian Molly Bolt
fights her battles with the
world and, given her sexual
bias and her personality, has
plenty of battles to fight. Some
of them are just plain funny

and others are just plain sad.
There is plenty of good old
fashioned plot in this book and
the reader glides easily along
from one episode to the next,
rooting for Molly all the way.
"Rubyfruit Jungle" is semi
autobiographical which may
account for its sensitivity and
depth.
The book avoids other writ
ers' pitfalls. Brown's charac
ters, for example, are whole
and complex people and Mol
ly's relationships with them
have all the complexities of real
human emotional involve
ments. Male and female
characters are drawn with ba
lanced sympathy and ven
geance.
Molly, an illegitimate child,
is adopted by a childless
couple in rural Pennsylvania.
Molly's childhood pranks
make it clear from the start that
she's not the traditional, sweet
little girl.
She moves with her family to
Florida and becomes a "star" in
high school, winning athletic
and academic trophies. Her
high school is unconventional
only in that she is sleeping with
the football player and the
cheerleader.
Molly wins a scholarship to
the University of Florida at
Gainesville, but her formal
academic career is interrupted
when her relationship with her
roommate is discovered. She
returns home only to be kicked
out by her mother who she de
scribes as politically "to the
right of Genghis Kahn." Molly
heads for New York to seek her
fortune in a series of adven
tures and misadventures.
Two things mar this book.
Moily is never hurt by any of
these trials. She is always
tough, always deviant, always

collected enough to rattle off
witty diatribes.
Also, there is not one happy
heterosexual in the book. Cer
tainly, Brown has encountered
one soul who hasn't been de
stroyed by heterosexuality.
Perhaps her own bitter experi
ences have distorted her vis
ion; maybe she honestly
doesn't believe there are any
happy heterosexuals.
But Rita Mae Brown is
neither naive nor stupid. What
she is, however, is a radical
lesbian who has written that
lesbianism is not only a sexual
act, but also a political choice.
Women can only gain control,
Brown says, by giving up
heterosexuality, because the
basis of heterosexuality is that
men are dominant.
Since a contented or well
adjusted heterosexual would
not make this point, Brown
simply doesn't include any.
What happens is that Brown
loses some of her credibility,
particularly with heterosexuals
whose experiences contradict
her version of sexual politics.
Brown's politics obstruct her
literary achievement. This
happens too often in the fic
tion feminists are writing.
Literary quality need not be
scarificed to politics. Joan Did
ion's "A Book of Common
Prayer," published last March,
addresses feminist concerns
while maintaining high literary
standards.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is a complex novel about Char
lotte Amelia Douglas, an
upper-middle class Californian
whose daughter has exploded
a bomb in the Transamerica
Building and burned an LlOll
on the Utah desert, all in the
name of "the revolution."
Charlotte has adventures

too. During her 40 years, she
elopes with a degenerate gent
leman of the first order then
leaves him without explana
tion. She marries a successful
lawyer, a decent sort who
cleans up after everyone else.
Charlotte leaves him to
travel with her first husband.
After her daughter bombs the
bank, and she has had the child
of her second husband while
with her first, Charlotte takes
the prematurely-born child to
South America to die.
She lands in Boca Grande

where she becomes involved
in its Banana Republic politics
by sleeping with two of the
political contenders and is kil
led in their revolution.
This is certainly a fair amount
of living for any individual, but
Charlotte doesn't really live it.
She is detached in her own
universe. Charlotte revises her
memories to suit each situation
or her mood. She doesn't re
ally lie because the line bet
ween the "real" original ex
perience and her versions of it
is never clear. The price Char
lotte pays for her own world is
any self-awareness she might
have gained. She has no sense
of her historical, political or
sexual involvements. Charlotte
is, at once, the ultimate victim
and the only person really in
control.
The book is also the story of
the narrator, an older Ameri
can woman who married into a
powerful Boca Grande family
and who is dying of cancer
when she meets Charlotte. She
is a scientist who turns to art
because she finds that the sci
entific method fails when it
comes to understanding Char
lotte.
She shows us Charlotte be

cause she can give us "the
molecular structure of the pro
tein which defined Charlotte."
There are certain things we
can't be told; we have to see
them. They can't be explained,
only demonstrated.
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is the demonstration. The re
sult is an effective psychologi
cal study of two women. Did
ion is a skillful writer. Whereas
Brown's book marches along
to a chronological beat, Did
ion's glides back and forth snif
fing for clues.
Although Didion is, first of
all, a writer, she is not apoliti
cal. Her political sense, how
ever, is quite different from
Brown's. In an interview
printed in the "New York

Times Literary bupplement"
she told Sara Davidson, "In the
life of the body politic the ac
tual involvement is going on
underneath, and I am in
terested in what's going on
underneath."
"A Book of Common Prayer"
is not a political novel; yet, if
read thoughtfully, it can have
political implications, however
subtle. The movement Didion
is starting is in the mind, not on
the streets.
There is no reason why
women can't produce higher
quality fiction that we've seen,
although there are many good
reasons why they haven't. One
may be that we haven't insisted
on it.

A fair number of mediocre
novels published in the name
of feminism have been proc
laimed masterpieces or impor
tant books by people who
know better. This is unfortu
nate, both for feminism and for
literature.
These novels are as predict
able as the last word in a good
cliche. The woman struggles to
extract herself from the
clutches of the male chauvinist
society, trying to gain "libera
tion" by the final chapter. The
novel is replete with flashbacks
to her childhood. We can see
the evil done by her parents
and by her first boyfriend.
In her struggle the woman
with selfish abandon often
ruins the lives of the people
around her, but as readers we
aren't bothered terribly be
cause the casualties are blood
less stock characters: the pas
sive mother; the overly protec
tive father; the well-meaning,
but dumb husband; the cruel
husband and the male lover
who fails his heroine because,
after all, he's still a male.
Her salvation can come only
from within and only with the
assistance of other women.
This is not to belittle the
women who have tried to im
prove their lives. In fact, it is
the importance of their efforts
that demands better literary
coverage.
