"Moments of Being, Unpublished Au
tobiographical Writings''
By Virginia Woolf
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
207 pages

"Moments of Being" may be
of more interest to those un
familiar with Virginia Woolf's
work than those familiar with
it. One type of contemporary
literary criticism claims that the
author's persona emerges
from a reading of his/her body
of work much as the composi
tion of a country reveals itself
in an aerial photograph. If one
agrees with this idea, then
reading novels and autobiog
raphical essays by the same au
thor may only serve to confuse
author and persona.
Ultimately, "Moments of Be
ing" is less interesting as a
primary source for the models
of Woolf's characters than for
the breadth of subject these
memoirs cover. The most ac
complished in this way, and
the longest at 63 pages, is "A
Sketch of the Past." Woolf's
reminiscences rival the obser
vances of child psychologists
in detailing the sensual, and
sensible, perceptions of child
hood. To her own growth from
child to woman, she counter
points the conflict between the

Victorian and twentieth cen
tury worlds. She analyzes the
patriarchal character of Victo
rian society, represented by
her father and half-brothers,
and in the essays written for
the Memoir Club of
Bloomsbury she describes the
less repressive society which
she and her sister and brothers
helped to create.
Memory itself is a region
synaesthetically alive to Vir
ginia Woolf: a word on the tip
of her tongue must have been a
tart thing to savor. One wishes,
sometimes, she savored a
word more, for Woolf was not
given to defining her use of
such words as "reality" al
though the manuscript's mar
ginal notes, reproduced in the
footnotes, often tantalize the
reader.
"Sketch" in particular fuses
the spontaneous personality
that began to emerge in
Woolf's letters after 1916, and
the incandescent descriptions in
"To the Lighthouse" and other
novels. There are, for those
who like to discover them,

musings which echo the struc
ture or subject of her novels.
One digression, which
claims "scene making is my
natural way of marking the
past," was written at the same
time she was working on her
last novel, "Between the Acts."
That book unfolds with a coun
try pageant of scenes from En
glish history..
"Moments of Being" was a

projected title for one of
Woolf's novels, "The Waves."
That novel probes personality,
and the paradox that when one
feels the self most intensely,
that moment transcends the
individual experience and
touches a deeper, more univ
ersal pattern of experience.
Woolf complains in these es
says of the failure of most
memoirs to describe the per

son experiencing the events as
well as the events themselves.
The success of these essays is
that a personality — a con
sciousness attentive to
window-shopping as well as to
Greek hexameters — does
emerge. And Virginia Woolf,
one concludes, is a fascinating
person to know.
