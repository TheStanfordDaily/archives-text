# Philipe Entremont: words and music
## 
### 
"To play the piano . . . it's
sort of re-creation. I am an in
terpreter. This is absolutely
tremendous. I am happy when
I perform, and when I am
happy, I'm sure the audience
can feel it."
Philippe Entremont is one of
the world's foremost pianists.
Those who attended Friday's
Memorial Auditorium concert
could sense, from the first
moment he walked onstage,
the power and maturity En
tremont has developed in 31
years of performances.
I talked with Entremont the
day before the concert. While
waiting for him in the hotel
lobby, I wondered what he
would be like: the man who
won France's top recording
award, the Grand Prix du Dis
que four years in a row; the
recent Grammy nominee
whose live performances are
world famous for their vitality
and technical perfection.
He greeted me warmly, and
helped me with my chair be
fore beginning: "You see, I am
right in the middle of a non
sense, because I will have
played, without taking any
days-off, for two years.

"It's a bit much. I had my last
vacation in August 1976. Now I
wait until July 1978 before I
have free time again. It's a
fulltime job, you know?"
Although he admits he gets
tired of "the traveling aspect of
this crazy life," Entremont
seems to be immune to the
fatigue accompanying a long
tour.
"I have no problem staying
mentally prepared for my per
formances," he said. "If I do
this life, this is because I like
it."
Entremont is married and
has two children. "I go home
for a few days at Christmas but
not enough to take any time off
because I will have to prac
tice."
Yet he finds no sacrifices in
the concert artist's life. "It
would be easy for me to say
stop, enough, finish! Take a
break, take three months . . .
(but) no, I don't feel like it now.
"I am at the right age to push
myself to the limits," he said.
"If I were thinking of the sac
rifice, then it would be the time
to stop."
Entremont also enjoys a sgc
cessful recording career,

though "there is something
very dead about a recording
. . . it is the reflection of one
moment. And I am sure I don't
play a piece twice the same.
"It's always something diffe
rent, day after day; it's an
evolution. It's always the un
expected that you are going to
do. It's always something un
expected in a concert. This is
what makes the difference for
me."
Entremont still feels nervous
before his performances.
"Stage fright is very important.
I like this kind of feeling. ... I
learned a long time ago that
since I had to live with it, we
had to try and be good friends
. . . it gives me excitement
too."
He does not judge his audi
ences "by the noise they make
at the end. I always judge by
the quality of their listening.
This is one thing that I feel right
away. This sort of communica
tion between the audience and
the artist onstage; this exists I
am certain. We can feel, you
know, the atmosphere.
"We can feel the response,
the way they are listening to us.


Philipe Entremont
This is really great, I am very
sensitive to this. I love to be on
stage."
Entremont said he prefers to
play for campus audiences.
"Young people go to a concert
because they like it. It is not a
social event. This is the kind of
audience I like."
When he is not touring or
recording, Entremont teaches
at the Ravel Academy in Paris.
"I love to teach . . . and I miss
it. I learn by teaching."
He believes it is possible to
spot a future concert artist
from the beginning. "I love to
work with young artists. We
know very well vyho has the po
tential of being great talent. It's
a combination of things, of
charisma and communication,
and talent, of course. It is a very
exciting thing."
Entremont began to study
piano at age eight. Both of his
parents were musicians. He
entered the Paris Conser
vatoire at age 12 and began to
accumulate awards for his
musicianship.
He made his professional
debut at 17 and has never stop
ped.
Entremont astutely avoids
discussing his achievements.
"I always say that, when it's
finished it's finished. I'm al
ways looking for the next one.
In the span of a career, you
have some decisive moments
that's for sure, but every night
is a new event."

the concert artist's life. "It
would be easy for me to say
stop, enough, finish! Take a
break, take three months . . .
(but) no, I don't feel like it now.
"I am at the right age to push
myself to the limits," he said.
"If I were thinking of the sac
rifice, then it would be the time
to stop."
Entremont also enjoys a sgc
cessful recording career,

though "there is something
very dead about a recording
. . . it is the reflection of one
moment. And I am sure I don't
play a piece twice the same.
"It's always something diffe
rent, day after day; it's an
evolution. It's always the un
expected that you are going to
do. It's always something un
expected in a concert. This is
what makes the difference for
me."
Entremont still feels nervous
before his performances.
"Stage fright is very important.
I like this kind of feeling. ... I
learned a long time ago that
since I had to live with it, we
had to try and be good friends
. . . it gives me excitement
too."
He does not judge his audi
ences "by the noise they make
at the end. I always judge by
the quality of their listening.
This is one thing that I feel right
away. This sort of communica
tion between the audience and
the artist onstage; this exists I
am certain. We can feel, you
know, the atmosphere.
"We can feel the response,
the way they are listening to us.


Philipe Entremont
This is really great, I am very
sensitive to this. I love to be on
stage."
Entremont said he prefers to
play for campus audiences.
"Young people go to a concert
because they like it. It is not a
social event. This is the kind of
audience I like."
When he is not touring or
recording, Entremont teaches
at the Ravel Academy in Paris.
"I love to teach . . . and I miss
it. I learn by teaching."
He believes it is possible to
spot a future concert artist
from the beginning. "I love to
work with young artists. We
know very well vyho has the po
tential of being great talent. It's
a combination of things, of
charisma and communication,
and talent, of course. It is a very
exciting thing."
Entremont began to study
piano at age eight. Both of his
parents were musicians. He
entered the Paris Conser
vatoire at age 12 and began to
accumulate awards for his
musicianship.
He made his professional
debut at 17 and has never stop
ped.
Entremont astutely avoids
discussing his achievements.
"I always say that, when it's
finished it's finished. I'm al
ways looking for the next one.
In the span of a career, you
have some decisive moments
that's for sure, but every night
is a new event."

"To play the piano . . . it's
sort of re-creation. I am an in
terpreter. This is absolutely
tremendous. I am happy when
I perform, and when I am
happy, I'm sure the audience
can feel it."
Philippe Entremont is one of
the world's foremost pianists.
Those who attended Friday's
Memorial Auditorium concert
could sense, from the first
moment he walked onstage,
the power and maturity En
tremont has developed in 31
years of performances.
I talked with Entremont the
day before the concert. While
waiting for him in the hotel
lobby, I wondered what he
would be like: the man who
won France's top recording
award, the Grand Prix du Dis
que four years in a row; the
recent Grammy nominee
whose live performances are
world famous for their vitality
and technical perfection.
He greeted me warmly, and
helped me with my chair be
fore beginning: "You see, I am
right in the middle of a non
sense, because I will have
played, without taking any
days-off, for two years.

"It's a bit much. I had my last
vacation in August 1976. Now I
wait until July 1978 before I
have free time again. It's a
fulltime job, you know?"
Although he admits he gets
tired of "the traveling aspect of
this crazy life," Entremont
seems to be immune to the
fatigue accompanying a long
tour.
"I have no problem staying
mentally prepared for my per
formances," he said. "If I do
this life, this is because I like
it."
Entremont is married and
has two children. "I go home
for a few days at Christmas but
not enough to take any time off
because I will have to prac
tice."
Yet he finds no sacrifices in
the concert artist's life. "It
would be easy for me to say

it. I learn by teaching."

spot a future concert artist
from the beginning. "I love to

"To play the piano . . . it's
sort of re-creation. I am an in
terpreter. This is absolutely
tremendous. I am happy when
I perform, and when I am
happy, I'm sure the audience
can feel it."
Philippe Entremont is one of
the world's foremost pianists.
Those who attended Friday's
Memorial Auditorium concert
could sense, from the first
moment he walked onstage,
the power and maturity En
tremont has developed in 31
years of performances.
I talked with Entremont the
day before the concert. While
waiting for him in the hotel
lobby, I wondered what he
would be like: the man who
won France's top recording
award, the Grand Prix du Dis
que four years in a row; the
recent Grammy nominee
whose live performances are
world famous for their vitality
and technical perfection.
He greeted me warmly, and
helped me with my chair be
fore beginning: "You see, I am
right in the middle of a non
sense, because I will have
played, without taking any
days-off, for two years.

"It's a bit much. I had my last
vacation in August 1976. Now I
wait until July 1978 before I
have free time again. It's a
fulltime job, you know?"
Although he admits he gets
tired of "the traveling aspect of
this crazy life," Entremont
seems to be immune to the
fatigue accompanying a long
tour.
"I have no problem staying
mentally prepared for my per
formances," he said. "If I do
this life, this is because I like
it."
Entremont is married and
has two children. "I go home
for a few days at Christmas but
not enough to take any time off
because I will have to prac
tice."
Yet he finds no sacrifices in
the concert artist's life. "It
would be easy for me to say
stop, enough, finish! Take a
break, take three months . . .
(but) no, I don't feel like it now.
"I am at the right age to push
myself to the limits," he said.
"If I were thinking of the sac
rifice, then it would be the time
to stop."
Entremont also enjoys a sgc
cessful recording career,

though "there is something
very dead about a recording
. . . it is the reflection of one
moment. And I am sure I don't
play a piece twice the same.
"It's always something diffe
rent, day after day; it's an
evolution. It's always the un
expected that you are going to
do. It's always something un
expected in a concert. This is
what makes the difference for
me."
Entremont still feels nervous
before his performances.
"Stage fright is very important.
I like this kind of feeling. ... I
learned a long time ago that
since I had to live with it, we
had to try and be good friends
. . . it gives me excitement
too."
He does not judge his audi
ences "by the noise they make
at the end. I always judge by
the quality of their listening.
This is one thing that I feel right
away. This sort of communica
tion between the audience and
the artist onstage; this exists I
am certain. We can feel, you
know, the atmosphere.
"We can feel the response,
the way they are listening to us.

This is really great, I am very
sensitive to this. I love to be on
stage."
Entremont said he prefers to
play for campus audiences.
"Young people go to a concert
because they like it. It is not a
social event. This is the kind of
audience I like."
When he is not touring or
recording, Entremont teaches
