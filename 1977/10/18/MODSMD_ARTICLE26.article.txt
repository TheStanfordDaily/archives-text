# Dan Rather: what the camera can't show
## 
### 
It is punchy, gossipy and full of remembrances of
yesterday's news from behind the headlines. It is, in
that sense, the archetypal journalist's history. As in
teresting and insightful as Dan Rather is in his
memoirs, "The Camera Never Blinks," he is still
much too close to the business of broadcast news to
go much beyond this.
It is clear that Rather got considerable help from his
editor/ghostwriter Mickey Herskowitz in injecting
personal comments and reflections between the
pages of superficial narrative. As Taylor Branch did
for John Dean in "Blind Ambition," Herskowitz has
obviously prodded Rather to come out of his dry
recitation with the constant question, "Well, Dan,
how did you feel when that happened?"
The trouble is that, as Rather admits, he doesn't
and didn't feel much of anything. From his early days
at the Houston Chronicle until he became one of the
hosts of "60 Minutes" and Walter Cronkite's likely
replacement, Rather has been a professional, has
done the job of reporting the news in a skilled man
ner, and then gone home and had dinner.
As an autobiographical figure, then, Rather is just
plain dull. But what about his insights into the events

of which he has been a part for 25 years? The main
thing he offers for the reading public is that what
happened behind the camera wasn't much more
complicated or essentially different from what the
public saw on the screen. Things were rough in Ox
ford, Miss., in 1963; Vietnam was strange, frustrating
and ultimately useless, President Lyndon Johnson
was a boorish oaf, etc.
One of two conclusions can be drawn from this:
Rather, like most television journalists, had neither
the time nor the inclination to look beneath the sur
face of events; or Rather's recollection is testimony to
the fact that historical peak experiences, while pos
sessing fascinating root causes, are not all that com
plex in and of themselves. The latter is probably the
case, though it makes for awfully dry reading.
What the essential weakness of the book really
proves is the constant frustration that lies at the heart
of journalism: who can go into depth on an issue
when there is neither the air time (or print space) nor
the reporter-time to study and report it? While Rather
doesn't explicity outline this dilemma, his work is the
best evidence of it.
As a look into the workings of CBS, Inc., the world's

greatest information-entertainment conglomerate,
the book may as well have been written by John
Chancellor. Rather is still there and not yet prepared
— who would have expected him to be — to spill his
guts if he has them to spill. A similar book by Daniel
Schorr might be more in order.
Still, for the reader with only a few minutes to
spend at a sitting and a nostalgic interest in reliving
Kennedy, Vietnam, Johnson and Watergate, the book
is a good source of atmosphere. One can almost feel
the frentic pace of the Dallas television station where
CBS set up its live coverage of the Kennedy assassina
tion aftermath, as well as the constant tension bet
ween local and network newspeople. The same is
true for Rather's Indochinese journey.
If Rather the man is less than total excitement it may
be his virtue; a journalist is ideally the type of person
who can blend into the scenery, appearing only in
print or on the screen. He would have been more
successful taking the kind of time he has never had to
look more closely at the news he has covered rather
than trying to concentrate on himself. But that's for
another time.

for John Dean in "Blind Ambition," Herskowitz has
obviously prodded Rather to come out of his dry
recitation with the constant question, "Well, Dan,
how did you feel when that happened?"
The trouble is that, as Rather admits, he doesn't
and didn't feel much of anything. From his early days
at the Houston Chronicle until he became one of the
hosts of "60 Minutes" and Walter Cronkite's likely
replacement, Rather has been a professional, has
done the job of reporting the news in a skilled man
ner, and then gone home and had dinner.
As an autobiographical figure, then, Rather is just
plain dull. But what about his insights into the events

of which he has been a part for 25 years? The main
thing he offers for the reading public is that what
happened behind the camera wasn't much more
complicated or essentially different from what the
public saw on the screen. Things were rough in Ox
ford, Miss., in 1963; Vietnam was strange, frustrating
and ultimately useless, President Lyndon Johnson
was a boorish oaf, etc.
One of two conclusions can be drawn from this:
Rather, like most television journalists, had neither
the time nor the inclination to look beneath the sur
face of events; or Rather's recollection is testimony to
the fact that historical peak experiences, while pos
sessing fascinating root causes, are not all that com
plex in and of themselves. The latter is probably the
case, though it makes for awfully dry reading.
What the essential weakness of the book really
proves is the constant frustration that lies at the heart
of journalism: who can go into depth on an issue
when there is neither the air time (or print space) nor
the reporter-time to study and report it? While Rather
doesn't explicity outline this dilemma, his work is the
best evidence of it.
As a look into the workings of CBS, Inc., the world's

greatest information-entertainment conglomerate,
the book may as well have been written by John
Chancellor. Rather is still there and not yet prepared
— who would have expected him to be — to spill his
guts if he has them to spill. A similar book by Daniel
Schorr might be more in order.
Still, for the reader with only a few minutes to
spend at a sitting and a nostalgic interest in reliving
Kennedy, Vietnam, Johnson and Watergate, the book
is a good source of atmosphere. One can almost feel
the frentic pace of the Dallas television station where
CBS set up its live coverage of the Kennedy assassina
tion aftermath, as well as the constant tension bet
ween local and network newspeople. The same is
true for Rather's Indochinese journey.
If Rather the man is less than total excitement it may
be his virtue; a journalist is ideally the type of person
who can blend into the scenery, appearing only in
print or on the screen. He would have been more
successful taking the kind of time he has never had to
look more closely at the news he has covered rather
than trying to concentrate on himself. But that's for
another time.

It is punchy, gossipy and full of remembrances of
yesterday's news from behind the headlines. It is, in
that sense, the archetypal journalist's history. As in
teresting and insightful as Dan Rather is in his
memoirs, "The Camera Never Blinks," he is still
much too close to the business of broadcast news to
go much beyond this.
It is clear that Rather got considerable help from his
editor/ghostwriter Mickey Herskowitz in injecting
personal comments and reflections between the
pages of superficial narrative. As Taylor Branch did
for John Dean in "Blind Ambition," Herskowitz has
obviously prodded Rather to come out of his dry
recitation with the constant question, "Well, Dan,
how did you feel when that happened?"
