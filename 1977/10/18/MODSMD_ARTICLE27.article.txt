# The 						Rock meeting and flying saucers

Giant Rock Airport (AP) —
The World Series might have
been taking place on Mars, for
all they cared, those hundreds
who plunked themselves
down on this remote desert
airstrip armed with pyramids,
magnetometers and plenty of
beer in case the UFOs should
land.
Once an Indian spirit haunt,
then the stony habitat of a re
cluse blown up in a wave of
World War II Nazi hysteria, this
bare patch of desert domi
nated by a monster boulder
was the weekend site of the
1977 Annual UFO Space Con
vention.
The flying saucer faithful —
and the merely curious —
came from as far away as Texas,
in private planes and in vehi
cles that included a sun
burnished Hudson Hornet
with bleached cattle skulls dis
played in its rear window.
The meeting was staged by
lose and Doris Rodriguez, who
met as rival rental car managers
in nearby Palm Springs and
were married at Giant Rock
three months after Jose bought
the airport last April Fool's Day.
The Rock
The unpaved runway leading
to the Rock, a seven-story-high
rounded chunk of granite, had
been the site of reported UFO

sightings and previous conven
tions. Rodriguez thinks the
huge Marine base at nearby
Twenty-nine Palms may be the
reason.
"They chose to visit Giant
Rock perhaps because of its
proximity to the largest Marine
base in the world," said Rod
riguez, wearing a brown lei
sure suit, a golden California
tan and a pyramid ring on his
index finger.
"There's a lot of movement
there, and if I were traveling in
outer space I would want to
know about our military
capabilities," said Rodriguez.
It was a likely spot for strange
occurrences in the desert.
Not five miles distant, built
by airport founder George Van
Tassel, stands the white,
dome-shaped Integretron.
Containing what Van Tassel
says is the world's largest elec
tric armature, the "time
machine" is designed to turn
back the aging process in those
who will enter its magnetic in
fluence, perhaps as early as
next year.
North of here, in the Old
Woman Mountains, scientists
recently recovered a space vis
itor in the form of a large iron
meteorite. The seminal coun
try rock musician Gram Par
sons died about 20 miles from

here while visiting his beloved
Joshua Tree National Monu
ment, whose rare and bizarrely
branching trees march across
the airport sands.
Held here for the first time in
seven years after an influx of
violent bikers turned the last
meeting into a raucous sham
bles, the convention features
self-styled UFO experts and a
few "contactees" — people
who claim to have personal fly
ing saucer encounters.
Van Tassel himself has re
ported numerous radio con
tacts with UFOs and once, de

tected "submarines all over the
worl" on an instrument inside
the Integretron.
Some experts huddled at
outdoor tables over inscruta
ble drawings of force fields and
UFO detectors. Others
gathered in a cool subterra
nean room dug beneath Giant
Rock by Frank Critzer, a reclu
sive minerwho first squatted in
the area in the 19305.
Described by Van Tassel as
an "advanced thinker," Critzer
erected a radio antenna that
locals wrongly suspected was
designed for transmitting U.S.

secrets to Germany during
World War 11.
Deputies sent to arrest
Critzer in 1942 hurled a tear gas
grenade into the cavern, ignit
ing a box of dynamite in a blast
that killed the miner and
wounded several deputies.
As of Sunday evening, all the
visitors were of this planet, but
Rodriguez was announcing
plans for an even bigger con
clave next spring. He said
further research must be sup
ported because presently "we
look at UFOs the way an
aborigine looks at a 747."
