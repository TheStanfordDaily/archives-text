# Court will allow Concorde landing
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court said Monday that
the Concorde supersonic jet
liner may land at John F. Ken
nedy International Airport
whenever the two airlines of
fering Concorde service are
ready to enter the lucrative
New York market.
Spokesmen for British Air
ways and Air France said they
would make a test flight of the
controversial faster-than
sound airplane to JFK from
Paris on Wednesday.
Both airlines said they hoped
to begin commercial trans-
Atlantic service linking London
and Paris with New York by
Nov. 22.
"We're on our way," a
British Airways spokesman
said. "It has been an enormous
and costly battle, but we have
won." In Paris, French Trans
portation Secretary Marcel
Cavaille said the Supreme
Court ruling was "in line with
justice and good sense."
In a brief sentence, the na
tion's highest court handed a
crushing defeat to New York
and New Jersey officials who
successfully had fought for
nearly two years to keep the
Concorde out of New York.
The justices merely turned
down a request by the Port Au
thority of New York and New
Jersey, which operates JFK, to
temporarily postpone the start
of Concorde operations at the
airport pending a formal ap
peal to the court by the port
authority.

In effect, that left intact a rul
ing by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals on Sept. 29
that Concorde operations
could begin immediately.
Port authority attorneys had
told the Supreme Court they
wanted to appeal the lower
court's ruling because it left
the authority officials liable to
"successful noise suits."
The authority said Monday
that it still intends to appeal,
but even if the court agrees to
review the case, its processing
could take months — and the
Concorde already will be flying
into and out of the city.

In other matters Monday,
the court:
— Indicated that it might not
reach the landmark decision
many legal scholars believed it
would in the much-publicized
"reverse discrimination" case
of Allan Paul Bakke.
The court asked attorneys
for both sides in the case that
challenges the constitutional
ity of so-called affirmative ac
tion programs that give racial
minorities special preference
to submit legal briefs. The jus
tices want to hear the lawyers'
opinions of how the 1964 Civil
Rights Act affects Bakke's case.

If the court decides the case
only on the wording of the 1964
law, which forbids discrimina
tion by educational institutions
receiving federal funds, the
potential for a ruling with pro
found effects on the nation's
race relations will be di
minished.
— Let stand a lower court's
order directing New York City
officials to take specific steps
aimed at limiting vehicle traffic
and improving air quality in
Manhattan. The lower court
described the city's air as con
taining five times the carbon
monoxide pollution federal
health standards allow.
