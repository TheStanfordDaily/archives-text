# Billing system questioned by prof at Medical Center
## 
### Andrea James News Analysis 
Eugene Dong, associate professor
of cardiovascular surgery at the Med
ical Center, learned a lot about bil
ling procedures when he was admit
ted as a patient to the center last year
for minor surgery.
He didn't like what he learned.
Dong, who has been with the
center for 17 years, recently filed
formal complaints against the Uni
versity, claiming the medical center
violates section 2008 of the California
Business Code.
The code states, in part, that medi
cal schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional
services rendered patients."
Dong's complaint, along with
charges filed by the Union of Ameri
can Physicians, may trigger investiga
tion into Stanford's billing practices
by the Board of Medical Quality As
surance (BMQA).
Manager's question
Suspicion that Stanford's billing
procedures might not be entirely
legal was reflected in 1965 when Wil
liam Rowland, then the business
manager for the medical center,
wrote to Stanford counsel Gordon
Weber asking if the University was in
violation of section 2008.
"It is my understanding that this
section prohibits the medical school
from charging for professional ser
vices but dqes not prohibit a full-time
faculty physician from charging for
his services," Rowland stated in his
letter.
"It was also my understanding,"
he wrote, "that we were not merely
employing a device to get around the
particular wording of section 2008
but that the intent of the corporate
practice section, as interpreted by
the courts, has less to do with the
professional fee than with the pre
servation of the patient-physician re
lationship."
Rowland asked Weber "In present
ing the above views to a questioning
faculty memberam I fairly presenting
the risk of our violating section

2008?"
More than 12 years later, this ques
tion is still being asked. Carl Hitch
ner, associated staff counsel of the
medical center legal department, be
lieves the present system used by the
University complies with state laws,
including section 2008.
"There are two legal entities in
volved here," Hitchner said, "Stan
ford University and Stanford Univer
sity Hospital. The hospital is an
owned subsidiary of the University.
The faculty physicians are employed
by the University and not by the hos
pital."
Hitchner explained that the hospi
tal is staffed with two types of physi
cians: physicians from the Palo Alto
area who are not faculty members
and are not paid by the University,
and faculty staff members.
Both types of physicians are consi
dered independent contractors be
cause the Palo Alto physician is work
ing from his own office and the fa
culty staff member is employed by
the University.
In effect, the University seems to
be saying, "We're not a hospital, just
a University that hires doctors."
Lost independence
"Doctors should be totally inde
pendent," complained Dong. "I
didn't go into medicine to be control
led by some jerk."
Dong said management problems
began occurring in 1968. "They were
having a lot of problems with the
dean of the medical school until
Clayton Rich (current dean) came.
He and Lyman (University President
Richard Lyman) instituted cen
tralized control and central planning.
I didn't like losing my independence
but I kept my peace."
Why did Stanford change to cor
poration management? A possible
explanation lies in a confidential
memorandum to Rich from Frederick
Koenig, a member of the law firm
representing the University's Board
of Trustees.
The memo states, in part, that
MediCal's preference seemed to be

limiting payment for services of
salaried physicians to cost reim
bursement only, paying no doctor
fees.
"A possible solution to the prob
lem might be to change the status of
Stanford's laculty physicians from
that of salaried employes to that of
independent contractors," the
memo states.
"In 1972 statutes governing the
practice of medicine were called to
my attention," Dong said. "I got a
lawyer and approached the dean of
the medical school. I told him that I
thought current practices regarding
billing of patients were against the
spirit and letter of the law.
"I got no satisfactory answer from
the dean or the University counsel,"
Dong said.
In October 1976, Dong entered the
medical center as a patient. He was
operated on by a faculty physician for
a thyroidectomy.
"When I got my bill, I found things
were worse than I had thought,"
Dong said. He proceeded to write
several letters to the patient account
ing department of the medical center
regarding his bill.
That was a year ago, and Dong says
he has not yet received replies.
"I didn't realize we had any un
answered correspondence," Hitch
ner said. "I will certainly look into the
matter." .
Mystery M.D.
Dong says he has photocopies of
other patients' bills showing sums
owed to unidentified doctors. The
bills state: "Professional fee â€” Dr.
XXX" with a figure in the "Total
Charges" column.
According to Dong, there is noway
to tell if "Dr. XXX" is a licensed
physician. If "XXX" is an intern or
resident and is billing for services re
ndered, he could face a heavy jail
sentence.
"The people whose bill photostats
I have say they never even saw a prac
ticing physician," Dong said.
If the BMQA does investigate Stan
ford, what will its judgment be? In a
memorandum from the legal office
of the Department of Consumer Af
fairs to BMQA, Richard DeWalt,
program manager, gave the follow
ing opinion:
"A physician may not be employed
in a licensed charitable and
eleemosynary institution, founda
tion ... or clinic operating as a part
of an approved medical school which
charges patients for professional
services rendered."
But you never know.
"Executive director of the BMQA is
Robert Rowland, former business
manager of the department of
medicine and son of William Row
land, author of that first questioning
letter way back in '65," Dong said.

manager for the medical center,
wrote to Stanford counsel Gordon
Weber asking if the University was in
violation of section 2008.
"It is my understanding that this
section prohibits the medical school
from charging for professional ser
vices but dqes not prohibit a full-time
faculty physician from charging for
his services," Rowland stated in his
letter.
"It was also my understanding,"
he wrote, "that we were not merely
employing a device to get around the
particular wording of section 2008
but that the intent of the corporate
practice section, as interpreted by
the courts, has less to do with the
professional fee than with the pre
servation of the patient-physician re
lationship."
Rowland asked Weber "In present
ing the above views to a questioning
faculty memberam I fairly presenting
the risk of our violating section

2008?"
More than 12 years later, this ques
tion is still being asked. Carl Hitch
ner, associated staff counsel of the
medical center legal department, be
lieves the present system used by the
University complies with state laws,
including section 2008.
"There are two legal entities in
volved here," Hitchner said, "Stan
ford University and Stanford Univer
sity Hospital. The hospital is an
owned subsidiary of the University.
The faculty physicians are employed
by the University and not by the hos
pital."
Hitchner explained that the hospi
tal is staffed with two types of physi
cians: physicians from the Palo Alto
area who are not faculty members
and are not paid by the University,
and faculty staff members.
Both types of physicians are consi
dered independent contractors be
cause the Palo Alto physician is work
ing from his own office and the fa
culty staff member is employed by
the University.
In effect, the University seems to
be saying, "We're not a hospital, just
a University that hires doctors."
Lost independence
"Doctors should be totally inde
pendent," complained Dong. "I
didn't go into medicine to be control
led by some jerk."
Dong said management problems
began occurring in 1968. "They were
having a lot of problems with the
dean of the medical school until
Clayton Rich (current dean) came.
He and Lyman (University President
Richard Lyman) instituted cen
tralized control and central planning.
I didn't like losing my independence
but I kept my peace."
Why did Stanford change to cor
poration management? A possible
explanation lies in a confidential
memorandum to Rich from Frederick
Koenig, a member of the law firm
representing the University's Board
of Trustees.
The memo states, in part, that
MediCal's preference seemed to be

limiting payment for services of
salaried physicians to cost reim
bursement only, paying no doctor
fees.
"A possible solution to the prob
lem might be to change the status of
Stanford's laculty physicians from
that of salaried employes to that of
independent contractors," the
memo states.
"In 1972 statutes governing the
practice of medicine were called to
my attention," Dong said. "I got a
lawyer and approached the dean of
the medical school. I told him that I
thought current practices regarding
billing of patients were against the
spirit and letter of the law.
"I got no satisfactory answer from
the dean or the University counsel,"
Dong said.
In October 1976, Dong entered the
medical center as a patient. He was
operated on by a faculty physician for
a thyroidectomy.
"When I got my bill, I found things
were worse than I had thought,"
Dong said. He proceeded to write
several letters to the patient account
ing department of the medical center
regarding his bill.
That was a year ago, and Dong says
he has not yet received replies.
"I didn't realize we had any un
answered correspondence," Hitch
ner said. "I will certainly look into the
matter." .
Mystery M.D.
Dong says he has photocopies of
other patients' bills showing sums
owed to unidentified doctors. The
bills state: "Professional fee â€” Dr.
XXX" with a figure in the "Total
Charges" column.
According to Dong, there is noway
to tell if "Dr. XXX" is a licensed
physician. If "XXX" is an intern or
resident and is billing for services re
ndered, he could face a heavy jail
sentence.
"The people whose bill photostats
I have say they never even saw a prac
ticing physician," Dong said.
If the BMQA does investigate Stan
ford, what will its judgment be? In a
memorandum from the legal office
of the Department of Consumer Af
fairs to BMQA, Richard DeWalt,
program manager, gave the follow
ing opinion:
"A physician may not be employed
in a licensed charitable and
eleemosynary institution, founda
tion ... or clinic operating as a part
of an approved medical school which
charges patients for professional
services rendered."
But you never know.
"Executive director of the BMQA is
Robert Rowland, former business
manager of the department of
medicine and son of William Row
land, author of that first questioning
letter way back in '65," Dong said.
Eugene Dong, associate professor
of cardiovascular surgery at the Med
ical Center, learned a lot about bil
ling procedures when he was admit
ted as a patient to the center last year
for minor surgery.
He didn't like what he learned.
Dong, who has been with the
center for 17 years, recently filed
formal complaints against the Uni
versity, claiming the medical center
violates section 2008 of the California
Business Code.
The code states, in part, that medi
cal schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional
services rendered patients."
Dong's complaint, along with
charges filed by the Union of Ameri

ner, associated staff counsel of the
medical center legal department, be
lieves the present system used by the
University complies with state laws,
including section 2008.
"There are two legal entities in
volved here," Hitchner said, "Stan
ford University and Stanford Univer
sity Hospital. The hospital is an
owned subsidiary of the University.
The faculty physicians are employed
by the University and not by the hos
pital."
Hitchner explained that the hospi
tal is staffed with two types of physi
cians: physicians from the Palo Alto
area who are not faculty members
and are not paid by the University,
and faculty staff members.
Both types of physicians are consi
dered independent contractors be
cause the Palo Alto physician is work
ing from his own office and the fa
culty staff member is employed by
the University.
In effect, the University seems to
be saying, "We're not a hospital, just
a University that hires doctors."
Lost independence
"Doctors should be totally inde
pendent," complained Dong. "I
didn't go into medicine to be control
led by some jerk."
Dong said management problems
began occurring in 1968. "They were
having a lot of problems with the
dean of the medical school until
Clayton Rich (current dean) came.
He and Lyman (University President
Richard Lyman) instituted cen
tralized control and central planning.
I didn't like losing my independence
but I kept my peace."
Why did Stanford change to cor
poration management? A possible
explanation lies in a confidential
memorandum to Rich from Frederick
Koenig, a member of the law firm
representing the University's Board
of Trustees.
The memo states, in part, that
MediCal's preference seemed to be

limiting payment for services of
salaried physicians to cost reim
bursement only, paying no doctor
fees.
"A possible solution to the prob
lem might be to change the status of
Stanford's laculty physicians from
that of salaried employes to that of
independent contractors," the
memo states.
"In 1972 statutes governing the
practice of medicine were called to
my attention," Dong said. "I got a
lawyer and approached the dean of
the medical school. I told him that I
thought current practices regarding
billing of patients were against the
spirit and letter of the law.
"I got no satisfactory answer from
the dean or the University counsel,"
Dong said.
In October 1976, Dong entered the
medical center as a patient. He was
operated on by a faculty physician for
a thyroidectomy.
"When I got my bill, I found things
were worse than I had thought,"
Dong said. He proceeded to write
several letters to the patient account
ing department of the medical center
regarding his bill.
That was a year ago, and Dong says
he has not yet received replies.
"I didn't realize we had any un
answered correspondence," Hitch
ner said. "I will certainly look into the
matter." .
Mystery M.D.
Dong says he has photocopies of
other patients' bills showing sums
owed to unidentified doctors. The
bills state: "Professional fee â€” Dr.
XXX" with a figure in the "Total
Charges" column.
According to Dong, there is noway
to tell if "Dr. XXX" is a licensed
physician. If "XXX" is an intern or
resident and is billing for services re
ndered, he could face a heavy jail
sentence.
"The people whose bill photostats
I have say they never even saw a prac
ticing physician," Dong said.
If the BMQA does investigate Stan
ford, what will its judgment be? In a
memorandum from the legal office
of the Department of Consumer Af
fairs to BMQA, Richard DeWalt,
program manager, gave the follow
ing opinion:
"A physician may not be employed
in a licensed charitable and
eleemosynary institution, founda
tion ... or clinic operating as a part
of an approved medical school which
charges patients for professional
services rendered."
But you never know.
"Executive director of the BMQA is
Robert Rowland, former business
manager of the department of
medicine and son of William Row
land, author of that first questioning
letter way back in '65," Dong said.
Eugene Dong, associate professor
of cardiovascular surgery at the Med
ical Center, learned a lot about bil
ling procedures when he was admit
ted as a patient to the center last year
for minor surgery.
He didn't like what he learned.
Dong, who has been with the
center for 17 years, recently filed
formal complaints against the Uni
versity, claiming the medical center
violates section 2008 of the California
Business Code.
The code states, in part, that medi
cal schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional
services rendered patients."
Dong's complaint, along with
charges filed by the Union of Ameri
can Physicians, may trigger investiga
tion into Stanford's billing practices
by the Board of Medical Quality As
surance (BMQA).
Manager's question
Suspicion that Stanford's billing
procedures might not be entirely
legal was reflected in 1965 when Wil
liam Rowland, then the business
manager for the medical center,
wrote to Stanford counsel Gordon
Weber asking if the University was in
violation of section 2008.
"It is my understanding that this
section prohibits the medical school
from charging for professional ser
vices but dqes not prohibit a full-time
faculty physician from charging for
his services," Rowland stated in his
letter.
"It was also my understanding,"
he wrote, "that we were not merely
employing a device to get around the
particular wording of section 2008
but that the intent of the corporate
practice section, as interpreted by
the courts, has less to do with the
professional fee than with the pre
servation of the patient-physician re
lationship."
Rowland asked Weber "In present
ing the above views to a questioning
faculty memberam I fairly presenting
the risk of our violating section

2008?"
