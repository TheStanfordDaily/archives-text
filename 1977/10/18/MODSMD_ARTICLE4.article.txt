# Students admit role in leaflet distribution

### Dan Fiduccia Randy Keith 
Several students have admitted in
volvement in distribution of
anonymous leaflets, which were
printed by people involved in the
campaigns of ASSU Senate candi
dates, during last week's campaign
and election.
One leaflet, printed on yellow
paper, and signed by "Concerned
Students for a Fair Election" attacked
candidate Rob Docters (now an
ASSU Alternate Senator-elect) and
supported the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) slate of 10 under
graduates.
Chris Hables Gray, the Stanford
alumnus who has admitted paying
for printing the leaflets, said last
night that he stood in front of Col
umbae House at 7 a.m. last Wednes
day and passed out leaflets to
"friends" who inserted them into
copies of the Daily.

Laura Carlsen, who lives in Terra
House and is a member of the Stan
ford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP), con
firmed yesterday her participation in
the insertion of the unauthorized
leaflets.
Carlsen said yesterday,"I didn't
know what I was getting into" when
she inserted the yellow flyers.
"I really regret it," Carlsen said.
The unauthorized insertion into
the Daily was not paid for.
Visiting Law Prof. Robert Ellickson
from USC told KZSU last night that in
his opinion the Daily would have a
valid civil suit against Cray because
the Daily could consider the yellow
pamphlet to constitute an adver
tisement chargeable to Cray.
Cray told KZSU that if billed by the
Daily he would not pay.
"I wasn't aware of legal implica
tions. I didn't know there was a
charge for advertising," said Carlsen.
Carlsen said no SOC candidates
were in any way involved in inserting
the leaflets and said she has not told

any SOC candidate of her actions.
(Three SOC candidates live in Col
umbae.)
Other students have admitted in
volvement in disseminating a pam
phlet on blue paper which urged
students not to vote for the SOC
slate, and signed by "Students
Committed to Individual Freedom."
ASSU election by-laws apparently
do not forbid anonymous campaign
literature.
Jim Labell, a member of Conserva

tive Students Union (CSU), said he
only passed out the blue flyers in one
dorm.
"I didn't like the idea of it being
anonymous," said Labell.
Labell explained he wasn't against
the content of the pamphlet, but
rather against the signatory commit
tee which he said didn't exist.
Labell also said the CSU never
voted to pay for the leaflet and said
