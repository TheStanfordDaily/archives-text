# Panelists ponder Bakke case
## 
### Lane Webster 
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don declared yesterday he is
"bothered" by the Bakke case be
cause "it's a zero-sum game."
In a forum on the controversial
"reverse discrimination" case, Har
gadon told about 60 persons in the
Zapata Dining Hall that "affirmative
action is by definition a negative ac

tion for some other group."
Another panelist, Cindy Ellwood of
the Santa Clara Commission on the
Status of Women, called on schools
to search themselves for signs of dis
crimination.
"You don't find discrimination un
less you look," she said. "Unless
schools sit down and assess their
policies, they're not going to be able

to change them."
Panelist Angie Briones, the student
organizer of the Anti-Bakke Decision
Coalition, said "reverse discrimina
tion is a meaningless term in a society
where overt discrimination is still
present."
The real issue, she said, "is na
tional oppression, not a weak term
like reverse discrimination."
Hargadon emphasized that the
admissions program here and at
other universities primarily affects
individuals. He said it is poor conso
lation to the minority student who is
not admitted — despite special prog
rams — to know that "somehow I'm
represented by the individual minor
ity students there."
Though Stanford has come a long
way toward admitting minorities, un
less there is corresponding pressure
on the nation's 26,000 high schools,
the University's efforts become "a
kind of finger in the dike exercise,"
Hargadon said.
Hargadon said his feelings on the
case are "terribly ambiguous. I guess
I hope that . . . the government will
not be allowed to encroach upon the
right of private institutions to decide
upon the kind of student bodies they
like."
Questions followed the presenta
tions by Ellwood, Briones, Hargadon
and Law School Prof. Thomas Grey.
Asked about the definition of
"minority," Hargadon pointed out
"On our Native-American search list
we get an awful lot of what sound to
me like Irish names. Then we get to
who you are is who you think you are
- who you identify with."
Lastyear, he said, a white applicant
sent the admissions office a two page
paper making the claim of being
black.

schools sit down and assess their
policies, they're not going to be able

to change them."
Panelist Angie Briones, the student
organizer of the Anti-Bakke Decision
Coalition, said "reverse discrimina
tion is a meaningless term in a society
where overt discrimination is still
present."
The real issue, she said, "is na
tional oppression, not a weak term
like reverse discrimination."
Hargadon emphasized that the
admissions program here and at
other universities primarily affects
individuals. He said it is poor conso
lation to the minority student who is
not admitted — despite special prog
rams — to know that "somehow I'm
represented by the individual minor
ity students there."
Though Stanford has come a long
way toward admitting minorities, un
less there is corresponding pressure
on the nation's 26,000 high schools,
the University's efforts become "a
kind of finger in the dike exercise,"
Hargadon said.
Hargadon said his feelings on the
case are "terribly ambiguous. I guess
I hope that . . . the government will
not be allowed to encroach upon the
right of private institutions to decide
upon the kind of student bodies they
like."
Questions followed the presenta
tions by Ellwood, Briones, Hargadon
and Law School Prof. Thomas Grey.
Asked about the definition of
"minority," Hargadon pointed out
"On our Native-American search list
we get an awful lot of what sound to
me like Irish names. Then we get to
who you are is who you think you are
- who you identify with."
Lastyear, he said, a white applicant
sent the admissions office a two page
paper making the claim of being
black.

consideration by the Supreme Court, was the topic of an
open forum held at Zapata last night.
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don declared yesterday he is
"bothered" by the Bakke case be
cause "it's a zero-sum game."
In a forum on the controversial
"reverse discrimination" case, Har
gadon told about 60 persons in the
Zapata Dining Hall that "affirmative
action is by definition a negative ac

tion for some other group."
Another panelist, Cindy Ellwood of
the Santa Clara Commission on the
Status of Women, called on schools
to search themselves for signs of dis
crimination.
"You don't find discrimination un
less you look," she said. "Unless
schools sit down and assess their
policies, they're not going to be able

to change them."

organizer of the Anti-Bakke Decision
