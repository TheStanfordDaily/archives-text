## Freedom for whom?

Last Wednesday the Daily Californian, a
student newspaper in Berkeley, published an
editorial supporting the Bakke decision. Fol
lowing this publication copies of the Daily
Californian were burned at a rally on the UC-
Berkeley campus and later in front of the of
fices of the Daily Californian.
We deplore this senseless act which is appa
rently meant to intimidate and frighten the
Daily Caliio nian staff and all those who sup
port ths bakke decision.
F.eedum of expression in this country is
guaranteed to all, not some — regardless of
the unpopularity or the falseness of the idea
being expressed.
Issues of national : mportance, such as the

Bakke case, are particularly deserving of full
and uninhibited debate. Those who support
one side or the other in the Bakke case should
attempt to get their ideas across through
reason and debate, not acts of violence. Such
actions only degrade the cause of those who
commit the acts.
The opinion of those who burned the pap
ers seems to be that only their viewpoint
should be expressed. If freedom of expres
sion were allowed only for some, then only
the opinions of those in the majority would
ever be heard in this country. We think that
those opposed to the Bakke decision can most
especially understand what the consequences
of this would be.
