# Watergate comes home

### 
Last week's ASSU Senate campaign was
marred by some of the most reprehensible
campaign tactics this campus has ever seen.
We are appalled at activities which some se
nate candidates and their supporters engaged
in.
These included destroying and defacing
campaign posters, having conflicts of interest,
making personal and defamatory attacks in
print on candidates and other students, and
issuing repeated falsehoods.
These also included the anonymous writing
and printing of two leaflets in support of cer
tain candidates. In fact, these leaflets were
written by persons closely linked to the can
didates being supported.
The most amazing hallmark of the election
was the seriousness which candidates and
their friends gave it. The life-or-death,
"them-or-us" philosophy of various students
is in a way reminiscent of the paranoia which
marked the Nixon administration before and
after the 1972 campaign. We don't know why
Stanford students, notably those representing
the political right and left, became locked in
such a desperate struggle with each other.
Some of these activities apparently had
their genesis in unfair actions perpetrated in

recent ASSU elections. We believe some of
these actions were not in keeping with the
spirit of this University. We hope that these
actions will never be repeated in any political
activity on this campus in the future.
We support ASSU Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy, ASSU Co-Presidents Greg Lar
son, Steve Westly, Anne Henkels and Glenn
Jordan, and ASSU Senate Chairman Pat Flinn
in their impartial and thorough efforts to deal
with the recent improprieties and election law
violations. We are sure they will see the dif
ficult problems raised by these activities
through to their proper resolution.
In the meantime, we urge all individuals
who have any knowledge or information
about any of these activities to contact either
Murphy or the Daily. As for those persons
who were involved in these activities, we
hope they will ask themselves whether what
they did was truly worth it, and if the best
course of action is to come forward now. From
those who would be our elected officials and
those who would engage in political debate
on this campus we should certainly be able to
expect honesty and a concern for the rights
and reputations of others.
