Letter defamatory
I would like to reply to an anonym
ous letter folded into the Wed., Oct.
12 copies of The Stanford Daily.
That letter, entitled "Who's afraid
of the SOC slate?" was an effort to
smear the ASSU Senate campaign
that I was engaged in at the time. The
authors of that letter—added to many
copies of the Daily without authori

zation—hoped that my slate would
have no time to rebut the charges it
contained before close of polls in
that election. They were largely suc
cessful and that defamatory letter
probably cost us the election.
Specifically, that letter claimed my
slate had included an inaccurate dis
cussion of past senates and misin
formation in our literature. This is

not true.
We observed that the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), now incorpo
rated into the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC), had controlled the
Senate two years ago. We added that
that year was unproductive and
noted for its ugly infighting, which
prompted the following year's "joke
slate" landslide. We stand by that
analysis.
In our literature, written weeks be
fore the SOC slate was selected, we
felt it fair to warn the voters that in
every way SOC was the ideological
heir to the original ARC slate.
Further, I must decry the innuen
dos present in the insert letter:
1. We were not responsible for an
anonymous blue letter (since then
linked to the Livingston slate)
which circulated attacking the
SOC slate. We had our names on
everything we printed.
2. Not that it matters in relation to the
ASSU Senate, but I am not a con
servative; I happen to be a liberta
rian.
3. We did not tear down SOC's or
anyone elses banners, at UGLY or
elsewhere. Our banners were de
stroyed as well.
Finally, let me say the whole inci
dent only leaves me with a feeling of
sorrow. Despite a viewpoint by the
Daily calling the letter a "vicious
piece of hatred.. .the lowest form of

political trickery..." and urging
people to ignore the letter, the con
siderable damage done is probably
irreparable.

I praise Peter Bing and the rest of
the trustees for beginning to meet
with students on a regular basis
(Daily, Oct. 12).
Of course, this should have begun
long ago. Nevertheless, I am optimis
tic. It is absolutely essential that the
trustees personally confront the stu
dents. As long as they debate the
demands of the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
among themselves, they will make
absolutely no progress, since not
one member of the board is willing
to, or capable of, sympathetically
presenting progressive viewpoints
. . . yet.
Make no mistake, mass rallies are
essential for demonstrating consen
sus and for applying real pressure. In
the meantime, I am enthusiastic
about the prospect of altering the
worldview of certain individuals in
power.

In our literature, written weeks be
fore the SOC slate was selected, we
felt it fair to warn the voters that in
every way SOC was the ideological
heir to the original ARC slate.
Further, I must decry the innuen
dos present in the insert letter:
1. We were not responsible for an
anonymous blue letter (since then
linked to the Livingston slate)
which circulated attacking the
SOC slate. We had our names on
everything we printed.
2. Not that it matters in relation to the
ASSU Senate, but I am not a con
servative; I happen to be a liberta
rian.
3. We did not tear down SOC's or
anyone elses banners, at UGLY or
elsewhere. Our banners were de
stroyed as well.
Finally, let me say the whole inci
dent only leaves me with a feeling of
sorrow. Despite a viewpoint by the
Daily calling the letter a "vicious
piece of hatred.. .the lowest form of

political trickery..." and urging
people to ignore the letter, the con
siderable damage done is probably
irreparable.

Trustee action
I praise Peter Bing and the rest of
the trustees for beginning to meet
with students on a regular basis
(Daily, Oct. 12).
Of course, this should have begun
long ago. Nevertheless, I am optimis
tic. It is absolutely essential that the
trustees personally confront the stu
dents. As long as they debate the
demands of the Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
among themselves, they will make
absolutely no progress, since not
one member of the board is willing
to, or capable of, sympathetically
presenting progressive viewpoints
. . . yet.
Make no mistake, mass rallies are
essential for demonstrating consen
sus and for applying real pressure. In
the meantime, I am enthusiastic
about the prospect of altering the
worldview of certain individuals in
power.

Letter defamatory
I would like to reply to an anonym
ous letter folded into the Wed., Oct.
12 copies of The Stanford Daily.
That letter, entitled "Who's afraid
of the SOC slate?" was an effort to
smear the ASSU Senate campaign
that I was engaged in at the time. The
authors of that letter—added to many
copies of the Daily without authori

zation—hoped that my slate would
have no time to rebut the charges it
contained before close of polls in
that election. They were largely suc
cessful and that defamatory letter
probably cost us the election.
Specifically, that letter claimed my
slate had included an inaccurate dis
cussion of past senates and misin
formation in our literature. This is

not true.
We observed that the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), now incorpo
rated into the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC), had controlled the
Senate two years ago. We added that
that year was unproductive and
noted for its ugly infighting, which
prompted the following year's "joke
slate" landslide. We stand by that
analysis.
