"The worst thing was shooting the
pilot before our eyes. It was terri
ble," a bearded German in his 20s
said of the five days during which he
and 86 other hostages were held cap
tive.
He and others returning to Ger
many said pilot Juergen Schumann,
the only hostage to die during the
hijacking, was executed by the hijack
leader in front of the passengers at
South Yemen after he allegedly tried
to escape and was brought back by
Yemeni authorities.
Eighty of the passengers, many
looking haggard and fatigued, step
ped off a backup Lufthansa jet at
Frankfurt International Airport and
were led to a nearby canteen for
reunions with relatives. Then they
went to a large hanger to hold a
memorial service for Schumann.
Commandos at home
The scene was more jubilant at the
Bonn-Cologne airport, where
another jet brought home about 80
members of the German commando
squad.
Acting with surgical precision in
the predawn darkness at Mogadishu
airport, the commandos stormed the
hijacked Lufthansa 737 through
emergency exits, rescued all 86 hos
tages aboard and killed three of the
Arabic-speaking hijackers. The
fourth, a woman, was seriously
wounded.
Hours after reporting the raid,
German officials made the surprise
announcement that three terrorists
held in a German jail had killed
themselves and a fourth had tried
and failed.
Officials said Andreas Baader,.34,
and his mistress Gudrun Ensslin, 37,
were found dead in their cells at the
Stammheim maximum security
prison near Stuttgart. )an-Carl Raspe,
33, died in a hospital, and Irmgard
Moeller, 30, was rushed to a hospital,
they said.
Freedom demanded
The four had been among 11 jailed
German terrorists whose freedom
was demanded by the Lufthansa
hijackers along with two Arabs held
in Turkey and $15 million in ransom.
In the flurry of developments,
there was no word on the fate of
Hanns Martin Schleyer, the German
industrialist kidnaped in Cologne
Sept. 5. His kidnapers had vowed to
kill him Sunday unless the hijackers'
demands were met.
