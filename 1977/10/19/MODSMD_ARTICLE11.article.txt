# Panamanians deserve canal
## 
### 
In Friday's Daily (Oct. 14), David
Miller called for the Congress and
the American people to reject the
Panama Canal Treaty, stating that it
was a poor solution to the problem. I
noticed a number of contradictions
and a poor understanding of the his
tory of the canal throughout the arti
cle.
Miller must recognize that the
clause allowing the U.S. the right to
intervene to protect the neutrality of
the canal could certainly never be in
voked by the U.S. without causing an
uproar throughout the world. Such
an actwould jeopardize our relations
with Latin America, and certainly dis
rupt any further normalization of re
lations with Russia and China. Thus
the likelihood of intervention is very
low and was probably bargained into
the treaty to please the conservatives
at home.
Miller also states that since the tre
aty does not give full control of the
canal to Panama until the year 2000,
it would invite the Panamanians to
seize control of the canal before that
time. Therefore, he says, we must
reject the treaty. But what, may I ask,
will happen if the treaty is rejected?
The Panamanians would only be
more likely to forcibly seize the
canal, and more importantly, the

likelihood of terrorist attack would
dramatically increase.
It seems better to Miller to never
return the canal than to wait 23 years.
I agree that 23 years is too long to
wait, especially since by that time
many of the world's tankers will be
too large to be able to use the canal,
but the possibility of further negotia
tion to turn the canal over to Panama
before then would be much greater if
this treaty were approved.
Finally, Miller shows a simple lack
of understanding of the history of
U.S. involvement in Central
America. He states that "present
ownership titles are too often the
product of past military/feudal con
quests, not of original labor." He
thus trots out the old argument that
since we built it we should be able to
keep it.
That is the imperialist argument
that has been used for decades and is
pure hogwash. What gave us the

Paul Urla II
right to simply take control of the
land in that area and build the canal
in the first place? It was an act of pure
power for which we have recouped
our investment many times over, and
to defend that act by keeping the
canal is to ignore the realities of the
modern world.
To condemn the claim of the
Panamanian people to the canul as
the "crudest form of nationalism"
gets us nowhere. I think Millerwould
agree that the U.S. would not stand
for any similar arrangement on their
own territory, as the one which
Panama has put up with for so long,
so let's not be so quick to accuse
Panama of crude and chauvinistic
nationalism.
The treaty is not a perfect one. Far
from it. But it is a first step, and cer
tainly far better than to continue our
imperialist ways.
