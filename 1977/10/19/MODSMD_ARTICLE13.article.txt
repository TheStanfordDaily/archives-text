# Need to address real issues
## Kent State gym experience a nonissue 
### 
Mike Shuman

For students like myself, Kent State
is a reminder of many things: The
madness of U.S. involvement in Viet
nam, the illegal invasion of Cam
bodia, peaceful protestors lying in
pools of blood, our parents'callously
misguided belief that "they deserved
it,"the whitewash commissions, the
tampered juries, the acquitted kil
lers. These memories cut so close to
the bone, that we swell with tears
and renew our demands for radical
change.
Often these emotional traumas
produce the impetus for meaningful
political change. But political
emotionalism can leave us groping
for any cause, and sometimes we
blindly support the wrong cause. Un
fortunately, Kent State recently de
monstrated this lesson when its stu
dent body wasted five months of
precious energy on a virtual nonis
sue â€” the building of a new gym. *
I visited Kent State last May 4,
exactly seven years after the 1970
shootings. A group calling itself the
May 4 Coalition organized vigils,

prayer ceremonies, marchers and
speakers to show the world that four
unavenged murders had not been
forgotten.
The old gymnasium was nearly full
as the first speakers recalled that fatal
day. They recalled how the National
Guard dispersed a peaceful rally with
tear gas and how G-troop about
faced to shoot the "more vocal" stu
dents in a parking lot several
hundred feet away. One speaker re
membered how Governor James
Rhodes came to Kent the day before
the massacre and denounced de
monstrators as "worse than
brownshirts." Everyone emphasized
that no Guardsman or Ohio official
had yet been convicted of anything.
So far, culpability has only been
placed upon the unarmed students.
Then one speaker shifted the sub
ject away from justice to the gym. He
briefly explained why the imminent
building of a new gym over the
shooting site was so deplorable: The
same aloof Ohio and Kent State offi
cials who had set the stage for vio

lence in 1970 and for seven years had
blocked prosecution of Guardsmen,
their commanders and irresponsible
politicians were now on the verge of
desecrating what many deemed a
sacred landmark. Symbolically, the
Watergate-bred cover-up paranoia
loomed large. With the wave of a six
million dollar wand, officials would
not entomb the major reminder of
their complicity.
Noisy crowd
At first, the otherwise noisy crowd
seemed quite subdued, indicating to
me that this issue was either new or
unimportant. But the crowd gradu
ally became more responsive and
each successive speaker fed more
gym rhetorrc to the anxious masses.
Taking note, the remaining speakers
scribbled new passages into their
prepared speeches. One Kent alum
nus, a writer for Counterspy
magazine, abandoned his speech en
tirely and proclaimed, "I'm pissed!"
Then comedian Dick Gregory
promised to drink only fruit juices
until the gym was stopped. Mean
while, a passing voice mentioned
that Gregory was on "two or three"
fruit juice diets already. The near hys
teria culminated in lawyer William
Kunstler urging the students to
throw themselves in front of the trac
tors if necessary.
My emotions were feverish and for
a few moments I, too, believed that
the survival of humanity depended
upon thwarting this building project.
I marched around the campus with
some 2000 others, gained a fair mea
sure of composure and decided to
scrutinize the site of the shootings.
An editor for the Cleveland Press
gave me an impromptu tour. He
pointed out that the gym was not
being built in the pagoda or the
parking lot areas. The actual site of
the Kent State tragedy would be vir
tually unaffected by the gym. How
ironic, I thought, that the actual
structure of this peripheral political
dispute would in fact be located at
the utmost periphery of the shooting
site.
Waste of time
One must regret how much time,
energy and money the students
wasted on this issue. After May 4, an
enormous school campaign was be
gun. Lengthy litigation ensued while

a miniature tent city grew on the gym
site. The Department of the Interior
was requested to declare the site a
national landmark and declined. Far
away from Ohio, bumper stickers
proclaimed, "Stop the Gym!" The
court efforts ended when a U.S. Sup
reme Court justice refused to enjoin
the project. Today, the gym is being
built.
One wonders if all this anti-gym
energy could have been used more
productively. An obvious example of
an alternative strategy is voting and
campaigning. Too traditional? Well
consider that the number of Kent
State students who didn't vote in the
1974 election could have turned
around a razor close election and
removed from power their ar
chenemy, Governor Rhodes. Also
there was the scarcely noticed Sep
tember news that the Sixth U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals ordered a ret
rial for Rhodes, state officials and the
National Guardsmen named in the
victims' $46 million damage suit. This
case will need massive public sup
port. Will the preoccupied students
have the time to organize it?
There is a lesson for us at Stanford
to learn from this Kent State experi
ence. Whether the issue is university
investment policy, South Africa, nuc
lear power, affirmative action or
minority admissions, activists must
be careful to choose and work to
ward attainable goals. A group action
that is personally satisfying is not
necessarily effective or valuable.
Symbolic victories are easier to ac
complish than solutions to complex
substantive issues. Activist strategies
must be carefully plotted. Because
once a path is taken, constraints in
time and energy usually foreclose
other strategies at least temporarily.
While hardly condoning the build
ing of a gym near (not on) the shoot
ing site, I must emphasize that it was
the wrong issue. It merely diverted
attention needed to address the real
issues of justice. For we must re
member that, even if the peripheral
gym at Kent State was stopped, the
killers of Allison Krause, Sandra
Scheuer, Jeffrey Miller and William
Schroeder would still be at large.
