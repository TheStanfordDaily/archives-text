Get Program Fee refund
Now that the Stanford Organizing Committee
(SOC) slate has landed a majority in the ASSU
Senate, I urge all students who feel that their in
terests are not represented by this group to trot up
to the ASSU office before Friday and take back
their dollar from the Program Fee.
This action will limit the amount of money the
SOC can channel to special interest groups. It is
unfortunate that certain other organizations may
lose support by this action, but considering the
make-up of the Senate this year, it is unlikely that
these organizations would have been approp
riated money from the program fund anyway.

Objection to Livingston's comment
I take strong objection to Dan Livingston's
comment (Daily, Oct. 17) that if the blue Conserva
tive Students' Union (CSU) leaflet is charged as a
campaign expense it should be charged against all
31 non-SOC (Stanford Organizing Committee)
candidates. I am sure that such an event could
never take place, but as a student and senate can
didate I am disgusted by the suggestion and the
whole situation surrounding it.

It is ludicrous to even think of charging candi
dates who had nothing to do with this leaflet,
especially when most of us would have refused to
be a part of such a secretive, low-handed project
had we been told about it.
I feel that the purpose of a campaign and of
campaign literature is to build up one's own im
age, not to tear down other candidates. If all can
didates had felt this way this would have been a
much more ethical campaign, rather than the
negative one it turned out to be.
Perhaps Livingston, ef al. were afraid that SOC
was not representative of the campus. How,
though, could they assume that their opinions
were any more representative? Livingston, your
campaign literature spoke of responsibility and
acting on principles'. Please take responsibility for
all your expenditures.

Open letter to Dan Livingston
Now that I am about to be one of your many
undergraduate constituents, I feel entitled to a
written explanation in the Daily of the numerous

improprieties in the conduct of your slate and of
your "campaign manager" in the recent ASSU se
nate election. I have a few questions:
1) If the blue sheet was so unimportant, why did
your campaign manager attempt to deny any
foreknowledge on your part of the leaflet?
2) If the document was so unimportant, why did
Don Barton instruct Kevin Childress to say that he
did not pick up the pamphlet?
3) Is it mere coincidence that the 10 students
who distributed the pamphlet were members of
the Conservative Students' Union (CSU) and of
Sigma Chi (organizations which you are a member
of)?
4) Could you explain the statement, "I entirely
approved of the fl.yer" — what did your approval
entail?
Finally, your assertion that, "There's no way it
can be charged to us. How can it possibly be part
of our campaign? We didn't print it with our names
and we didn't distribute it with our names," seems
to be at best an artificial distinction — a minor
technicality which in no way lessens your respon
sibility in the matter.
I look forward to your response to these and
other questions.
