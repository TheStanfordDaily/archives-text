## Cops stymied in gem dealer case 
### 
San Juan, Puerto Rico (AP) —
Each time police dig up
another grave in an effort to
find the body of a New York
diamond dealer who disap
peared here last summer, cri
tics want to know why they
didn't dig deeper to solve a
series of diamond dealer mur
ders.
A badly burned, bullet
riddled body that officials
found July 29 and buried
shortly thereafter — without an
investigation — is believed to
be that of Abraham
Shafizadeh, a diamond dealer
who was carrying $250,000 in
gems when he disappeared
July 28.
Officials now are unable to
locate the body after digging
up four graves in the attempt.
But this is only one of the many
problems confronting au
thorities in the case.
Police also have not solved
the killings of two other
diamond brokers that occur
red within months of each
other in 1974. As a result,
charges of police bungling and
negligence are growing.
Unexplainedly:
—Ballistics tests were never
done after the 1974 killings,
even though the two victims,
both of whom carried gems,
were gunned down in similar
fashion, both with a .38-caliber
revolver. The body believed to
be Shafizadeh's also was shot
with a .38.
—Key witnesses and sus
pects, later found by reporters,
were not questioned.
—Shafizadeh's disappear
ance was never tied to the twin
1974 killings.
—Shafizadeh's brother, who
rushed here from Chicago
after his brother disappeared,
was never told about the July 29
slaying.
—Shafizadeh's brother told
authorities that the missing
jeweler's fingerprints were on
file with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in
Washington because of his
immigrant status. The finger
print report has yet to show up
here. Police deny a local pub
lished report that the wrong
records were sent.
—Last week, Col. Hector
Lugo, chief investigator in the
inquiry, sent a long-awaited
report to the Puerto Rico Se
nate about the narcotics racket
here. He first released the re
port Sept. 9, but it was rejected
because it lacked full details on
the island's organized crime
activity. Lugo reportedly de
murred at providing the infor
mation the first time around,
claiming he would lose his life
in underworld reprisals. There
has been published specula

tion that the gem killings are
mob-related.
—One day last week, one of
the chief investigators said au
thorities were "closing in" on
the killers. The next day, his
boss said that was "absurd."
Reporters who have been
sent here to track down the
story say the confusion is typi
cal of authorities' handling of
the case.
What brought the reporters
here from the U.S. mainland
were reports that a body found
here could be that of
Shafizadeh, issued shortly
after another diamond dealer
was suffocated and found stuf
fed in a box in the diamond
district in New York.
That incident also focused
attention on what police have
been doing — or have not been
doing — to solve the series of
killings.
Last Saturday, the extent of
the local police's difficulties,
including the supposedly elite
group handling the investiga
tion, became fully known.
It was then that Dr. Rafael
Criado, chief pathologist of the
Institute of Legal Medicine, in
terrupted his autopsy of a body
thought to be Shafizadeh's and
shouted: "We've got the
wrong body!"
The body sent to Dr. Criado
for the autopsy had no gunshot
wounds and was not burned.
Dr. Criado also said that the
exhumed body sent to him had
10 fingers, while all but two
fingers had been burned from
the body found July 29. The
pathologist studied three other
bodies and determined that
none of them could have been

Shafizadeh.
Later that day, after the mis
take was reported, Luis Seb
ron, superintendent of the
cemetery from which the
bodies were dug up declared:
"What can I say? There's no
two ways about it. We buried
four bodies, on the fourth of
August and two on the 12th.
We can't identify them; we
only bury them and record
them."
However, evidence suggests
that they can't record them

either, at least not accurately.
At the potters' cemetery where
the bodies were dug up, two
record books are kept. They do
not agree with one another.
Tuesday, an investigator said
authorities "are trying to figure
out where they are going to dig
next." Officials have said they
might exhume four more
bodies.
Dr. Criado, meanwhile, said
he knew of only one more
body to examine that possibly
could be Shafizadeh's.
