# Berkeley prof admits errors in testing cancer linked pesticide
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — A Uni
versity of California professor
admitted yesterday that re
searchers erred 20 years ago in
not doing more tests on a pes
ticide now believed a cancer
agent and linked to sterility
among dozens of chemical
workers.
Charles Hine, a clinical pro
fessor of occupational and en
vironmental medicine, also
said the federal standards set in
1961 for handling the chemical
and in effect until this past Au
gust were probably unsafe.
Those standards were based
on a 1961 research report pub
lished by Hine and other re
searchers. Their work was sub
sidized by the Shell Oil Co. and
the Dow Chemical Co., the two
domestic producers of the pes
ticide dibromochloropropane
or DBCP.

Its production was halted in
August when tests showed
many of the workers showed
zero or abnormally low sperm
counts.
In the third of four days of
hearings on the pesticide,
Hine said researchers erred by
suggesting standards for
worker exposure to DBCP
without proving that the level
of exposure would be harm
less.
Animal studies found that
five parts per million DBCP
were slightly harmful, so the
exposure level for workers was
set at one part per million
(ppm).
That one ppm dose, how
ever, was never given to ani
mals to make sure it would
have no detrimental effect on
them.
"It was probably ill-advised
and stupid not to go to a no
effect level," he said. "I think
we should have gone to a no
effect level, and I made an
error on this thing.
"With the present data rela
tive to the effect we have got
ten from human exposure, I
would be concerned myself
that one part per million is a
safe and reasonable level," he
said.
"I think this is probably too
high a level," he added.
Production of DBCP began
in 1955 at Shell Oil Co.'s De
nver plant. Until August of this
year, the federal standards re
quired that Shell and Dow pre
vent workers from .inhaling
more than one part per million
DBCP on average over 24
hours. The assumption was
that level was safe.
But in August, after tests
found many employes who
worked with DBCP were
sterile, the federal standard
was lowered to 10 parts per bill
ion, a 100-fold reduction.
Officials of the California

Department of Industrial Rela
tions, which is conducting the
DBCP hearings, said they were
disturbed that Hine's research
appeared to be sponsored by
the University of California,
when actually it was paid for by
Shell and Dow.
Hine also has been a paid
part-time consultant for Shell
since 1947, which is when he
began working for the univer
sity.
DBCP is used by farmers to
kill nematodes, tiny worms
that gnaw at crop roots and
stunt growth.
Besides Denver, cities where
it has been produced include
Mobile, Ala.; Magnolia, Ark.;
Lathrop, Calif, and Midland,
Mich.
Since August, federal agen
cies have tightened DBCP reg
ulations and California has
banned its sale or use. The U.S.
Environmental Protection
Agency also has warned that
residues of the pesticide on
produce could cause new
cases of cancer among Ameri
cans.

gust were probably unsafe.
Those standards were based
on a 1961 research report pub
lished by Hine and other re
searchers. Their work was sub
sidized by the Shell Oil Co. and
the Dow Chemical Co., the two
domestic producers of the pes
ticide dibromochloropropane
or DBCP.

Its production was halted in
August when tests showed
many of the workers showed
zero or abnormally low sperm
counts.
In the third of four days of
hearings on the pesticide,
Hine said researchers erred by
suggesting standards for
worker exposure to DBCP
without proving that the level
of exposure would be harm
less.
Animal studies found that
five parts per million DBCP
were slightly harmful, so the
exposure level for workers was
set at one part per million
(ppm).
That one ppm dose, how
ever, was never given to ani
mals to make sure it would
have no detrimental effect on
them.
"It was probably ill-advised
and stupid not to go to a no
effect level," he said. "I think
we should have gone to a no
effect level, and I made an
error on this thing.
"With the present data rela
tive to the effect we have got
ten from human exposure, I
would be concerned myself
that one part per million is a
safe and reasonable level," he
said.
"I think this is probably too
high a level," he added.
Production of DBCP began
in 1955 at Shell Oil Co.'s De
nver plant. Until August of this
year, the federal standards re
quired that Shell and Dow pre
vent workers from .inhaling
more than one part per million
DBCP on average over 24
hours. The assumption was
that level was safe.
But in August, after tests
found many employes who
worked with DBCP were
sterile, the federal standard
was lowered to 10 parts per bill
ion, a 100-fold reduction.
Officials of the California

Department of Industrial Rela
tions, which is conducting the
DBCP hearings, said they were
disturbed that Hine's research
appeared to be sponsored by
the University of California,
when actually it was paid for by
Shell and Dow.
Hine also has been a paid
part-time consultant for Shell
since 1947, which is when he
began working for the univer
sity.
DBCP is used by farmers to
kill nematodes, tiny worms
that gnaw at crop roots and
stunt growth.
Besides Denver, cities where
it has been produced include
Mobile, Ala.; Magnolia, Ark.;
Lathrop, Calif, and Midland,
Mich.
Since August, federal agen
cies have tightened DBCP reg
ulations and California has
banned its sale or use. The U.S.
Environmental Protection
Agency also has warned that
residues of the pesticide on
produce could cause new
cases of cancer among Ameri
cans.
San Francisco (AP) — A Uni
versity of California professor
admitted yesterday that re
searchers erred 20 years ago in
not doing more tests on a pes
ticide now believed a cancer
agent and linked to sterility
among dozens of chemical
workers.
Charles Hine, a clinical pro
fessor of occupational and en
vironmental medicine, also
said the federal standards set in
1961 for handling the chemical
and in effect until this past Au
gust were probably unsafe.
