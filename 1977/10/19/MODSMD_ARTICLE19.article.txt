Former Stanford guard Mike Bratz made the
final cut of the NBA's Phoenix Suns Tuesday,
then suited up for the season opener against the
Golden State Warriors last night.
A 1977 All-Pacific-8 basketball selection, Bratz
sweated through five days of July rookie camp,
two months of summer league play in southern
California and six weeks of fall practice before
being notified that he had made the final 12-
player Phoenix roster.
"I'm really pleased," Bratz said over the
phone yesterday before the game with Golden
State. "It was a rough summer but it was all
worth it now."
Last year's Stanford captain, Bratz was one of
five players competing for the final three spots
on the Suns. Phoenix coach John MacLeod gave
Bratz the good news Tuesday.
"I could be playing every game or I may not
play for two or three weeks. MacLeod told me I
would have to wait and see," Bratz said.
Bratz joins veterans Paul Westphal, Ronnie
Lee and Don Buse in the Sun backcourt.
"We all can handle the ball and we all can
score," Bratz said of the Phoenix quartet of
guards.
"We all have to run the offense and play good
defense."
Bratz came to Stanford after a year at Allan
Hancock Junior College where he led his team
to the 1974 California junior college champion
ships.
Used intermittently his first year on the Farm,
Bratz was the unquestioned floor leader his last
two seasons. Last year he averaged 19.6 points a
game.
Bratz said yesterday that he had spent the
summer working his offense and defense to fit
the game philosophy used in Phoenix.
Hard-working Bratz joins Claude Terry and
Rich Kelly as Stanford's current representatives
in professional basketball.
