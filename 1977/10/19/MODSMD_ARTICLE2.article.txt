# Police initiate bike registration
## 
### Charlie Smith 
In an effort to ease the identifica
tion of stolen bicycles, the Stanford
Bicycle Security Program will set up a
bicycle registration booth in White
Plaza tomorrow between 10 a.m. and
6 p.m.
Public Safety Department Detec
tive Carl Gielitz said he hopes "a lot
more (persons) th?n we normally
get" will come to register their bikes.
Currently bikes can be registered
every afternoon from 4 to 6 p.m.
Since last Jan. 1, 260 bicycles have
been reported stolen here. Of these,
23 were valued at over $200 and were
considered grand thefts.
Bike thefts are the greatest theft
problem with which the police have
to deal, Gielitz said.
Gielitz said that since January, 123
bikes have been found but only 30
returned to their owners. The return
figure, however, is higher than in
past years.

Gielitz explained that although "a
few owners moved away and left no
forwarding address," the main
reason so few were returned was be
cause "most bikes weren't regis
tered."
Further, Gielitz said that of the re
gistered bikes found, every original
owner was either sent a letter or con
tacted personally.

Gielitz said the reason for the small
number of arrests (less than five this
year) was that "people who spotted a
suspicious circumstance would
watch, instead of giving us a call."
The problem was that suspects
would drive away before a witness
called the police, Gielitz said.
Gielitz said most s'.olen bikes were
locked to themselves, allowing
thieves to lift them into vans and cart
them off campus. Gielitz said a bike
chained through both tires, the
frame and to a solid object would
normally be safe.
He added, "a key lock is recom
mended since a combination lock
can be broken much more easily."
One-half to three-quarter inch wide
chain is also recommended. It
should be locked as high on the bike
as possible, forcing a thief to raise a
chain cutter into full view of pas
sersby.
Gielitz encouraged all cyclists to
register their bikes. Registration
costs $2 and, under California Vehi
cle Code Section 39000, all bikes
must be licensed.
Gielitz said cyclists should carry
their registration number, frame
number, and model name with them
at all times; if a bicycle is stolen, it
can be reported immediately to the
police.
Fast reporting, he said, is the way
every bicycle arrest has been made
this year. Without a license, it be
comes difficult if not impossible to
find or identify a stolen bike.

register their bikes. Registration
costs $2 and, under California Vehi
cle Code Section 39000, all bikes
must be licensed.
Gielitz said cyclists should carry
their registration number, frame
number, and model name with them
at all times; if a bicycle is stolen, it
can be reported immediately to the
police.
Fast reporting, he said, is the way
every bicycle arrest has been made
this year. Without a license, it be
comes difficult if not impossible to
find or identify a stolen bike.
In an effort to ease the identifica
tion of stolen bicycles, the Stanford
Bicycle Security Program will set up a
bicycle registration booth in White
Plaza tomorrow between 10 a.m. and
6 p.m.
Public Safety Department Detec
tive Carl Gielitz said he hopes "a lot
more (persons) th?n we normally
get" will come to register their bikes.
Currently bikes can be registered
every afternoon from 4 to 6 p.m.
Since last Jan. 1, 260 bicycles have
been reported stolen here. Of these,
23 were valued at over $200 and were
considered grand thefts.
Bike thefts are the greatest theft
problem with which the police have
to deal, Gielitz said.
Gielitz said that since January, 123
bikes have been found but only 30
returned to their owners. The return
figure, however, is higher than in
past years.

Gielitz explained that although "a
few owners moved away and left no
forwarding address," the main
reason so few were returned was be
cause "most bikes weren't regis
tered."
Further, Gielitz said that of the re
gistered bikes found, every original
owner was either sent a letter or con
tacted personally.

Gielitz said the reason for the small
number of arrests (less than five this
year) was that "people who spotted a
suspicious circumstance would
watch, instead of giving us a call."
The problem was that suspects
would drive away before a witness
called the police, Gielitz said.
Gielitz said most s'.olen bikes were
locked to themselves, allowing
thieves to lift them into vans and cart
them off campus. Gielitz said a bike
chained through both tires, the
frame and to a solid object would
normally be safe.
He added, "a key lock is recom
mended since a combination lock
can be broken much more easily."
One-half to three-quarter inch wide
chain is also recommended. It
should be locked as high on the bike
as possible, forcing a thief to raise a
chain cutter into full view of pas
sersby.
