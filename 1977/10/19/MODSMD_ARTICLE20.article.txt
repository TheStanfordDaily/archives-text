# Spikers in crucial match
## 
### Bill Burger 
Stanford volleyball coach Art
Lambert hopes his team has
matured some since last Fri
day's 15-6, 15-3, 15-3 loss to
(JSC, the nation's No. 1-ranked
team.
Tomorrow Lambert finds out
whether his hopes will
materialize as the Cards take
on San Jose State at 8 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
"We've got to beat San Jose
State," said Lambert after
Monday afternoon's practice.
"They were the league favorite
before the season. It would be
a big win."
Lambert described San Jose
State as a "very quick team that
is a little more sophisticated
than we are." San Jose State
has two women more than 25
years old who give them more
experience than Stanford's
team, Lambert said.
"We had a good practice for
a Monday," said Lambert after

the workout. "We had a little
chat after the last loss (to USC)
and it showed; they (the
players) were working very
hard today."
This year's squad is 10-2 for
the season, the two losses
coming against USC and
UCLA, the No. 1- and No.
3-ranked teams in the country.
Stanford's most impressive
victory was against Pepper
dine, the nation's N0.4-ranked
team. That victory led the
Cards to their first tournament
win ever at San Jose State on
Oct. 1.

Lambert has said all season
that this year's team has the po
tential to be a "very good vol
leyball team." Considering
that there is only one senior
(Shawn Hoover) and two
juniors (Carol Meihausand Liz
Hughes) on the 14-player ros
ter, Stanford will have a poten
tially good team for some time
to come.
A strong showing against San
lose State tomorrow, however,
may signal that Stanford vol
leyball fans will not havetowait
long before their team is
worthy of a national ranking.
