# Band announcer confesses all to Daily reporter
## Old and crusty Hal recalls the Band in days of yore 
### John Nielsen 
In addition to being one of the more intel
ligent, humorous and good-natured persons
on the face of the earth, Hal Michelson is the
announcer for the Stanford Band. Recently
the Daily exposed Hal to a tape recorder and
attempted to capitalize on his eloquence. It
worked exactly as we planned - what follows
is an edited account.
Daily: How do you work this thing?
Hal: Push P and R, and then ask if I think the
Band has changed.
Daily: P and R. Hmm. P and R . . . I think the
batteries are dead.
Hal: No that's not it. Put the tape in first.
Daily: I was supposed to bring a tape?
Hal: OK. Never mind. I'll do it myself . . .
there. Now, did you ask how I thought the
Band had changed? Good question. Yes, in
deed it did, and I'll tell about it.
The most visible change — if someone had
been in the Aleutians for six or eight years
and was just now returning — would be that
women are now members of the Band. In
the fall of '69 when I first became involved

with them that would have been incom
prehensible. In the fall of '69 the Band con
sisted of males, who used it as a substitute
for cold showers or for shooting baskets on a
Saturday night. It was a form of sublimation
— a male release of sexual tension. A night
out with the Band was a night out with the

boys, and I have to say that much of our
behavior today reflects that arrested stage of
development.
Daily: What?
Hal: I said, much of our behavior today re
flects that arrested stage of development,
which implies that women haven't had all
that radical an effect. I will elaborate. In a
way that is incomprehensible to me, women
have followed the old patterns of behavior,
even though the reasons for doing so no
longer exist. Because there are coed dorms
on campus, because the Band itself is coed,
because the Band does not consist of the
losers it consisted of when I was an under
graduate, the need for the kind of sublima
tion and release I have spoken of has rather
passed us by.
Daily: Is this on?
Hal: Still, some things have changed, be
haviorally speaking. For instance, in the old
days the Band was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and that is no
longer the case. In the old days a central
focus of activity was to guard the Band Shak
and, by extension, the campus in Big Came
week, as we had to keep the Cal weenies
from acts of vandalism. People then ran
around with walkie-talkies, or slept over
night in the Shak to keep the weenies from
breaking in and stealing things.
These days the Band frankly hasn't the
time for those kinds of activities. They've
become much more a part of the
mainstream of campus life, and in that sense
they've become part of the campus estab
lishment.
That in itself is a turnaround. When I was a
freshman the campus establishment was the
Ax Comm (Axe Committee), which con
sisted of all these cashmere-sweater types
from La Jolla and Pasadena and Piedmont.
The Band got the turkeys and the slide-rule
carriers and bookish and retiring types (or
unbookish but nevertheless unsociable
types) who wouldn't have been part of the
social establishment.
Well, those fashionable folks are gone
now, and in their stead the Band — and I
hate to say it — has become the fashionable
establishment. The paramilitary types with
their walkie talkies are no longer, as alumni
rallies have taken their place.
Daily: Maybe I should get an extension
chord.
Hal: That reminds me.
The Band, and particularly the Band staff,
has for years been hustling the pompon dol
lies. The band has pursued them with a un
iform and startling lack of success. The
struggle was immortalized a few years ago
when I was a senior when a number of en
terprising sophomores made Susan Taylor's
bicycle seat kind of a trophy — it was stolen

off of her bicycle and then ceremoniously
presented to Ken Peterson, who was then
the manager. It was repeatedly stolen from
her bicycle that year.
Still, to my observation the women who
have been Stanford Dollies over the years
have tended to become doctors and lawyers
and MBAs with as much, if not greater, fre
quency than their fellow students. They are
highly motivated, highly organized,
achievement-minded people and you
shouldn't be fooled by the fact that some of
them are gorgeous.
In the same sense, these comments ought
not imply that the Band staff lacks redeem
ing social value. I can tell you, for instance,
that they work a hell of a lot harder than the
ASSU Council of Presidents (Hal was on the
COP as an undergraduate in 1970).
Are you listening to me?
Daily: Yeah. Is this on?
Hal: Perhaps some personal data would be
in order at this point.
I came to Stanford in the fall of '67, and
though I couldn't stand the taste of beer
when a fresnman or sophomore and didn't
care much for bands or parties either (I was
more inclined than anything else to strut off
to the undergraduate library on a Friday or
Saturday night); despite all this I was a Band

groupie all along. During my junior year the
then-announcer, a fellow named Don Piatt,
was called away on a MacNamara Fellow
ship. I filled in, and that began an eight-year
association.
I can tell you that the first year I did it I was
of pretty poor quality — the whole first year I
didn't know how to work the microphone.
And I don't mean learning to speak into it for
greatest effect either, I mean working the
switch that turns it on. I had trouble holding
the switch open. . . .
Daily: Excuse me, sir, but I was under the
impression that this was my interview. I will
ask the questions, if you please. Now, tell us
about the worst single Band formation ■you
have ever seen, and why you regret ever
having associated yourself with them in the
first place. Also, the truth about Rich
Johnson's bald spot, please.
Hal: I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've suppressed all
that.
Daily: Oh. Well. . . .
Hal: I will say this about the Band, however,
and then I think I'll be leaving:
Marching into the Rose Parade certainly
ranks among great moments in Band history
as it provided the final proof of the advan
tages that accrue from being other than a
precision-oriented marching band. You see,
the predominant sensation one gets in the
Rose Parade is the sensation of following
horses — horses that tend to leave tangible
and olifactory evidence of their passage be
hind them. Others had trouble, but we were
able to stride through the steaming mounds
with relative ease.
There are other memorable incidents, of
course — another of my favorites involves a
Band visit to Disneyland. As far as I know we
are no longer allowed within the confines of
the Magic Kingdom — they appear in
terested in catering to a more clean-cut au
dience — but we did hit it full force once.
After wandering around in knots of three
or four for the most part of the day, the
Bandsmen gathered at a relatively obscure
attraction called the Storybook Canal Ride.
Being a "g" or "h" ticket there wasn't much
competition, and when the young lady that
normally narrates the ride saw that she had
only Band people (and no real human be
ings), she turned the microphone over to
them.
I was then forced by peer pressure to take
the instrument into my humble and trembl
ing hands and thereupon to describe the
scenery from a slightly different perspective.
After all, when you consider Snow White
alone in the forest with seven dwarves the
possibilities are really staggering.
Daily: That's pretty funny. You must be
pretty funny up there in the press box.
Hal: In a way, perhaps, but the funniest an

nouncers to watch have been the middle
aged speech teachers who do halftimes for
such schools as Ohio State. As I recall the
Ohio State band announcer dressed up in
grey militaristic Ohio State band regalia, in
cluding the big hairbrush on the front of his
cap, and he had an assistant tapping him on
the shoulder to cue him to talk. They also
tend to have gorgeous ring-bound
notebooks with graph paper diagramming
each formation. Also elegantly typed scripts.
I enjoy watching that, even though I prefer
writing my script on the back of an envelope
sometime around a half hour before the
game starts.

hate to say it — has become the fashionable
establishment. The paramilitary types with
their walkie talkies are no longer, as alumni
rallies have taken their place.
Daily: Maybe I should get an extension
chord.
Hal: That reminds me.
The Band, and particularly the Band staff,
has for years been hustling the pompon dol
lies. The band has pursued them with a un
iform and startling lack of success. The
struggle was immortalized a few years ago
when I was a senior when a number of en
terprising sophomores made Susan Taylor's
bicycle seat kind of a trophy — it was stolen

off of her bicycle and then ceremoniously
presented to Ken Peterson, who was then
the manager. It was repeatedly stolen from
her bicycle that year.
Still, to my observation the women who
have been Stanford Dollies over the years
have tended to become doctors and lawyers
and MBAs with as much, if not greater, fre
quency than their fellow students. They are
highly motivated, highly organized,
achievement-minded people and you
shouldn't be fooled by the fact that some of
them are gorgeous.
In the same sense, these comments ought
not imply that the Band staff lacks redeem
ing social value. I can tell you, for instance,
that they work a hell of a lot harder than the
ASSU Council of Presidents (Hal was on the
COP as an undergraduate in 1970).
Are you listening to me?
Daily: Yeah. Is this on?
Hal: Perhaps some personal data would be
in order at this point.
I came to Stanford in the fall of '67, and
though I couldn't stand the taste of beer
when a fresnman or sophomore and didn't
care much for bands or parties either (I was
more inclined than anything else to strut off
to the undergraduate library on a Friday or
Saturday night); despite all this I was a Band

groupie all along. During my junior year the
then-announcer, a fellow named Don Piatt,
was called away on a MacNamara Fellow
ship. I filled in, and that began an eight-year
association.
I can tell you that the first year I did it I was
of pretty poor quality — the whole first year I
didn't know how to work the microphone.
And I don't mean learning to speak into it for
greatest effect either, I mean working the
switch that turns it on. I had trouble holding
the switch open. . . .
Daily: Excuse me, sir, but I was under the
impression that this was my interview. I will
ask the questions, if you please. Now, tell us
about the worst single Band formation ■you
have ever seen, and why you regret ever
having associated yourself with them in the
first place. Also, the truth about Rich
Johnson's bald spot, please.
Hal: I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've suppressed all
that.
Daily: Oh. Well. . . .
Hal: I will say this about the Band, however,
and then I think I'll be leaving:
Marching into the Rose Parade certainly
ranks among great moments in Band history
as it provided the final proof of the advan
tages that accrue from being other than a
precision-oriented marching band. You see,
the predominant sensation one gets in the
Rose Parade is the sensation of following
horses — horses that tend to leave tangible
and olifactory evidence of their passage be
hind them. Others had trouble, but we were
able to stride through the steaming mounds
with relative ease.
There are other memorable incidents, of
course — another of my favorites involves a
Band visit to Disneyland. As far as I know we
are no longer allowed within the confines of
the Magic Kingdom — they appear in
terested in catering to a more clean-cut au
dience — but we did hit it full force once.
After wandering around in knots of three
or four for the most part of the day, the
Bandsmen gathered at a relatively obscure
attraction called the Storybook Canal Ride.
Being a "g" or "h" ticket there wasn't much
competition, and when the young lady that
normally narrates the ride saw that she had
only Band people (and no real human be
ings), she turned the microphone over to
them.
I was then forced by peer pressure to take
the instrument into my humble and trembl
ing hands and thereupon to describe the
scenery from a slightly different perspective.
After all, when you consider Snow White
alone in the forest with seven dwarves the
possibilities are really staggering.
Daily: That's pretty funny. You must be
pretty funny up there in the press box.
Hal: In a way, perhaps, but the funniest an

nouncers to watch have been the middle
aged speech teachers who do halftimes for
such schools as Ohio State. As I recall the
Ohio State band announcer dressed up in
grey militaristic Ohio State band regalia, in
cluding the big hairbrush on the front of his
cap, and he had an assistant tapping him on
the shoulder to cue him to talk. They also
tend to have gorgeous ring-bound
notebooks with graph paper diagramming
each formation. Also elegantly typed scripts.
I enjoy watching that, even though I prefer
writing my script on the back of an envelope
sometime around a half hour before the
game starts.


... it was a substitute for
cold showers or for shooting
baskets on a Saturday night.
It was a form of sublimation
-a release of sexual tension
-and I have to say that much
of our behavior in the Band
today reflects that arrested
stage of development.


. . . these days the Band is in
many respects a central
focus of-and I hate to say it
- fashionable activity on
campus. Nothing is more es
tablishment oriented than
playing for alumni rallies,
and to my knowledge the
band never misses an alumni
rally these days. . . .


. . . marching in the Rose
Parade certainly ranks
among the great moments in
Band history. We had the
advantage of not being a
precision-oriented band,
and that helped, since the
predominant sensation that
one gets in the parade is the
sensation of walking behind
horses.
In addition to being one of the more intel
ligent, humorous and good-natured persons
on the face of the earth, Hal Michelson is the
announcer for the Stanford Band. Recently
the Daily exposed Hal to a tape recorder and
attempted to capitalize on his eloquence. It
worked exactly as we planned - what follows
is an edited account.
Daily: How do you work this thing?
Hal: Push P and R, and then ask if I think the
Band has changed.
Daily: P and R. Hmm. P and R . . . I think the
batteries are dead.
Hal: No that's not it. Put the tape in first.
Daily: I was supposed to bring a tape?
Hal: OK. Never mind. I'll do it myself . . .
there. Now, did you ask how I thought the
Band had changed? Good question. Yes, in
deed it did, and I'll tell about it.
The most visible change — if someone had
been in the Aleutians for six or eight years
and was just now returning — would be that
women are now members of the Band. In
the fall of '69 when I first became involved

with them that would have been incom
prehensible. In the fall of '69 the Band con
sisted of males, who used it as a substitute
for cold showers or for shooting baskets on a
Saturday night. It was a form of sublimation
— a male release of sexual tension. A night
out with the Band was a night out with the

boys, and I have to say that much of our
behavior today reflects that arrested stage of
development.
Daily: What?
Hal: I said, much of our behavior today re
flects that arrested stage of development,
which implies that women haven't had all
that radical an effect. I will elaborate. In a
way that is incomprehensible to me, women
have followed the old patterns of behavior,
even though the reasons for doing so no
longer exist. Because there are coed dorms
on campus, because the Band itself is coed,
because the Band does not consist of the
losers it consisted of when I was an under
graduate, the need for the kind of sublima
tion and release I have spoken of has rather
passed us by.
Daily: Is this on?
Hal: Still, some things have changed, be
haviorally speaking. For instance, in the old
days the Band was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and that is no
longer the case. In the old days a central
focus of activity was to guard the Band Shak
and, by extension, the campus in Big Came
week, as we had to keep the Cal weenies
from acts of vandalism. People then ran
around with walkie-talkies, or slept over
night in the Shak to keep the weenies from
breaking in and stealing things.
These days the Band frankly hasn't the
time for those kinds of activities. They've
become much more a part of the
mainstream of campus life, and in that sense
they've become part of the campus estab
lishment.
That in itself is a turnaround. When I was a
freshman the campus establishment was the
Ax Comm (Axe Committee), which con
sisted of all these cashmere-sweater types
from La Jolla and Pasadena and Piedmont.
The Band got the turkeys and the slide-rule
carriers and bookish and retiring types (or
unbookish but nevertheless unsociable
types) who wouldn't have been part of the
social establishment.
Well, those fashionable folks are gone
now, and in their stead the Band — and I
hate to say it — has become the fashionable
establishment. The paramilitary types with
their walkie talkies are no longer, as alumni
rallies have taken their place.

Band visit to Disneyland. As far as I know we
are no longer allowed within the confines of
the Magic Kingdom — they appear in
terested in catering to a more clean-cut au
dience — but we did hit it full force once.
After wandering around in knots of three
or four for the most part of the day, the
Bandsmen gathered at a relatively obscure
attraction called the Storybook Canal Ride.
Being a "g" or "h" ticket there wasn't much
competition, and when the young lady that
normally narrates the ride saw that she had
only Band people (and no real human be
ings), she turned the microphone over to
them.
I was then forced by peer pressure to take
the instrument into my humble and trembl
ing hands and thereupon to describe the
scenery from a slightly different perspective.
After all, when you consider Snow White
alone in the forest with seven dwarves the
possibilities are really staggering.
Daily: That's pretty funny. You must be
pretty funny up there in the press box.
Hal: In a way, perhaps, but the funniest an

nouncers to watch have been the middle
aged speech teachers who do halftimes for
such schools as Ohio State. As I recall the
Ohio State band announcer dressed up in
grey militaristic Ohio State band regalia, in
cluding the big hairbrush on the front of his
cap, and he had an assistant tapping him on
the shoulder to cue him to talk. They also
tend to have gorgeous ring-bound
notebooks with graph paper diagramming
each formation. Also elegantly typed scripts.
I enjoy watching that, even though I prefer
writing my script on the back of an envelope
sometime around a half hour before the
game starts.


... it was a substitute for
cold showers or for shooting
baskets on a Saturday night.
It was a form of sublimation
-a release of sexual tension
-and I have to say that much
of our behavior in the Band
today reflects that arrested
stage of development.


. . . these days the Band is in
many respects a central
focus of-and I hate to say it
- fashionable activity on
campus. Nothing is more es
tablishment oriented than
playing for alumni rallies,
and to my knowledge the
band never misses an alumni
rally these days. . . .


. . . marching in the Rose
Parade certainly ranks
among the great moments in
Band history. We had the
advantage of not being a
precision-oriented band,
and that helped, since the
predominant sensation that
one gets in the parade is the
sensation of walking behind
horses.
In addition to being one of the more intel
ligent, humorous and good-natured persons
on the face of the earth, Hal Michelson is the
announcer for the Stanford Band. Recently
the Daily exposed Hal to a tape recorder and
attempted to capitalize on his eloquence. It
worked exactly as we planned - what follows
is an edited account.
Daily: How do you work this thing?
Hal: Push P and R, and then ask if I think the
Band has changed.
Daily: P and R. Hmm. P and R . . . I think the
batteries are dead.
Hal: No that's not it. Put the tape in first.
Daily: I was supposed to bring a tape?
Hal: OK. Never mind. I'll do it myself . . .
there. Now, did you ask how I thought the
Band had changed? Good question. Yes, in
deed it did, and I'll tell about it.
The most visible change — if someone had
been in the Aleutians for six or eight years
and was just now returning — would be that
women are now members of the Band. In
the fall of '69 when I first became involved

with them that would have been incom
prehensible. In the fall of '69 the Band con
sisted of males, who used it as a substitute
for cold showers or for shooting baskets on a
Saturday night. It was a form of sublimation
— a male release of sexual tension. A night
out with the Band was a night out with the

boys, and I have to say that much of our
behavior today reflects that arrested stage of
development.
Daily: What?
Hal: I said, much of our behavior today re
flects that arrested stage of development,
which implies that women haven't had all
that radical an effect. I will elaborate. In a
way that is incomprehensible to me, women
have followed the old patterns of behavior,
even though the reasons for doing so no
longer exist. Because there are coed dorms
on campus, because the Band itself is coed,
because the Band does not consist of the
losers it consisted of when I was an under
graduate, the need for the kind of sublima
tion and release I have spoken of has rather
passed us by.
Daily: Is this on?
Hal: Still, some things have changed, be
haviorally speaking. For instance, in the old
days the Band was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and that is no
longer the case. In the old days a central
focus of activity was to guard the Band Shak
and, by extension, the campus in Big Came
week, as we had to keep the Cal weenies
from acts of vandalism. People then ran
around with walkie-talkies, or slept over
night in the Shak to keep the weenies from
breaking in and stealing things.
These days the Band frankly hasn't the
time for those kinds of activities. They've
become much more a part of the
mainstream of campus life, and in that sense
they've become part of the campus estab
lishment.
That in itself is a turnaround. When I was a
freshman the campus establishment was the
Ax Comm (Axe Committee), which con
sisted of all these cashmere-sweater types
from La Jolla and Pasadena and Piedmont.
The Band got the turkeys and the slide-rule
carriers and bookish and retiring types (or
unbookish but nevertheless unsociable
types) who wouldn't have been part of the
social establishment.
Well, those fashionable folks are gone
now, and in their stead the Band — and I
hate to say it — has become the fashionable
establishment. The paramilitary types with
their walkie talkies are no longer, as alumni
rallies have taken their place.
Daily: Maybe I should get an extension
chord.
Hal: That reminds me.
The Band, and particularly the Band staff,
has for years been hustling the pompon dol
lies. The band has pursued them with a un
iform and startling lack of success. The
struggle was immortalized a few years ago
when I was a senior when a number of en
terprising sophomores made Susan Taylor's
bicycle seat kind of a trophy — it was stolen

off of her bicycle and then ceremoniously
presented to Ken Peterson, who was then
the manager. It was repeatedly stolen from
her bicycle that year.
Still, to my observation the women who
have been Stanford Dollies over the years
have tended to become doctors and lawyers
and MBAs with as much, if not greater, fre
quency than their fellow students. They are
highly motivated, highly organized,
achievement-minded people and you
shouldn't be fooled by the fact that some of
them are gorgeous.
In the same sense, these comments ought
not imply that the Band staff lacks redeem
ing social value. I can tell you, for instance,
that they work a hell of a lot harder than the
ASSU Council of Presidents (Hal was on the
COP as an undergraduate in 1970).
Are you listening to me?
Daily: Yeah. Is this on?
Hal: Perhaps some personal data would be
in order at this point.
I came to Stanford in the fall of '67, and
though I couldn't stand the taste of beer
when a fresnman or sophomore and didn't
care much for bands or parties either (I was
more inclined than anything else to strut off
to the undergraduate library on a Friday or
Saturday night); despite all this I was a Band

groupie all along. During my junior year the
then-announcer, a fellow named Don Piatt,
was called away on a MacNamara Fellow
ship. I filled in, and that began an eight-year
association.
I can tell you that the first year I did it I was
of pretty poor quality — the whole first year I
didn't know how to work the microphone.
And I don't mean learning to speak into it for
greatest effect either, I mean working the
switch that turns it on. I had trouble holding
the switch open. . . .
Daily: Excuse me, sir, but I was under the
impression that this was my interview. I will
ask the questions, if you please. Now, tell us
about the worst single Band formation ■you
have ever seen, and why you regret ever
having associated yourself with them in the
first place. Also, the truth about Rich
Johnson's bald spot, please.
Hal: I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've suppressed all
that.
Daily: Oh. Well. . . .
Hal: I will say this about the Band, however,
and then I think I'll be leaving:
Marching into the Rose Parade certainly
ranks among great moments in Band history
as it provided the final proof of the advan
tages that accrue from being other than a
precision-oriented marching band. You see,
the predominant sensation one gets in the
Rose Parade is the sensation of following
horses — horses that tend to leave tangible
and olifactory evidence of their passage be
hind them. Others had trouble, but we were
able to stride through the steaming mounds
with relative ease.
There are other memorable incidents, of
course — another of my favorites involves a

and was just now returning — would be that
women are now members of the Band. In
the fall of '69 when I first became involved

with them that would have been incom
prehensible. In the fall of '69 the Band con
sisted of males, who used it as a substitute
for cold showers or for shooting baskets on a
Saturday night. It was a form of sublimation
— a male release of sexual tension. A night
out with the Band was a night out with the

boys, and I have to say that much of our
behavior today reflects that arrested stage of
development.
Daily: What?
Hal: I said, much of our behavior today re
flects that arrested stage of development,
which implies that women haven't had all
that radical an effect. I will elaborate. In a
way that is incomprehensible to me, women
have followed the old patterns of behavior,
even though the reasons for doing so no
longer exist. Because there are coed dorms
on campus, because the Band itself is coed,
because the Band does not consist of the
losers it consisted of when I was an under
graduate, the need for the kind of sublima
tion and release I have spoken of has rather
passed us by.
Daily: Is this on?
Hal: Still, some things have changed, be
haviorally speaking. For instance, in the old
days the Band was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and that is no
longer the case. In the old days a central
focus of activity was to guard the Band Shak
and, by extension, the campus in Big Came
week, as we had to keep the Cal weenies
from acts of vandalism. People then ran
around with walkie-talkies, or slept over
night in the Shak to keep the weenies from
breaking in and stealing things.
These days the Band frankly hasn't the
time for those kinds of activities. They've
become much more a part of the
mainstream of campus life, and in that sense
they've become part of the campus estab
lishment.
That in itself is a turnaround. When I was a
freshman the campus establishment was the
Ax Comm (Axe Committee), which con
sisted of all these cashmere-sweater types
from La Jolla and Pasadena and Piedmont.
The Band got the turkeys and the slide-rule
carriers and bookish and retiring types (or
unbookish but nevertheless unsociable
types) who wouldn't have been part of the
social establishment.
Well, those fashionable folks are gone
now, and in their stead the Band — and I
hate to say it — has become the fashionable
establishment. The paramilitary types with
their walkie talkies are no longer, as alumni
rallies have taken their place.
Daily: Maybe I should get an extension
chord.
Hal: That reminds me.
The Band, and particularly the Band staff,
has for years been hustling the pompon dol
lies. The band has pursued them with a un
iform and startling lack of success. The
struggle was immortalized a few years ago
when I was a senior when a number of en
terprising sophomores made Susan Taylor's
bicycle seat kind of a trophy — it was stolen

off of her bicycle and then ceremoniously
presented to Ken Peterson, who was then
the manager. It was repeatedly stolen from
her bicycle that year.
Still, to my observation the women who
have been Stanford Dollies over the years
have tended to become doctors and lawyers
and MBAs with as much, if not greater, fre
quency than their fellow students. They are
highly motivated, highly organized,
achievement-minded people and you
shouldn't be fooled by the fact that some of
them are gorgeous.
In the same sense, these comments ought
not imply that the Band staff lacks redeem
ing social value. I can tell you, for instance,
that they work a hell of a lot harder than the
ASSU Council of Presidents (Hal was on the
COP as an undergraduate in 1970).
Are you listening to me?
Daily: Yeah. Is this on?
Hal: Perhaps some personal data would be
in order at this point.
I came to Stanford in the fall of '67, and
though I couldn't stand the taste of beer
when a fresnman or sophomore and didn't
care much for bands or parties either (I was
more inclined than anything else to strut off
to the undergraduate library on a Friday or
Saturday night); despite all this I was a Band

groupie all along. During my junior year the
then-announcer, a fellow named Don Piatt,
was called away on a MacNamara Fellow
ship. I filled in, and that began an eight-year
association.
I can tell you that the first year I did it I was
of pretty poor quality — the whole first year I
didn't know how to work the microphone.
And I don't mean learning to speak into it for
greatest effect either, I mean working the
switch that turns it on. I had trouble holding
the switch open. . . .
Daily: Excuse me, sir, but I was under the
impression that this was my interview. I will
ask the questions, if you please. Now, tell us
about the worst single Band formation ■you
have ever seen, and why you regret ever
having associated yourself with them in the
first place. Also, the truth about Rich
Johnson's bald spot, please.
Hal: I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've suppressed all
that.
Daily: Oh. Well. . . .
Hal: I will say this about the Band, however,
and then I think I'll be leaving:
Marching into the Rose Parade certainly
ranks among great moments in Band history
as it provided the final proof of the advan
tages that accrue from being other than a
precision-oriented marching band. You see,
the predominant sensation one gets in the
Rose Parade is the sensation of following
horses — horses that tend to leave tangible
and olifactory evidence of their passage be
hind them. Others had trouble, but we were
able to stride through the steaming mounds
with relative ease.
There are other memorable incidents, of
course — another of my favorites involves a
Band visit to Disneyland. As far as I know we
are no longer allowed within the confines of
the Magic Kingdom — they appear in
terested in catering to a more clean-cut au
dience — but we did hit it full force once.
After wandering around in knots of three
or four for the most part of the day, the
Bandsmen gathered at a relatively obscure
attraction called the Storybook Canal Ride.
Being a "g" or "h" ticket there wasn't much
competition, and when the young lady that
normally narrates the ride saw that she had
only Band people (and no real human be
ings), she turned the microphone over to
them.
I was then forced by peer pressure to take
the instrument into my humble and trembl
ing hands and thereupon to describe the
scenery from a slightly different perspective.
After all, when you consider Snow White
alone in the forest with seven dwarves the
possibilities are really staggering.
Daily: That's pretty funny. You must be
pretty funny up there in the press box.
Hal: In a way, perhaps, but the funniest an

nouncers to watch have been the middle
aged speech teachers who do halftimes for
such schools as Ohio State. As I recall the
Ohio State band announcer dressed up in
grey militaristic Ohio State band regalia, in
cluding the big hairbrush on the front of his
cap, and he had an assistant tapping him on
the shoulder to cue him to talk. They also
tend to have gorgeous ring-bound
notebooks with graph paper diagramming
each formation. Also elegantly typed scripts.
I enjoy watching that, even though I prefer
writing my script on the back of an envelope
sometime around a half hour before the
game starts.

In addition to being one of the more intel
ligent, humorous and good-natured persons
on the face of the earth, Hal Michelson is the
announcer for the Stanford Band. Recently
the Daily exposed Hal to a tape recorder and
attempted to capitalize on his eloquence. It
worked exactly as we planned - what follows
is an edited account.
Daily: How do you work this thing?
Hal: Push P and R, and then ask if I think the
Band has changed.
Daily: P and R. Hmm. P and R . . . I think the
batteries are dead.
Hal: No that's not it. Put the tape in first.
Daily: I was supposed to bring a tape?
Hal: OK. Never mind. I'll do it myself . . .
there. Now, did you ask how I thought the
Band had changed? Good question. Yes, in
deed it did, and I'll tell about it.

achievement-minded people and you
shouldn't be fooled by the fact that some of
them are gorgeous.
In the same sense, these comments ought
not imply that the Band staff lacks redeem
ing social value. I can tell you, for instance,
that they work a hell of a lot harder than the
ASSU Council of Presidents (Hal was on the
COP as an undergraduate in 1970).
Are you listening to me?
Daily: Yeah. Is this on?
Hal: Perhaps some personal data would be
in order at this point.
I came to Stanford in the fall of '67, and
though I couldn't stand the taste of beer
when a fresnman or sophomore and didn't
care much for bands or parties either (I was
more inclined than anything else to strut off
to the undergraduate library on a Friday or
Saturday night); despite all this I was a Band

groupie all along. During my junior year the
then-announcer, a fellow named Don Piatt,
was called away on a MacNamara Fellow
ship. I filled in, and that began an eight-year
association.
I can tell you that the first year I did it I was
of pretty poor quality — the whole first year I
didn't know how to work the microphone.
And I don't mean learning to speak into it for
greatest effect either, I mean working the
switch that turns it on. I had trouble holding
the switch open. . . .
Daily: Excuse me, sir, but I was under the
impression that this was my interview. I will
ask the questions, if you please. Now, tell us
about the worst single Band formation ■you
have ever seen, and why you regret ever
having associated yourself with them in the
first place. Also, the truth about Rich
Johnson's bald spot, please.
Hal: I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've suppressed all
that.
Daily: Oh. Well. . . .
Hal: I will say this about the Band, however,
and then I think I'll be leaving:
Marching into the Rose Parade certainly
ranks among great moments in Band history
as it provided the final proof of the advan
tages that accrue from being other than a
precision-oriented marching band. You see,
the predominant sensation one gets in the
Rose Parade is the sensation of following
horses — horses that tend to leave tangible
and olifactory evidence of their passage be
hind them. Others had trouble, but we were
able to stride through the steaming mounds
with relative ease.
There are other memorable incidents, of
course — another of my favorites involves a
Band visit to Disneyland. As far as I know we
are no longer allowed within the confines of
the Magic Kingdom — they appear in
terested in catering to a more clean-cut au
dience — but we did hit it full force once.
After wandering around in knots of three
or four for the most part of the day, the
Bandsmen gathered at a relatively obscure
attraction called the Storybook Canal Ride.
Being a "g" or "h" ticket there wasn't much
competition, and when the young lady that
normally narrates the ride saw that she had
only Band people (and no real human be
ings), she turned the microphone over to
them.
I was then forced by peer pressure to take
the instrument into my humble and trembl
ing hands and thereupon to describe the
scenery from a slightly different perspective.
After all, when you consider Snow White
alone in the forest with seven dwarves the
possibilities are really staggering.
Daily: That's pretty funny. You must be
pretty funny up there in the press box.
Hal: In a way, perhaps, but the funniest an

nouncers to watch have been the middle
aged speech teachers who do halftimes for
such schools as Ohio State. As I recall the
Ohio State band announcer dressed up in
grey militaristic Ohio State band regalia, in
cluding the big hairbrush on the front of his
cap, and he had an assistant tapping him on
the shoulder to cue him to talk. They also
tend to have gorgeous ring-bound
notebooks with graph paper diagramming
each formation. Also elegantly typed scripts.
I enjoy watching that, even though I prefer
writing my script on the back of an envelope
sometime around a half hour before the
game starts.


... it was a substitute for
cold showers or for shooting
baskets on a Saturday night.
It was a form of sublimation
-a release of sexual tension
-and I have to say that much
of our behavior in the Band
today reflects that arrested
stage of development.


. . . these days the Band is in
many respects a central
focus of-and I hate to say it
- fashionable activity on
campus. Nothing is more es
tablishment oriented than
playing for alumni rallies,
and to my knowledge the
band never misses an alumni
rally these days. . . .


. . . marching in the Rose
Parade certainly ranks
among the great moments in
Band history. We had the
advantage of not being a
precision-oriented band,
and that helped, since the
predominant sensation that
one gets in the parade is the
sensation of walking behind
horses.
