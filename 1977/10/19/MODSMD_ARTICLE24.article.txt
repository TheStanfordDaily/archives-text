# IM grid wars underway

The intramural program is
now in its third week of ac
tion with a full schedule of
men's, women's and coed
football and two-person vol
leyball games. As well,
tournament sheets for
single-elimination sports —
3-on-3 basketball, tennis
doubles, golf, table tennis,
free throws and billiards —
have been posted, initiating
play in these sports.
In football, many teams
have found that the long
summer layoff has taken its
toll — the smooth-running
machine of last fall no
longer functions efficiently.
Nevertheless, there have
been some outstanding per
formances turned in — even
at this early date.
In the "A" league, the
Theta Delts, displaying the
poise and talent that carried
them to the finals two years
ago (losing to the Zetes
18-13) have played two
strong games, defeating
Sigma Chi, 25-13, and SAE,
45-12. The Sigma Chi game
was extremely rough,
characterized by the brutal
blocking and rushing of
Theta Delts Carl Edwards
and Redmond "Circle"
Burke, a former JV
ballplayer, and Sigma Chi's
"Jo-Jo."
Sigma Chi was outnum
bered and outmanned, but

refused to give up, keeping
the score close until the
very end. In the SAE game,
the Theta Delts scored each
time they had the ball, with
Bill Christopher throwing
seven TD passes, four of
them to Shanagher.
In other "A" games, the
Zetes defeated Biz 11, 13-12,
in their first game and the
Delts, 12-7, in their second
game. After losing to the
Zetes, Biz II came back to
defeat Biz I in the second
week of play, 37-0. Against
Biz 11, the Zetes, defending
champions after defeating
the DUs in the final last year,
were forced into overtime
before they clinched the
victory. Against the Delts,
they were unable to gener
ate much offense at all. The
Zetes have a new quarter
back this year, Jack Bunce (a
former )V ballplayer), and
had to replace many
graduating seniors. They
can expect a strong chal
lenge from the Theta Delts.
While it is too early in the
season to distinguish the
good from the bad "B"
teams, strong showings
have been made by the
Bootables, Sigma Chi, the
Ghetto, the Space Cowboys
Law 3 and Organized
Grime. The Grime players
are talking dynasty (their
team has been extremely
successful over the past few

years), and have a strong of
fense led by QB Kevin Triggs
and receivers Pepe
Hinojosa and Charlie Lan
nin. Triggs engineered the
Grime offense to a 45-0 vic
tory over Culos in its first
game. Anchoring the de
fense are the rushers, Pete
Davison and Mark "Kato"
Chin, backed up by beefy
linebacker Mike Kositch.
The Law 3 team, however,
may have the finest collec
tion of athletes of any "B"
team. The squad is com
posed primarily of players
from last year's "A" basket
ball champions, Loss Causa
tion, most notably Jeff Mor
ris, Al Epstein and Joe Mais.
Morris, at quarterback, has
been known to throw the
ball with wild abandon, and
Epstein is a particularly
talented player. It should be
a good game this week
when Causation lines up
against the Theta Delt "B"
team. Therearea numberof
Theta Delts who played on
the basketball team that lost
to Loss Causation in the
semifinals last year.
All in all, it promises to be
an interesting and exciting
IM football season. Anyone
who witnesses a particularly
spectacular or otherwise
significant IM event should
feel free to drop a note by
the IM Office.
