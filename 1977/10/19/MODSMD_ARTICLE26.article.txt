# Students yield to signs' temptation
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
"You wanna know about
stealing signs? Sure, which
sign do you want?"
This is a typical statement
from a cocky freshman when
the subject of sign stealing is
brought up. But it isn't just
freshmen who think like this.
You might be amazed at the
number of admitted sign steal
ers around.
Walk into any dorm or row
house and chances are very
high that you will soon spot a
boldly lettered sign that has
been "mysteriously relocated"
from its original perch beside
the road or on a building.
A sign which once served the
public welfare, such as "No
Dumping by Order of Sheriff"
or "Yield" takes on new mean
ing when cleverly placed above
the entrance to a bathroom or
on a bedroom wall.
Fad
"Heck, these days it's just a
fad, a fashion trend," said one
student. "Everybody back in
Massachusetts does it. I don't
know too many people who
haven't stolen signs . . . boys
that is; girls don't do it for
some reason."
Whoever is doing it (and the
police have a pretty good idea),
the practice of sign stealing is
on the rise in Palo Alto and
California.
Bob Halligan, information
officer for the State Depart
ment of Transportation said he
has no statistics on sign theft,
but said his shelves were filled
with reports.
"It's terrible," he declared.
"And I understand that they
usually end up in Stanford stu
dents' rooms," he added
lightly.
In Palo Alto over a three

month period (July-Sept.) last
year, 378 street signs were re
paired due to theft, vandalism
and accidents, said Harley
Davis, the city's street super
visor. During the same period
this year, that number rose to
604.
"What motivates upstanding
young students to steal signs,"
you may wonder.
When asked this question,
almost any ordinary man-on
the-street becomes an instant
expert in the field and exp
lains: "Really, its kind of a
prize, a trophy. People think
'Hey, he's a neat guy, he stole a
sign!' I guess its kind of a per
verted admiration, but still it's
status."
"I see it as a medal of honor,
to see who can make the most
daring snatch."
"It's one of those things you
think of doing when you're
bored. There's a lot of fun in
disobeying the law, because
there's always the risk of get
ting caught."
Tasteful
According to one experi
enced upperclassman, there is
more sign stealing by freshman
than by veteran students who
hold their forages down to an
occasional "tasteful, deluxe
sign caper."
This, he explains, is due to
"the rush to achieve a quick
status hike in the eyes of peers
during that first frantic quarter.
It also gets to be a group effort
sometimes. You get to know
people better and you de
monstrate your defiance of the
establishment."
In one dormitory, some bold
first year students said they
take orders for signs.
"We see one we like, with
somebody's last name on it and

ask the guy if he wants it. Then
we go out with chain saws and
a pick-up truck and it's as good
as ours."
Said one big-hearted thief, "I
rarely keep them, I give 'em
away as presents."
For my girl
"I get 'em for my girlfriend,"
said another.
Older students appear reluc
tant to speak on the subject at
first — careful to protect their
reputation or their fraternity's
good name.
"Nobody in this house ever
stole a sign," said one brother
as a sign like "Slow 199 Chil
dren at Play" hung on the wall
behind him.
However, another student
admitted, "It's a conversation
piece — a visual stimulus. It's
great for bringing up old
stories about how you ripped it
off — which is half the fun, and
even if you fail, the stories are
worth it."
Toquerville
Examples of some of the
signs you may run across in a
campus residence tour are lo
cation signs from Toquerville,
Lovelock, Slippery Rock or
Beaver County located in
lounges or girl's bathrooms; a
caution sign Loose Gravel with
the "A" changed to an "O,"
located over a well frequented
bar; Keep Left, posted for polit
ical reasons.
Other signs speak for them
selves: No Dogs in the Rose
Garden, Waddle-1, Please No
Jokes, Remarks Can Lead To
False Information, Dismount
and Stop — Do Not Bring Sick
Pigs Into This Swine Barn.
According to various
sources, a plastic casted
Ronald McDonald or Jack-in
the-Box has a high bounty.

Signs from the UC-Berkeley
campus also rate highly, as do
placards with the Stanford
name on them.
Quality signs
In general, "Quality signs
and those that present a chal
lenge to get" seem to be the
most coveted.
Other opinions hold that
signs whose meanings can be
twisted to have sexual innuen
dos or funny turnarounds are
the best.
"My great ambition is to steal
one of those giant green free
way signs, but I've never found
anyone who wants to help
me," said one undergrad.
"Did you know that there
isn't one sign left in Lucken
bach, Texas with that name on
it?" posed one sign buff. "Ev
ery time they put up a new one,
it's ripped off."
Halligan singled out the sign,
Caution — There May Be
Rattlesnakes In This Area, as a
frequent target, and added
"We also.have a real problem
up on Highway 69."
Public nuisance
Although state employes
and police were genial in pro
viding information on sign ste
aling, they decried it as
"dangerous," costly and a pub
lic nuisance.
Tom Berubee, a Stanford
police sergeant, said, "These
signs are posted for a purpose
— to assist visitors and com
muters passing through cam

pus. And most importantly in
directing drivers of ambu
lances, fire engines, or any
emergency vehicle. What if
they can't find a location in an
emergency situation?"
In Palo Alto, Davis said, "Five
to 10 stop signs are taken or
turned around every week. I
don't think kids realize how
dangerous this could be and
how easily it could cause an ac
cident."
The city's streets division has
tried using theft-proof nuts
and bolts but signs are ripped
off anyway, said David. "Espe
cially College Terrace signs,"
he said, "where the streets are
labeled with names of col
leges."
Busted
"Police catch the robbers
every now and then," Davis
said. Sign theft is a punishable
offense, according to the Palo
Alto Police Department, and is
under the category of petty
theft, a misdemeanor for
which the penalty is less than
$1000 fine or a term in the
county jail not to exceed one
year.
Davis said that the incidence
is seasonal, peaking in Sep
tember, October and
November.
Acampus policeman said the
busiest time is right before the
Big Game and one year some
vandals were caught in the act.
Naturally, they were Cal stu
dents.

Massachusetts does it. I don't
know too many people who
haven't stolen signs . . . boys
that is; girls don't do it for
some reason."
Whoever is doing it (and the
police have a pretty good idea),
the practice of sign stealing is
on the rise in Palo Alto and
California.
Bob Halligan, information
officer for the State Depart
ment of Transportation said he
has no statistics on sign theft,
but said his shelves were filled
with reports.
"It's terrible," he declared.
"And I understand that they
usually end up in Stanford stu
dents' rooms," he added
lightly.
In Palo Alto over a three

month period (July-Sept.) last
year, 378 street signs were re
paired due to theft, vandalism
and accidents, said Harley
Davis, the city's street super
visor. During the same period
this year, that number rose to
604.
"What motivates upstanding
young students to steal signs,"
you may wonder.
When asked this question,
almost any ordinary man-on
the-street becomes an instant
expert in the field and exp
lains: "Really, its kind of a
prize, a trophy. People think
'Hey, he's a neat guy, he stole a
sign!' I guess its kind of a per
verted admiration, but still it's
status."
"I see it as a medal of honor,
to see who can make the most
daring snatch."
"It's one of those things you
think of doing when you're
bored. There's a lot of fun in
disobeying the law, because
there's always the risk of get
ting caught."
Tasteful
According to one experi
enced upperclassman, there is
more sign stealing by freshman
than by veteran students who
hold their forages down to an
occasional "tasteful, deluxe
sign caper."
This, he explains, is due to
"the rush to achieve a quick
status hike in the eyes of peers
during that first frantic quarter.
It also gets to be a group effort
sometimes. You get to know
people better and you de
monstrate your defiance of the
establishment."
In one dormitory, some bold
first year students said they
take orders for signs.
"We see one we like, with
somebody's last name on it and

ask the guy if he wants it. Then
we go out with chain saws and
a pick-up truck and it's as good
as ours."
Said one big-hearted thief, "I
rarely keep them, I give 'em
away as presents."
For my girl
"I get 'em for my girlfriend,"
said another.
Older students appear reluc
tant to speak on the subject at
first — careful to protect their
reputation or their fraternity's
good name.
"Nobody in this house ever
stole a sign," said one brother
as a sign like "Slow 199 Chil
dren at Play" hung on the wall
behind him.
However, another student
admitted, "It's a conversation
piece — a visual stimulus. It's
great for bringing up old
stories about how you ripped it
off — which is half the fun, and
even if you fail, the stories are
worth it."
Toquerville
Examples of some of the
signs you may run across in a
campus residence tour are lo
cation signs from Toquerville,
Lovelock, Slippery Rock or
Beaver County located in
lounges or girl's bathrooms; a
caution sign Loose Gravel with
the "A" changed to an "O,"
located over a well frequented
bar; Keep Left, posted for polit
ical reasons.
Other signs speak for them
selves: No Dogs in the Rose
Garden, Waddle-1, Please No
Jokes, Remarks Can Lead To
False Information, Dismount
and Stop — Do Not Bring Sick
Pigs Into This Swine Barn.
According to various
sources, a plastic casted
Ronald McDonald or Jack-in
the-Box has a high bounty.

Signs from the UC-Berkeley
campus also rate highly, as do
placards with the Stanford
name on them.
Quality signs
In general, "Quality signs
and those that present a chal
lenge to get" seem to be the
most coveted.
Other opinions hold that
signs whose meanings can be
twisted to have sexual innuen
dos or funny turnarounds are
the best.
"My great ambition is to steal
one of those giant green free
way signs, but I've never found
anyone who wants to help
me," said one undergrad.
"Did you know that there
isn't one sign left in Lucken
bach, Texas with that name on
it?" posed one sign buff. "Ev
ery time they put up a new one,
it's ripped off."
Halligan singled out the sign,
Caution — There May Be
Rattlesnakes In This Area, as a
frequent target, and added
"We also.have a real problem
up on Highway 69."
Public nuisance
Although state employes
and police were genial in pro
viding information on sign ste
aling, they decried it as
"dangerous," costly and a pub
lic nuisance.
Tom Berubee, a Stanford
police sergeant, said, "These
signs are posted for a purpose
— to assist visitors and com
muters passing through cam

pus. And most importantly in
directing drivers of ambu
lances, fire engines, or any
emergency vehicle. What if
they can't find a location in an
emergency situation?"
In Palo Alto, Davis said, "Five
to 10 stop signs are taken or
turned around every week. I
don't think kids realize how
dangerous this could be and
how easily it could cause an ac
cident."
The city's streets division has
tried using theft-proof nuts
and bolts but signs are ripped
off anyway, said David. "Espe
cially College Terrace signs,"
he said, "where the streets are
labeled with names of col
leges."
Busted
"Police catch the robbers
every now and then," Davis
said. Sign theft is a punishable
offense, according to the Palo
Alto Police Department, and is
under the category of petty
theft, a misdemeanor for
which the penalty is less than
$1000 fine or a term in the
county jail not to exceed one
year.
Davis said that the incidence
is seasonal, peaking in Sep
tember, October and
November.
Acampus policeman said the
busiest time is right before the
Big Game and one year some
vandals were caught in the act.
Naturally, they were Cal stu
dents.

"You wanna know about

This is a typical statement
from a cocky freshman when
the subject of sign stealing is
brought up. But it isn't just
freshmen who think like this.
You might be amazed at the
number of admitted sign steal
ers around.
Walk into any dorm or row
house and chances are very
high that you will soon spot a
boldly lettered sign that has
been "mysteriously relocated"
from its original perch beside
the road or on a building.
A sign which once served the
public welfare, such as "No
Dumping by Order of Sheriff"
or "Yield" takes on new mean
ing when cleverly placed above
the entrance to a bathroom or
on a bedroom wall.

"What motivates upstanding
young students to steal signs,"
you may wonder.
When asked this question,
almost any ordinary man-on
the-street becomes an instant
expert in the field and exp
lains: "Really, its kind of a
prize, a trophy. People think
'Hey, he's a neat guy, he stole a
sign!' I guess its kind of a per
verted admiration, but still it's
status."
"I see it as a medal of honor,
to see who can make the most
daring snatch."
"It's one of those things you
think of doing when you're
bored. There's a lot of fun in
disobeying the law, because
there's always the risk of get
ting caught."
Tasteful
According to one experi
enced upperclassman, there is
more sign stealing by freshman
than by veteran students who
hold their forages down to an
occasional "tasteful, deluxe
sign caper."
This, he explains, is due to
"the rush to achieve a quick
status hike in the eyes of peers
during that first frantic quarter.
It also gets to be a group effort
sometimes. You get to know
people better and you de
monstrate your defiance of the
establishment."
In one dormitory, some bold
first year students said they
take orders for signs.
"We see one we like, with
somebody's last name on it and

ask the guy if he wants it. Then
we go out with chain saws and
a pick-up truck and it's as good
as ours."
Said one big-hearted thief, "I
rarely keep them, I give 'em
away as presents."
For my girl
"I get 'em for my girlfriend,"
said another.
Older students appear reluc
tant to speak on the subject at
first — careful to protect their
reputation or their fraternity's
good name.
"Nobody in this house ever
stole a sign," said one brother
as a sign like "Slow 199 Chil
dren at Play" hung on the wall
behind him.
However, another student
admitted, "It's a conversation
piece — a visual stimulus. It's
great for bringing up old
stories about how you ripped it
off — which is half the fun, and
even if you fail, the stories are
worth it."
Toquerville
Examples of some of the
signs you may run across in a
campus residence tour are lo
cation signs from Toquerville,
Lovelock, Slippery Rock or
Beaver County located in
lounges or girl's bathrooms; a
caution sign Loose Gravel with
the "A" changed to an "O,"
located over a well frequented
bar; Keep Left, posted for polit
ical reasons.
Other signs speak for them
selves: No Dogs in the Rose
Garden, Waddle-1, Please No
Jokes, Remarks Can Lead To
False Information, Dismount
and Stop — Do Not Bring Sick
Pigs Into This Swine Barn.
According to various
sources, a plastic casted
Ronald McDonald or Jack-in
the-Box has a high bounty.

Signs from the UC-Berkeley
campus also rate highly, as do
placards with the Stanford
name on them.
Quality signs
In general, "Quality signs
and those that present a chal
lenge to get" seem to be the
most coveted.
Other opinions hold that
signs whose meanings can be
twisted to have sexual innuen
dos or funny turnarounds are
the best.
"My great ambition is to steal
one of those giant green free
way signs, but I've never found
anyone who wants to help
me," said one undergrad.
"Did you know that there
isn't one sign left in Lucken
bach, Texas with that name on
it?" posed one sign buff. "Ev
ery time they put up a new one,
it's ripped off."
Halligan singled out the sign,
Caution — There May Be
Rattlesnakes In This Area, as a
frequent target, and added
"We also.have a real problem
up on Highway 69."
Public nuisance
Although state employes
and police were genial in pro
viding information on sign ste
aling, they decried it as
"dangerous," costly and a pub
lic nuisance.
Tom Berubee, a Stanford
police sergeant, said, "These
signs are posted for a purpose
— to assist visitors and com
muters passing through cam

pus. And most importantly in
directing drivers of ambu
lances, fire engines, or any
emergency vehicle. What if
they can't find a location in an
emergency situation?"
In Palo Alto, Davis said, "Five
to 10 stop signs are taken or
turned around every week. I
don't think kids realize how
dangerous this could be and
how easily it could cause an ac
cident."
The city's streets division has
tried using theft-proof nuts
and bolts but signs are ripped
off anyway, said David. "Espe
cially College Terrace signs,"
he said, "where the streets are
labeled with names of col
leges."
Busted
"Police catch the robbers
every now and then," Davis
said. Sign theft is a punishable
offense, according to the Palo
Alto Police Department, and is
under the category of petty
theft, a misdemeanor for
which the penalty is less than
$1000 fine or a term in the
county jail not to exceed one
year.
Davis said that the incidence
is seasonal, peaking in Sep
tember, October and
November.
Acampus policeman said the
busiest time is right before the
Big Game and one year some
vandals were caught in the act.
Naturally, they were Cal stu
dents.

"You wanna know about
stealing signs? Sure, which
sign do you want?"
This is a typical statement
from a cocky freshman when
the subject of sign stealing is
brought up. But it isn't just
freshmen who think like this.
You might be amazed at the
number of admitted sign steal
ers around.
Walk into any dorm or row
house and chances are very
high that you will soon spot a
boldly lettered sign that has
been "mysteriously relocated"
from its original perch beside
the road or on a building.
A sign which once served the
public welfare, such as "No
Dumping by Order of Sheriff"
or "Yield" takes on new mean
ing when cleverly placed above
the entrance to a bathroom or
on a bedroom wall.

"Heck, these days it's just a
fad, a fashion trend," said one
student. "Everybody back in
Massachusetts does it. I don't
know too many people who
haven't stolen signs . . . boys
that is; girls don't do it for
some reason."
Whoever is doing it (and the
police have a pretty good idea),
the practice of sign stealing is
on the rise in Palo Alto and
California.
Bob Halligan, information
officer for the State Depart
ment of Transportation said he
has no statistics on sign theft,
but said his shelves were filled
with reports.
"It's terrible," he declared.
"And I understand that they
usually end up in Stanford stu
dents' rooms," he added
lightly.
In Palo Alto over a three

month period (July-Sept.) last
year, 378 street signs were re
paired due to theft, vandalism
and accidents, said Harley
Davis, the city's street super

hold their forages down to an
occasional "tasteful, deluxe
sign caper."
This, he explains, is due to
"the rush to achieve a quick
status hike in the eyes of peers
during that first frantic quarter.
It also gets to be a group effort
sometimes. You get to know
people better and you de
monstrate your defiance of the
establishment."
In one dormitory, some bold
first year students said they
take orders for signs.
"We see one we like, with
somebody's last name on it and

ask the guy if he wants it. Then
we go out with chain saws and
a pick-up truck and it's as good
as ours."
Said one big-hearted thief, "I
rarely keep them, I give 'em
away as presents."
For my girl
"I get 'em for my girlfriend,"
said another.
Older students appear reluc
tant to speak on the subject at
first — careful to protect their
reputation or their fraternity's
good name.
"Nobody in this house ever
stole a sign," said one brother
as a sign like "Slow 199 Chil
dren at Play" hung on the wall
behind him.
However, another student
admitted, "It's a conversation
piece — a visual stimulus. It's
great for bringing up old
stories about how you ripped it
off — which is half the fun, and
even if you fail, the stories are
worth it."
Toquerville
Examples of some of the
signs you may run across in a
campus residence tour are lo
cation signs from Toquerville,
Lovelock, Slippery Rock or
Beaver County located in
lounges or girl's bathrooms; a
caution sign Loose Gravel with
the "A" changed to an "O,"
located over a well frequented
bar; Keep Left, posted for polit
ical reasons.
Other signs speak for them
selves: No Dogs in the Rose
Garden, Waddle-1, Please No
Jokes, Remarks Can Lead To
False Information, Dismount
and Stop — Do Not Bring Sick
Pigs Into This Swine Barn.
According to various
sources, a plastic casted
Ronald McDonald or Jack-in
the-Box has a high bounty.

Signs from the UC-Berkeley
campus also rate highly, as do
placards with the Stanford
name on them.
Quality signs
In general, "Quality signs
and those that present a chal
lenge to get" seem to be the
most coveted.
Other opinions hold that
signs whose meanings can be
twisted to have sexual innuen
dos or funny turnarounds are
the best.
"My great ambition is to steal
one of those giant green free
way signs, but I've never found
anyone who wants to help
me," said one undergrad.
"Did you know that there
isn't one sign left in Lucken
bach, Texas with that name on
it?" posed one sign buff. "Ev
ery time they put up a new one,
it's ripped off."
Halligan singled out the sign,
Caution — There May Be
Rattlesnakes In This Area, as a
frequent target, and added
"We also.have a real problem
up on Highway 69."
Public nuisance
Although state employes
and police were genial in pro
viding information on sign ste
aling, they decried it as
"dangerous," costly and a pub
lic nuisance.
Tom Berubee, a Stanford
police sergeant, said, "These
signs are posted for a purpose
— to assist visitors and com
muters passing through cam

pus. And most importantly in
directing drivers of ambu
lances, fire engines, or any
emergency vehicle. What if
they can't find a location in an
emergency situation?"
In Palo Alto, Davis said, "Five
to 10 stop signs are taken or
turned around every week. I
don't think kids realize how
dangerous this could be and
how easily it could cause an ac
cident."
The city's streets division has
tried using theft-proof nuts
and bolts but signs are ripped
off anyway, said David. "Espe
cially College Terrace signs,"
he said, "where the streets are
labeled with names of col
leges."
Busted
"Police catch the robbers
every now and then," Davis
said. Sign theft is a punishable
offense, according to the Palo
Alto Police Department, and is
under the category of petty
theft, a misdemeanor for
which the penalty is less than
$1000 fine or a term in the
county jail not to exceed one
year.
Davis said that the incidence
is seasonal, peaking in Sep
tember, October and
November.
Acampus policeman said the
busiest time is right before the
Big Game and one year some
vandals were caught in the act.
Naturally, they were Cal stu
dents.

These signs of our times have found a happy home in the Stanford
Band Shak.
"You wanna know about
stealing signs? Sure, which
sign do you want?"
This is a typical statement
from a cocky freshman when
the subject of sign stealing is
brought up. But it isn't just
freshmen who think like this.
You might be amazed at the
number of admitted sign steal
ers around.
Walk into any dorm or row
house and chances are very
high that you will soon spot a
boldly lettered sign that has
been "mysteriously relocated"
from its original perch beside
the road or on a building.
A sign which once served the
public welfare, such as "No
Dumping by Order of Sheriff"
or "Yield" takes on new mean
ing when cleverly placed above
the entrance to a bathroom or
on a bedroom wall.
Fad
"Heck, these days it's just a
fad, a fashion trend," said one
student. "Everybody back in
Massachusetts does it. I don't
know too many people who
haven't stolen signs . . . boys
that is; girls don't do it for
some reason."
Whoever is doing it (and the
police have a pretty good idea),
the practice of sign stealing is
on the rise in Palo Alto and
California.
Bob Halligan, information
officer for the State Depart
ment of Transportation said he
has no statistics on sign theft,
but said his shelves were filled
with reports.
"It's terrible," he declared.
"And I understand that they
usually end up in Stanford stu
dents' rooms," he added
lightly.
In Palo Alto over a three

month period (July-Sept.) last
year, 378 street signs were re
paired due to theft, vandalism
and accidents, said Harley
Davis, the city's street super
visor. During the same period
this year, that number rose to
604.
"What motivates upstanding
young students to steal signs,"
you may wonder.
When asked this question,
almost any ordinary man-on
the-street becomes an instant
expert in the field and exp
lains: "Really, its kind of a
prize, a trophy. People think
'Hey, he's a neat guy, he stole a
sign!' I guess its kind of a per
verted admiration, but still it's
status."
"I see it as a medal of honor,
to see who can make the most
daring snatch."
"It's one of those things you
think of doing when you're
bored. There's a lot of fun in
disobeying the law, because
there's always the risk of get
ting caught."
Tasteful
According to one experi
enced upperclassman, there is
more sign stealing by freshman
than by veteran students who
hold their forages down to an
occasional "tasteful, deluxe
sign caper."
This, he explains, is due to
"the rush to achieve a quick
status hike in the eyes of peers
during that first frantic quarter.
It also gets to be a group effort
sometimes. You get to know
people better and you de
monstrate your defiance of the
establishment."
