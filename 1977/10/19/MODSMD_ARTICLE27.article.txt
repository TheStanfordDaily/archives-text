Schlesinger told to sell gas stock
Washington — A Senate committee told Energy
Secretary James Schlesinger yesterday to sell more
than $33,000 worth of stock he and his wife hold in
an energy-related company. The panel said the
holdings pose a possible conflict of interest.
The committee action came as a House-Senate
conference committee began work on a com
promise energy bill and as President jimmy Carter
declared that the reputations of both Congress
and of his first year domestic program hinge on the
energy bill to come.
The energy committee gave Schlesinger nine
months to dispose of 2100 shares of stock in the
Newhall Land and Farming Company. The stock is
worth about $33,600.
The unanimous committee vote followed
Schlesinger's own disclosure to the panel that
"there are some 90 producing wells, mostly
natural gas" on 150,000 acres owned by the com
pany.
Carter, in an Oval Office meeting with Rep.
Thomas Ashley (D-Ohio), predicted that Congress
eventually will enact the bulk of his energy prog
ram, despite numerous major setbacks in the Se
nate.
"I think what we do on energy will determine
the success or failure of the year of congressional
work, I think, in the minds of the American
people," Carter told Ashley.
"I think it's legitimate to measure the success of
Congress and my own administration, at least in
domestic affairs, on what happens to energy,"
Carter added.
According to some persons, Carter has said the
energy tax incentives approved by the Senate
panel and expected to win full Senate approval
would create a budget deficit of $55 billion.
U.S. won't name rights violators
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — The United States, under
pressure from its allies, has apparently agreed to
exercise restraint in reviewing the human rights
record of the Soviet Union and Communist East
ern Europe, sources reported yesterday.
Arthur Goldberg, chief of the U.S. delegation to
the Helsinki review conference, is still examining
the issue with NATO member delegations, offi
cials say.
But diplomatic sources reported that for the
time being, at least, the United States may moder

ate its tactics in order not to "get too far in front of
the allies."
The question is whether to cite countries and
cases by name when reviewing implementation of
the 1975 Helsinki accords.
The accords, signed at a summit meeting in the
Finnish capital by the United States, the Soviet
Union, Canada and 32 European countries, recog
nized Soviet influence in Eastern Europe in ex
change for what the West views as promises of
greater human rights in the Communist countries.
The United States came to the Belgrade follow
up conference prepared to document 1500 cases
involving a total of 5000 persons who had been
blocked from joining relatives in the West in al
leged violations of the accords on family unifica
tion, the sources said.
But its allies in the North Atlantic alliance are
said to fear that naming names will provoke harsh
reaction and be counterproductive if any com
mitments from the East Bloc are to be gained.
U.S. restraint would have three aims, the
sources reported: to preserve allied unity, to
avoid a confrontation with the Soviets so a full
review can be carried out, and to ensure that
further review conferences can be held after Bel
grade in order to keep pressure on the East.
Pentagon won't give welfare info
Washington — Government investigators look
ing for welfare cheaters have personnel informa
tion on 2.8 million federal employes, but are being
denied access to military records because of Pen
tagon concerns about privacy.
HEW Secretary )oseph Califano )r. has ordered
the personnel information, including employe
names, Social Security numbers and birth dates,
compared with data on government welfare rolls
in what he has dubbed, "Operation Match."
The plan is designed to identify federal
employes who are taking welfare benefits from the
government illegally or improperly.
Civil Service Commission officials said yester
day they have given the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare computer tapes identifying
all government employes except those in security
agencies and some congressional and judicial
posts.
A memorandum of understanding between the
commission and HEW's inspector general said the
giant social service agency promises to safeguard
the data it gets and destroy the files when it is

finished.
But a spokesman for the Pentagon said its
lawyers and privacy board officials thought
Califano's request for sensitive personnel data
might violate the tederal privacy act. The law was
designed to limit the flow of personal information
from agency to agency.
"We talked to HEW and the Office of Manage
ment and Budget about it,"the spokesman said.
"We just wanted to make sure this thing was done
legally. Our aim really was to see if there was any
way we could comply with the request and the act,
too."
Defense officials decided they would proceed
under a section of the privacy law that permits
transfer of personnel information between agen
cies for so-called "routine use."
In order to do that, the Pentagon must publish
its plan in the Federal Register and give the public
and individuals affected by the transfer an oppor
tunity to object.
The Civil Service Commission said it was acting
under a different section of the law that permits it
to turn over files on employes to law enforcement
agencies investigating civil and criminal cases.
The request for private help in Operation Match
came from Califano after the government learned
that 1732 federal employes were on the District of
Columbia welfare roles.
Crosby buried in private service
Los Angeles — Bing Crosby was buried yesterday
in a misty hillside cemetery after a simple church
ceremony held in predawn darkness to avoid a
crush of fans seeking to pay a last tribute to one of
the world's most famous entertainers.
A private gathering of 35 relatives and friends,
including Crosby's close friend Bob Hope, at
tended the quiet 6 a.m. funeral service. Only
newsmen were present on the foggy, deserted
streets outside.
The body, resting in an oak casket topped by a
blanket of Sonia roses, was buried near a stone
grotto in Holy Cross Cemetery beside his parents
and his first wife, Dixie Lee, who died of cancer in
1952.
