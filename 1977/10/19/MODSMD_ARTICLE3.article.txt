New York (AP) — Reggie Jackson
smashed three home runs, tying a
World Series record set by Babe Ruth
51 years ago, and powered the New
York Yankees to baseball's World
Championship last night with an
8-4 victory over the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
Jackson, who played a major role
in the season-long soap opera of the
Yankees, brought the story to a fairy
tale conclusion with a two-run
homer in the fourth, a two-run
homer in the fifth and a solo shot into
the center field bleachers in the
eighth. Each homer came on the first
pitch.
It was the first time in World Series
history anyone had hit three con
secutive home runs.
Chris Chambliss also ripped a
two-run homer and Mike Torrez
rode the long-ball attack to an easy,
nine-hit victory as the Yankees nailed
down their 21st world title and their
first in 15 years.
