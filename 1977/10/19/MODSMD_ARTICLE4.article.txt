# In upper-level carrels
## UGLY starts audio service 
### Kathy Andrews 
The Undergraduate Library's
audio-visual staff is experimenting
with the use of upper-level carrels for
audio listening.
The pilot program features music
and sportscasts as well as course
related selections.
UGLY was originally designed to
accommodate the use of audio ser
vices in all carrels for classes. Be
cause of faculty complaints that the
library is too noisy, however, the
facility has not been used this way in
the past.
Overcrowding in the ground
floor's audio-visual areas, particu
larly in mid-afternoons, has promp
ted the staff to expand the use of the
upstairs carrels to both pleasure and
reserve (class-related) listening, said
Audiovisual Services Coordinator
Roxanna Siefer.
As part of the program, headsets
are available at both the audio-visual
department and second floor service

desks, she said. Class-related record
ings are scheduled to be used in the
sections where course books are
kept and coordinating staff members
will simultaneously operate the
programs and the audio-visual ser
vice desk.
Despite the staff's enthusiasm for
the project, the lack of student input
has been a problem, Siefer said. So
far, the main program users have
been drama and opera classes.
"It's nice to be able to listen to
music while studying and not have to
bother changing records," said one
music program listener. Pleasure lis
teners enjoy classical, jazz and rock
music programs as well as a weekly
special feature.
The system is also running Univer
sity football games. Jackie Peterson,
an audio-visual services staffer, said
the staff hopes to be able to start an
AM program soon, featuring on
the-road sports events as well as
home basketball and hockey games.

The programs play from 8 a.m. to
11 p.m., and daily schedules are
posted in the audio-visual services
section and the first floor bulletin
board. They are also available at the
portal monitor, the reference desk
and the second floor loan desk.
