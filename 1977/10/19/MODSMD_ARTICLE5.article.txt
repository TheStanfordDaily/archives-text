# University divestiture report due next week

### Will Nixon 
The divestiture report on the Uni
versity's stockholdings in companies
doing business in South Africa
should come out within a week to 10
days, Rodney Adams, director of fi
nance, said today. Adams was re
sponding to one of the questions
nailed to President Lyman's office
door at a rally Monday afternoon.
Another question asked was why
the ad hoc committee on Investment
Responsibility meetings are closed
and why the minutes are secret.
"The committee as a whole agreed
to keep their meetings private for
what I believe are good reasons,"
said Adams. The committee was set
up in June by the Trustees and
charged with the task of reviewing
the University's existing investment
guidelines and to reorganize the
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (CIR).
"If the meetings were not secret it
would force people to not discuss
issues as openly as they might, and it
might tend to freeze people into pos
itions," added Adams.
Third question
A third question on Lyman's door
asked why there was no employe
representation on the ad hoc CIR.

This question came before the
committee when the United Stan
ford Employees and later two Stan
ford employes requested represen
tation, according to Adams.
This motion was turned down by
the committee 6 to 3, said Adams. A
summary of this issue went to Lyman
who then forwarded it to the Trus
tees. The Trustees unanimously ap
proved the committee's decision.
Three companies operating in
South Africa have made public their
letters to Trustee President Peter
Bing. The letters were in response to
a letter from Bing urging the com
panies to work against racial dis
crimination and were released late in
spring quarter by the Stanford Uni
versity News Service.
"Union Carbide encourages ac
ceptance in South Africa of the
employment practices that Ameri
cans hold inviolable," wrote Board
Chairman William Sneath.
Social responsibility
"Because of our record of social
responsibility to our South African
employes and their dependency on
our presence, many of South Africa's
black leaders continue to urge us to
remain involved there," he said.
"We believe that our presence is a
constructive force for peaceful
change," Sneath added.
Manager of corporate institutional
relations for General Electric John
Ingersoll wrote, "The company be
lieves ... it is doing more good for
its employes in South Africa than
harm in being there."
"We have been able to make sig
nificant progress in upgrading the
position of black South African GE
employes through improved wages
and benefits, education and train
ing," Ingersoll continued.
"In the final analysis, we continue

to feel that our presence in South
Africa is beneficial to all citizens of
that country, including the blacks
who. aspire to better jobs and im
proved standards of living," replied
Board Chairman of Texaco, Maurice
Granville.
Another of the questions on Ly
man's office door had asked why
none of these corporate responses
had appeared in the Daily.
The Daily will print the responses
Friday.
The divestiture report will be "as
factual as possible," according to
Adams. "It will be a factual analysis of
various costs and elements of divesti
ture."
Delayed release
One reason for the delayed release
of the reports, said Adams, is that
there is no precedent for such a
study. In 1969 Princeton University
did some work along these lines but
nothing as extensive as the upcom
ing Stanford report, he added.
The final report is being written
now, said Adams, and should be
about 10 pages long.
When speaking on why the ad hoc
CIR meetings were closed Adams
continued, "I am very disturbed and
very angry about the fact that various
members of the ad hoc CIR have
stated their willingness to talk with
students, and that the three student
members of the committee were
given the responsibility of arranging
these meetings with students, and so
far no such meetings have been set
up."
Lloyd Dixon, one of the three
members of the ad hoc CIR, said no
meetings had been scheduled be
cause none of the members had had
the time. "We have been working on
final recommendations for
