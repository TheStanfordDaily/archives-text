# Amnesty Int'l lacks local interest

Amnesty International, the worldwide peace organi
zation which "adopts" political prisoners and agitates
for their release, has racked up an impressive list of
credentials.
The organization has just won the Nobel Peace Prize
and boasts some 100,000 members. Al has had a hand in
securing the release of 8000 of the 15,000 political pris
oners for whom it has fought, according to national Vice
Chairman Sally Lilienthal.
In contrast to the large and often effective parent
organization, the campus branch here has been plagued
by disorganization in the past and remains small and
relatively unknown.
"I'm a little puzzled myself that there's so little interest
in a human rights group like this," admitted Steve Tap
pel, a second-year graduate student from Cal Tech and
one of the campus branch leaders.
"We usually end up getting about eight people who
show up at meetings," he said.
According to former President Lynne Levine, Al was
first established here in 1973 by visiting Psychology Prof.
Sidney Bloch. That organization collapsed within a year.
A similar group was formed in Columbae House in 1975,
but "by the end of the year there were only two mem
bers," she said.
The current group, which held an organizational
meeting Monday, began last year.
Last week had been designated "Prisoner of Consci

ence Week." Al members here observed the week by
collecting signatures as part of a worldwide petition
urging the release of all political prisoners. After a week
of petitioning in White Plaza, however, fewer than 50
signatures had been collected.
Levine attributes this general student disinterest to
the fact that Al is not a politically oriented group. "Am
nesty does not take a political stand. We don't jump on
the band wagon . . . we'd lose credibility if we did," she
said.
She pointed out that this cautiousness gives Al "a
good name."
"We try not to get too far to the left or too far to the
right. For example, they want us to come out with a
general policy on the government of South Africa. All
that we can do is protest the treatment of prisoners."
Levine herself is from South Africa.
At the meeting Monday the group announced it is
adopting three prisoners — an Indonesian critic, a South
Korean high school teacher and a Peruvian teacher —
whom Al claims were imprisoned because of their be
liefs.
Levine said chances for immediate release were slim,
but noted that Al often helps prisoners in indirect ways.
Also discussed at the meeting was an upcoming
SWOPSI course on human rights, which is being spon
sored by Al. The course will last through winter and
spring quarters, with the first half as classroom work and
the second half fieldwork.

the second half fieldwork.
Amnesty International, the worldwide peace organi
zation which "adopts" political prisoners and agitates
for their release, has racked up an impressive list of
credentials.
The organization has just won the Nobel Peace Prize
and boasts some 100,000 members. Al has had a hand in
securing the release of 8000 of the 15,000 political pris
oners for whom it has fought, according to national Vice
Chairman Sally Lilienthal.
In contrast to the large and often effective parent
organization, the campus branch here has been plagued
by disorganization in the past and remains small and
relatively unknown.
"I'm a little puzzled myself that there's so little interest
in a human rights group like this," admitted Steve Tap
pel, a second-year graduate student from Cal Tech and
one of the campus branch leaders.
"We usually end up getting about eight people who
show up at meetings," he said.
According to former President Lynne Levine, Al was
first established here in 1973 by visiting Psychology Prof.
Sidney Bloch. That organization collapsed within a year.
A similar group was formed in Columbae House in 1975,
but "by the end of the year there were only two mem
bers," she said.
The current group, which held an organizational
meeting Monday, began last year.
Last week had been designated "Prisoner of Consci

ence Week." Al members here observed the week by
collecting signatures as part of a worldwide petition
urging the release of all political prisoners. After a week
of petitioning in White Plaza, however, fewer than 50
signatures had been collected.
Levine attributes this general student disinterest to
the fact that Al is not a politically oriented group. "Am
nesty does not take a political stand. We don't jump on
the band wagon . . . we'd lose credibility if we did," she
said.
She pointed out that this cautiousness gives Al "a
good name."
"We try not to get too far to the left or too far to the
right. For example, they want us to come out with a
general policy on the government of South Africa. All
that we can do is protest the treatment of prisoners."
Levine herself is from South Africa.
At the meeting Monday the group announced it is
adopting three prisoners — an Indonesian critic, a South
Korean high school teacher and a Peruvian teacher —
whom Al claims were imprisoned because of their be
liefs.
Levine said chances for immediate release were slim,
but noted that Al often helps prisoners in indirect ways.
Also discussed at the meeting was an upcoming
SWOPSI course on human rights, which is being spon
sored by Al. The course will last through winter and
spring quarters, with the first half as classroom work and
the second half fieldwork.
