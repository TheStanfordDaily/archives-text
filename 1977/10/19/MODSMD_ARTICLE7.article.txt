# Overflow crowd hears Brown

"The Catch-22 myth that the establishment has per
petuated is that women really fear success," stated
leading feminist strategist Rita Mae Brown, author of
"Rubyfruit Jungle," to an enthusiastic overflow
crowd last night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"This is probably true, but it is a fact of human
nature that you fear the unknown," continued Brown
in her keynote address of Stanford Women's Week
'77 titled "Success: A Double Edged Sword."
Brown, introduced as "the ail-American lesbian,"
remarked, "Frankly, I'd be much more frightened of
being a Stanford student than of being a lesbian!"
Brown, who received a standing ovation at the end
of her address, spoke on a historical perspective of
the women's movement, establishment myths con
cerning women and success and collective strategies
she sees as necessary for insuring the success of the
women's movement.
Downward mobility
"The downward mobility of the '60s was a reaction
to the glutted consumerism of the previous genera
tion," Brown observed. "We were caught up in an
almost Puritan self-denial trip — there was no ques
tion of Jerry Rubin's downward mobility being a suc
cess, but for women it was more difficult," she said.
"Women's success then was defined only by the
success of the men they were with; in a sense they
gave up the success they never had," Brown said.
"They were right in going along with their brothers
against the war and for civil rights, but they were
being misled by the possibilities of the new left
movement, of the rhetoric of democracy and of
egalitarianism," she added.
"They were still not free — in this environment the
women's movement was started," Brown said.
"No longer protected by their social and cultural
backgrounds or the college environment, women

were confronted with the harsh realities of the
economic situation, that all the opportunities were
not open to them," Brown commented.
Economic program
Since "we have to eat," Brown stressed the need
for the women's movement to be economically
realistic. "We must formulate an economic program
— in order to restructure America, the changes must
be systemic," she said.
"We need to utilise our skills collectively; each of
us has this responsibility," Brown emphasized.
'Those with skill in economics must use it in ways to
humanize industrialization, if that is impossible, then
to show ways of returning to farm work without los
ing civilization," she added.
"Most importantly, we must pool our financial re
sources to give our movement a strong focus —in the
real world, right-wingers organize like bandits. We
must match them in their dedication," Brown said.
"I am the first person to break through the move
ment pushed by her sisters on the grass roots level,
not being pushed by the established media as the
representative of the movement's national image,"
Brown remarked.
"Any lack of success in the feminist movement can
be blamed on our originally being caught up in insist
ing on ideological purity," Brown stated. "There was
a narcissism of small differences — in truth there is
not a perfect feminist — we can't strive to be a soror
ity of sisters all alike."
"We cannot deny our past; everyone has a
background she must claim, whether they like it or
not, so you can point toward the possibility of trans
forming it," Brown stated.
"But the power belongs to you — don't look to me
as a prophet for a magic answer, because it's up to
you. You can no longer look — you have got to be the
answer," she said.
