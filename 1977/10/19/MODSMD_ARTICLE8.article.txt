## Women's Week 
### 
Women's Week at Stanford, a five day
celebration and series of workshops and
events dealing with feminism and humanism
in the women's movement, opened last night
with a keynote address by Rita Mae Brown, a
leading feminist strategist and author.
We salute the organizers of the whole prog
ram for a number of reasons. Their dedication
and hard work have been related to us in
late-night meetings; the committment to their
cause is obvious in the choices of speakers
and topics they have chosen to deal with.
But most important is the attitude they have
shown and voiced in all our dealings with
them —that they hope to bring into Women's
Week persons who thus far have been either
unsympathetic or hostile to the concepts of
feminism.
To us this represents the finest aspirations
of such an undertaking. They intend the week

to have educational benefits not only for
those already attuned to feminism as a per
sonal element of a total world outlook, but
also to everyone else in the community.
Topics of the week will include discussions
of sexism in education, men and women relat
ing in a feminist framework, discussions of
feminist artists and their works and a number
of workshops dealing with special problems
women encounter dealing with a male
dominated society.
It is our hope that Stanford will take heed of
what is happening this week through the
program. A number of viewpoints will be pre
sented, not all of which all persons will under
stand or appreciate. But there will be ample
opportunity to investigate many aspects of
feminism.
