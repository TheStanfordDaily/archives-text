## Nuclear bomb humanistic? 
### 
Steve Barkan

In his inaugural address last
January, Jimmy Carter declared his
goal of ending the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. He also spoke up
in favor of human rights across the
world.
Like so many of his pronounce
ments, these words have since rung
hollow, and distressingly so. The
Administration's outrage over
human rights violations apparently
applies only to Communist coun
tries, not to our "friends" in Chile,
South Korea, the Phillipines, and
other nations that systematically and
cruelly tear apart the human spirit.
Carter will spend the latter part of
November visiting several nations,
including Iran and Brazil, two of the
world's most brutal governments;
his visits there will lend legitimacy
and strength to their rule by torture,
making a mockery of American ide
als.
Perhaps in no area has the con
tradiction between what the Presi
dent says and what the President
does been so evident as in the debate
over the neutron bomb. Last summer
the bomb became a controversial
issue overnight, something its spon
sors had tried to avoid by stealthily
including provisions for its funding
in a bill having nothing to do with the
military.
The function of the bomb, we
learned, was to emit low levels of
intense radiation that would slowly
kill all persons within a few hundred
yards, while leaving such things as
tanks and buildings intact. It was
meant to be used against ground
troops, specifically Soviet forces, in
vading Western Europe. Therein ,its
proponents argue, lies its deterrent
value, and hence the need for its de
velopment.
Reasons against
But the reasons against the neut
ron bomb are far more compelling.
Its level of destruction, low com
pared to conventional nuclear
weapons, could easily invite its use
on the battlefield, inevitably leading
itchy fingers to push buttons launch
ing far more deadly nuclear
weapons. Its development would
lead the Soviets to do the same, ad
ding fuel to the arms race. Ironically,
there are reports the Carter Ad
ministration is failing in its efforts to
convince our Western European al
lies, especially West Germany, that
the neutron bomb is in their best in
terests.
Given its ability to kill human be
ingswhile not harming buildings, the
neutron bomb has been called the
ideal capitalist weapon, a real estate
agent's dream. It is all that, and
more.
It is an antipersonnel weapon in
the long, horrible tradition of
weapons so horrid and so inhumane
as to violate even the lethal standards
of modern warfare. The sophisti
cated technological nature of the
neutron bomb should not disguise
the fact that its purpose and function
are no different from the mustard gas
of an early part of this century and
the more recent chemical and
biological agents, all of which have
been banned by the canons of inter
national law.
The neutron bomb is also the logi

cal descendant of the many antiper
sonnel weapons that helped the Un
ited States destroy Vietnam,
weapons that aroused international
condemnation. Have we forgotten
the memories of the war so quickly?
Have we forgotten the flechette
bombs that sent out hundreds of
one-inch nails that could shred mus
cles and body organs but couldn't
harm a tank or truck? Or the pineap
ple bomb that shot forth 250 steel
pellets, with the same consequ
ences? Or napalm?
All these weapons were mora! hor
rors, villainous achievements of a
supposedly civilized people. If the
terror posed by the neutron bomb
has not yet 'been similarly ap
preciated, perhaps that is because
the bomb has not yet been used. If
that happens, the pictures on our TV'
screens would be the same as those
we saw during Vietnam. And later, as
other nuclear bombs of far greater
power were employed, there would
be no pictures left to see.
In a remarkable statement, Presi
dent Dwight Eisenhower once said,
"Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired signify,
in the final sense, a theft from those
who hunger and are not fed, those
who are cold and are not clothed."
Thanks to Carter and an acquies
cent Congress, research on the neut
ron bomb continues as a theft not
only from our own people but also
from our human decency. Mean
while we stumble blindly along the
path to our own destruction, with
only a few brave but powerless voi
ces of peace pointing out the damna

tion to which we have condemned
ourselves.

In his inaugural address last
January, Jimmy Carter declared his
goal of ending the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. He also spoke up
in favor of human rights across the
world.
Like so many of his pronounce
ments, these words have since rung
hollow, and distressingly so. The
Administration's outrage over
human rights violations apparently
applies only to Communist coun
tries, not to our "friends" in Chile,
South Korea, the Phillipines, and
other nations that systematically and
cruelly tear apart the human spirit.
Carter will spend the latter part of
November visiting several nations,
including Iran and Brazil, two of the
world's most brutal governments;
his visits there will lend legitimacy
and strength to their rule by torture,
making a mockery of American ide
als.
Perhaps in no area has the con
tradiction between what the Presi
dent says and what the President
does been so evident as in the debate
over the neutron bomb. Last summer
the bomb became a controversial
issue overnight, something its spon
sors had tried to avoid by stealthily
including provisions for its funding
in a bill having nothing to do with the
military.
The function of the bomb, we
learned, was to emit low levels of
intense radiation that would slowly
kill all persons within a few hundred
yards, while leaving such things as
tanks and buildings intact. It was
meant to be used against ground
troops, specifically Soviet forces, in
vading Western Europe. Therein ,its
proponents argue, lies its deterrent
value, and hence the need for its de
velopment.
Reasons against
But the reasons against the neut
ron bomb are far more compelling.
Its level of destruction, low com
pared to conventional nuclear
weapons, could easily invite its use
on the battlefield, inevitably leading
itchy fingers to push buttons launch
ing far more deadly nuclear
weapons. Its development would
lead the Soviets to do the same, ad
ding fuel to the arms race. Ironically,
there are reports the Carter Ad
ministration is failing in its efforts to
convince our Western European al
lies, especially West Germany, that
the neutron bomb is in their best in
terests.
Given its ability to kill human be
ingswhile not harming buildings, the
neutron bomb has been called the
ideal capitalist weapon, a real estate
agent's dream. It is all that, and
more.
It is an antipersonnel weapon in
the long, horrible tradition of
weapons so horrid and so inhumane
as to violate even the lethal standards
of modern warfare. The sophisti
cated technological nature of the
neutron bomb should not disguise
the fact that its purpose and function
are no different from the mustard gas
of an early part of this century and
the more recent chemical and
biological agents, all of which have
been banned by the canons of inter
national law.
The neutron bomb is also the logi

cal descendant of the many antiper
sonnel weapons that helped the Un
ited States destroy Vietnam,
weapons that aroused international
condemnation. Have we forgotten
the memories of the war so quickly?
Have we forgotten the flechette
bombs that sent out hundreds of
one-inch nails that could shred mus
cles and body organs but couldn't
harm a tank or truck? Or the pineap
ple bomb that shot forth 250 steel
pellets, with the same consequ
ences? Or napalm?
All these weapons were mora! hor
rors, villainous achievements of a
supposedly civilized people. If the
terror posed by the neutron bomb
has not yet 'been similarly ap
preciated, perhaps that is because
the bomb has not yet been used. If
that happens, the pictures on our TV'
screens would be the same as those
we saw during Vietnam. And later, as
other nuclear bombs of far greater
power were employed, there would
be no pictures left to see.
In a remarkable statement, Presi
dent Dwight Eisenhower once said,
"Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired signify,
in the final sense, a theft from those
who hunger and are not fed, those
who are cold and are not clothed."
Thanks to Carter and an acquies
cent Congress, research on the neut
ron bomb continues as a theft not
only from our own people but also
from our human decency. Mean
while we stumble blindly along the
path to our own destruction, with
only a few brave but powerless voi
ces of peace pointing out the damna

tion to which we have condemned
ourselves.
