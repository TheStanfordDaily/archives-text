The Island has been an international classic ever since its release.
It uses a poetic and eloquent camera to document a way of life
interwoven with nature. The story concerns a farming family (pa
rents and their two small sons), attempting to survive on arid,
forbidding land. Their struggle with the soil and the seasons un
v folds in a simple plot that moves as naturally and unevenly as life 1
itself. There is no dialogue—sounds and music express the ele
mental struggle in nonverbal terms.
