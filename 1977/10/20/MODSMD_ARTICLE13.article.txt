# The
						Palestinian problem-another view of its history
## 
### 
In 1948 the United Nations
put forth a plan which called
for the partition of Palestine
into two separate states — an
Arab state and and a Jewish
state. The Jewish occupants of
Palestine accepted the U.N. re
solution. The Palestinian Arabs
rejected the plan. The resulting
war of 1948 brought the re
fugee problem into existence,
tmile Ghoury, Secretary Gen
eral of the Arab Higher Com
mittee, in an interview with
Beirut Telegraph (Sept. 6,1948)
declared: "The fact that there
are these refugees is a direct
consequence of the act of the
Arab States in opposing parti
tion and the Jewish State."
Haled al Axm, who served as
Prime Minister of Syria in 1948
and 1949, states in his
memoirs: "Since 1948 we (the
Arabs) have been demanding
the return of the refugees to
their homes. But we ourselves

are the ones who encouraged
them to leave. . . . We have
brought destruction upon a
million Arab refugees, by cal
ling upon them and pleading
with them to leave their land,
their homes, their work and
their businesses. ... In addi
tion, we have accustomed
them to begging for handouts

Forum

and to suffice with what little
the U.N. organization would
allocate them."
Furthermore, although fre
quent mention is made of the
Arab refugees who left Israel in
1948, the world rarely remem
bers the Jewish refugees
created during the 1948 war.
Between 1947 and 1948 there

were pogroms throughout the
Arab world causing the absorp
tion by Israel of large numbers
of Jewish refugees from Arab
lands. Specifically, Israel took
in approximately 80,000 Jews
from Egypt, 12,000 from Syria,
7500 from Lebanon, and an ad
ditional 750,000 from Aden,
Yemen, Iraq and North Africa.

The important point is not that
refugees were created on both
sides — displacements of
populations and population
exchanges are, unfortunately,
often the result of war. The im
portant point is that all the
Jewish refugees were integ
rated into Israel, made into full
citizens. They were not artifi
cially kept in refugee camps.
Ahmad Baha al-Din, writing in
the leading Beirut daily, Al
Anwar (Dec. 8, 1973), stated:
"Israel has turned the Jewish
immigrants . . . from primitive
illiterates to active citizens,
farmers, and soldiers, whereas
we (the Arabs), in the year of
disaster 1948, have turned the
Palestinian people . . . into re

fugees having to fight for
crumbs from the table of UN
RWA. . . . Hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians are
living in many Arab countries
without rights, without even an
identity card or passport . . .
the Arabs allowed the human,
social and cultural existence of
the Palestinians to disinteg
rate."
In 1955 UNRWA reported
that its rehabilitation fund of
$200 million, set aside in 1952
to provide homes and jobs for
the Palestinian refugees, was
still intact, owing to obstruc
tion and lack of cooperation by
the Arab governments. The
depressing condition of the re
fugees is the result of a delib
erate political choice, for, if it
were a purely human problem,
it would be capable of solu
tion, even without U.N. funds.
The oil billions of the Arab
countries should be more than
sufficient to provide for the re
settlement and rehabilitation
of all Arab refugees. As re
ported in the New York Times
(Editorial, June 17, 1977), last
year alone OPEC collected $44
billion more from oil sales than
it was able to spend. In 1977the
exporter's surpluses — amas
sed mostly by Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait — are expected to ex

ceed $50 billion.
It should further be men
tioned that during the 19 years
(1948-67) when Jordan and
Egypt coniiolled the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, respectively,
there was never an attempt to
set up a Palestinian state. It is
only since the land has come
under Israeli control that such
a question has even been
raised. Additionally, a close
examination of the Palestinian
refugee plight will show that
their standard of living has ac
tually improved since they
came under Israeli control.
Firstly, there have been
marked improvements in
health care. The number of
doctors and dentists has dou
bled since the 1967 war, and
the number of hospital beds
has increased 20 per cent.
Malaria is now completely ab
sent from the West Bank and
there has been a sharp drop in
deaths from measles and
poliomyelitis — factors which
have halved the infant mortal
ity rate. Even though the West
Bank is occupied territory, Is
rael has not prevented West
Bank Arabs from visiting their
brethren on the East Bank in
Jordan. Under Israel's Open
Bridges Policy, visitors from
Arab States freely cross the
Jordan River bridges or land at
Ben Gurion Airport. This is al
lowed at great monetary ex
pense to the Israeli govern
ment. Arab children in the
West Bank are given free edu
cation through the 12th grade,
while Israeli children may only
attend freely until the 9th
grade. Many other special con
siderations are granted to the
Palestinian refugees.
