The dynamite thing about
"The Serial" is that it really
clears away the bullshit. I
mean, it's subtitled "A Year in
the Life of Marin County," and
it is authentic, you know? Like,
if you get off on the California
dynamic at all, you develop this
heavy duty simpatico right out
of the starting gate. It's almost
freaky.
The star is Kate Holroyd, this
really beautiful human being
who's going through some
heavy changes, mostly be
cause of Harvey (who's super
bad news), whom she's got this
fixated, mutual-dependency,
on-going relationship with.
Harvey's an escrow officer at
the Wells Fargo bank and he's
into this murky, off-the-wall,
macho trip, replete with anti
feminist put-downs and a ges
talt that's sort of totally repres
sed. What he is is a microcosm
of the whole sick male power
base in Amerika, and he simply
can't assimilate all the far-out
emanations that come from
Kate's getting in touch with
herself. No way. So instead of
being laid-back and cool about
it, he trucks off to a one
bedroom condo where he
exploits this foxy woman of 18
named Marlene who does a
number on all this enzyme
killing crap he's been scarfing
up at the grocery store. She

gets him into lentil loaves, soya
milk, kelp and ginseng root,
but it turns out he can't handle
that either so he runs back to
the Holroyd's Sutton Manor
tract house to "take responsi
bility" when his daughter Joan,
a woman of 14, joins the
Moonies.
Meanwhile Kate is in her
own space, improving her
self-image, raising her con
sciousness, inventing a diffe
rent life script. So are her
friends, The Sisters. Martha
can't get behind the master/
slave shtick, so with her fifth
husband Bill, she's worked out
a groovy marriage contract that
spells out exactly what they can
expect from each other in this

Books -=

Permanent Commitment: "A
subclause permitted Martha to
ski at Tahoe one week every
winter, in january or February,
depending on snow condi
tions, while Bill took over the
laundry and kids. She recipro
cated by allowing Bill to go
backpacking in the Sierras for
10 days every summer, al
though due to some ambiguity
in the wording of the contract,
they disagreed about whether
or not she should just let the
garbage pile up while he was
gone.
And Carol. Carol was plug
ged into that "anatomy is de
stiny" crap and she was sleep
ingaround all the time because
she thought she had to prove
something. Then her psychiat

rist put her straight, got her in
touch with her essence, and
she came out of the closet,
admitted she was gay. " 'You
really come to terms with being
a woman and you're gonna re
late to women. I mean, who
needs men? What do you need
Harvey for, for instance? What
does anybody need Harvey
for?' "
" 'Well,' " Kate said ear
nestly, " 'Harvey's got a lot of
good points, he really does. He
grows terrific tomatoes. And
this year he gave me 'Our
Bodies, Ourselves' for our an
niversary, which I thought was
really progress, because last
year he gave me this Waring
blender. Don't you think that
shows he's, like trying?' "
In contrast, Harvey's buddy
Sam Stein is going down the

tube. After making it with Mar
lene for awhile, he just wigs
out and decides to retreat to
Hammond, Indiana, because
he " 'can't take the whole
Marin head-set anymore.' "
" 'Plantstores,' "Samcomp
lains. " 'Kleenraw in the hum
mingbird feeder. Weekends at
Tahoe. Vasectomies. The Fun
gus Faire, redwood bathtubs,
mandalas, compost piles,
needlepoint, burglar
alarms. . . .' Harvey had al
ready begun to back toward
the door when Sam's voice
rose to a cracked tenor.
'Acupuncture, saunas, sour
dough, macrame. . . "
There are 52 zingy episodes
to "The Serial" and they're all
pretty much like that, full of
people you can really relate to
and situations that may very
well enable you to expand your
parameters, or just go with the
flow and free-associate.
Cyra McFadden has the

whole schmeer down cold.
She verbalizes what others
merely conceptualize and I
think that's just tremendous.
She's a cross between Erma
Bombeck and John Updike,
Gloria Steinem and Bruce Jay
Friedman, and though some
people think the novel is a
funny, funny satire, sort of this
value-judgment on the Liber
ated Lifestyle, I thought it was
just super deep, and all the way
through "The Serial" I was
flashing on what a great com
mune California is, where
everybody's different but they
all think the same so there's no
bullshit anywhere.
