## Henry IV excellent 
### 
"This Star of England" — an adaptation
of Shakespeare now in repertory at the
California Actors Theater in Los Gatos —
reduces lOV2 hours of bard into 2Vi hour
segments. Henry IV, the first segment,
shortens two complete plays to a single
performance. Put too simply, it recounts
Henry IV's difficulties with his allies from
beginning to end, and similarly deals with
Prince Hal's evolution from drinking
buddy extraordinaire into Henry V. It also
introduces "sweet Jack Falstaff," a
sandbag of a human being who is to my
mind the funniest such organism in the
history of the medium. Dakin Matthews
has managed to perform what he admits is
a textual "bloodletting" without greatly al
tering the play, and the acting is outstand
ing nearly all the way around.

Still these comments are deceiving, in
that they imply that "This Star of England"
is above all else a textual exercise, one to
be met by moderate applause and a few
scholarly harumphs. They do not reflect
the vigor of the performance, and they
pretend that given the choice, I would
rather sit through lOV2 hours.
Accordingly, I should like to make my
true feelings known. "This Star of England"
is the finest Bay Area Shakespearean pro
duction extant, for the following reasons:
—Byron Jennings plays Hal in an intelli
gent, subdued, almost devious manner,
thereby allowing what could very easily be
a cluttered, chaotic production some
breathing room.
—Dakin Matthews, who as has been
said was responsible for the adapting, is an

extremely funny Falstaff, and he, too, only
rarely overdoes it.
—The staging is such that it counters the
effect of the frequent scene changes,
exits, entrances and what-nots necessi
tated by the adapting, while it still man
ages to emphasize specific attitudes, and
heighten specific moments (for instance,
as Hal banishes Falstaff at the end, the
other characters exit and leave him alone
at one end of the stage, under a single
diminishing spotlight.
—Finally, the Los Gatos Old Town Thea
ter is a perfect site for this event. The
seating is uniformly excellent (the place is
relatively small, and as a consequence the
worst seat in the house would be coveted
in most other theaters).
In sum, "This Star of England" has com
bined a lot of major theater acting with
most of the more intimate advantages that
accrue from working a smaller, more
pleasant spot.

"This Star of England" — an adaptation
of Shakespeare now in repertory at the
California Actors Theater in Los Gatos —
reduces lOV2 hours of bard into 2Vi hour
segments. Henry IV, the first segment,
shortens two complete plays to a single
performance. Put too simply, it recounts
Henry IV's difficulties with his allies from
beginning to end, and similarly deals with
Prince Hal's evolution from drinking
buddy extraordinaire into Henry V. It also
introduces "sweet Jack Falstaff," a
sandbag of a human being who is to my
mind the funniest such organism in the
history of the medium. Dakin Matthews
has managed to perform what he admits is
a textual "bloodletting" without greatly al
tering the play, and the acting is outstand
ing nearly all the way around.

Still these comments are deceiving, in
that they imply that "This Star of England"
is above all else a textual exercise, one to
be met by moderate applause and a few
scholarly harumphs. They do not reflect
the vigor of the performance, and they
pretend that given the choice, I would
rather sit through lOV2 hours.
Accordingly, I should like to make my
true feelings known. "This Star of England"
is the finest Bay Area Shakespearean pro
duction extant, for the following reasons:
—Byron Jennings plays Hal in an intelli
gent, subdued, almost devious manner,
thereby allowing what could very easily be
a cluttered, chaotic production some
breathing room.
—Dakin Matthews, who as has been
said was responsible for the adapting, is an

extremely funny Falstaff, and he, too, only
rarely overdoes it.
—The staging is such that it counters the
effect of the frequent scene changes,
exits, entrances and what-nots necessi
tated by the adapting, while it still man
ages to emphasize specific attitudes, and
heighten specific moments (for instance,
as Hal banishes Falstaff at the end, the
other characters exit and leave him alone
at one end of the stage, under a single
diminishing spotlight.
—Finally, the Los Gatos Old Town Thea
ter is a perfect site for this event. The
seating is uniformly excellent (the place is
relatively small, and as a consequence the
worst seat in the house would be coveted
in most other theaters).
In sum, "This Star of England" has com
bined a lot of major theater acting with
most of the more intimate advantages that
accrue from working a smaller, more
pleasant spot.
