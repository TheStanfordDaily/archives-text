Chuck Mangione
"Feels So Good"
A & M Records
Since Chuck Mangione
began his career with Art
Blakey's Jazz Messengers sev
eral years ago, he has drifted
steadily towards playing music
which could often be called
"pop" or "easy listening." His
latest album, "Feels So Good,"
will undoubtedly appeal to his
new-found audience, but also
has quite a bit to offer hard
core jazz fans.
The jazz-rock fusion has
produced three distinctive
styles: the funky-rhythmic
school led by Herbie Hancock
or the Jazz Crusaders; the
spacey, harmonic style,
typified by John McLaughlin
and Chick Corea; and the
highly melodic style displayed
by Chuck Mangione and John
Klemmer.
This is a sketchy description

of jazz-rock, but, I feel, an ac
curate one. The striking aspect
of Mangione's recent albums
has been his melodies. The
large orchestration, the impro
vised solos have been just
frosting on the cake. It is this
melodic and lyrical emphasis
which has won Mangione the
hearts of the record-buying
public.
The beauty of "Feels So
Good" is that it dispenses with
the thick arrangements and
pop vocals of previous albums
and showcases instead the
simple beauty of the melodies.
The best example of this is
the title song, "Feels So
Good." The guitar-flugelhorn
duet, which opens the piece, is
one of the nicer things Man
gione has done. "The Xlth
Commandment" and "Theme
from 'Side Street' " are suc
cessful pieces for the same
reason.

Mangione's attempts at up
tempo numbers are less appe
aling. "Hide & Seek" falls into
the disco cliches, which have
plagued a lot of recent jazz.
Mangione has never been a
technically impressive musi
cian; faster numbers'have
never been his strong point.
The one significant draw
back to the album is the loss of
Gerry Niewood, whose bril-

liant sax work added to several
of Mangione's previous al
bums.
John Wood
"Until Goodbye"
Ranwood Records
John Wood is an unheralded
LA pianist who deserves much
more attention than the press

has given him. His latest al
bum, "Until Goodbye," is one
of the most refreshing releases
of the year and, unfortunately,
will probably soon fade into
obscurity.
The first side is an unaccom
panied performance which is
as good as any solo piano being
played today. The music is slow
and dreamlikebut by no means
background music. Wood's
chord voicings and melodic
lines demand close listening.
Obviously influenced by Bill
Evans, Wood shares that ar
tist's beautifully clear touch
and singing tone. The technical
proficiency, which Wood has
gained after playing the piano
only 11 years, is literally amaz
ing.
On side two, Wood is joined
by bassist Tony Dumas who
shows a close rapport with
Wood but is miked too loud
and often obscures some of

Wood's finer moments.
"Until Goodbye" is an amaz
ing album which will be dif
ficult to find, except in spe
cialty stores with large stocks
of jazz. Wood's previous al
bums, "Freeway of Love," and
"Introducing the John Wood
Trio," are excellent albums as
well but are almost impossible
to find.
It is difficult to believe that
John Wood will remain
obscure for long. His playing
has the confidence of the most
experienced professional and
the assurance of a musician
who knows well the path he
wants to take.
Most impressive of all, is the
fact that Wood is only 27. It will
be interesting to see what di
rections he takes in the future.
His present position certainly
indicates that they will be
noteworthy.
