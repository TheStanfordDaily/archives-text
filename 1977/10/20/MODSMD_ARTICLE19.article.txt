## Commission will rule on charges in ASSU election 
### Mike Charlson 
The Council of Presidents
(COP) and the ASSU Senate
chairman will set up a special
commission to review alleged
irregularities during the ASSU
election campaign last week,
according to Senate Chairman
Pat Flinn.
In other election news,
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy announced ap
proval of both fee assessment
referenda and slight alterations
in senate election results after
the receipt of some overseas
votes.
Flinn said the decision to
create a commission came
after Murphy gave Flinn a pre
liminary report concerning ac
tivities of some candidates.
Murphy said the report "de
tails the fact that extensive ir
regularities did occur" and said
the report included a list of
candidates who should possi
bly be disqualified from the
race.
Neither Flinn nor Murphy
would say how many persons
are on the list, but Murphy said
"a large number" are involved.
Flinn said the commission
will convene within a few days
and will likely complete its
work within a few weeks.
There will be three to five
members of the group, all stu
dents.
The senate will be convened
only after the commission de
cides which candidates, if any,
should be disqualified, and
only those persons not disqual
ified by the board will be sea
ted, Flinn said.
The commission will be "to
tally independent" and its de
cision will be subject to review
"by no one," Flinn said. Its
meetings will be open to the
public, he said.
Members of the commission
will be chosen by the COP and
Flinn, but no formal process
for selection exists.
"We're trying to pick people
who are above board," Flinn
said. He said selection was dif
ficult because candidates must
be willing to serve, removed

from the situation enough to
serve and willing to accept the
responsibility of serving on the
board.
Flinn said the decision to
form an independent group
came only after "everyone
from former COP candidates
to (University counsel) John
Schwartz" was asked for ad
vice.
He said nothing in the ASSU
Constitution prohibits such a
body from being formed. He
said lack or guidance in the
constitution is partially re
sponsible for the current situa
tion.
"The constitution has been
singularly unhelpful" in this
matter, Flinn said.
Murphy said his report to
Flinn was preliminary and that
he hoped to finish his investi
gation by the end of the week.
He said he thought his work
may continue into the middle
of next week, however.
The final report he forwards
to Flinn will include a list of
mitigating circumstances,"
Murphy said.
None of the recommenda
tions of the report "are clear
cut," Flinn said. "Therearefine
shades of gray. None will be an
easy decision."
The investigation into al
leged misconduct began Oct.
12 after distribution of material
aimed at injuring the cam
paigns of some senate candi
dates or slates, he said.
Distribution of one leaflet
aimed against the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee (SOC)
slate was first denied, then
later admitted, by persons in
volved in the campaign of
senator-elect Dan Livingston
and alternate-elect Kevin Chil
dress.
Pro-SOC material, which at
tacked other undergraduate
candidates, was distributed
when Chris Cray and repor
tedly 25 other persons stuffed
them in copies of the Oct. 12
Daily.
SOC slate members have
denied responsibility for the
incident.

In addition, it has been al
leged that some candidates
may have exceeded the $50
campaign expenditure limit.
Murphy and Flinn both de
clined comment on specific
cases.
In other election news,
Murphy said the proposal to
assess a one-quarter $1 fee as
sessment during winter quar
ter for the ASSU Speakers
Bureau passed by a 2139 to 519
vote last week.
The two-quarter $1 assess
ment proposal for the ASSU
Recycling Center passed 2513
to 245. The fees will be col
lected winter and spring quar
ters.
Murphy also said overseas
votes from Austrian, French
and Italian campuses have al
tered the results in the under
graduate senate election
slightly.
