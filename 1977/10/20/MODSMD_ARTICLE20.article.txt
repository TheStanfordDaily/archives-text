Johannesburg, South Africa
(AP) — In a massive predawn
crackdown, South Africa's
white rulers yesterday banned
virtually every major black or
ganization in the country,
closed its two principal black
newspapers and detained at
least 50 prominent blacks.
Striking nationwide, security
police also slapped restriction
orders on six whites and raided
the offices and homes of black
leaders, movements and
church bodies.
"This is the limit," declared
Thamsanqe Jambule, a high
school headmaster in the vast
Soweto black township south
of Johannesburg. "I think we
are fast moving toward a
climax."
The crackdown, the tough
est in this white-ruled nation
since the early 19605, came
amid mounting attacks on the
government over the Sept. 12
prison death of Steve Biko, a
major South African black
nationalist activist.
Justice Minister James
Kruger said the government
was moving against organiza
tions, newspapers and people
being used to create a "re
volutionary climate" and a
black-white confrontation.
'Preventive detention'
He said those detained in the
raids would be held in "pre
ventive detention" until the
situation has "returned to
normal."
Warning of even tougher
measures, Kruger said: "The
government is determined to
ensure that the peaceful
coexistence of peoples in
South Africa is not disturbed by
a small group of anarchists."
The government measures
provoked an immediate outcry
from blacks and liberal whites,
and raised fears of a violent
backlash.
Black primary school chil
dren began streaming out of

classes in Soweto in protest.
Armed police arrested at least
50 white students from the
Witwatersrand University con
verging on a post office near
central (ohannesburg to send
protest telegrams to Prime
Minister John Vorster.
Banned papers
The newspapers banned
were the World and its sister
publication, the Weekend
World, published in Johan
nesburg. The World, South Af
rica's major black newspaper,
is estimated to have at least a
million readers.
Its editor, Percy Qoboza,
was seized by plainclothesmen
at the paper's offices shortly
before he was scheduled to
hold a news conference.
Weekend World news editor
Aggrey Klaaste was picked up
overnight.
The 18 black and interracial
organizations banned were
generally regarded as moder
ate and nonviolent. All the
militant black organizations
have already been banned and
their leaders jailed.
Those ordered banned in
cluded two organizations
linked to Biko — the Black
People's Convention (BPC)
and the South African Students
Organization, as well as the
Christian Institute and the
Soweto Students' Representa
five Council.
Those detained included
BPC President Hlaku Rachidi
and Roman Catholic leader the
Rev. Patrick Mkhatshwa. The
whites banned for five years
were Christian Institute Direc
tor Beyers Naude and two col
leagues; Donald Woods, the
outspoken editor of the East
London daily Dispatch, and
two Cape Town clergymen.
Banned persons are re
stricted to their hometowns,
may not have visitors without
official permission and can't be
quoted in the press.
