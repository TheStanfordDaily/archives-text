# Western Culture task force starts student input search

### Rob Lempert 
Members of the Western Culture Task Force,
in an effort to gain student input on the prop
osed Western Culture requirement, will be con
vening in dorm lounges over the next few
weeks.
Last year the Faculty Senate voted to add a
Western Culture requirement to the curriculum
here. It then formed the task force, consisting of
both faculty and students, to design a course
fulfilling that requirement.
In the Junipero lounge Tuesday night, approx
imately 20 persons joined chairman Ronald Re
bholz, associate English professoi, . id three
other task force members in a discussion of the
plans presently under consideration.
The first alternative, the one favored by Re
bholz and most of the task force, is a series of
four or five unit seminars, with students taking
one seminar each quarter for three quarters.
No seminar would have more than 20 stu
dents, which means more than 80 separate sec
tions would be needed to accommodate all in
coming freshmen and transfers. However, there
would only be one reading list common to all
the classes.
The second alternative differs from the first by
eliminating the common reading list. There

were anywhere from two to 80 different lists and
students would be free to choose whichever
aspects of Western Culture they wished to
study. This alternative would resemble the pre
sent freshman seminar program.
The third alternative is to abandon seminars
entirely and to rely on large lecture courses.
Either one large Western Culture series would
be required, similar to the type abolished here
in 1969, or a smaller series would be added and
students would be required to take it,
Humanities 61-63, or History 1-3.
The task force must give a preliminary report
to the Committee on Undergraduate Education
by Nov. 19 and is presently debating the relative
merits of the alternative class structures.
The group plans future meetings in Stern, Elo
Mo and possibly Branner and the Row Elouses.
The Faculty Senate will probably receive its
proposals by late lanuary.
Rebholz said he expects a pilot program will
be set up next fall to test whichever course struc
ture is decided upon. The course will be volun
tary and enroll just a few hundred students. If it
proves satisfactory, Stanford may have a full
fledged Western Culture requirement by au
tumn quarter, 1979.
