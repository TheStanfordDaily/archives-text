House probes Korean bribes
Washington — The South Korean ambassador
stuffed envelopes with $100 bills as part of a
long-range plan by his government to "buy off"
Congress, the House ethics committee was told
yesterday.
"Because of what has come to light in our
investigation, buttressed by the present attitude
of the South Korean government, there are
compelling indications that the South Korean
government . . . was engaged in an effort to
influence members of Congress by giving them
valuable gifts," said special counsel Leon
Jaworski.
Jaworski made the statements in opening re
marks as the ethics panel began a nationally
televised hearing into what could become one
of the worst scandals in congressional history.
Study questions dam safety
Washington — A new study prompted by the
Teton Dam disaster warns that 17 western dams
could collapse if subjected to extremely heavy
flooding.
All 17, built before the 19505, contain design
flaws and "require modification to prevent their
failure should the currently estimated maximum
probable flood occur," the Bureau of Reclama
tion report concluded.
"Although the probability of the occurrence
of the maximum probable flood is extremely
unlikely, such a flood could possibly occur in
any year," it said.
In addition, the report cited eight dams with
seepage problems that pose a safety threat. The
seepage "indicates a possible need for remedial
measures," the report said.
German terrorists slay hostage
Paris—The body of West German industrialist
Hanns-Martin Schleyer, kidnapped six weeks
ago, was found last night stuffed into the trunk
of a car in the French city of Mulhouse near the

German border, the French Interior Ministry
said. A spokesman said his throat had been cut.
Earlier in the day, a communique received by
an extreme leftist Paris newspaper said: "The
existence of Mr. Hanns-Martin Schleyer has
been ended."
He was abducted Sept. 5 by terrorists firing
automatic weapons.
The communique was signed "Commando
Siegfried Houssner R.A.F."
That was the name of the German terror group
that said it kidnapped Schleyer and threatened
to execute him unless the West German gov
ernment released 11 terrorists from West Ger
man jails and flew them to the refuge of their
choice with nearly half a million dollars in ran
som.
The government has not met the demands.
Committee to meld energy bills
Washington — Members of a House-Senate
conference committee were eyeing possible
compromises yesterday to enable utilities to in
stall home insulation and other energy-saving
devices when requested by consumers.
As the panel sought accord on its first energy
issue, President Jimmy Carter hinted that he
might cancel or postpone his overseas trip next
month if Congress does not finish work on an
energy bill by then.
The conference panel is trying to reconcile
the wide House and Senate differences in the
energy legislation.
Carter, who favors the House bill because it
contains most of his energy proposals, met with
House Democrats on the negotiating panel yes
terday to discuss strategy.

House probes Korean bribes
Washington — The South Korean ambassador
stuffed envelopes with $100 bills as part of a
long-range plan by his government to "buy off"
Congress, the House ethics committee was told
yesterday.
"Because of what has come to light in our
investigation, buttressed by the present attitude
of the South Korean government, there are
compelling indications that the South Korean
government . . . was engaged in an effort to
influence members of Congress by giving them
valuable gifts," said special counsel Leon
Jaworski.
Jaworski made the statements in opening re
marks as the ethics panel began a nationally
televised hearing into what could become one
of the worst scandals in congressional history.
Study questions dam safety
Washington — A new study prompted by the
Teton Dam disaster warns that 17 western dams
could collapse if subjected to extremely heavy
flooding.
All 17, built before the 19505, contain design
flaws and "require modification to prevent their
failure should the currently estimated maximum
probable flood occur," the Bureau of Reclama
tion report concluded.
"Although the probability of the occurrence
of the maximum probable flood is extremely
unlikely, such a flood could possibly occur in
any year," it said.
In addition, the report cited eight dams with
seepage problems that pose a safety threat. The
seepage "indicates a possible need for remedial
measures," the report said.
German terrorists slay hostage
Paris—The body of West German industrialist
Hanns-Martin Schleyer, kidnapped six weeks
ago, was found last night stuffed into the trunk
of a car in the French city of Mulhouse near the

German border, the French Interior Ministry
said. A spokesman said his throat had been cut.
Earlier in the day, a communique received by
an extreme leftist Paris newspaper said: "The
existence of Mr. Hanns-Martin Schleyer has
been ended."
He was abducted Sept. 5 by terrorists firing
automatic weapons.
The communique was signed "Commando
Siegfried Houssner R.A.F."
That was the name of the German terror group
that said it kidnapped Schleyer and threatened
to execute him unless the West German gov
ernment released 11 terrorists from West Ger
man jails and flew them to the refuge of their
choice with nearly half a million dollars in ran
som.
The government has not met the demands.
Committee to meld energy bills
Washington — Members of a House-Senate
conference committee were eyeing possible
compromises yesterday to enable utilities to in
stall home insulation and other energy-saving
devices when requested by consumers.
As the panel sought accord on its first energy
issue, President Jimmy Carter hinted that he
might cancel or postpone his overseas trip next
month if Congress does not finish work on an
energy bill by then.
The conference panel is trying to reconcile
the wide House and Senate differences in the
energy legislation.
Carter, who favors the House bill because it
contains most of his energy proposals, met with
House Democrats on the negotiating panel yes
terday to discuss strategy.
