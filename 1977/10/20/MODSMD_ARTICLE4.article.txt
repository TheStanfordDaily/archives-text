# Pauling on cancer: causes, treatments, research
## 
### 
Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi
gures of this century. For many
years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or
even a number of discip
lines, but has covered numer-

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

wryly comments, "it hasn't

the NAS that we would be rais

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

variety of subjects, scientific
and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

crease in the incidence of
cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
