# Pauling on cancer: causes, treatments, research
## 
### 
Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi
gures of this century. For many
years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or
even a number of discip
lines, but has covered numer-

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

variety of subjects, scientific
and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

crease in the incidence of
cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make
decisions abCL't grants - the

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub

elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University

"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came

cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C

San Diego, and Stanford Uni

try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub

and Pauling had been a

upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica

just been constructed at the

talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de

vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'

hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of
the new cancer research build

crease in the incidence of
cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

way the vitamin C therapy for
cancer was begun."
paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get

many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make
decisions abCL't grants - the

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus

point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

C is in giving better general nutrition by

committees that make recom

amount of money in the Na

though it is $800 million this

supporting the work of the Na

someone, some outsider,

then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get

on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C
is such a substance. It im

human body; it puts a person

well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov

feeling that to be unconven

point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a

His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of
the new cancer research build

crease in the incidence of
cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

cancer was begun."
paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

it?

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make
decisions abCL't grants - the
National Cancer Institute, tor
. example — there is probably a
feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

It was pretty clear that vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not necessarily directly.

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —

clinical studies with humans in

had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have

what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi
gures of this century. For many
years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or
even a number of discip
lines, but has covered numer-

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

yielded the most spectacular

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov

feeling that to be unconven

tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

and cancer, and that he himself

of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi

years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

wryly comments, "it hasn't

yielded the most spectacular

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica

talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de

vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C
is such a substance. It im

Linus Pauling is one of the

at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of
the new cancer research build

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

it?

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make
decisions abCL't grants - the
National Cancer Institute, tor
. example — there is probably a
feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

It was pretty clear that vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not necessarily directly.

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

diseases of all types.

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C
is such a substance. It im

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi
gures of this century. For many
years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or
even a number of discip
lines, but has covered numer-

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven

to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub

elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background

have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi

years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica

just been constructed at the

talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de

vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a

C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C
is such a substance. It im

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi

years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

wryly comments, "it hasn't

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,

Ewan Cameron called

to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic

cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven

to you in holding your job. The

adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C
is such a substance. It im
proves the functioning of the
human body; it puts a person

has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub

and Pauling had been a

His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of
the new cancer research build

crease in the incidence of
cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

cancer was begun."
paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and
save 10 or 13 per cent of them, why not do
it?

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make
decisions abCL't grants - the
National Cancer Institute, tor
. example — there is probably a
feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

It was pretty clear that vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not necessarily directly.

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —

had made contacts with hospi

carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi

enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi
gures of this century. For many
years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or
even a number of discip
lines, but has covered numer-

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

yielded the most spectacular

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov

feeling that to be unconven

to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

and cancer, and that he himself

of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C

Linus Pauling is one of the
outstanding scientific fi

years a professor of chemistry
at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45
years Pauling's work has not
been contined to any one or

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

wryly comments, "it hasn't

yielded the most spectacular

tory, yet it too remains virtually
unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially
mental retardation, but to

some extent schizophrenia, as
molecular diseases. In the
course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita
mins in relation to both mental
disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called

been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica

talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make

feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
because the natural protective
mechanisms do operate
against all diseases. Vitamin C
is such a substance. It im

Linus Pauling is one of the

at the Cajifornia Institute of
Technology, Oxford Univer
vty, University of California
San Diego, and Stanford Uni
versity, he is now Director of
the I inns Pauling Institute of
Science and Medicine in
Menlo Park. During the past 45

ous fields of physics, chemis
try, biology, and medicine. He
has written more than 500 sci
entific papers and authored
several books, including the
classic "The Nature of the
Chemical Bond" (1939).
In conducting this work,
Pauling has made fundamental
contributions to our know
ledge of molecular structure,
the properties of hemoglobin
and other proteins, enzyme re
search, immunology, anes
thesia, aging, mental disease,
and orthomolecular medicine.
He has received the Phillips
Medal of the American College
of Physicians for contributions
to internal medicine, the
Thomas Addis Medal of the
American Nephrosis Society,
the Modern Medicine Award,
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry
in 1954, the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962 (making him the only
person to have individually
won two Nobel Prizes), and a
great number of additional
awards in science, medicine
and other fields.
After he wrote "Vitamic C
and the Common Cold" in
1970, Pauling's scientific work
began to generate con
troversy, especially his advo
cacy of vitamin C. He has re
peatedly analyzed the pub
lished controlled studies,
showing that conclusive evi
dence about the preventive
and therapeutic value of vita
min C against the common
cold exists. His examination of
these published studies was re
jected by the journal of the
American Medical Association
after Pauling twice revised the
paper to meet the suggestions
of its referees. It was published
in Medical Tribune. Con
troversy or no, Pauling has
gone unrefuted.
Pauling contends that vita
min C's therapeutic potential is
so great that extensive clinical
work in various diseases is war
ranted. Recently he has
teamed with Dr. Ewan Came
ron in research on vitamin C
and cancer. After writing a
landmark paper entitled "As
corbic Acid and the
Glycosaminoglycans: Art Or
thomolecular Approach to
Cancer and Other Diseases" in
1973, Pauling and Cameron
discussed where they would
publish it. Pauling suggested
sending the paper to the Pro
ceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. The NAS
had a 58-year-old policy that a
member had the right to pub
lish papers in the Proceedings,
and Pauling had been a
member since 1933. The edito
rial board, however, which ac
tually had advisorv power only,
decided to change the policy

unpublicized. At the present
time, cancer, a cause of death
accompanied by unusual suf
fering, causes about 20 per

cent of all deaths in the United
States.
Pauling is a vibrant man,
exuding energy and humor,
extremely kind and patient. His
long white hair flows from the
dome of his head — which
sometimes is beneath a black
beret and sometimes not. His
modest office is mostly filled
with his desk and with book
shelves harboring all manner
of volumes on an extraordinary

and otherwise. On one wall
rests a greenboard replete with
molecular diagrams, chemical
equations, the names of do
zens of researchers, the
hieroglyphics of quantum
mechanics," and the notation
"Asc Ac & Cancer."
His desk is covered with
papers, casually but neatly
stacked according to topic,
one article separated from
another by paperclips. At the
upper right corner of the desk,
15 copies of Pauling's new
book are open at the flyleaf,
each signed "Linus Pauling" in
a fluid script in black ink.
When I arrived at his office to
discuss his work with cancer
and vitamin C, Pauling was
speaking on the telephone
with the London Times. He had
just returned from a European
tour, where, as usual, he had
spoken to over-flow audiences
anxious to see and hear the
world's most eminent chemist,
a man famed tor his speaking
flair as well as for his scientific
genius.
The scientific literature of
the 20th century is dotted with
acknowledgements of "helpful
discussions with Linus Paul
ing." One scientist I talked to
confided that whenever she
met Pauling at a party, he
would kindly advance her re
search 10 steps. Yet for all of
that, Pauling prefaced his re
marks to me with the apology
that he would have to "hem
and haw as much as I like." Ac
tually he speaks in a beautifully
modulated voice, with very dis
tinct pronunciation, and with
all the fluency expected from a
man who has dictated some of
the standard chemical texts of
our day one chapter at a time
from memory.
I asked Pauling how he had
come to examine the matter of
vitamin C and cancer. "In
1935," he told me, "I began
work on hemoglobin, largely
from the chemical side, and
very soon became interested in
the immunological
mechanisms in the body and
'he general problem of the re
lation between physiological
activity,and molecular struc

ture of the substances in the
human body. Then, in 1945, I
had the idea that later came to
be called molecular disease. In
particular, I thought sickle-rell
of molecular disease, which is
that the disease involves ab
normal molecules, usually pro
tein molecules.
My principal collaborator,
Harvey A. Itano, had been an
officer ot the public health ser
vice for some years, and after
eight years with me, he was or
dered back to Bethesda, Mary
land. I had to decide what I
would do next. I felt I wouldn't
try to compete with him on the
hereditary hemolytic anemias,
but rather, since there are
many other diseases, I would
look at other diseases to see to
what extent they are molecular
diseases. I thought they might
as well be an important disease
or group of diseases. I had de
cided that cancer and mental

illness were very important
diseases and that I should
make a choice. Well, I decided
on mental disease, with the ar
gument that almost everybody
was working on cancer and
practically nobody in 1953 was
working on mental disease,
from a scientific point of view.
"I got a grant from the Ford
Foundation, and then grants
from the National Institute of
Mental FHealth, and for about a
decade, 1954 to 1964, I worked
on mental illness, especially

course of these investigations I
became interested in the vita

disease and health in general. I
ran across the work that A. Hot
ter and H. Osmond had been
doing in Canada about vita
mins in relation to schizop
hrenia. I was much impressed
by that. It seemed to be a new
idea, essentially. At first I was
skeptical, but then I began
checking the medical literature
and also thinking, and I formu
lated some general principles
of what I called "orthomolecu
lar medicine." I invented this
word, "orthomolecular,"
meaning the right molecules in
the right concentrations, and I
said that orthomolecular
medicine is the prevention and
treatment of disease by using
substances that are normally
present in the human body,
many of them in fact required
for life, by varying their con
centrations in the human
body. I wrote a couple of pap
ers on orthomolecular
psychiatry, in one of which I
introduced the word, and I
coedited a book entitled "Or
thomolecular Psychiatry."
Now there's an International
Academy of Orthomolecular
Psvchiatrv, a Journal of Or
thomolecular Psychiatry, a
California Orthomolecular
Medical Association, and a
number of similar organiza

tions of orthomolecular physi
cians and scientists. So that
word and argument have be
come popular.
"Then in March 1966 when I
in New Yoik, a biochemist
ihe next 15 or 20 year .. He
wrote saying that he wanted
me to live even longer and that
if I would follow his regime
about high intake of vitamin C,
I would. He had written four
papers about vitamin C, argu
ments to the effect that most
people, practically everyone,
gets a very small amount of vit
amin C compared with the op
timum intake which I had been
discussing in my writing about
orthomolecular medicine, and
that in particular the common
cold could be controlled with
vitamin C. I mentioned this
when I was talking in a new
medical school and a professor
of medicine then wrote me a
very strong ietter attacking me
for having suggested this. He
asked if I could point to one
double blind study that had
shown that vitamin C had any
more value than a placebo.
Well, I couldn't, because I
hadn't read the literature, but I
decided that I would read the
literature. I didn't get around
to it for several months, but fi
nally I checked the literature
and found half a dozen double
blind studies showing that vit
amin C has value against the
common cold.
"I wrote "Vitamin C and the
Common Cold" in 1970. Well,
it was attacked so much by the
medical profession that I had
to continue working. I began
to run across statements about
vitamins in relation to cancer,
and about 1970 I read a book by
Ewan Cameron called
"Hyaluronidase and Cancer,"

published in 1966.1 had already
been checking up, on not only
the common cold but other
diseases, and in November
1971 I gave a talk at the dedica
tion of the Ben May Laboratory
for Cancer Research that had
just been constructed at the
University of Chicago. In my
talk I felt I needed to say some
thing about cancer while
speaking at this dedication of
the new cancer research build

cancer and mortality from
cancer if large doses of vitamin
C were used (I am now willing
to make an estimate that the
age-specific incidence of this
disease might well be de
creased by 50 per cent). My talk
was published in 1972, but
there were newspaper articles
about it immediately after it
was given. Someone sent
Cameron an article from the
New York Times, and Cameron
wrote to me to ask how much
vitamin C to try. I said 10 grams
a day. There are various argu
ments for that which are de
scribed in both of mv books on
vitamin C. He began cautiously

paused tor a moment
and I asked him to retrace
the fusion of h-s ideas with
Cameron's book which ena
bled him to make his predic
tions. "At the time he wrote the
book," he said, "1966, Came
ron had been surgeon, chief
surgeon part of the time, of
Vale of Leven Hospital, Loch
Lomondside, Scotland, a hos
pital where they had a lot of
cancer patients. Back in 1948,
he had had an idea about
cancer which he ultimately dis
cussed in this book. He said,
we aren't making progress
against cancer. There's good
evidence that the natural pro
tective mechanisms in the
human body protect people to
some extent against cancer.
Perhaps we could get consid
erable control by potentiating
— improving — these natural
protective mechanisms. He
thought of one way of doing
this: if you can strengthen the
normal tissue surrounding
malignant tumor you might be
able to make it resist infiltra
tion by the malignant tumor.
He pointed out that it was
known that there was a so
called "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors,
not by non-malignant ones,
and this spreading factor con
tains the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme at
tacks the hyaluronic acid which
is an important constituent of
the intercellular cement in tis
sues, so that it can weaken the
normal tissues around the
malignant tumor in such a way
as to permit infiltration. The
body also produces an in
hibitor, and his idea was that if
you could stimulate the body
to make more of that inhibitor,
perhaps you could control the
cancer by keeping the normal
tissues strong, not weakened
by action of that enzyme.
"Cameron tried for five or
half a dozen years to stimulate
production of this inhibitor in
patients with terminal cancer
by giving them various hor
mones, and he was always dis
appointed. It didn't work. The

idea that I had was that you
could achieve the same end by
increasing the number of col
lagen fibrils in the intercellular
cement. Part of the strength of
the intercellularcement comes
from the presence of little
strands (fibrils) of collagen, an
important constituent of all
connective tissue and the prin
cipal structural protein in the
body. We know that a high in
take of vitamin C leads to
synthesis of more collagen.
You don't make any if you
don't get any vitamin C, and
then you die of scurvy. The
body just falls apart. So it was
quite easv a reasonable pre
diction to make, that with i
high intake of vitamin C tht'
strengthened, and that would
be like putting more steel rein
forcing rods in reinforced con
crete. This intercellular cement
would be stronger and might
control the cancer."
I asked if vitamin C therapy
for cancer was entirely new. "It
wasn't the first time it had been
tried," he answered. "There
are a number of reports in the
literature of patients with
cancer apparently benefiting

A hundred patients with untreatable termi
nal cancer were given ascorbate therapy
and nothing else. The results were really
astounding.

from getting larger amounts of
vitamin C. I think it was nearly
the first time that anyone had
tried 10 grams or more a day.
This was much higher than the
earlier studies which had usu
ally involved perhaps one gram
a day. There was one report of
a man with leukemia who had
treated himself with larger
amounts with his doctor keep
ing an eye on him. His doctor
got him to stop a couple of
times, and each time his
leukemia got worse, whereas
he could keep it under control
by taking large doses of vitamin
C. but that individual case was
just ignored, and the other re
ports were essentially ig
nored."
I asked if Cameron's study
constituted the major evidence
that vitamin C prevents or
helps treat cancer.
"Yes," he said, "it's the
major evidence. There have
been four or five papers pub
lished by him and col
laborators on the results of his
observations. Probably the
most significant one is the one
that he and I published to
gether last October where a
hundred patients with untreat
able terminal cancer were
given ascorbate therapy and
nothing else — except if they
needed opiates, narcotic drugs
to control pain, they received
it. They were compared with a
thousand matched controls
who were also untreatable
terminal cancer patients who
got the same treatment in the
same hospital except for not
getting vitamin C. And there

suits of that comparison were
really astounding. They go
beyond anything that anyone
has reported for 25 years, I
think, in the cancer field. The
average survival time of the as
corbate patients was over four
times that of the controls, and a
fraction of these patients — 10
per cent — have had very long
survival times, over 20 times
the average for the controls,
and no longer show signs of

malignant disease. These re
sults clearly indicate that vita
min C is of definite value in the
treatment of patients with ad
vanced cancer.
"I saw Cameron three weeks
ago, and at that time there
were 13 out of the original 100
terminal cancer patients still
alive. I talked with a woman
whom I had seen before, who
five years and a half ago was

If you can take terminal cancer patients and

it?

expected to die within a couple
of months with terminal
cancer, and she's alive and
well, lively, going about her
business, with no sign of the
disease. A year ago when that
paper was written and sent to
be published, the 10th of Au
gust, there were 16 out of the
hundred alive, though some of
them not in very good shape.
All of the thousand controls
have died. Well now, three
more of these hundred
ascorbate-treated patients
have died, leaving 13 who
might possibly live on indefi
nitely, but there's a chance that
they won't.
"Well, if you can take pa
tients who are in the terminal
stage and expected to die in a
couple of months — and the
average duration of life for the
thousand controls after being
pronounced untreatable is 50
days — if you can take these
patients and save 10 or 13 per
cent of them, why not do it?

And if you can make the rest of
them, even though they die,
feel better and live longer,
three times longer than ex
pected, and also live better
lives, why not do it? And this
with a substance which is rec
ognized as one of the least
toxic of all substances."
Having come across a
number of attempted refu
tations of Pauling's work, I
asked him about the scientists
who attack him. "The cancer
people are apt to criticize this
study in that they say that
perhaps Cameron selected pa
tients who were going to sur
vive anyway and gave them as
corbate; and it wasn't a double
blind study," he answered.
"There was no formal ran
domization, but the way in
which the patients were
selected to receive vitamin C
was such as to introduce a con
siderable element of random
ness. Even though Cameron is
the senior surgeon in charge of
the whole 100 hospital beds,
half of the hospital beds are
under the immediate direction

of the other consultant sur
geon who didn't give vitamin C
to the patients until toward the
end when he began giving it to
some of them. Also, there were
a number of other surgeons
and physicians involved, the
junior people, called regis
trars, residents, and interns.
When a new registrar came in,
it usually happened that no pa
tient under his direct charge,
with Cameron supervising, re
ceived ascorbate for two or
three months, because the
new man didn't know anything
about it and it would have been

The matter of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human body, the general
health of the cancer patient, has been almost
totally ignored.

improper for him to have given
ascorbate until he learned
more about it. There were
other ways in which some de
gree of randomness entered.

I've also checked that just re
cently. The check isn't com
plete. It applies to only half of
the total of 1100. I've com
pared, for 50 ascorbate-treated
patients and the 500 controls,
the length of time from first
hospitalization for cancer to
being determined as unbeata
ble. Since ascorbate wasn't in
troduced there, if there was
randomness, these lengths of
time should be the same, and
they are the same. This is a
reasonable test of the
hypothesis that the ascorbate
treated terminal cancer pa
tients and the control cancer
patients are randomly
selected, representative sub
populations from the same
population, and not selected
differently."
I had heard of one particu
larly clear and dramatic vitamin
C-produced recovery and
asked him about it. "Yes," he
said, "there is one patient with
a reticulum cell sarcoma about
whom a separate paper was
published because he had a
double regression from the
same cancer. He was consi
dered a terminal patient, was
given 10 grams a day of vitamin
C, responded very well, and
left the hospital after a month
or six weeks and went back to
work as a long distance truck
driver, while continuing to
take 10 grams a day. Then, at
the end of about six months,
he was taken off the vitamin C
by his physician, who thought,
well he's cured: his chest is
cleared up, x-rays are clear, so
that he's cured. When a person
is cured you take him off the
drug. Within a month he was
back in the hospital. The
cancer was back again. In
didn't respond to 10 grams a
day for the second time so he
was given 20 grams a day for 10
days intravenously, and then

the cancer went away a second
time. The x-rays cleared up
completely, and for three years
he's been in good health, driv
ing his truck and taking 12 and

a half grams a day orally. In
each case the regression oc
curred within two weeks after
initiation of the ascorbate. It's
very hard to argue against that
being an effect of the ascor
bate."
I pointed out that there
seems to be a misemphasis in
cancer research, in that resear
chers have overstressed the
individual cell rather than look
ing at the environment around
it. "Well," he said, "the matter
of the natural protective
mechanisms of the human
body, the general health of the
cancer patient, has been al
most entirely ignored. Most
cancer patients suffer from
malnutrition, partially because
of 'anorexia' — lack of appe
tite. Well, they feel miserable
and they don't eat and of
course that means they're not
well-nourished. And the intake
of vitamins has not been stres
sed by cancer physicians at all.
There are occasional excep
tions of physicians who treat
cancer advocating good nutri
tion and even taking vitamins,
but they're pretty rare. Only
recently has there been em
phasis on what they call
"hyperalimentation," and
there the doctors have gone at
it in a characteristic medical
way by operating on the pa
tient and introducing a tube
into the heart or something
through an opening some
where and then pouring in
predigested nutrients — very
expensive and disagreeable for
the patient. All this instead of
"super nutrition," you might
say, instead of giving them lots
of vitamins. Actually, Came
ron's patients, almost without
exception, develop good ap
petities when they get their 10
grams of vitamin C a day, and
begin eating well.
"So it may well be that part of
the effect of the vitamin C is in
giving better general nutrition
by causing the patient to eat
better, to have a better appe
tite. And the so-called cachexia
— which is general malaise,
just feeling miserable — that
disappears too for the
ascorbate-treated patients.
There is a significant decrease
in the amount of pain; they get
lively; they have a feeling of
well-being; they want to get
back to work; and they do go
back to work or go home and
take care of the house. So
that's a good indication of im
proved health. But of course in
many of them the cancer dis
appears and the other clinical
tests of illness disappear."
I saw that it was clear his ap
proach was more to return the
cancer patient to general
health than to attempt to blitz
cancer cells, but, I asked, did
vitamin C also seem to aid in
attacking malignant tumors?
"There have been a few pa
tients who responded to as
corbate by pronounced
change in the nature of the
tumor, and it was pretty clear
that the vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not neces
sarily directly. It might be indi
rectly because you find lym
phocytes around the tumor.
There was published a year ago
a paper by three people at the
National Cancer Institute. It's
the only work they have done
on vitamin C and cancer. It was
done by one of the permanent
members plus two visitors,
who had never heard about
Cameron's work. They showed
that taking five or 10 grams of
vitamin C a day increases the
number of lymphocytes that
are produced, and it's known
that lymphocytes attack cancer
cells and that the prognosis for
a cancer patient is good if he
has a high rate of production of
new lymphocytes under an
tigenic stimulation, and is poor
if he has a low rate. So these
investigators said at the end of
their report that because of this
known correlation between
blastogenesis of lymphocytes
and the prognosis for cancer
patients, vitamin C ought to be
tried on cancer patients."
11 seemed odd to me that the
I medical world was so willing
last year to spend $135 million
to fight the nonexistent swine
flu. In view of this, and the fact
that cancer researchers spend
many millions more each year
without great result, I asked
Pauling why the medical estab
lishment has shown such a lack
of enthusiasm in prescribing
vitamin C for patients, and
even for investigating its ef
fects. "Well, it's hard to under
stand," he said. "With gov
ernment officials who make
decisions abCL't grants - the
National Cancer Institute, tor
. example — there is probably a
feeling that to be unconven
tional, to take any unconven
tional action, may be harmful
to you in holding your job. The
safe thing to do is to just
adhere to convention. And this
may operate. The peer review
system has been under discus
sion recently, and here one
point, one argument that's
been used, is that the peers,

So it may be that part of the effect of vitamin
C is in giving better general nutrition by
causing the patient to eat better.

the people who are on the
committees that make recom
mendations, are people who
are working in the field and re
ceiving grants themselves. The
amount of money in the Na
tional Cancer Institute, even
though it is $800 million this
year, is still finite. It's used in
supporting the work of the Na
tional Cancer Institute. If
someone, some outsider,
wants to bleed off a part of that,
then it will be at the sacrifice of
the people who've been get
ting grants, and since they are
on these committees that make
recommendations, they are
apt to recommend against it.
"Then, of cr e, the idea
has been sp(t->- the medical
and nutritional establishment

for some 30 years that large
doses of vitamins have no
value. Forty years ago, in the
19305, there was considerable
enthusiasm about what you
might call megavitamin
therapy. It didn't involve the
large dosage used now, but
nevertheless there was en
thusiasm about vitamins. You
had therapeutic vitamins that
were given to patients some
times. The sulfa drugs came
along just at that time, and the
antibiotics. They are so effec
tive and reliable against infec
tious diseases that physicians
and medical investigators lost
interest in the vitamins. Vita
min C used in the rather mod
est amounts customary then is
only partially effective against
infection, and its failure in
some patients caused it to fall
into disfavor. And the idea
began to develop that vitamins
didn't work, large dosages of
vitamins, at least for many pa
tients, weren't helpful. This
idea has been spread so widely
and emphasized so thoroughly
for 30 years, that there's no dis
cussion of it, and you are in a
sense a traitor to the estab
lishment if you use vitamins.
"I am interested to have
learned, as I have, that many
physicians take large doses of
vitamin C and other vitamins
themselves and give large
doses to their families, but
won't admit it. They never say
anything about it. Yet there
was one who had made a
statement, which was pub
lished in Medical Tribune and
elsewhere. He is a physician
with a very good background
who has just become the dean
of the Cornell University
School of Medicine in New
York, one of the great medical
schools and medical research
institutions of the country, and
until January he was the head
health man in our government,
the assistant secretary for
health of Health, Education
and Welfare. Theodore
Cooper is his name. He stated
that he thought I was- right

It was pretty clear that vitamin C was attack
ing the tumor, but not necessarily directly.

the common cold, and the flu,
and cancer, and that he himself
takes large doses of vitamin C
and gives large doses to mem-
of his family. He said this
decision to take large CIOS PS °*
vitamin C himself and give it to
members of his family is a dif
ferent matter from his getting
the government institutions
that he was the head of to re
commend vitamin C generally
to the public, and that you'd
have to have much stronger
evidence before he would
make that general recommen
dation to everybody through

the National Institute of Health
or the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
"And then, of course, you
have the question, for a prac
ticing physician, of malpractice
suits. If a practicing physician
follows the usual custom of giv
ing, say, cytotoxic drugs and
high energy radiation to a
cancer patient, he doesn't
stand much chance of being
sued. If he fails to give a
cytotoxic drug or high energy
radiation, especially if the pa
tient asks for it, even to a pa
tient who has the sort of cancer
that does not respond much to
those treatments, he might be
sued, as not having done ev
erything that he could do, even
though of course he might feel

that the chance of the treat
ments having any effect is so
small that it's not worthwhile
making the patient miserable
from the side effects the rest of
his life. And if he were to give
vitamin C there is a chance that
he would be sued, because it's
not accepted by the medical
establishment as a treatment
for cancer."
I said that I wondered
whether such an eminent sci
entist as Pauling ever had trou
ble obtaining grants to conduct
cancer research. "Four and a
half years ago," he said,
"Cameron had observed 40 pa
tients. I went to the National
Cancer Institute and asked
them to carry out a control
trial. Cameron already had said
he wouldn't carry out a control
trial with half of the patients
selected at random not getting
vitamin C because he was al
ready convinced that it was
valuable. He was trying to get
every patient to try it. He didn't
succeed because he wasn't
able to make the decision all by
himself, you see, but that was
the stage he had reached then.
I thought that a control trial
should be carried out and that
surely the National Cancer In
stitute would be interested. My
wife went along with me and
we talked for two hours to 10 of
the rather top officials in the

Cancer institute, heads of sec
tions, and just didn't get any
where with them. FinaNy, at the
end of the two hours they said,
we wouldn't touch this until
animal studies have been
made, so why don't you apply
for a grant to carry out the ani
mal studies. So I worked for a
month or two getting out an
application and sent it in, and,
after nearly a year, it was
turned down. So I applied
again, and it was turned down
again. And I applied again and

again, and now the fifth time
has been turned down. Once a
year for five years I've applied
and they've turned me down
each time.
"The original applications

they almost need to be done
with guinea pigs. Mice make so
much vitamin C that they're
not a good animal: they're al
ready past the intake that I'm
recommending for human
cancer patients. It's more ex
pensive to do guinea pig work
than mouse work, but the
$100,000ayear I thoughtwould
permit us to set up a small ani
mal colony with mice and rats
and guinea pigs. The trouble
with guinea pigs is that there's
not much cancer work done on
them so you don't have the
background information.
Nevertheless, it would have
been sensible to do it. This last
application was for several
times the original amount —
$500,000 or $600,000 a year for
clinical studies with humans in
Scotland and )apan, where I
had made contacts with hospi
tals and physicians who would
carry out control trials, and var
ious animal studies and basic
scientific studies."
I asked him whether he was
optimistic about obtaining
funding in the future. "We are
getting money now from small
foundations and private
donors," he answered.
"Thousands of private indi
viduals have sent us $10 or $20

or $100 or $1000. We're getting
enough money to do a little
work. But of course research is
expensive, and even if we have
$100,000 a year, which is about
what we are getting now for
this, we can't do what needs to
be done. That's why I applied
for $500,000 or $600,000 in my
last application to the National
Cancer Institute. I finally have
pushed the National Cancer
Institute, just a couple of
months ago, into agreeing to
support a control trial to be
carried out by somebody else,
and it looks as though they
might even carry out two con
trol trials. And there are other

diseases of all types.

groups that I hear about, other
investigators, who are proba
bly going to carry out control
trials. One difficulty with these
trials would be if the patients
were already in bad shape, and
had received large amounts of
the cytotoxic drugs which
knock out their normal protec
tive mechanisms. Now, if vita
min C works principally by
potentiating the immune
mechanisms, and the immune

mechanisms are knocked out
in the patients, then they won't
respond to vitamin C. Came
ron doesn't get childhood can
cers. They go to another hospi
tal, and they are apt to be
rapidly growing cancers, which
can be controlled by
chemotherapy. His patients
are largely people with slow
growing solid tumors who
don't respond to
chemotherapy very well, so
that the patients can become
terminal without having re
ceived cytotoxic drugs, and
then they can respond to the
ascorbate. If control trials were
to be carried out to check
Cameron, it should be on simi
lar patients, namely those who
haven't received the cytotoxic
drugs."
I suggested that many
people, because Pauling has
made such a large claim for vit
amin C in terms of the range of
diseases that it can treat, be
jjoye that he is talking about an
impossible pi na cea. Particu
larly in the case of cancer, It
seems to be a disease that
strikes randomly. I asked how
vitamin C can treat so many
diseases, and how can it treat
cancer, which seems to strike

in a random way. "We have a
question, a general question,
of what are the causes of dis
ease," he said. "It's customary
to say that, with the infectious
disease, viruses and bacteria
and rickettsial are the causes of
the diseases. One can argue,
however, that while they are
involved, they aren't necessar
ily the causes. If there is a flu
epidemic, with a lot of people
exposed to the flu, some of
them come down with flu and
some of them don't. And simi
larily with other infectious dis
ease. So we can ask why is it
that with equal exposures —
and this has even been tested

by giving people measured
amounts of respiratory disease
viruses — that some of them
come down with the disease
and some of them don't?
There's little doubt that the
answer to this question is that
some people have good
natural protection against dis
ease, and one can say that part
of the disease is the lack of a
good system of protection
against the disease. In fact, if
everybody gets exposed to
something, one might even say
that the cause of the disease in
those who get it is the poor
functioning of their natural
protective mechanisms. This
applies to cancer, too.
"Now, the evidence is good
that vitamin C bolsters up the
natural protective mechanisms
of the body, and we know that
these natural protective
mechanisms operate against
diseases of aii kinds. Con
sequently, I can conclude that
no matter what is wrong with
you vitamin Cwill helpyou. It's
customary in the medical pro
fession to say that if somebody
claims that a drug or treatment
is good for you no matter
what's wrong with you, then
you are dealing with a quack,
this is just quackery. I think
that that conclusion, while it
may be justified sometimes, is
wrong in general. I think that if
you have some way of bolster
ing up the body's natural pro
tective mechanisms, then you
have a way of protecting your
self against all sorts of diseases,
