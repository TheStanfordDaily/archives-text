# Med Center faces troubles with space
## 
### Andrea James 
Although the Medical Center has
considerable growth potential, Di
rector of Facilities Jim McNally says
"the space will eventually give us re
lief but it won't meet our demands
for growth."
Meanwhile, Stanford attorneys are
preparing arbitration briefs against
Phase I architects, Caudill, Rowlett
and Scott. Staff counsel Cassius Kirk
said arbitration proceedings should
begin in May.
Most of the basement and third
floor areas of the medical complex
are empty shells. The $18.5 million
Phase I expansion project, on which
construction was completed last
year, added 170,000 square feet to
the center. Today, only 85,000 square
feet of the project is functional.
"The current space still does not
meet the demands for the new pro
jects coming in, and the new equip
ment and technical procedures that
go along with those programs," Mc-
Nally said.
The entire medical center cur
rently covers 1,200,000 square feet.
McNally said it "is impossible to say"
how many square feet the medical
center will eventually cover.
McNally said that detailed plans of
how the basement and third floors
were to be used were not budgeted
for when the Med Center was built.
"So," he said, "we centered in on the
patient care area on the first and sec
ond floors.
"We can't design the rooms for the
shell areas until we know what
equipment will be installed in those
rooms," he added.
Phase I was designed in 1972 and
construction began in 1973. The first
section of the building to become
operational, the blood transfusion
laboratories, opened last December.
Early this year surgical pathology and
post-anesthesiology recovery began
service.
The cardiology and radiology de
partments are completed but are
awaiting delivery of equipment.
"The whole expansion was built
around the new 25 intensive care
units which opened in late spring of
this year," said McNally. "We can
now offer intensive care to clinics as
well as to in-house patients."
The empty shell space on the sec
ond floor of Phase I was originally
designed as a surgical support area
including locker rooms and lounges
for the operating room staff and
physicians.
McNally said there is no set date
for completion of this area and there

is a possibility the area will be rede
signed to hold more laboratories.
"The University is claiming that er
rors and omissions on the part of the
architectural firm cost Stanford
money," Kirk said. He said costs of
damages are still being assessed and
an exact figure for the claim has not
yet been decided. However, he
added that "it is a substantial
amount."
The University claims the ar
chitects delayed more than two years
in construction preparation and
failed to build the project within
specified budget figures.
The claim also states that the de
sign was not proper for a hospital and
