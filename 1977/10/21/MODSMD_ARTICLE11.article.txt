# 'Female frats' at Stanford?
## Answers to the 'sorority question' 
### 
Leslie Crozier

Last spring in a SWOPSI course, I
chose the "sorority question" as my
area of research. A near terminal case
of spring-quarter apathy and a
number of other high priority pro
jects (catching rays at deGuerre,
happy hours at Zot's, etc.) prevented
me from finishing the project before
the term ended.
The subject did provide the basis
for a number of lively discussions,
but my own ambivalent attitude to
ward the establishment of sororities
prevented me from writing the con
cluding section of my paper.

Regardless of how that section is
completed, I discovered the most in
teresting theme, from the female
student's point of view, was the ir
refutable logic of the male students
against any thought of "female frats"
at our university. These arguments
generally fell into three categories.
The first observation was almost
invariably that the University did not
attract the "sorority-type girl" like
the University of Virginia or Old
Miss. The inference here was that
sororities only worked where the
girls strolled around in petticoats and

hoopskirts, wearing large hats, and
twirling a parasol.
Apparently, however, the con
verse of this argument does not
apply to the Stanford male, as I have
noticed a singular lack of Brooks
Brother suits and Gucci shoes among
the frat persons.
I do agree that the Stanford girl is
indeed different from your U.S.C.
Theta, but I also noted that the Stan
ford fraternity member didn't par
ticularly relish the idea of being
stereotyped and identified with his
U.S.C brethren. The point is that,
male and female alike, we are, and
hopefully will continue to be, primar
ily influenced by the Stanford culture
irrespective of the existence of
fraternities or sororities.
The second most widely expressed
observation was the tendency for
girls, when thrown together in
sororities, to become 'cliquish' and
engage in all sorts of 'silly' activities.
There seemed to be a genuine con
cern that the girls would be unable to
follow the example set by the frater
nities who engage in 'mature' pur
suits such as treasure hunts in San
Francisco, swimming in hotel water
fountains, and singing from the
roof-tops after getting wasted at
"The O."
Obviously, these high standards
present a hard act to follow, but sev
eral of the female students expressed
a willingness to try, and a confidence
that with several years of practice
they, too, could attain this high level
of social behavior.
The most interesting argument
was advanced one evening at a
fraternity luau. A young gentleman
explained that the Stanford system
worked so well because it was
"half-Greek, and thus there are no
sororities to team up with the frater
nities and form a closed social unit."
His date rather testily retorted that

"if being half-Greek was indeed the
ideal social structure, then the sim
ple answer would be to allow frater
nities on the even-numbered years,
and sororities on the odd-numbered
years â€” thus spreading around both
the advantages and disadvantages of
the Greek system."
Space does not permit the discus
sion of some of the more academic
sides of the question, such as what
group or groups should have the ul
timate say in whether or not
sororities are permitted . . . the
whole student body ... the female
students . . . or any interested group
of female students? Also, what
should the role of the administration
be, if any, in permitting sororities,
and which sororities, and to what
degree of control is retained over
their activities?
The social aspect aside, there are
currently two forces working on the
Stanford campus which, in the next
few years, if they continue, will man
date the formation of sororities, or at
least sorority-like organizations.
These forces are the ever-increasing
number of female students, and the
current on-campus housing situation
which leaves the female co-ed no op
tion but to subject herself to the an
nual 'Spring Draw' which determines
where your new home is and who
your new roommates will be for the
fall quarter.
Females, no less than males, look
upon their Stanford years as one for
forming life-long friendships and as
sociations. Returning each fall to a
dorm full of strangers, while last
year's friends have been scattered to
the wind by the draw number, is a
frustrating experience. These forces
alone virtually assure that the "soror
ity issue" will become one of the
paramount considerations of female
students during the next few years.
