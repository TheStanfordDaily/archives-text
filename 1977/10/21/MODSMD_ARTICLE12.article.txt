# The
						cargo preference issue
## Floundering in a murky sea of scandal

Kathy Cannell

Still recovering from the embar
rassment of the Lance affair, the Car
ter administration is now flounder
ing in an even murkier sea of scandal
and bad judgement. The issue?
Cargo preference. The outrage? That
the so-called "open administration"
is allowing, if not pushing, one of the
worst pieces of legislation through
the House of Representatives.
The Cargo Preference Bill would
require that 9.5 per cent of the oil
imported into the U.S. be carried by
American tankers, a protectionist
move aimed at bolstering the already
heavily-subsidized maritime indus
tries.
The cost of such a move would fall
on the American consumer, in
higher heating bills, gasoline prices
and utilities. Estimates of the in
creased cost to the consumer range
between $240 million to as high as
$610 million a year.
The bill is a bad one on other
counts as well. The President's
Economic Policy Group unanimously
opposed the bill, believing "the net
impact on the economy as a whole
would be a decrease in total
employment and gross national pro
duct."
Defense opposes it, seeing no na
tional security benefits in it. State
opposes it, feeling that it would viol
ate some 30 treaties with our allies.
Who wants cargo preference?
The answer is the maritime in
terests, certain members of the

House Merchant Marine Committee,
and President Jimmy Carter. In a deal
that smells suspiciously like the milk
price supports of the Nixon era, Car
ter received over $100,000 in cam
paign contributions from maritime
interests. And he is not alone. Rep.
John Murphy (D-N.Y.), Chairman of
the House Merchant Marine Com
mittee, received over $11,000 in
campaign contributions.
In fact, the maritime unions make
the highest per capita contributions
to political campaigns of any in the
country â€” in 1976, they gave over
$900,000 to candidates for Congress.
There are a few fighters in this
legislative bargain. Leading the
House battle against cargo prefer
ence is our own congressman, Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park). Almost
single-handedly, he is bringing pub
lic attention and congressional
awareness to an issue he claims
"stinks to high heaven" of corrup
tion.
Aside from obvious objections to
the bill itself, McCloskey criticizes
the way the bill is being railroaded
through the House. During commit
tee hearings, McCloskey called
seven administration witnesses to
testify on cargo preference. Six of the
seven did not appear, as so ordered
by Carter's "open administration."
Chairman Murphy denied McClos
key's request for subpoena. (The
sole witness for the administration
was Maritime Administrator Robert

Blackwell. It would appear the ad
ministration has something to hide.)
On calendar for Oct. 5, the bill has
mysteriously been set aside.
Chances are it won't reach the House
floor for another week. Did a head
count show Carter short of the
necessary votes in the House? Let's
hope so. Let's hope the efforts of
Congressman McCloskey and such
diverse lobbyists as Common Cause,

the League of Women Voters, the oil
interests and Ralph Nader have
turned the bill around. Special in
terests can't get away with buying
legislation. . . and with the consum
er's money, at that.
