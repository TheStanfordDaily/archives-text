# Letters on Stanford, corporations and South Africa
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Last spring,
the Board of Trustees ex
changed correspondence with
certain corporations doing bus
iness in South Africa and which
the University held stock in.
These public letters addressed
to Board of Trustees President
Peter Bing, are reprinted be
low.
Dear Mr. Bing:
This will acknowledge with
thanks your letter of April 15
with respect to the stockholder
proposal on South Africa.
We appreciate your state
ment of position and your shar
ing with us th 6 reasoning be
hind the decision of the Trus
tees. Your views will certainly
be taken into consideration
with respect to our operations
in South Africa.
We thank you for recogniz
ing the efforts which have been
made to date by Caltex Pet
roleum Corporation. In the
final analysis, we continue to
feel that our presence in South
Africa is beneficial to all citi
zens of that country, including
the blacks who aspire to better
jobs and an improved standard
of living.
With all good wishes,
Sincerely yours,
Maurice F. Granville
Chairman of the Board
Texaco, Inc.
Dear Mr. Bing:
Thank you for your letter of
April 15, 1977, explaining the
position taken by the trustees
of Stanford University regard
ing the stockholder proposal
pertaining to investments in
South Africa that will be on the
agenda for Union Carbide's
forthcoming Annual Meeting.
It was thoughtful of you to
write, and we appreciate hear
ing your viewpoint.

In considering investment in
any country, and particularly in
the developing nations, the in
vestment decision should take
into consideration the moral,
political, and economic factors
involved. No one of these fac
tors is more important than the
other; in fact, they are usually
intertwined and difficult to
separate.
Over the long term, the Un
ited States unquestionably is
dependent on chrome from
either the African nations of
Rhodesia or South Africa, or
from Russia. Over 95 per cent
of the world's reserves of
chrome ore is located in these
three countries. Chrome is
needed for a multitude of es
sential products, since it is a
vital component of many steels
that have widespread applica
tions in industry and in na
tional defense. Yet all of these
source countries have policies,
practices, or attitudes with
which our country does not ag
ree.
Union Carbide encourages
acceptance in South Africa of
the employment practices that
Americans hold inviolable. Be
cause of our record of social

responsibility to our South Af
rican employees and their de
pendency on our presence,
many of South Africa's black
leaders continue to urge us to
remain involved there. We be
lieve that our presence is a
constructive force for peaceful
change.
We are pleased that you ap
prove of Union Carbide's re
cent cosigning of the State
ment of Principles regarding
operations in South Africa. The
manifesto does not reflect a
change in policy for the Corpo
ration; it says that we will con
tinue to encourage acceptance
in South Africa of the employ
ment practices that Americans
hold inviolable. We hope that
such open expression of prin
ciples and continuing pursuit
of them by American corpora
tions doing business in South
Africa will lead to further
peaceful progress for the
blacks of that country.
Of course, those who would
invest new money in South Af
rica must keep in mind the
changing political and
economic climate. You may be
sure that Union Carbide is fully
aware of the changing situation

there.
We realize that honest
people can differ in their opin
ions as to the best response of
Americans to the problems in
South Africa. The course we
follow reflects our best judg
mentand sincere convictions. I
am sure the trustees of Stan
ford University would say the
same regarding their absten
tion from the vote on the South
African proposal.
Thank you for your com
ments and concern, and for
your continuing interest in
Union Carbide.
Sincerely,
William S. Sneath
Chairman of the Board
Union Carbide Corporation

Dear Mr. Bing:
Your letter of the 15th to our
Chairman, Mr. R.H. )ones, has
been directed to me for re
sponse.
First, let me express our
thanks for informing us of how
Stanford's shares will be hand
led relative to Shareowner
Proposal No. 4, and, more par
ticularly, for the clear, concise
statement as to the reasons for
your decision.
General Electric, too, op
poses racial discrimination in
any form. The Company be
lieves, however, that it is doing
more good for its employees in
South Africa than harm in
being there. We have been
able to make significant prog

ress in upgrading the position
of black South African GE
employees through improved
wages and benefits, education
and training. We feel a strong
obligation to our nearly 1,600
employees there and feel that
the proper course of action is
to continue trying to make
progress with and for them.
As regards your urging of
General Electrictopubliclyjoin
with the twelve companies and
others who have adopted the
set of six principles relating to
segregation and employment
in South Africa, we feel that
rather than resorting to politi
cal signals, we can be more ef
fective working on our own at
making progress for the South
African people in our employ.

We feel that individual com
panies can and should ap
proach the government di
rectly to propose changes for
their own employees. On the
other hand, we feel that any
public challenge to a foreign
government is best done on a
government to government
basis.
Once again, thank you for
presenting us with the reasons
for your decision to abstain on
Shareowner Proposal No. 4
and for allowing us the oppor
tunity to amplify our position
on this important question.
Sincerely yours,
John L. Ingersoll
Manager,
Corporate Industrial Relations
General Electric
