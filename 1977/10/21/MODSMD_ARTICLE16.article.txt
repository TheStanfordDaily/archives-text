# Ballooning guarantees a natural high
## 
### Bill Burger 
I had never been in a hot air
balloon before last Sunday.
And when told that the hot air
burners were new and had
never been in one either, the
whole idea of going up there
without a parachute did not
sound too appetizing. But I
went anyway.
The Stanford Balloon Club
left the Farm at 6 a.m. on Sun
day. So after almost missing
the trip, we boarded the cars
and drove south, seemingly
forever.
Nearly 40 miles later we pul
led into a dirt field alongside
Highway 101 near a place called
Morgan Hill. The morning was
clear, crisp, and the sun was
just finding its way above the

foothills.
Balloonists fly in the morn
ing because the cool air makes
it easier to get off the ground.
We were to fly in a seven
color balloon called "Rainbow
Rider." Its owner, Mick Vale,
can accurately be described as
a "balloon freak." From his
"ASCEND" license plate to his
balloon-shaped pipe Vale has
made ballooning his life for the
past six years.
After spending about an
hour preparing the balloon for
flight, it was ready to go. The
burners worked (at least on the
ground) and there were no
holes.
After climbing decrepitly
into the custom-made basket,
complete with nameplate, I
had resigned myself to the idea
that the ground was soon to be
several hundred feet below me
and that the wind was about to

control my life.
So after several blasts from
the burners, the balloon took
off and left us at the mercy of
the wind.
Vale explained that balloon
ing is "the safest aeronautic
travel there is," as we skimmed
over a grove of walnut trees.
The tops of the trees scratched
the bottom of the basket, a
trick Vale said is very hard to
do.
As we rose to cross 101, dogs
in the surrounding farms could
be seen jumping and heard
barking as the strange craft
passed overhead.
According to Vale, there are
about 1100 balloons in this
country. Some 150 to 170 of
them belong to the Northern

At the end of a successful novice flight,
everyone pays "homage to the gods" by
pouring champagne down each other's
neck.

California Ballooning Associa
tion of which Vale is president.
The ride in the basket is sur
prisingly smooth although it is
not as quiet as one might ex
pect because the burners,
which throw out an eight foot
flame, are quite loud.
After about 20 minutes in the
air over the Santa Clara Valley,
Vale opened the vent, letting
the air out so that we dropped
down and made our landing. It
was a bit rough but at least we
were on the ground.
The only bumps come on the
landing and vary with wind
speed. Vale said there are
many mornings when he goes
to the field and "kicks the dirt
around" because it is too
windy to fly.
Upon returning to the take
off spot, those of us who had
made our first flight that day
were given a champagne sur

prise. We knelt down and used
our teeth to pick the cup of
champagne off the ground.
Our hands were behind our
backs and just as we grabbed
the cups Vale gave each of us a
champagne shower. He said
this is a traditional ceremony.
So after paying "homage to the
gods" for the safe trip we were
ready to join the regulars for a
cup of champagne that could
be held in our hands.
Sally Vale, Mick's wife, said
the couple got involved in bal
looning through Mick's
brother who took them to the
world championship in
Calgery, Alberta in 1971.
"We brought back 400 pic
tures," Sally explained, "we

both just fell in love with it."
Vale, who lists himself in the
yellow pages, charges one per
son $75 for a 90-minute ride
and $125 for two people. Both
prices include champagne,
Vale said.
For those who would like to
experience the thrill of bal
looning themselves, the Stan
ford Balloon Club has or
ganized a balloon-in for Sun
day from 7 a.m. to noon next to
Stern Hall.
Persons associated with the
University will be charged 25
cents for a short ride in one of
the three to five balloons
which will be on hand. Others
will be charged 75 cents for the
ride.

I had never been in a hot air
balloon before last Sunday.
And when told that the hot air
burners were new and had
never been in one either, the
whole idea of going up there
without a parachute did not
sound too appetizing. But I
went anyway.
The Stanford Balloon Club
left the Farm at 6 a.m. on Sun
day. So after almost missing
the trip, we boarded the cars
and drove south, seemingly
forever.
Nearly 40 miles later we pul
led into a dirt field alongside
Highway 101 near a place called
Morgan Hill. The morning was
clear, crisp, and the sun was
just finding its way above the

foothills.
Balloonists fly in the morn
ing because the cool air makes
it easier to get off the ground.
We were to fly in a seven
color balloon called "Rainbow
Rider." Its owner, Mick Vale,
can accurately be described as
a "balloon freak." From his
"ASCEND" license plate to his
balloon-shaped pipe Vale has
made ballooning his life for the
past six years.
After spending about an
hour preparing the balloon for
flight, it was ready to go. The
burners worked (at least on the
ground) and there were no
holes.
After climbing decrepitly
into the custom-made basket,
complete with nameplate, I
had resigned myself to the idea
that the ground was soon to be
several hundred feet below me
and that the wind was about to

control my life.
So after several blasts from
the burners, the balloon took
off and left us at the mercy of
the wind.
Vale explained that balloon
ing is "the safest aeronautic
travel there is," as we skimmed
over a grove of walnut trees.
The tops of the trees scratched
the bottom of the basket, a
trick Vale said is very hard to
do.
As we rose to cross 101, dogs
in the surrounding farms could
be seen jumping and heard
barking as the strange craft
passed overhead.
According to Vale, there are
about 1100 balloons in this
country. Some 150 to 170 of
them belong to the Northern

At the end of a successful novice flight,
everyone pays "homage to the gods" by
pouring champagne down each other's
neck.

California Ballooning Associa
tion of which Vale is president.
The ride in the basket is sur
prisingly smooth although it is
not as quiet as one might ex
pect because the burners,
which throw out an eight foot
flame, are quite loud.
After about 20 minutes in the
air over the Santa Clara Valley,
Vale opened the vent, letting
the air out so that we dropped
down and made our landing. It
was a bit rough but at least we
were on the ground.
The only bumps come on the
landing and vary with wind
speed. Vale said there are
many mornings when he goes
to the field and "kicks the dirt
around" because it is too
windy to fly.
Upon returning to the take
off spot, those of us who had
made our first flight that day
were given a champagne sur

prise. We knelt down and used
our teeth to pick the cup of
champagne off the ground.
Our hands were behind our
backs and just as we grabbed
the cups Vale gave each of us a
champagne shower. He said
this is a traditional ceremony.
So after paying "homage to the
gods" for the safe trip we were
ready to join the regulars for a
cup of champagne that could
be held in our hands.
Sally Vale, Mick's wife, said
the couple got involved in bal
looning through Mick's
brother who took them to the
world championship in
Calgery, Alberta in 1971.
"We brought back 400 pic
tures," Sally explained, "we

both just fell in love with it."
Vale, who lists himself in the
yellow pages, charges one per
son $75 for a 90-minute ride
and $125 for two people. Both
prices include champagne,
Vale said.
