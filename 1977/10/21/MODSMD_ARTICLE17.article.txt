What is an "X" parking permit? These areas
seem to be the most desirable on campus.

The Stanford Police, who are responsible for
issuing parking permits, said that the "X" per
mits are for construction workers only. These
special permits are issued by the Facilities Plan

The other night I was at the library and wanted
to check out a book. When I went to the circula
tion desk, however, I realized I didn't have my
University ID. I showed the woman my meal
card, but she wouldn't accept it as ID, and I was
forced to wait to get the book. Why won't the
library system recognize meal cards as IDs?
-MC
Essentially, only registered students are al
lowed library privileges (that includes checking
out books). According to Gloria Stockton, chief
librarian of central circulation, meal cards "do
not mean a student is registered." Meal cards
are issued to non-registered students. Also, it is
possible for a student to get a meal card while
having a registration hold for overdue books.

Obviously the library doesn't want to check
books out to students who do not return them!
Also, with so many different types of ID float
ing around campus, it is difficult to keep track of
them. So, the library has adopted an official
policy of only accepting current student regist
ration cards.

What is the meaning of the fish-shaped stic
kers one sees on car back windows or bumpers?
-PF
The symbol of the fish has been used since
ancient times as a symbol for Christianity. Early
Christians, when persecuted and hunted,
employed the symbol of the fish to identify
themselves secretly to one another.
The origin of this visual password is interest
ing. To His pioneer disciples, the Messiah was
known as "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,"
which, translated into Greek, was lesous Chris
tos, Theou Uios Soter. The initials of those five
Greek words, which used to be spelled l-CH
TH-U-S, we now spell out ICTHYS — the Greek
word for fish. That's why many of the fish stic
kers you see probably have this word spelled in
Greek characters upon them — IXGYE. Even
today, the study of fish is termed ichthyology.
So, when you see a fish-shaped sticker on a
car, the owner is using an ancient symbol to
show that he/she is a Christian.

The other night I was at the library and wanted
to check out a book. When I went to the circula
tion desk, however, I realized I didn't have my
University ID. I showed the woman my meal
card, but she wouldn't accept it as ID, and I was
forced to wait to get the book. Why won't the
library system recognize meal cards as IDs?

Essentially, only registered students are al
lowed library privileges (that includes checking
out books). According to Gloria Stockton, chief
librarian of central circulation, meal cards "do
not mean a student is registered." Meal cards
are issued to non-registered students. Also, it is
possible for a student to get a meal card while
having a registration hold for overdue books.

Obviously the library doesn't want to check
books out to students who do not return them!
Also, with so many different types of ID float
ing around campus, it is difficult to keep track of
them. So, the library has adopted an official
policy of only accepting current student regist
ration cards.

What is the meaning of the fish-shaped stic
kers one sees on car back windows or bumpers?
-PF
The symbol of the fish has been used since
ancient times as a symbol for Christianity. Early
Christians, when persecuted and hunted,
employed the symbol of the fish to identify
themselves secretly to one another.
The origin of this visual password is interest
ing. To His pioneer disciples, the Messiah was
known as "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior,"
which, translated into Greek, was lesous Chris
tos, Theou Uios Soter. The initials of those five
Greek words, which used to be spelled l-CH
TH-U-S, we now spell out ICTHYS — the Greek
word for fish. That's why many of the fish stic
kers you see probably have this word spelled in
Greek characters upon them — IXGYE. Even
today, the study of fish is termed ichthyology.
So, when you see a fish-shaped sticker on a
car, the owner is using an ancient symbol to
show that he/she is a Christian.
