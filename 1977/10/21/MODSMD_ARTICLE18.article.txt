# Cards brace for aerial circus
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
It's a hell of a way to make a
debut.
Your first start in the defen
sive secondary and you've got
to face the NCAA's fifth-ranked
passer, Washington State's
Throwin' Samoan, Jack
Thompson.
A tough time to crack the
starting lineup as a defensive
back, but that will be the case
for two Stanford players to
morrow when the Cardinals,
4-2 on the season and 2-1 in
Pac-8, take the field to host the
Cougars, 1-2 in league and 3-3
overall, in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
Freshman Robbie Chapman
and sophomore Rick Parker
will undergo a severe test in
their initial start in a shuffled
Card secondary.
Chapman will start at free
safety and free safety Ralph
Phillips will move to strong
safety. Parker will start at left
cornerback and John Pigott will
go at right corner. Two-year
veteran Larry Reynolds will
spell Parker at corner if he is
healthy. In fact, there is a
chance Reynolds could start if
he is feeling well tomorrow.
"We're hoping for good
team defense and that includes
a good pass rush to relieve
some of the pressure off the

deep four," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said.
The front four also assumes a
bit of a new look for the
Washington State game. Right
end Dean Wilson has been
moved to right tackle to re
place the injured Steve Howe
and to provide Stanford with a
strong inside pass rush. Senior
Bruce Barker will start at right
end.
In the middle, linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, the team
leader in tackles, is "much
more healthy than last week,"
according to Walsh.
Thompson's favorite targets
are seniors Mike Levenseller
and Brian Kelly. Levenseller is
second in the conference in
pass receptions with 29 while
the scrappy Kelly has found the
end zone five times in 24 recep
tions.
When Thompson sends the
Cougars on the ground the ball
is moved by fullbacks Tali Ena
and Dan Doornink.
And while the Cougar of
fense will provide a stern chal
lenge for the new-look Cardi
nal defense, Benjamin and the
Stanford attack are sure to
keep the Cougar defense
equally busy.
Benjamin missed the UCLA
game two weeks ago and
seemed to use the first half of

last week's loss to Washington
to regain his confidence. But in
the second half the nation's
No. 2 passer completed 23 pas
ses for 310 yards and three
touchdowns to senior wide re
ceiver James Lofton.
Lofton caught 12 passes for
192 yards against the Huskies.
Split end Bill Kellar proved
another Benjamin favorite
snaring nine passes for 122

yards.
Tomorrow's game is certain
to be an aerial circus with the
West Coast two top quarter
backs and the Pac-B's top five
receivers on hand, but the out
come may hinge more on how
well the new faces in the Stan
ford defense perform than
how the two Heisman Trophy
candidates play.

Freshman Ken Naber kicks a 20-yard field goal against UCLA out of the hold of Steve Dils. The first-year
placekicker has made good on nine of 13 field goal attempts and is tied for the national lead in field goals
with 1.8 per game. His toe could be a deciding factor in tomorrow's contest with Washington State.

A tough time to crack the
starting lineup as a defensive
back, but that will be the case
for two Stanford players to
morrow when the Cardinals,
4-2 on the season and 2-1 in
Pac-8, take the field to host the
Cougars, 1-2 in league and 3-3
overall, in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
Freshman Robbie Chapman
and sophomore Rick Parker
will undergo a severe test in
their initial start in a shuffled
Card secondary.
Chapman will start at free
safety and free safety Ralph
Phillips will move to strong
safety. Parker will start at left
cornerback and John Pigott will
go at right corner. Two-year
veteran Larry Reynolds will
spell Parker at corner if he is
healthy. In fact, there is a
chance Reynolds could start if
he is feeling well tomorrow.
"We're hoping for good
team defense and that includes
a good pass rush to relieve
some of the pressure off the

deep four," Stanford coach Bill
Walsh said.
The front four also assumes a
bit of a new look for the
Washington State game. Right
end Dean Wilson has been
moved to right tackle to re
place the injured Steve Howe
and to provide Stanford with a
strong inside pass rush. Senior
Bruce Barker will start at right
end.
In the middle, linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, the team
leader in tackles, is "much
more healthy than last week,"
according to Walsh.
Thompson's favorite targets
are seniors Mike Levenseller
and Brian Kelly. Levenseller is
second in the conference in
pass receptions with 29 while
the scrappy Kelly has found the
end zone five times in 24 recep
tions.
When Thompson sends the
Cougars on the ground the ball
is moved by fullbacks Tali Ena
and Dan Doornink.
And while the Cougar of
fense will provide a stern chal
lenge for the new-look Cardi
nal defense, Benjamin and the
Stanford attack are sure to
keep the Cougar defense
equally busy.
Benjamin missed the UCLA
game two weeks ago and
seemed to use the first half of

last week's loss to Washington
to regain his confidence. But in
the second half the nation's
No. 2 passer completed 23 pas
ses for 310 yards and three
touchdowns to senior wide re
ceiver James Lofton.
Lofton caught 12 passes for
192 yards against the Huskies.
Split end Bill Kellar proved
another Benjamin favorite
snaring nine passes for 122

yards.
Tomorrow's game is certain
to be an aerial circus with the
West Coast two top quarter
backs and the Pac-B's top five
receivers on hand, but the out
come may hinge more on how
well the new faces in the Stan
ford defense perform than
how the two Heisman Trophy
candidates play.

Freshman Ken Naber kicks a 20-yard field goal against UCLA out of the hold of Steve Dils. The first-year
placekicker has made good on nine of 13 field goal attempts and is tied for the national lead in field goals
with 1.8 per game. His toe could be a deciding factor in tomorrow's contest with Washington State.
It's a hell of a way to make a
debut.
Your first start in the defen
sive secondary and you've got
to face the NCAA's fifth-ranked
passer, Washington State's
Throwin' Samoan, Jack
Thompson.
