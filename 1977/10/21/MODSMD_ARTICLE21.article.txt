# Three's no crowd for Card tight ends
## 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Noticed any strange occurrences
on the football field lately? Any in
tricate offenses and unusual num
bers of tight ends all playing at
once?
Don't think the announcer is mis
taken or the coach has lost his ta
lent. It's all there in the form of a
non-traditional offense and three
excellent tight ends: Mitch Pleis,
Marty Smith and Pat Bowe.
Coach Bill Walsh doesn't re
member when or where the offen
sive twist was conceived, but is
rather grateful for the opportunity
to put it to work for the Cards.
"I've been coachinga long time,"
said Walsh. "You don't remember
where you picked it up, but you
know it can be very good if there
are the right kind of players." Ob
viously, Stanford is in luck.
"Had we not had three tight
ends, we might not have been
doing some of these things. You
sort of use the material you have
available to you. Fortunately, Pleis,
Smith and Bowe are available.
But why is this offense having the
tight ends rotate to bring in the
plays, and even utilizing all three at
one time?
"It was the strongest position on
the team," said the one-time coach
of the Cincinnati Bengals. "We had
depth there — three good players
— and we didn't have it anywhere

else."
Nothing like practicality. The
tight ends themselves, however,
credit Walsh with the know-how to
pull this off.
"To me he's like a professor of
football," said Bowe, "a football
master-mind."
"He's more of the kind of coach
that guides rather than leads you.
He makes it come from within
yourself," said Pleis.
Smith has "the highest regard for
his knowledge of the game. He has
the ability to put together an of
fense in one week to take advan
tage of a defense's weak point.
Academically, he's very sharp."
And so are the tricks Walsh keeps
extricating from his men.
Take Bowe, a 6-foot-7,225-pound
sophomore that is "just beginning
to grow," according to Walsh.
"He's a wonderful competitor and
very intelligent . . . he'll be a great
player at some time during his
career."
Although Bowe would, mod
estly, "like to catch a pass maybe"
(he's caught four this season),
blocking is very important to him.
"When you block and it's good and
we score a touchdown, it's almost
as gratifying as making a good
catch," said Bowe.
Smith, not as massive as Bowe,
6-foot-6, 210 pounds, agreed. "I
like to do things that involve physi

cal work like blocking and hitting. I
like being right in the middle of the
action." Smith is also attributed
with having "good hands," though,
which leads Walsh to comment that
"Marty's a good all-around tight
end. He's got all-around ability and
fits in between Bowe and Pleis who
are better at either blocking or re
ceiving."
"Mitch Pleis is our best receiver,"
said Walsh. "He's very nimble and
quick on his feet. He's a fine
blocker, but not real big. He's
6-foot-4, 210 pounds."
Do they get enough time on the
field individually while utilizing the
rotating tight end strategy?
Smith, echoing the sentiments of
probably every participating athlete
ever, wants to play more. "If some
one works hard, they feel like they
should be playing. I don't take it
personally. An athlete needs to feel
he should be playing more in order
to do his best."
Pleis said, "I guess all three of us
would rather stay in there the
whole time if we had a choice. We
don't though, and the best thing for
the team is what we've been do
ing."
Bowe, a sophomore, said he is
glad to be getting as much time as
he is — except "the running in and
out gets tiring sometimes!"
"They all get along extremely
well," observed Walsh. "I see them

together a lot and that's good be
cause they communicate with each
other about their jobs — help each
other improve. They're all very
competitive, but it's not like one's
on the bench all the time — they all
play."
That certainly eases the tension.
And they find a camaraderie in their
interaction on and off the field.
"Mitch Pleis coming to Stanford
made me a better tight end," said
Smith of his junior college transfer
teammate. "Everyone's attitude
makes it easy to share the responsi
bility. If they were all chumps, it
would be a lot harder."
It might also be a lot harder if they
weren't all as enthusiastic about
being at Stanford. Each was re
cruited by a number of large foot
ball schools including Notre Dame,
Nebraska, UCLA and Washington.
Perhaps Walsh described it best
when he said, "we're just especially
fortunate at Stanford to have all
three of these fellows."
Each stated that the well
developed passing game, in addi
tion to Stanford's academic reputa
tion, combined to provide the im
petus to play ball here.
"I've always looked up to Stan
ford," said Bowe. "When they
came into the picture, I knew
where I wanted to go."
Pleis said, "Stanford carried a lot
of prestige. I always pictured myself

playing for Stanford, whereas I
couldn't see suiting up for UCLA or
Washington."
Smith said accepting Stanford
"was the best choice in all respects.
I knew I'd only be playing football
for four years, not the rest of my
life."
Their preparation for a game is as
different as their reasons for com
ing to Stanford are similar.
Smith tends to run the plays over
in his mind. Pleis said the greatest
psychological boost is that burst of
adrenalin when he runs onto the
field. Bowe tends to get a bit more
nervous until the first hit comes. In
any event, by the time that whistle
blows, it's obvious they're ready to
play — and they're ready to play
Saturday's game against
Washington already.
Pleis called the game a "must
win." He said it's "really important
to come off of a loss with a win to
keep up the momentum."
Bowe predicted the contest will
be "an aerial circus since both
teams are heavy passers."
The strategy performed each
Saturday, then is not a strange oc
currence at all. Nor is one seeing
triple when Pleis, Smith and Bowe
all take the field at once. What one
is witnessing is an intricately or
ganized team of three that relate
exceptionally well on, as well as off,
the field.
