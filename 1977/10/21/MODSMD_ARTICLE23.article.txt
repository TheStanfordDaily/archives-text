# John Gansel: freshman under fire
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
"I couldn't swim, not com
petitively anyway," said Stan
ford water polo goalie John
Gansel. "One day my coach
threw a ball at me and hit me in
the face. Ever since then I've
been a goalie."
Four years after being un
ceremoniously bopped in the
face by his high school coach,
freshman Gansel is keeping
goal for the defending NCAA
champion Stanford Cardinals.
And his current coach is
more likely to be tossing
plaudits his way than errant
water polo balls.
Gansel is "the best goalie

I've seen this year (in the
NCAA)," Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti said. He added that
Gansel has "the perfect emo
tional makeup for a goalie."
"I don't know what he (De
ttamanti) means by that," Gan
sen said. "For me, life is not
letting the ball get past me. It
bothers me when a shot goes
in, but I don't think about it all
that much. I just put that out of
my mind and prepare for the
next shot.
"If you let a team see that
they've got you down," he ad
ded, "then they'll really start
gunning at you. When you get
down, they just kick you until

you're on the ground. Then
when you're on the ground,
they'll kick you a couple more
times."
Besides his emotional
makeup, Gansel has some
thing else in his favor: strong
legs.
"Before I came here," he
said, "I'd never really done leg
conditioning. Now I carry
weights from one side of the
pool to the other with my
hands over my head. They (the
coaches) have even got me
running thje stadium stairs."
It seems to have helped.
Gansel is averaging nearly
three saves a quarter and has

stopped more than half-a
dozen one-on-one shots,
mostly because of his ability to
get his upper body high out of
the water.
"I've always been a worker,"
he said. "There are some
people who can get in shape
really fast but I have to work my
butt off."
This year Gansel has had to
work particularly hard. With
the graduation of All-America
goalie Chris Oorst, Gansel had
to compete for the starting job
against fellow prep All-
Americas Alan Launer and
Vince Vanelli, both freshmen.
"I didn't think I'd be starting
when I came here," he said. "I
may not even be starting at the
end of the year. Vince and Al
are great goalies and they're
right behind me."
Being the only starting
freshman on a varsity team
made up mostly of juniors and
seniors, Gansel felt the pres
sure to adequately fill the spot
left by Dorst.
"There was a lot of pres
sure," he said. "All of the
players on the team from last
year were used to shooting
against Dorst and I think
everyone was expecting a lot
from me. I just have to work as
hard as I can."
The older players give him a
lot of support, Gansel said.
"They're great guys," he
said. "They're helping mea lot.
They're telling me what I'm
doing wrong and they'll come
down every Sunday and shoot
at me in practice.
"Doug Burke is all smiles,"
he laughed. "He'll score on
you and this big smile comes
up under his moustache. Marty
Davis has the most sinister
smile, though," he kidded.
Gansel, who is wavering be
tween engineering and pre
med interests, is not looking
too far into the future or to
ward the Olympics now.
"I'm just going one year at a
time," he said. "The Olympics
are not even on my mind right
now. There are so many other
goalies between me and the
Olympics. Chris Dorst is one.
That's so far off that I'm not
even thinking about it, really.
When 1980 comes around,
then maybe I'll be thinking
about it."
Stanford assistant coach
Mike MacNama said that Gan
sel was "blessed with legs." He
was also blessed with talent, in
telligence and a modest per
sonalty. What else could he ask
for?
