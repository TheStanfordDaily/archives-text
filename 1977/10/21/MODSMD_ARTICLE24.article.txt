# Dement joins soothsaying staffers
## 
### 
The feeble forecasters
of the Daily sports staff
have brought in a sleeper
to aid with this week's
football predictions. Dr.
William Dement, a man
who knows more about
sleep than does Rip Van
Winkle, pits his visionary
talents against the less
than dreamlike abilities of
the Daily's sportswriters.
An avid follower of Stan
ford sports, the director of
the Stanford Sleep Clinic
may have had his
prophecies come to him in
a dream. All that not
withstanding, here are the
good doctor's picks:
"Washington State Uni
versity at Stanford. This
should be a dream game.
If Guy Benjamin, Darrin
Nelson and company
catch the Cougars cat
napping, the final score
could well be 10-66 with
the Cards on top.
"USC at Notre Dame.
This traditional match-up
is always an arouser. If the

Trojans and Charles White
can do more running than
remming they could win.
However, jet lag will make
the differences in a close
contest. The Fighting Irish
on top, 21-17.
"California at UCLA.
When the Bears meet the
Bruins, one of these ursal
species will be feeling the
autumnal yen for hiberna
tion. I pick the Bears to be
singing the lullabies to the
tune of 31-20.
"Oregon at LSU. The
Ducks will leave their
waterbeds to nest on Tiger
turf. The Bayou Bengals
have been explosive but
the feline species is prey to
postprandial drowsiness.
Oregon on top, 17-10. '
"Oregon State at
Washington. In the land of
the midnight sun, Huskies
are legendary for their
alertness (SSS equals 1).
The snoozing Beavers may
have nightmares.
Washington 40, Oregon
State 13."
