### Dean Eyre 
The Stanford soccer team
continued its winning ways by
beating Sacramento State 4-0
Tuesday and Hayward State 2-0
yesterday to raise its record to
7-6-1.
The Cards now have six vic
tories in a row, five of them
shutouts. Stanford has out
scored its opponents 39 to 1 in
the last six games.
Stanford's first goal against
Sacramento came 30 minutes
into the game on a kick by Paul
Kozachenko. "jimmy's
(Melamed) throw-in was excel
lent, right on the money,"
Kozachenko said. "I enjoy a
defense that likes to dribble
back there (near their own
goal) because they do make
mistakes. I placed it in a good
spot."
Kozachenko scored again
with 35 minutes left in the
game. Eight minutes later Dan
McNevin scored on a penalty
kick. In the process of calling
the penalty, a referee ejected
the Sacramento goalie for
disputing his judgment. For

the remaining time, Sac
ramento had to play with only
10 team members. Greg De-
Igado kicked a Ron Johnson
pass in for the final tally with
seven minutes remaining.
In yesterday's game Peter
Phillips scored with an assist
from Stephen Dietz 10 minutes
into the second half. The final
goal came on a penalty shot by

McNevin with eight minutes
remaining.
For Stanford coach Nelson
Lodge, the Hayward match was
more than just another date on
the schedule. "I felt it was a
real challenge," he said. "I
could do it (coach Hayward to a
national ranking) there and I
can do it at Stanford. I had
something to prove."
