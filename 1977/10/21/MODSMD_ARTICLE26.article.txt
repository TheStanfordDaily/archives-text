# Scotchers down De Anza
## 
### Lewis Alexander 
Stanford's field hockey
team crushed De Anza
Junior College 5-0 Wednes
day to move its conference
record to 3-1.
Stanford scored early in
the first half on an accurate
push by freshman Kelly
Westerwick. The Cards con
trolled play throughout the
game and ensured the win
by scoring four goals in the

second half.
Tomorrow Stanford
travels to San Jose State to
play the Spartans. The last
time these teams met was in
the final game of the 1976
regional tournament, when
Stanford squeaked out a
shaky 1-0 victory to win a
berth in the national tour
nament. Stanford has not
beaten San Jose State dur
ing the regular season in the
last three years, however.
