Hijacker kills himself in Atlanta
Atlanta — A hijacker who commandeered a
Frontier Airlines jet in Nebraska in a day long
ordeal, released his hostages late yesterday. Fron
tier Airlines officials in Denver said he then shot
himself.
About a half hour after the hostages were re
leased, five ambulances sped up to the aircraft and
a dozen or so persons ran to the steps leading to
the door of the plane.
"He just sat down and pulled the trigger," an FBI
spokesman in Atlanta said shortly after the Fron
tier Airlines announcement.
The hijacker, Thomas Hannan, was struck once
in the chest by the shotgun blast and died im
mediately, the agent said.
Hannan had been asked to surrender by a man
with whom he had been charged in a bank rob
bery. Hannan had demanded that George Stewart
be brought to the plane from his cell in the Fulton
County jail here where he was being held on the
robbery charges. Hannan had been freed on bail.
In addition to Stewart's freedom, Hannan had
asked for $3 million in cash in return for freeing the
hostages.
However, after talking with Stewart by radio,
Hannan allowed a lawyer, J. Roger Thompson, to
board the plane for more negotiations. When
Thompson boarded the plane, Hannan freed the
remaining 11 passengers, holding only two crew
members.
Korean admits influence buying
Washington — A former South Korean intelli
gence agent told congressmen yesterday he spent
about $1 million supplied by his government in a
scheme to buy influence from members of Con
gress.
Testifying under the guard of U.S. marshals, the
witness told the House ethics committee that he
understood Washington rice dealer Tongsun Park
had links to "a high official of the Congress" and
an assistant to then-President Gerald Ford.
Kim Sang Kuen, who defected to the United
States after a career as a Korean Central Intelli
gence Agency spy and as first secretary of the
South Korean embassy in Washington, described
an elaborate scheme to spread money around

Capitol Hill.
He said the plan, directed from Seoul, was
cloaked in tight security.
While he said repeatedly that the principal aim
of the project was to buy influence in Congress, he
did not say how successful it was.
He neither volunteered nor was he asked the
names of American officials who may have been
offered bribes.
Kim did not identify the assistant to Ford with
reported links to Tongsun Park. But there was a
White House inquiry in 1975 into a trip to the
Dominican Republic involving Park and the family
of Nancy Howe, who was Betty Ford's personal
assistant. Howe's husband, James, committed
suicide during the inquiry.
Schlever abductors sought
Bonn, West Germany — Police in Germany and
France launched a massive hunt yesterday for 10
women and six men sought in the kidnap-slaying
of top German industrialist Hanns-Martin
Schleyer. Protests by sympathizers of German ter
rorists exploded across Europe for the second day.
French police, reinforced by 500 anti-terrorist
specialists, combed the Alsace region of eastern
France near the border town of Mulhouse where
the body of the 62-year-old Schleyer was found
Wednesday stuffed in the trunk of a German se
dan. He had been shot in the head.
German police also went into the predomin
antly German-speaking region to distribute hand
bill with pictures and descriptions of the suspects.
The German government offered a $24,000 re
ward for information leading to the arrest of each
suspect.
In Mulhouse, opposite the Rhine river from
Germany, medical experts performed an autopsy
on the body of the industrialist, who was kidnaped
in Cologne Sept. 5 by members of the Red Army
Faction, a West German terror group headed by
the late Andreas Baader.
Panamanians to vote on treaty
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
said yesterday the Carter administration expects
Panamanian voters to approve the Panama Canal
treaty in a nationwide plebiscite.

Vance told the House International Affairs
Committee it would be "foolhardy for me to
speculate" on the vote's outcome. But he said that
"our best information is that it will receive ap
proval."
Panamanians are voting Sunday on the treaty
that would turn the canal over to their country by
the year 2000. Panama and the United States would
have joint responsibility for keeping the waterway
open and neutral after that date.
Officials in the government of Panama's leader,
Gen. OmarTorrijos, as well as some treaty suppor
ters in this country have expressed concern that
the treaty might be rejected by Panamanians be
cause of leftist claims that the pact gives the United
States too much.
