# Program for minorities, women
## Potential Ph.D.s encouraged 
### Kurt Cobb 
The University has joined with 19
other universities in a program de
signed to seek out and encourage
potential minority and women doc
toral applicants at the undergraduate
level, according to W. Bliss Car
nochan, dean of graduate studies.
The action is a response to the de
cline in minority applications to and
enrollment in doctoral programs in
the past few years, he said. Car
nochan and Associate Dean Arthur
Walker said they hope the program
will help increase the number of
qualified minority and women
applicants.
In a report to the Faculty Senate
last spring, Carnochan and Walker
stated, "While progress in the en
rollment of women is being made in
many areas, the euphoric increase in
graduate applications and admis
sions of minority students generated
by the impact of the civil rights
movement of the early '60s, and swel
led by the return of older students to
achieve postponed educational go
als, now appears to be over.
"Any further progress will only
come with a more systematic ap
proach than in the past."
Carnochan said better job pros
pects for business, law and medical
school graduates may have attracted
qualified minority students away
from the less lucrative fields of uni
versity teaching and research.
As a result, these schools have
been able to maintain a more stable
enrollment of minorities, he said.

Carnochan also said enrollment in
doctoral programs has dropped gen
erally because of less funding to fel
lowships. He said this may have also
contributed in part to a drop in
minority student interest in such
programs, especially from those in
need of financial assistance.
Walker expressed hope that legis
lation providing a fellowship prog
ram aimed at minorities and women
will be enacted by Congress provid
ing more incentive for these two
groups to enroll in doctoral prog
rams.
Another problem plaguing en
rollment generally has been the re
luctance to compete in a shrinking
job market for university and college
professorships, traditionally the only
area open to persons possessing
doctorates. Carnochan said few
programs currently take into consid
eration the possibility that some
candidates may not end up with pro
fessorships.
Walker added, "There are a
number of topics of interest to indus
try. For example, lasers. There is a
range of thesis topics that can indeed
be directed in such a way that the
student is better prepared for indust
rial research."
Carnochan said neither he nor
Walker is suggesting that doctoral
programs be given a "vocational
twist," but that they believe such
programs can offer a "broader out
look without compromising qual
ity."

Walker said the results of affirma
tive action for women have been sig
nificant in some areas and that
"some (new) attempts to make fields
more excessible to women, may well
have a positive effect."
He cited the dramatic increase in
the number of women engineers, an
area traditionally dominated by men,
as an example of where "artificial
barriers" were being broken down.
He emphasized, however, there
are many other areas where such
barriers remain.
Carnochan and Walker have intro
duced new affirmative action
guidelines for graduate depart
ments.
