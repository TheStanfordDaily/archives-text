# Disturbances flare across S. Africa

Johannesburg, South Africa (AP) —
Police gunfire wounded a black
youth yesterday as disturbances and
protests flared across South Africa
following the government's
crackdown on the black press and
black protest movements and lead
ers.
Even Afrikaaner academics joined
the wide condemnation of the gov
ernment by opposition whites and
the opposition press. Some warned
the country is becoming a police
state headed towards bloody racial
conflict.
But Gen. H.J. van den Berg, head
of the powerful Bureau of State Sec
urity, declared that even tougher ac
tion will be taken if the current un
rest continues. He said there could
be more arrests and restrictions.
At the United Nations in New York,
the 49-nation African Group an
nounced it would ask the U.N. Sec
urity Council to take up "the ques
tion of South Africa ... as soon as
possible."
In its toughest action since the
early 19605, South Africa's white gov
ernment on Wednesday banned vir
tually all significant black organiza
tions, closed the two principal black
newspapers, detained more than 50
prominent blacks and slapped re
striction orders on seven whites.
Publications lost
Closing of the white-owned World
and Weekend World newspapers
meant urban blacks, already living
under severe government racial re
strictions, lost the publications re
garded as most closely mirroring
their grievances and aspirations. The
papers carried the most extensive
reporting in the country of black un
rest and boycotts.

Also wiped out, at least officially,
were all black consciousness move
ments, including black-run self-help
community programs. Their offices
have been closed, their assets fro
zen, and most of their leaders de
tained.
The wounding of the youth yester
day occurred when police fired on
protesters outside Graaff-Reinet, a
town in Cape province 500 miles
south of Johannesburg. Riot police
chief Maj. Gen. Dawid Kriel said
police fired after 300 youths gathered
at a primary school near the town and
began stoning cars.
13 arrests
Kriel reported 13 arrests at various
disturbances across the country.
One trouble spot was the black
township of Sharpeville, 36 miles
south of Johannesburg where in 1960
a total of 67 blacks were killed by
police gunfire in the country's first
major racial disturbance.
Principal J. Makhokolo of Shar
peville's Lekoa-Shandu high school
said students wrote slogans on
blackboards denouncing Bantu
black education and chanted
nationalist slogans in the schoolyard
before streaming out to stone pas
sing cars.
Six youths were arrested, Kriel
said, in Pretoria's black townships,
scene of continuing unrest with
militants reported by police to be in
timidating some high schoolers who
want to attend classes.
In Johannesburg's big Soweto
township, home of 1.2 million
blacks, virtually all middle schools
were deserted, the first time that
younger pupils have joined Soweto's
total high school boycott by 27,000
high school pupils.

At the United Nations in New York,
the 49-nation African Group an
nounced it would ask the U.N. Sec
urity Council to take up "the ques
tion of South Africa ... as soon as
possible."
In its toughest action since the
early 19605, South Africa's white gov
ernment on Wednesday banned vir
tually all significant black organiza
tions, closed the two principal black
newspapers, detained more than 50
prominent blacks and slapped re
striction orders on seven whites.
Publications lost
Closing of the white-owned World
and Weekend World newspapers
meant urban blacks, already living
under severe government racial re
strictions, lost the publications re
garded as most closely mirroring
their grievances and aspirations. The
papers carried the most extensive
reporting in the country of black un
rest and boycotts.

Also wiped out, at least officially,
were all black consciousness move
ments, including black-run self-help
community programs. Their offices
have been closed, their assets fro
zen, and most of their leaders de
tained.
The wounding of the youth yester
day occurred when police fired on
protesters outside Graaff-Reinet, a
town in Cape province 500 miles
south of Johannesburg. Riot police
chief Maj. Gen. Dawid Kriel said
police fired after 300 youths gathered
at a primary school near the town and
began stoning cars.
13 arrests
Kriel reported 13 arrests at various
disturbances across the country.
One trouble spot was the black
township of Sharpeville, 36 miles
south of Johannesburg where in 1960
a total of 67 blacks were killed by
police gunfire in the country's first
major racial disturbance.
Principal J. Makhokolo of Shar
peville's Lekoa-Shandu high school
said students wrote slogans on
blackboards denouncing Bantu
black education and chanted
nationalist slogans in the schoolyard
before streaming out to stone pas
sing cars.
Six youths were arrested, Kriel
said, in Pretoria's black townships,
scene of continuing unrest with
militants reported by police to be in
timidating some high schoolers who
want to attend classes.
In Johannesburg's big Soweto
township, home of 1.2 million
blacks, virtually all middle schools
were deserted, the first time that
younger pupils have joined Soweto's
total high school boycott by 27,000
high school pupils.
Johannesburg, South Africa (AP) —
Police gunfire wounded a black
youth yesterday as disturbances and
protests flared across South Africa
following the government's
crackdown on the black press and
black protest movements and lead
ers.
Even Afrikaaner academics joined
the wide condemnation of the gov
ernment by opposition whites and
the opposition press. Some warned
the country is becoming a police
state headed towards bloody racial
conflict.
But Gen. H.J. van den Berg, head
of the powerful Bureau of State Sec
urity, declared that even tougher ac
tion will be taken if the current un
rest continues. He said there could
be more arrests and restrictions.
