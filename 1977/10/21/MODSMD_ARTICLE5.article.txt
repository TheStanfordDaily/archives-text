A NASA satellite to be launched today will include a
Stanford-designed research project that "may lead to a
better understanding of energy in the future," accord
ing to Umran Inan, a postdoctoral research affiliate on
the project.
The purpose of the project aboard the International
Sun Earth Explorer satellite is to obtain a better under
standing of the sun-earth relationship for possible in
creases in the world energy supply, according to Electri
cal Engineering Prof. Robert Helliwell, who headed the
project.
The project focuses on wave particle interactions in
the earth's magnetosphere, said Inan.
The process involves sending signals from the VLF
(Very Low Frequency) transmitter in Siple, Antartica,

which are received by a VLF receiver on board the satel
lite.
"We use space as a plasma laboratory, and our find
ings increase wave and particle understanding on
earth," Inan said. "The information we acquire may be
applied to fusion processes on earth, and may lead to a
better understanding of energy in the future."
Inan and Timothy Bell, a physicist at Stanford Elec
tronics Laboratory, will come here next week to monitor
the satellite transmissions.
Inan and Bell will be in close contact with Adjunct
Professor of Electrical Engineering John Katsufrakis, who
manages the Siple VLF transmitter.
The project originated four years ago when NASA first
requested proposals for the ISEE satellite.
The satellite, being launched from Kennedy Space
Center in Florida, will orbit for three years.
