# Androgyny House: outgrowing the sexist lifestyle
## 
### Jill Liscom 
To one Androgyny House member, the
residence offers "an experiment to see just
how far feminist ideas can be incorporated
into lifestyles."
To Row Director Karen Harrison, "the
fact that they get food on the table every
night is a victory in itself."
And to one women who left Androgyny
after living there for two days, the brief stay
showed her she "was not ready to commit
that much time to it."
Those are only a few of the reactions to
the newly formed co-op on 620 Mayfield.
Androgyny was approved in March by
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs. The proposal for the co-op said the
house would be devoted to a nonsexist
lifestyle and the study of sexism.
Non-sexist environment
"We hope to have a non-sexist living en
vironment," said Dee Bucciarelli, senior
house associate. "Another one of our goals
is having people be aware of what
feminism means to them in their daily lives
and how both men and women can benefit
from the changes in society that feminism
can bring about," she continued.
The 34 residents in Androgyny House
form a student co-op in which all members
participate in the cooking, cleaning and
decision-making.
One house member, Randy Linder, said
he sees the house in two different ways. As
a co-op, he said, Androgyny is "a lot the
same as Columbae, Terra or Synergy."
The co-op members are "more in touch
with each other's feelings."

As a house devoted to androgyny as a
theme, Linder said the house "provides an
opportunity for me to expand the way I
think and the way I relate to people. Living
here doesn't mean I'm becoming strictly
effeminate," said Linder, "but I would like
to incorporate into my personality certain
qualities of females."
Linder said he feels this is helping him
"to become a fuller person because I have
a broader range of feelings."
A current bone of contention for resi
dents, according to some residents, is over
the house's name because "people have
different concepts about what androgyny
and feminism mean, and how they should
be incorporated into the house."
"Feminism implies more political activity

and androgyny is a more passive term deal
ing with personal behavior and thought,"
explained one resident. "Androgyny basi
cally means ridding oneself of sex roles,"
he said.
However, house members said they
think the "diversity of views" is "excellent
for the house" even if it is "disorienting to
us as a unit and to outsiders."
"I see this house as a new born baby,
even born a little premature," explained
one house member. "It demands a lot of
special care and attention to figure out how
to live right."
Two moved out
Although most residents seem to be en
joying Androgyny House, two students
have moved out of the house this quarter.
One woman who dropped out after liv
ing there for two days claimed she "wasn't
ready for that."
"To begin with, I'm not that political.
Everyone else in the house was very politi
cal. Feminism itself is a political fight.
You've got to get out there and fight for it
to make people aware of what's going on,"
she said.
"I practice feminism within my own lifes
tyle, but I don't feel this need to go out and
tell other people about it," she added.
She also said that "there were other stu
dents who wanted to be in the house, so I
thought I should give up my place for
them."
Very friendly
"In general," she concluded, "the
people were very friendly and warm. I
didn't feel any pressures from the people
there — no one even said anything about
my leaving."
One of the major programs in the house
is weekly CR (consciousness-raising)
groups which everyone in the house at
tends. There are two male groups and two
female groups of eight to 10 each.
The CR groups are aimed at "examining a
person's sex role in society," but "all kinds
of topics are discussed," commented Buc
ciarelli. "I think everybody looks forward
to them."
Personal level
The CR groups are conducted "on a very
personal level" said one participant. Al
though they have only been held for three
weeks, he said that he thinks "already
some good has come out of them. We feel
better about ourselves as people. But a

basic trust has to be built up first, and that
takes time."
Another unique aspect of the house is
that a consensus decision-making is used
for all decisions affecting the house.
Although everyone might not always
agree with the final decision, explained
Bucciarelli, "the important part is that
everybody knows how everybody else
feels. People don't ever leave the meetings
feeling resentful because their opinion
wasn't heard. But of course, there always
have to be compromises."
Group decision-making
Bucciarelli added that the group
decision-making process leads to "a real
caring feeling in the meetings."
The house even prefers to have press
interviews done as a group. When origi
nally interviewed, Leslie Bixel, a resident,
said she could not answer any questions

until after she had consulted with the other
members of the house's "press collec
tive."
In a later interview with the press collec
tive — a group of three males and three
females — it was explained that the collec
tive was established the first week of
school to deal with any press coverage of
the house.
"A reporter was here from the (San Fran
cisco) Examiner asking one person for an
interview and at first we didn't think any
thing of it, but then we realized that any
one person's comments would have an
impact on the whole house," explained
Bixel.
According to Harrison, the house was
"not ready for occupancy when it opened"
and"the kitchen was not outfitted with an
adequate supply of utensils."

In accordance with their nonsexist theme, male and female members of Androgyny House provided
child care earlier this week for mothers participating in Women's Week.
One resident explained that all
house members pooled their cook
ing utensils to be able to prepare
meals for the first several days. "We
really had to be a community at that
point," he added.
This past week Androgyny House
has been very involved with planning
and carrying out some of the ac
tivities of Women's Week. Free child
care has been provided at the house
every day for mothers participating
in Women's Week.
"I see child care as part of our
theme, especially for the men," said
Bucciarelli, "because in past years
child care has been primarily as
sociated with females. The men in
the house are really excited about
the idea of getting to take care of
little kids."
In addition, an undergraduate
special course on Feminism and An
drogyny: an Exploration is taught at

the house.
"We hope to ultimately have
people in the house go out to
feminist groups in the community so
we can have an educational ex
change going on," Bucciarelli said.
She also mentioned that some
house members would like to form
an outreach committee to go to other
on-campus residences to talk about
sex roles, androgyny and feminism.
The house members are con
cerned about what other students
think of the Androgyny House. One
press collective member said he
didn't think that the campus' impres
sion of the house is "real favorable,
but I don't imagine it's real accurate
either."
Another student added, "we're
very interested in campus feedback
— what people think the house is
like. Or if they don't know, we'd like
for them to come up here and find
out."
To one Androgyny House member, the
residence offers "an experiment to see just

into lifestyles."

that much time to it."
Those are only a few of the reactions to
the newly formed co-op on 620 Mayfield.
Androgyny was approved in March by
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs. The proposal for the co-op said the
house would be devoted to a nonsexist
lifestyle and the study of sexism.
Non-sexist environment
"We hope to have a non-sexist living en
vironment," said Dee Bucciarelli, senior
house associate. "Another one of our goals
is having people be aware of what
feminism means to them in their daily lives
and how both men and women can benefit
from the changes in society that feminism
can bring about," she continued.
The 34 residents in Androgyny House
form a student co-op in which all members
participate in the cooking, cleaning and
decision-making.
One house member, Randy Linder, said
he sees the house in two different ways. As
a co-op, he said, Androgyny is "a lot the
same as Columbae, Terra or Synergy."
The co-op members are "more in touch
with each other's feelings."
Expand thinking
As a house devoted to androgyny as a
theme, Linder said the house "provides an
opportunity for me to expand the way I
think and the way I relate to people. Living
here doesn't mean I'm becoming strictly
effeminate," said Linder, "but I would like
to incorporate into my personality certain
qualities of females."
Linder said he feels this is helping him
"to become a fuller person because I have
a broader range of feelings."
A current bone of contention for resi
dents, according to some residents, is over
the house's name because "people have
different concepts about what androgyny
and feminism mean, and how they should
be incorporated into the house."
"Feminism implies more political activity

and androgyny is a more passive term deal
ing with personal behavior and thought,"
explained one resident. "Androgyny basi
cally means ridding oneself of sex roles,"
he said.
However, house members said they
think the "diversity of views" is "excellent
for the house" even if it is "disorienting to
us as a unit and to outsiders."
"I see this house as a new born baby,
even born a little premature," explained
one house member. "It demands a lot of
special care and attention to figure out how
to live right."
Two moved out
Although most residents seem to be en
joying Androgyny House, two students
have moved out of the house this quarter.
One woman who dropped out after liv
ing there for two days claimed she "wasn't
ready for that."
"To begin with, I'm not that political.
Everyone else in the house was very politi
cal. Feminism itself is a political fight.
You've got to get out there and fight for it
to make people aware of what's going on,"
she said.
"I practice feminism within my own lifes
tyle, but I don't feel this need to go out and
tell other people about it," she added.
She also said that "there were other stu
dents who wanted to be in the house, so I
thought I should give up my place for
them."
Very friendly
"In general," she concluded, "the
people were very friendly and warm. I
didn't feel any pressures from the people
there — no one even said anything about
my leaving."
One of the major programs in the house
is weekly CR (consciousness-raising)
groups which everyone in the house at
tends. There are two male groups and two
female groups of eight to 10 each.
The CR groups are aimed at "examining a
person's sex role in society," but "all kinds
of topics are discussed," commented Buc
ciarelli. "I think everybody looks forward
to them."
Personal level
The CR groups are conducted "on a very
personal level" said one participant. Al
though they have only been held for three
weeks, he said that he thinks "already
some good has come out of them. We feel
better about ourselves as people. But a

basic trust has to be built up first, and that
takes time."
Another unique aspect of the house is
that a consensus decision-making is used
for all decisions affecting the house.
Although everyone might not always
agree with the final decision, explained
Bucciarelli, "the important part is that
everybody knows how everybody else
feels. People don't ever leave the meetings
feeling resentful because their opinion
wasn't heard. But of course, there always
have to be compromises."
Group decision-making
Bucciarelli added that the group
decision-making process leads to "a real
caring feeling in the meetings."
The house even prefers to have press
interviews done as a group. When origi
nally interviewed, Leslie Bixel, a resident,
said she could not answer any questions

until after she had consulted with the other
members of the house's "press collec
tive."
In a later interview with the press collec
tive — a group of three males and three
females — it was explained that the collec
tive was established the first week of
school to deal with any press coverage of
the house.
"A reporter was here from the (San Fran
cisco) Examiner asking one person for an
interview and at first we didn't think any
thing of it, but then we realized that any
one person's comments would have an
impact on the whole house," explained
Bixel.
According to Harrison, the house was
"not ready for occupancy when it opened"
and"the kitchen was not outfitted with an
adequate supply of utensils."

In accordance with their nonsexist theme, male and female members of Androgyny House provided
child care earlier this week for mothers participating in Women's Week.
One resident explained that all
house members pooled their cook
ing utensils to be able to prepare
meals for the first several days. "We
really had to be a community at that
point," he added.
This past week Androgyny House
has been very involved with planning
and carrying out some of the ac
tivities of Women's Week. Free child
care has been provided at the house
every day for mothers participating
in Women's Week.
"I see child care as part of our
theme, especially for the men," said
Bucciarelli, "because in past years
child care has been primarily as
sociated with females. The men in
the house are really excited about
the idea of getting to take care of
little kids."
In addition, an undergraduate
special course on Feminism and An
drogyny: an Exploration is taught at

the house.
"We hope to ultimately have
people in the house go out to
feminist groups in the community so
we can have an educational ex
change going on," Bucciarelli said.
She also mentioned that some
house members would like to form
an outreach committee to go to other
on-campus residences to talk about
sex roles, androgyny and feminism.
The house members are con
cerned about what other students
think of the Androgyny House. One
press collective member said he
didn't think that the campus' impres
sion of the house is "real favorable,
but I don't imagine it's real accurate
either."
Another student added, "we're
very interested in campus feedback
— what people think the house is
like. Or if they don't know, we'd like
for them to come up here and find
out."
To one Androgyny House member, the
residence offers "an experiment to see just
how far feminist ideas can be incorporated
into lifestyles."
To Row Director Karen Harrison, "the
fact that they get food on the table every
night is a victory in itself."
And to one women who left Androgyny
after living there for two days, the brief stay
showed her she "was not ready to commit
that much time to it."

vironment," said Dee Bucciarelli, senior
house associate. "Another one of our goals
is having people be aware of what
feminism means to them in their daily lives
and how both men and women can benefit
from the changes in society that feminism
can bring about," she continued.
The 34 residents in Androgyny House
form a student co-op in which all members
participate in the cooking, cleaning and
decision-making.
One house member, Randy Linder, said
he sees the house in two different ways. As
a co-op, he said, Androgyny is "a lot the
same as Columbae, Terra or Synergy."
The co-op members are "more in touch
with each other's feelings."
Expand thinking
As a house devoted to androgyny as a
theme, Linder said the house "provides an
opportunity for me to expand the way I
think and the way I relate to people. Living
here doesn't mean I'm becoming strictly
effeminate," said Linder, "but I would like
to incorporate into my personality certain
qualities of females."
Linder said he feels this is helping him
"to become a fuller person because I have
a broader range of feelings."
A current bone of contention for resi
dents, according to some residents, is over
the house's name because "people have
different concepts about what androgyny
and feminism mean, and how they should
be incorporated into the house."
"Feminism implies more political activity

and androgyny is a more passive term deal
ing with personal behavior and thought,"
explained one resident. "Androgyny basi
cally means ridding oneself of sex roles,"
he said.
However, house members said they
think the "diversity of views" is "excellent
for the house" even if it is "disorienting to
us as a unit and to outsiders."
"I see this house as a new born baby,
even born a little premature," explained
one house member. "It demands a lot of
special care and attention to figure out how
to live right."
Two moved out
Although most residents seem to be en
joying Androgyny House, two students
have moved out of the house this quarter.
One woman who dropped out after liv
ing there for two days claimed she "wasn't
ready for that."
"To begin with, I'm not that political.
Everyone else in the house was very politi
cal. Feminism itself is a political fight.
You've got to get out there and fight for it
to make people aware of what's going on,"
she said.
"I practice feminism within my own lifes
tyle, but I don't feel this need to go out and
tell other people about it," she added.
She also said that "there were other stu
dents who wanted to be in the house, so I
thought I should give up my place for
them."
Very friendly
"In general," she concluded, "the
people were very friendly and warm. I
didn't feel any pressures from the people
there — no one even said anything about
my leaving."
One of the major programs in the house
is weekly CR (consciousness-raising)
groups which everyone in the house at
tends. There are two male groups and two
female groups of eight to 10 each.
The CR groups are aimed at "examining a
person's sex role in society," but "all kinds
of topics are discussed," commented Buc
ciarelli. "I think everybody looks forward
to them."
Personal level
The CR groups are conducted "on a very
personal level" said one participant. Al
though they have only been held for three
weeks, he said that he thinks "already
some good has come out of them. We feel
better about ourselves as people. But a

basic trust has to be built up first, and that
takes time."
Another unique aspect of the house is
that a consensus decision-making is used
for all decisions affecting the house.
Although everyone might not always
agree with the final decision, explained
Bucciarelli, "the important part is that
everybody knows how everybody else
feels. People don't ever leave the meetings
feeling resentful because their opinion
wasn't heard. But of course, there always
have to be compromises."
Group decision-making
Bucciarelli added that the group
decision-making process leads to "a real
caring feeling in the meetings."
The house even prefers to have press
interviews done as a group. When origi
nally interviewed, Leslie Bixel, a resident,
said she could not answer any questions

until after she had consulted with the other
members of the house's "press collec
tive."
In a later interview with the press collec
tive — a group of three males and three
females — it was explained that the collec
tive was established the first week of
school to deal with any press coverage of
the house.
"A reporter was here from the (San Fran
cisco) Examiner asking one person for an
interview and at first we didn't think any
thing of it, but then we realized that any
one person's comments would have an
impact on the whole house," explained
Bixel.
According to Harrison, the house was
"not ready for occupancy when it opened"
and"the kitchen was not outfitted with an
adequate supply of utensils."

In accordance with their nonsexist theme, male and female members of Androgyny House provided
child care earlier this week for mothers participating in Women's Week.
One resident explained that all
house members pooled their cook
ing utensils to be able to prepare
meals for the first several days. "We
really had to be a community at that
point," he added.
This past week Androgyny House
has been very involved with planning
and carrying out some of the ac
tivities of Women's Week. Free child
care has been provided at the house
every day for mothers participating
in Women's Week.
"I see child care as part of our
theme, especially for the men," said
Bucciarelli, "because in past years
child care has been primarily as
sociated with females. The men in
the house are really excited about
the idea of getting to take care of
little kids."
In addition, an undergraduate
special course on Feminism and An
drogyny: an Exploration is taught at

the house.
"We hope to ultimately have
people in the house go out to
feminist groups in the community so
we can have an educational ex
change going on," Bucciarelli said.
She also mentioned that some
house members would like to form
an outreach committee to go to other
on-campus residences to talk about
sex roles, androgyny and feminism.
The house members are con
cerned about what other students
think of the Androgyny House. One
press collective member said he
didn't think that the campus' impres
sion of the house is "real favorable,
but I don't imagine it's real accurate
either."
Another student added, "we're
very interested in campus feedback
— what people think the house is
like. Or if they don't know, we'd like
for them to come up here and find
out."
To one Androgyny House member, the
residence offers "an experiment to see just
how far feminist ideas can be incorporated
into lifestyles."
To Row Director Karen Harrison, "the
fact that they get food on the table every
night is a victory in itself."
And to one women who left Androgyny
after living there for two days, the brief stay
showed her she "was not ready to commit
that much time to it."
Those are only a few of the reactions to
the newly formed co-op on 620 Mayfield.
Androgyny was approved in March by
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs. The proposal for the co-op said the
house would be devoted to a nonsexist
lifestyle and the study of sexism.

decision-making.
One house member, Randy Linder, said
he sees the house in two different ways. As
a co-op, he said, Androgyny is "a lot the
same as Columbae, Terra or Synergy."
The co-op members are "more in touch
with each other's feelings."

As a house devoted to androgyny as a
theme, Linder said the house "provides an
opportunity for me to expand the way I
think and the way I relate to people. Living
here doesn't mean I'm becoming strictly
effeminate," said Linder, "but I would like
to incorporate into my personality certain
qualities of females."
Linder said he feels this is helping him
"to become a fuller person because I have
a broader range of feelings."
A current bone of contention for resi
dents, according to some residents, is over
the house's name because "people have
different concepts about what androgyny
and feminism mean, and how they should
be incorporated into the house."
"Feminism implies more political activity

and androgyny is a more passive term deal
ing with personal behavior and thought,"
explained one resident. "Androgyny basi
cally means ridding oneself of sex roles,"
he said.
However, house members said they
think the "diversity of views" is "excellent
for the house" even if it is "disorienting to
us as a unit and to outsiders."
"I see this house as a new born baby,
even born a little premature," explained
one house member. "It demands a lot of
special care and attention to figure out how
to live right."
Two moved out
Although most residents seem to be en
joying Androgyny House, two students
have moved out of the house this quarter.
One woman who dropped out after liv
ing there for two days claimed she "wasn't
ready for that."
"To begin with, I'm not that political.
Everyone else in the house was very politi
cal. Feminism itself is a political fight.
You've got to get out there and fight for it
to make people aware of what's going on,"
she said.
"I practice feminism within my own lifes
tyle, but I don't feel this need to go out and
tell other people about it," she added.
She also said that "there were other stu
dents who wanted to be in the house, so I
thought I should give up my place for
them."
Very friendly
"In general," she concluded, "the
people were very friendly and warm. I
didn't feel any pressures from the people
there — no one even said anything about
my leaving."
One of the major programs in the house
is weekly CR (consciousness-raising)
groups which everyone in the house at
tends. There are two male groups and two
female groups of eight to 10 each.
The CR groups are aimed at "examining a
person's sex role in society," but "all kinds
of topics are discussed," commented Buc
ciarelli. "I think everybody looks forward
to them."
Personal level
The CR groups are conducted "on a very
personal level" said one participant. Al
though they have only been held for three
weeks, he said that he thinks "already
some good has come out of them. We feel
better about ourselves as people. But a

basic trust has to be built up first, and that
takes time."
Another unique aspect of the house is
that a consensus decision-making is used
for all decisions affecting the house.
Although everyone might not always
agree with the final decision, explained
Bucciarelli, "the important part is that
everybody knows how everybody else
feels. People don't ever leave the meetings
feeling resentful because their opinion
wasn't heard. But of course, there always
have to be compromises."
Group decision-making
Bucciarelli added that the group
decision-making process leads to "a real
caring feeling in the meetings."
The house even prefers to have press
interviews done as a group. When origi
nally interviewed, Leslie Bixel, a resident,
said she could not answer any questions

until after she had consulted with the other
members of the house's "press collec
tive."
In a later interview with the press collec
tive — a group of three males and three
females — it was explained that the collec
tive was established the first week of
school to deal with any press coverage of
the house.
"A reporter was here from the (San Fran
cisco) Examiner asking one person for an
interview and at first we didn't think any
thing of it, but then we realized that any
one person's comments would have an
impact on the whole house," explained
Bixel.
According to Harrison, the house was
"not ready for occupancy when it opened"
and"the kitchen was not outfitted with an
adequate supply of utensils."

In accordance with their nonsexist theme, male and female members of Androgyny House provided
child care earlier this week for mothers participating in Women's Week.
One resident explained that all
house members pooled their cook
ing utensils to be able to prepare
meals for the first several days. "We
really had to be a community at that
point," he added.
This past week Androgyny House
has been very involved with planning
and carrying out some of the ac
tivities of Women's Week. Free child
care has been provided at the house
every day for mothers participating
in Women's Week.
"I see child care as part of our
theme, especially for the men," said
Bucciarelli, "because in past years
child care has been primarily as
sociated with females. The men in
the house are really excited about
the idea of getting to take care of
little kids."
In addition, an undergraduate
special course on Feminism and An
drogyny: an Exploration is taught at

the house.
"We hope to ultimately have
people in the house go out to
feminist groups in the community so
we can have an educational ex
change going on," Bucciarelli said.
She also mentioned that some
house members would like to form
an outreach committee to go to other
on-campus residences to talk about
sex roles, androgyny and feminism.
The house members are con
cerned about what other students
think of the Androgyny House. One
press collective member said he
didn't think that the campus' impres
sion of the house is "real favorable,
but I don't imagine it's real accurate
either."
Another student added, "we're
very interested in campus feedback
— what people think the house is
like. Or if they don't know, we'd like
for them to come up here and find
out."
To one Androgyny House member, the
residence offers "an experiment to see just
how far feminist ideas can be incorporated
into lifestyles."
To Row Director Karen Harrison, "the
fact that they get food on the table every
night is a victory in itself."
And to one women who left Androgyny
after living there for two days, the brief stay
showed her she "was not ready to commit
that much time to it."
Those are only a few of the reactions to
the newly formed co-op on 620 Mayfield.
Androgyny was approved in March by
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs. The proposal for the co-op said the
house would be devoted to a nonsexist
lifestyle and the study of sexism.
Non-sexist environment
"We hope to have a non-sexist living en
vironment," said Dee Bucciarelli, senior
house associate. "Another one of our goals
is having people be aware of what
feminism means to them in their daily lives
and how both men and women can benefit
from the changes in society that feminism
can bring about," she continued.
The 34 residents in Androgyny House
form a student co-op in which all members
participate in the cooking, cleaning and
decision-making.
One house member, Randy Linder, said
he sees the house in two different ways. As
a co-op, he said, Androgyny is "a lot the
