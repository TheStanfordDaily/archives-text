# Senate responsibilities
## An open letter to the SOC

Tom Faletti

An open letter to the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee:
Congratulations. You have won a
majority of seats in the ASSU Senate.
Do not take lightly the respon
sibilities you have just been granted.
Do not forget the promises you made
in campaigning, but more impor
tantly, do not forget that you are now
members of a body which represents
all of the students of Stanford Uni
versity.
The yellow leaflet inserted in the
Daily by friends of yours during elec
tion week seemed to say that you are,
by your very nature, representative
of Stanford students. This is obvi
ously not true. You are, to quote
your candidacy statement in the
Daily, "a coalition of Stanford's
minority, women's, and progressive
groups, as well as the United Stan
ford Employees."
Adding together the numbers of all
the groups you represent still leaves
you with only a fraction of the stu
dents on this campus. You are by no
means inherently representative of
all the students. Yet, you must now
try to fairly represent all of us.
Most of the organizations you rep
resented voted for you. Most of the
rest of the campus did not vote for
you, or did not vote at all. Do not
consider your election as a stamp of
approval from the community at
large. Rather, consider it, to a certain
extent, an election by neglect, an
election by apathy of the majority.
I do not mean to imply that you
should not have won. You won the
election fairly, and we now look to
you to carry out the will of the stu
dents. But this means all students,
not just those whom you rep
resented in the campaign. This is not
an easy task, but it is the responsibil
ity you have accepted.
The first step in fulfilling that re
sponsibility is to keep in mind the
promises you have made to the
community.
The second step is to insist on an
awareness of all student concerns,
not just of the concerns of immediate
friends and acquaintances. You rep
resent the opinions of the more ac
tivist or progressive elements of the
campus. You must not close your

ears to the needs and demands of the
more moderate students. They, too,
are among the students you now
serve.
Unfortunately, these two goals
may often seem to be mutually exc
lusive to you. In resolving such con
flicts, again I would urge that you
insist on input from all elements of
the community, regardless of their
political persuasions.
A good rule of thumb in consider
ing which issues to devote your se
nate time to is this: can the particular
issue thrive without senate support,
or does it require senate action in
order to exist?
An example of how to apply this
rule can be given concerning the
Bakke controversy. This is an issue
which will thrive at Stanford regard
less of the degree of senate involve
ment. Students will hold rallies with
or without senate support. On the
other hand, senate action may be the
only forum for increasing the ad
ministration's concern for minority
hiring. In this issue, then, the senate
would best expend its limited ener
gies working for minority hiring and
not rallying against the Bakke deci
sion.
Another application of this rule
would encourage you to tackle the
housing problem here. Similarly, a
study of advising, especially
freshman advising, is sorely needed.
On the other hand, the issue of
university investment in South Africa
does not depend on the senate for
support. The Stanford Committee
for a Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) and other concerned stu
dents will not allow the issue to die.
Furthermore, there is nothing the
senate can do that other students
cannot, except perhaps to redirect
ASSU investments. I would not think
of asking you to change your per
sonal activities, merely that you de
vote your senate time to issues which
need senate support. Investment re
sponsibility is not such an issue.
The South Africa issue gives rise to
another aspect of your senate in
volvement. There is no clear consen
sus among Stanford students as to
their position on the issue. Many
students will not accept simple solu-

tions to this problem. Some students
do not feel that asking corporations
to pull out of South Africa is the best
solution. Some do not feel that the
University should pull its invest
ments out of companies involved in
South Africa. Obviously, many do.
There is disagreement, and no con
sensus.
As individuals, you should make
every effort to seek the ends you de
sire in this issue. But as members of
the senate of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, you
must remember that you represent a
group which has not made up its col
lective mind on the issue. You must
not present your opinions as the
opinions of the entire campus.
I wish you well in your senate ac
tivities this year. If you keep in mind
these ideas of responsibility, you will
gain and maintain the support of all
students. If you seriously seek to
represent the entire student body,
you can count on the help of con
cerned students such as myself. The
potential benefits from your in
volvement are great. Strive to form a
senate we can all finally be proud of.
