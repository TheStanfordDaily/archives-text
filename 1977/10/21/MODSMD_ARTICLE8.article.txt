# A
						young journalist's world
## Life inside a styrofoam octopus

Aspiring young journalists (like
myself) find their sanity often chal
lenged by the effort to build a good
clipping file and follow in Woods
tein's footsteps.
I've clambered across Stanford
roofs at 11 p.m. (led by a security
guard), interviewed a Pet Rock and
ridden inside a styrofoam octopus on
a parade float, all in search of good
stories.
But I'd never experienced total
disorientation until my internship
last spring on a weekly newspaper in
Washington.
The town had 4250 citizens and two
papers. One had been publishing for
about 70 years. Mine had been pub

lishing about seven months, and I
never did find out what its circulation
was. I was the reporter and the
photographer and I delivered a few
papers.
I doubt a town can sue for charac
ter assassination, but there's no
sense upsetting the local chamber of
commerce by printing the name of
the metropolis. Suffice to say it had:
a) no pizza parlor, b) no movie thea
ter, and c) no news.
The following story, which was
filed sometime in )une, may help
explain the place.
Saturday morning, 9:15, I was sit
ting on the floor of my apartment,
groggily awake, watching the Bugs

Bunny/Road Runner Hour on TV.
I heard the phone ring next door in
the office of my place of employ
ment. Grabbing my robe, I stumbled
through the door which (to my in
creasing disgust) connected the of
fice to my apartment.
Honest, there was a door between
the two bathrooms.
After a couple of tries, I found the
phone. Who would call a weekly
newspaper at the crack of dawn on
Saturday?
A woman's voice: "Hello, I'd like
to cancel a classified ad in your
paper."
jesus.
Okay, what did it say?
"It said, 'Wanted: Parts from old
Westinghouse dryer with slant front
â€” approximately 15-20 years old.' "
Had she found the parts?
"Yes, this lady called up right
away, and she had a whole dryer that
still works. She told me everything

still works, including the buzzer."
The buzzer?
"That's why I wanted the dryer.
The buzzer plays 'How Dry I Am'
when the clothes are done. No one
believed me when I said they used to
make dryers like that, so I'm going to
take the buzzer out and put it in my
own dryer."
An entire dryer just for the buzzer?
"For $20, I figure it was a pretty
good investment. Besides, the dryer
itself is a collector's item."
I took down her name and
number, said goodbye as calmly as I
could and walked back to my apart
ment.
Mrs. Smith was happier because
her dryer buzzes "How Dry I Am"
when her unmentionables are done.
Somehow Bugs Bunny just wasn't
the same anymore.
