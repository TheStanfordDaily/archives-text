Middle East myths
It is a pity that the Middle East con
troversy should be clouded again
and again by myths that have long
since been exposed. In a recent col
umn (Daily, Oct. 20), Susan Keleman
maintained that the Palestinians wil
lingly left their homes in 1948 be
cause they had been told to do so by
Arab leaders.
It is hardly credible that farmers,
homeowners, businessmen, doc
tors, lawyers, and others would leave
a land that their people had occupied
for 1300 years, simply at the request
of foreign governments. The evi
dence shows that they fled in fear,
after what the Encyclopedia Britan
nica calls "a campaign of psychologi
cal warfare."
In "Terror Out of Zion," published
by Columbia University's Institute of
War and Peace Studies, the author
wrote: "When the Haganah offen
sive began early in April, coupled
with the news from Deir Yassin (the
site of a battle in which all 250 in
habitants of a town were killed), the
Arabs, regardless of their leaders' in
tentions or the issues of the moment,
began to flee because they were af
raid. . . And, as Sami Suleiman
pointed out (Daily, Oct. 13),
Menachem Begin himself wrote, in
"The Revolt," that after Deir Yassin
"Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of
Eretz Israel . . . The Arabs began to
flee in terror."
Keleman blames the rich Arab na
tions for not absorbing and resettling
the refugees, as Israel did the lewish
refugees from Arab countries. But
would she suggest that, after World
War II, Canada and the U.S. should
have absorbed the Jewish survivors
rather than helping them to establish
Israel? The Jews wanted a homeland
of their own, not resettlement in a
foreign country.

The crux of the problem is that two
peoples, Israelis and Palestinians, lay
justified claims to the same territory.
Until this problem is solved, the po
tential for war in the Middle East will
continue to exist.
An Israeli writer, Uri Avneri, who
fought for Israel's independence, re
cently outlined the only possible
solution: "We have fulfilled our
self-determination by establishing
the state of Israel in this country. . . .
In my view the right to self
determination of the Palestinians
means the actual establishment of a
Palestinian state in the territory
which, in the present historical situa
tion, is the part of Palestine that has
remained Arab â€” i.e., the West Bank
and the Gaza strip."
Avneri's view is supported by
many Israelis and Palestinians but it
can only be realized after com
promise and negotiation between
the people directly involved. The rest
of us should urge that such negotia
tions take place rather than bolster a
stalemate situation that can only lead
to war.

Congratulations to band
For those of my generation it is
often times difficult for us to know
just how good, or bad, the Stanford
band really is.
But two weeks ago, all doubts were
resolved. I have never heard the Na
tional Anthem played as well or with
greater feeling. It brought a lump to
my throat and tears to my eyes. I was
filled with pride for the band, the
university it represents, and for this
great country of ours.
Congratulations, and keep up the
good work.
