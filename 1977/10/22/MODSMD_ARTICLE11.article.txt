## McCann snaps Cardinals into action 
### Brad Brockbank 
"A lineman sort of has to
take the winning itself as satis
faction and not depend on get
ting his nameand picture in the
paper a lot," said senior Dan
McCann, Stanford's starting
center. "It's a different head
trip for a lineman. It's not as
much being in the public eye
but it's definitely a self
satisfaction of doing a job
that's essential to the team."
McCann, who was recruited
as a linebacker, made the
switch to center at the end of
his sophomore year.
"It turned out to be a good
move," the 6-foot-5,235 pound
er said, "because I wasn't play
ing very much at linebacker and

I felt I could contribute a lot
sooner at center.
"I really like the offensive
line," he continued, "because
I'm most suited for it in my abil
ity and my temperment. It's re
ally a cohesive unit on the team
and we take a lot of pride in
helping each other on the pass
blocking and working together
on the run."
One of McCann's individual
responsibilities is to make the
line blocking calls. The calls are
made in order for the line to be
able to block effectively against
the many different defensive
set-ups which occur in a game.
Cardinal coach Bill Walsh was
particularly complimentary of
McCann's abilities.

"He's been a vital part of our
offense because he's the man
who makes so many of the line
blocking calls at the line of
scrimmage," commented
Walsh. "He's a very intelligent
player. He's a very hard work
ing man who gets the absolute
most out of his athletic ability."
"Dan is probably the smar
test lineman we've got on the
football team," assistant coach
Tom Lovat said. "So far this
year, he's been as consistent a
lineman as any team could
have. He makes very few mis
takes.
"He's an effective blocker,"
Lovat continued. "He's not as
strong as some of the other
linemen. When he blocks you,
he doesn't shock you but he
gets to you and screens you
from the play."
An offensive lineman must
be able to block on both pas
sing and running plays. Until
this year, Stanford has been
notorious for their aerial ex
positions with little or no run
ning attack. However, things
have changed this year and the
front line has been an impor
tant factor.
"We've always tried to mix
running with passing in the

past," McCann said, "but the
biggest difference this year is
that it's coming together be
cause we have a really super
talented back in Darrin Nelson.
"The biggest thing in run
blocking," he said, "is getting
off the ball quickly and trying
to get into the man to stop his
initial charge. Once you do
that, you try to get position on
him.
"Pass blocking," he con
tinued, "is more of a passive
thing. You have to snap the ball
and set up quickly while you're
reading the rush and trying to
discern whether it's a blitz or
not. Then you want to block
the man and try to stop his for
ward progress. You can't over
commit, though, because if
you get leaning too far for
ward, he can merely pull you or
push you aside."
Extra burden
Besides the blocking and
line calling responsibilities,
McCann has another duty:
snapping the balL For the
center, this can sometimes
make it more difficult to block
effectively.
"Anyone who has been play
ing center long enough has
probably gotten used to that

extra burden," McCann said.
"It can be a hindrance, though,
especially on pass blocking.
The way to compensate is just
to do it a lot. You have to learn
to develop a quicker set but
you get used to it."
Another situation that
McCann must be watching for
is the blitz.
"If a blitz comes," McCann
explained, "we know which
man will pick it up (by pre
arranged assignments). If I'm
assigned to pick it up, then it's
a question of my recognizing
the blitz at the onset and get
ting into position to stop the
man. Usually on a blitz, the
only thing you can do, since it
happens so fast, is try to cut the
linebacker that's blitzing. A lot
of teams will bring an outside
linebacker and an inside
linebacker in tandem because
the very purpose of the blitz is
to try and outman you and con
fuse you."
If McCann did not have
enough things to worry about,
there's one more. Very often,
the defense will put a man right
in front of the offensive center.

guard, is McCann's primary

blocking responsibility on pass
plays and on many running
plays as well.
"Washington State has a very
good nose guard named
George Yarno and he's very ac
tive and quick," McCann said.
"Our scheme at this point in
volves giving me some extra
help on him because he tends
to slant quite a bit.
"Their entire defense is very

active," he continued. "They
have three very good down
linemen. They're a good pursu
ing team. They'll probably be
one of the more active de
fenses we'll face all year.
"Quite a bit of the pressure
is on the offensive line because
we have such skilled receivers,
quarterbacks and backs. If we
allow them the time and pro
tection to do their job, we're
going to win games."

to try and outman you and con

"Their entire defense is very

active," he continued. "They
have three very good down
linemen. They're a good pursu
ing team. They'll probably be
one of the more active de
fenses we'll face all year.
"Quite a bit of the pressure
is on the offensive line because
we have such skilled receivers,
quarterbacks and backs. If we
allow them the time and pro
tection to do their job, we're
going to win games."
"A lineman sort of has to
take the winning itself as satis
faction and not depend on get
ting his nameand picture in the
paper a lot," said senior Dan
McCann, Stanford's starting
center. "It's a different head
trip for a lineman. It's not as
much being in the public eye
but it's definitely a self
satisfaction of doing a job
that's essential to the team."
McCann, who was recruited
as a linebacker, made the
switch to center at the end of
his sophomore year.
"It turned out to be a good
move," the 6-foot-5,235 pound
er said, "because I wasn't play
ing very much at linebacker and

I felt I could contribute a lot
sooner at center.
"I really like the offensive
line," he continued, "because
I'm most suited for it in my abil
ity and my temperment. It's re
ally a cohesive unit on the team
and we take a lot of pride in
helping each other on the pass
blocking and working together
on the run."
One of McCann's individual
responsibilities is to make the
line blocking calls. The calls are
made in order for the line to be
able to block effectively against
the many different defensive
set-ups which occur in a game.
Cardinal coach Bill Walsh was
particularly complimentary of
McCann's abilities.

"He's been a vital part of our
offense because he's the man
who makes so many of the line
blocking calls at the line of
scrimmage," commented
Walsh. "He's a very intelligent
player. He's a very hard work
ing man who gets the absolute
most out of his athletic ability."
"Dan is probably the smar
test lineman we've got on the
football team," assistant coach
Tom Lovat said. "So far this
year, he's been as consistent a
lineman as any team could
have. He makes very few mis
takes.
"He's an effective blocker,"
Lovat continued. "He's not as
strong as some of the other
linemen. When he blocks you,
he doesn't shock you but he
gets to you and screens you
from the play."
An offensive lineman must
be able to block on both pas
sing and running plays. Until
this year, Stanford has been
notorious for their aerial ex
positions with little or no run
ning attack. However, things
have changed this year and the
front line has been an impor
tant factor.
"We've always tried to mix
running with passing in the

past," McCann said, "but the
biggest difference this year is
that it's coming together be
cause we have a really super
talented back in Darrin Nelson.
"The biggest thing in run
blocking," he said, "is getting
off the ball quickly and trying
to get into the man to stop his
initial charge. Once you do
that, you try to get position on
him.
"Pass blocking," he con
tinued, "is more of a passive
thing. You have to snap the ball
and set up quickly while you're
reading the rush and trying to
discern whether it's a blitz or
not. Then you want to block
the man and try to stop his for
ward progress. You can't over
commit, though, because if
you get leaning too far for
ward, he can merely pull you or
push you aside."
Extra burden
Besides the blocking and
line calling responsibilities,
McCann has another duty:
snapping the balL For the
center, this can sometimes
make it more difficult to block
effectively.
"Anyone who has been play
ing center long enough has
probably gotten used to that

extra burden," McCann said.
"It can be a hindrance, though,
especially on pass blocking.
The way to compensate is just
to do it a lot. You have to learn
to develop a quicker set but
you get used to it."
Another situation that
McCann must be watching for
is the blitz.
"If a blitz comes," McCann
explained, "we know which
man will pick it up (by pre
arranged assignments). If I'm
assigned to pick it up, then it's
a question of my recognizing
the blitz at the onset and get
ting into position to stop the
man. Usually on a blitz, the
only thing you can do, since it
happens so fast, is try to cut the
linebacker that's blitzing. A lot
of teams will bring an outside
linebacker and an inside
linebacker in tandem because
the very purpose of the blitz is
to try and outman you and con
fuse you."
If McCann did not have
enough things to worry about,
there's one more. Very often,
the defense will put a man right
in front of the offensive center.

guard, is McCann's primary

plays and on many running
plays as well.

good nose guard named

tive and quick," McCann said.
