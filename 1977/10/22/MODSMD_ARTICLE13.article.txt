# Who is he?
## The 						man in the red beret measures up 
### Emilie Deutsch 
A mystery that has besieged
Stanford football fans game
after game has recently come
to a climactic solution.
Who is that man in the red
beret that handles the down
markers?
The question has been
answered and the long
awaited disclosure is more
than had been hoped for.
That man is Dr. Weldon
"Hoot" Gibson, executive vice
president of Stanford Research
Institute, the president of SRI
International, and the Interna
tional Associate of the Hoover
Institution (his current primary
link to the University).
What we have here ladies
and gentlemen, when he re
moves his red beret, is no or
dinary chainhandler.
Twenty-five years ago Gib
son was standing on the field
with a friend of his who was
running the chain. Overstep
ping his bounds, the doctor's
friend argued one too many
times with the referee and was
thrown out of the stadium. The
incensed referee motioned for
Gibson to take the vacated pos
ition, and he's been running
the chains ever since.
Several years later Gibson
received a gift the red beret
that has become his
trademark among Stanford
fans.
Undeniably an appropriate
accessory to the ever-present
red sports coat the doctor
wears to each game, the
cardinal-colored beret has
topped his head ever since.
Mastery of his famed behind
the-back lateral was not ac

quired so easily.
Gibson, who was born and
raised in an impoverished
farming area in West Texas,
had little hope of attending col
lege during the depression
years after graduating from
high school.
But an uncle who was assis
tant football coach at
Washington State University
gave the poor and not
particularly-gifted athlete a
shot at a college education. He
made the football team and,
though he played very little,
Gibson was a member of the
traveling squad that came to
Palo Alto for the Stanford-WSU
game in 1935.
"Seems like just yesterday
we drove down Palm Drive and
I got my first glimpse of the
Stanford campus," said Gib
son. "Right then I decided to
attend graduate school here."
That initial decision eventu
ally earned Gibson a master's
and a doctorate from Stan
ford's Graduate School of Bus
iness.
"Thus, rightly or wrongly, I
look upon college football as
having brought me ultimately
to Stanford," he said.
Lateral development
But it was at Washington
State that the art of throwing
laterals began to emerge and
with more than 25 years of
practice, Gibson is acclaimed
as an expert at the craft from
one end of Palo Alto to the
other.
The chainhandler played
center at WSU and was the de
signated ballholder when the
team was gathered in a circle
around the coach to hear

strategy or criticism. The
center was responsible for
keeping the ball in his posses
sion, away from the restive
hands of players who desired
to offer the coach less than
their undivided attention. But
Gibson was no abnormally
calm college football player
either. He found away to toss
the ball around without the
coach ever suspecting by
whipping it skillfully behind his
back to a teammate who would
toss it back so Gibson could

whip it again.
He can now toss the ball "a
good 25 yards" with uncanny
accuracy. But all those years of
practicing the lateral and run
ning the chains have not been
without incident, in particular
three years ago.
"I was knocked over and the
chain wrapped around my
foot," said the doctor. "I was at
the bottom of a pile-up and the
whole thing ended rather
bloodily."
A more glory-filled moment

came when Gibson caught "a
long pass by Frank Ryan" that
had missed the receiver.
When chided that he hand
les the chains just to be close to
where the action is, Gibson re
plied, "It's just like college. I
couldn't see any better from
the bench than I can now!" He
can obviously see well enough
to remain excited about the
team and Stanford athletics as a
whole.

letics, particularly football, has
another dimension," said Gib
son. "I am enormously impre
ssed with the ability of our
young men and women stu
dents of high caliber who
can, and do, compete success
fully with the best.
"My respect for the Stanford
athletic program within the
broader environment of excel
lence at Stanfprd is un
bounded." That respect is
further evidenced by Gibson's
10-year calendar which has
every Stanford football game
transcribed in it through 1982.
Why does Gibson work the
chain at each home game and
make efforts to see one or two
away contests a year?
"The Stanford athletic prog
ram not only encourages excel

lence but also offers a change
of pace to my everyday work,"
he said.
His present-day affiliation
with football is remarkedly dif
ferent from the years when
Gibson was "a member of the
team but not a player." The
Sports Illustrated Silver An
niversary Award recipient has
acquired the image of once
having been a great athlete
himself. "I've heard it said so
many times, I've come to be
lieve it myself!"
Whatever the history, the
mystery man has been ap
proached, his identity un
veiled. And for all the would
be imitators of the flashy
behind-the-back lateral, the
"secret is all in the wrist."

either. He found away to toss
the ball around without the
coach ever suspecting by
whipping it skillfully behind his
back to a teammate who would
toss it back so Gibson could

whip it again.
He can now toss the ball "a
good 25 yards" with uncanny
accuracy. But all those years of
practicing the lateral and run
ning the chains have not been
without incident, in particular
three years ago.
"I was knocked over and the
chain wrapped around my
foot," said the doctor. "I was at
the bottom of a pile-up and the
whole thing ended rather
bloodily."
A more glory-filled moment

came when Gibson caught "a
long pass by Frank Ryan" that
had missed the receiver.
When chided that he hand
les the chains just to be close to
where the action is, Gibson re
plied, "It's just like college. I
couldn't see any better from
the bench than I can now!" He
can obviously see well enough
to remain excited about the
team and Stanford athletics as a
whole.

young men and women stu

can, and do, compete success

"My respect for the Stanford
athletic program within the

further evidenced by Gibson's
10-year calendar which has
every Stanford football game

Why does Gibson work the
chain at each home game and
make efforts to see one or two
away contests a year?
"The Stanford athletic prog
ram not only encourages excel

of pace to my everyday work,"
he said.
His present-day affiliation
with football is remarkedly dif
ferent from the years when
Gibson was "a member of the

Sports Illustrated Silver An

acquired the image of once
having been a great athlete

Whatever the history, the
mystery man has been ap
proached, his identity un
veiled. And for all the would
be imitators of the flashy
behind-the-back lateral, the
"secret is all in the wrist."
A mystery that has besieged
Stanford football fans game
after game has recently come
to a climactic solution.
Who is that man in the red
beret that handles the down
markers?
The question has been
answered and the long
awaited disclosure is more
than had been hoped for.
That man is Dr. Weldon
"Hoot" Gibson, executive vice
president of Stanford Research
Institute, the president of SRI
International, and the Interna
tional Associate of the Hoover
Institution (his current primary
link to the University).
What we have here ladies
and gentlemen, when he re
moves his red beret, is no or
dinary chainhandler.
Twenty-five years ago Gib
son was standing on the field
with a friend of his who was
running the chain. Overstep
ping his bounds, the doctor's
friend argued one too many
times with the referee and was
thrown out of the stadium. The
incensed referee motioned for
Gibson to take the vacated pos
ition, and he's been running
the chains ever since.
Several years later Gibson
received a gift the red beret
that has become his
trademark among Stanford
fans.
Undeniably an appropriate
accessory to the ever-present
red sports coat the doctor
wears to each game, the
cardinal-colored beret has
topped his head ever since.
Mastery of his famed behind
the-back lateral was not ac

quired so easily.
Gibson, who was born and
raised in an impoverished
farming area in West Texas,
had little hope of attending col
lege during the depression
years after graduating from
high school.
But an uncle who was assis
tant football coach at
Washington State University
gave the poor and not
particularly-gifted athlete a
shot at a college education. He
made the football team and,
though he played very little,
Gibson was a member of the
traveling squad that came to
Palo Alto for the Stanford-WSU
game in 1935.
"Seems like just yesterday
we drove down Palm Drive and
I got my first glimpse of the
Stanford campus," said Gib
son. "Right then I decided to
attend graduate school here."
That initial decision eventu
ally earned Gibson a master's
and a doctorate from Stan
ford's Graduate School of Bus
iness.
"Thus, rightly or wrongly, I
look upon college football as
having brought me ultimately
to Stanford," he said.
Lateral development
But it was at Washington
State that the art of throwing
laterals began to emerge and
with more than 25 years of
practice, Gibson is acclaimed
as an expert at the craft from
one end of Palo Alto to the
other.
The chainhandler played
center at WSU and was the de
signated ballholder when the
team was gathered in a circle
around the coach to hear

strategy or criticism. The
center was responsible for
keeping the ball in his posses
sion, away from the restive
hands of players who desired
to offer the coach less than
their undivided attention. But
Gibson was no abnormally
calm college football player
either. He found away to toss
the ball around without the
coach ever suspecting by
whipping it skillfully behind his

Institution (his current primary

What we have here ladies
and gentlemen, when he re
moves his red beret, is no or
dinary chainhandler.
Twenty-five years ago Gib
son was standing on the field
with a friend of his who was
running the chain. Overstep
ping his bounds, the doctor's
friend argued one too many
times with the referee and was
thrown out of the stadium. The
incensed referee motioned for
Gibson to take the vacated pos
ition, and he's been running
the chains ever since.
Several years later Gibson
received a gift the red beret
that has become his
trademark among Stanford
fans.
Undeniably an appropriate
accessory to the ever-present
red sports coat the doctor
wears to each game, the
cardinal-colored beret has
topped his head ever since.
Mastery of his famed behind
the-back lateral was not ac

quired so easily.
Gibson, who was born and
raised in an impoverished
farming area in West Texas,
had little hope of attending col
lege during the depression
years after graduating from
high school.
But an uncle who was assis
tant football coach at
Washington State University
gave the poor and not
particularly-gifted athlete a
shot at a college education. He
made the football team and,
though he played very little,
Gibson was a member of the
traveling squad that came to
Palo Alto for the Stanford-WSU
game in 1935.
"Seems like just yesterday
we drove down Palm Drive and
I got my first glimpse of the
Stanford campus," said Gib
son. "Right then I decided to
attend graduate school here."
That initial decision eventu
ally earned Gibson a master's
and a doctorate from Stan
ford's Graduate School of Bus
iness.
"Thus, rightly or wrongly, I
look upon college football as
having brought me ultimately
to Stanford," he said.
Lateral development
But it was at Washington
State that the art of throwing
laterals began to emerge and
with more than 25 years of
practice, Gibson is acclaimed
as an expert at the craft from
one end of Palo Alto to the
other.
The chainhandler played
center at WSU and was the de
signated ballholder when the
team was gathered in a circle
around the coach to hear

strategy or criticism. The
center was responsible for
keeping the ball in his posses
sion, away from the restive
hands of players who desired
to offer the coach less than
their undivided attention. But
Gibson was no abnormally
calm college football player
either. He found away to toss
the ball around without the
coach ever suspecting by
whipping it skillfully behind his
back to a teammate who would
toss it back so Gibson could

whip it again.
He can now toss the ball "a
good 25 yards" with uncanny
accuracy. But all those years of
practicing the lateral and run
ning the chains have not been
without incident, in particular
three years ago.
"I was knocked over and the
chain wrapped around my
foot," said the doctor. "I was at
the bottom of a pile-up and the
whole thing ended rather
bloodily."
A more glory-filled moment

came when Gibson caught "a
long pass by Frank Ryan" that
had missed the receiver.
When chided that he hand
les the chains just to be close to
where the action is, Gibson re
plied, "It's just like college. I
couldn't see any better from
the bench than I can now!" He
can obviously see well enough
to remain excited about the
team and Stanford athletics as a
whole.
"My interest in Stanford ath

letics, particularly football, has
another dimension," said Gib
son. "I am enormously impre
ssed with the ability of our
young men and women stu
dents of high caliber who
can, and do, compete success
fully with the best.
"My respect for the Stanford
athletic program within the
broader environment of excel
lence at Stanfprd is un
bounded." That respect is
further evidenced by Gibson's
10-year calendar which has
every Stanford football game
transcribed in it through 1982.
Why does Gibson work the
chain at each home game and
make efforts to see one or two
away contests a year?
"The Stanford athletic prog
ram not only encourages excel

lence but also offers a change
of pace to my everyday work,"
he said.
His present-day affiliation
with football is remarkedly dif
ferent from the years when
Gibson was "a member of the
team but not a player." The
Sports Illustrated Silver An
niversary Award recipient has
acquired the image of once
having been a great athlete
himself. "I've heard it said so
many times, I've come to be
lieve it myself!"
Whatever the history, the
mystery man has been ap
proached, his identity un
veiled. And for all the would
be imitators of the flashy
behind-the-back lateral, the
"secret is all in the wrist."
A mystery that has besieged
Stanford football fans game
after game has recently come
to a climactic solution.
Who is that man in the red
beret that handles the down
markers?
The question has been
answered and the long
awaited disclosure is more
than had been hoped for.
That man is Dr. Weldon
"Hoot" Gibson, executive vice
president of Stanford Research
Institute, the president of SRI
International, and the Interna
tional Associate of the Hoover
Institution (his current primary
link to the University).
