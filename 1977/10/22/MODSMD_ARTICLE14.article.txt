# Quite a Hall!
## Freshman linebacker secures outside 
### Ben Webster 
If Washington State's Jack Thompson starts trying to force the
ball to his receivers over the middle today, he better be looking out
for one of Stanford's outstanding freshmen performers 6-foot-2,
220 linebacker Tom Hall.
Though only 18-years-old, Hall has already sacked and tackled
his way into the ranks of fine linebackers in the Pacific-8.
"He could easily become just a super football player, and go on
to an outstanding career," said assistant coach Russel Charles.
"Tom's the only freshman on the coast who's starting at
linebacker."
Why the sudden success for Hall? Stanford head coach Bill Walsh
said Hall has "natural athletic ability and great agility," adding that
he is "an outstanding prospect."
But even if the predictions of greatness are accurate, Hall, a
native of Newport News, Va., is more concerned with the present.
"I'm only a freshman," he said. "I'm still getting adjusted around
here, and this varsity action is a real experience."
The absence of a lot of experience has shown at times. "He
makes a few mistakes every now and then, but he makes up for
them with his aggressive style," said Charles. "He's a very physical
player, loves contact, and that's primarily why he's on the field
now."
Fills the spot
Hall's physical contact might still be primarily with the splinters
on the bench had not an injury to the preseason sophomore
starter Terry Rennacker sprung Hall into the freshman strongside
linebacker position against Tulane.
"Tom did a great job that night," Charles said. "He made one big
stop on a third down that turned out to be a crucial play of the
game."
And of Hall's Stanford career. He has started at strong linebacker
in the four games since Tulane.
"I'm very pleasantly surprised to be playing so much so soon,"
Hall said. The massive Virginian, whose name and number 58
appeared nowhere not even on the bottom line of the Athletic
Department's preseason defensive depth charts, said he expected
to assume "a backup, catch-a-game-here, catch-a-game-there"
role during his first year.
Hall, n _vertheless, said he felt he had a better chance of
playing nore at Stanford than at the other five schools Penn
State, William arid Mary, University of Virginia, North Carolina
State and Duke that recruited him.
Graduation gap
"The fact that Stanford lost six linebackers to graduation last year
really influenced my decision to come out here," explained Hall,
who spent last summer working at Bay Meadows race track.
"Playing linebacker has just always been a sort of natural thing
for me, I guess," said Hall, whose three older brothers all played
linebacker for Ferguson High. One brother, Jack, played four years
at linebacker for North Carolina State and was named to the 1976
Academic Ail-American team.
For Tom, academics have been intriguing and smooth-flowing,
but so far he hasn't settled on a major. "I'm just taking a broad
sampling of courses now, trying to get some requirements out of
the way and seeing what seems to hold the most interest for me."
Career goals present an even bigger question mark on Tom's
horizon. "There are three more years ahead of me and a lot can
happen then," Hall said at the mention of pro football. "I'm too
young to start thinking about things like that right now."
Tom Hall isn't even thinking about the USC game. Or the Big
Game. "The tension of the Pac-8 hasn't really hit me yet. I know
that there are a lot of super good teams out here, but I really don't
know too much about the conference. Anyway, I'm just taking
things one game at a time and concentrating on who we play when
we play them."
Tom's philosophy seems to be working pretty well so far. And
he's still got three more years on the Farm to perfect it.

Why the sudden success for Hall? Stanford head coach Bill Walsh
said Hall has "natural athletic ability and great agility," adding that
he is "an outstanding prospect."
But even if the predictions of greatness are accurate, Hall, a
native of Newport News, Va., is more concerned with the present.
"I'm only a freshman," he said. "I'm still getting adjusted around
here, and this varsity action is a real experience."
The absence of a lot of experience has shown at times. "He
makes a few mistakes every now and then, but he makes up for
them with his aggressive style," said Charles. "He's a very physical
player, loves contact, and that's primarily why he's on the field
now."
Fills the spot
Hall's physical contact might still be primarily with the splinters
on the bench had not an injury to the preseason sophomore
starter Terry Rennacker sprung Hall into the freshman strongside
linebacker position against Tulane.
"Tom did a great job that night," Charles said. "He made one big
stop on a third down that turned out to be a crucial play of the
game."
And of Hall's Stanford career. He has started at strong linebacker
in the four games since Tulane.
"I'm very pleasantly surprised to be playing so much so soon,"
Hall said. The massive Virginian, whose name and number 58
appeared nowhere not even on the bottom line of the Athletic
Department's preseason defensive depth charts, said he expected
to assume "a backup, catch-a-game-here, catch-a-game-there"
role during his first year.
Hall, n _vertheless, said he felt he had a better chance of
playing nore at Stanford than at the other five schools Penn
State, William arid Mary, University of Virginia, North Carolina
State and Duke that recruited him.
Graduation gap
"The fact that Stanford lost six linebackers to graduation last year
really influenced my decision to come out here," explained Hall,
who spent last summer working at Bay Meadows race track.
"Playing linebacker has just always been a sort of natural thing
for me, I guess," said Hall, whose three older brothers all played
linebacker for Ferguson High. One brother, Jack, played four years
at linebacker for North Carolina State and was named to the 1976
Academic Ail-American team.
For Tom, academics have been intriguing and smooth-flowing,
but so far he hasn't settled on a major. "I'm just taking a broad
sampling of courses now, trying to get some requirements out of
the way and seeing what seems to hold the most interest for me."
Career goals present an even bigger question mark on Tom's
horizon. "There are three more years ahead of me and a lot can
happen then," Hall said at the mention of pro football. "I'm too
young to start thinking about things like that right now."
Tom Hall isn't even thinking about the USC game. Or the Big
Game. "The tension of the Pac-8 hasn't really hit me yet. I know
that there are a lot of super good teams out here, but I really don't
know too much about the conference. Anyway, I'm just taking
things one game at a time and concentrating on who we play when
we play them."
Tom's philosophy seems to be working pretty well so far. And
he's still got three more years on the Farm to perfect it.

Freshman linebacker Tom Hall is ready for action during a Stanford practice. The strongside linebacker is
the Cards' fifth-leading tackier.
If Washington State's Jack Thompson starts trying to force the
ball to his receivers over the middle today, he better be looking out
for one of Stanford's outstanding freshmen performers 6-foot-2,
220 linebacker Tom Hall.
Though only 18-years-old, Hall has already sacked and tackled
his way into the ranks of fine linebackers in the Pacific-8.
"He could easily become just a super football player, and go on
to an outstanding career," said assistant coach Russel Charles.
"Tom's the only freshman on the coast who's starting at
linebacker."
