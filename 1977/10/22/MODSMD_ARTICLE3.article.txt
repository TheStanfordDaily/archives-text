Aerial football will be the
name of the game this after
noon when the Stanford Car
dinals square off against the
Washington State Cougars.
Today's contest is a confron
tation between the two finest
football passers in the nation,
Stanford senior Guy Benjamin
and Cougar junior Jack
Thompson, the "Throwin' Sa
moan." Benjamin is currently
second nationally in passing
with a .649 percentage for 1372
yards and 10 touchdowns, and
is third in total offense.
Thompson is fifth in passing
(113 of 196 for 1312 yards) and
eighth in total offense.
Career-wise, Benjamin is
fourth in the Pacific-8 with 4797
yards passing, while his
Cougar counterpart ranks
seventh with 4407.
The two had good outings
last week, with Thompson
throwing for 261 yards against
UCLA and the Stanford signal
caller chalking up 376 against
Washington. Benjamin missed
the NCAA record for passing
yardage in one half by 11 yards
in gaining 310 in the second
half.
WSU coach Warren Powers
declined to compare the two.
"Washington State and Stan
ford have two different types of
play," he said. "We use Jack in
a little different type of of
fense. We run more options."
"Benjamin is a more mature

quarterback," said Stanford
coach Bill Walsh, "but then
Thompson's only a junior.
Thompson is a bull-like man;
he throws with tremendous
velocity. Benjamin has more
touch. He'll throw one hard,
and make the next one soft to
fit it in between defenders.
Benjamin's further along."
The Pac-B's top five receivers
will be running their routes
through the secondaries. The
Cardinals' James Lofton is the
conference's leading receiver
with 33 catches while the
Cougars' Mike Levenseller is
second with 29. Right behind
Levenseller is Stanford
halfback Darrin Nelson (28)
and Cardinal split end Bill Kel
lar (27). The Cougars' other re
ceiver, Brian Kelly, is fifth with
24 receptions.
Record performance
Lofton tied a school record
of three touchdowns in one
game last week. He caught 12
passes for 192 yards, while Kel
lar snagged nine for 122 yards.
Lofton leads the Pac-8 in scor
ing (44 points) and in pass
receiving. He is second nation
ally in receiving with an aver
age of 5.5 receptions per con
test. Levenseller had nine
catches for 148 yards against
UCLA, and is third on WSU's
all-time list.
Stanford, 4-2 overall, enters
the game with a 2-1 mark in the
Pac-8 while the Cougars stand
at 1-2, having lost to USC and

UCLA. The outcome of this af
ternoon's game will decide
who has the upper hand in the
series record, which now
stands at 16-16-1. Stanford pul
led out a 22-16 victory last year
in Pullman, when Card running
back Gary Lynn crashed across
the goal line with less than a
minute left on the clock.
Turnaround
The Cougars had an auspici
ous start this season under new
head coach Powers, including
wins over powerhouse Neb
raska and Michigan State.
When you consider that they
were 3-8 last year, and lost to
UCLA 62-3, WSU has ac
complished great things. Why
the turnaround? Powers is a
winner.
He played six seasons in the
Oakland Raider defensive
backfield after a successful col
lege stint at Nebraska. Powers
was a member of the Raiders'
1968 Super Bowl squad, and
then retired and became an as
sistant coach at his alma mater.
During Powers' eight years as
defensive back coach for the
Cornhuskers, Nebraska
posted a 78-14-5 record.
Much of the success of a new
coach depends on how quickly
a good relationship with his
players develops. The transi
tion apparently worked out
well for Powers and his troops.
"It just depends on how you
treat the players," remarked
Powers. "Naturally they'll have

a lot of questions. So you have
to have them believe in what
you say. But I think the kids
understand me pretty well."
"We concentrate a great deal
more on developing a good,
sound running game," said
Powers about the changes he
has instituted. "Last year we
were primarily a throwing
team."
According to Powers, his
All-West Coast quarterback
Thompson could care less
about hurting his statistics with
the implementation of the run
at WSU.
"He (Thompson) has made
no indication," said Powers,
"that he doesn't like to run the
football. In fact, he would

probably do more runs than
passes if he called his own
plays."
New defense
If ever there was a no-name
defense, WSU has it. But it
probably won't stay that way
for long. At Nebraska, Powers'
defensive backs held oppo
nents to an average of under
100 yards passing per game.
"It took the kids a while to
get used to it," said the Cougar
coach of his 5-2 defensive
alignment. "It's more techni
cally oriented. Last season
there was more stunting (blitz
ing)."
Powers added, "Both teams
have real fine passers and they
