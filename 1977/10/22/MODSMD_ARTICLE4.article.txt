## Lofton has the confidence 
### jay Roach 
"James Lofton's greatest as
sets are his confidence and his
ability to dance in the end
zone," Guy Benjamin said of
his talented receiver in the
locker room after a recent
practice.
Walking by on his way to the
showers, Lofton overheard his
quarterback's jocular com
ment (Benjamin meant for him
to). He turned his head and
smiled calmly but walked on
without a retort. Benjamin
grinned back.
Steve Dils, whose locker
stands near Benjamin's, grin
ned too. He and Benjamin both
know there's a lot more to
James Lofton and his successes
than that. So does Lofton.
They know he's surrounded
by other great assets, two of
which are Benjamin and Dils
themselves. Together, they've
tossed him 33 completions for
577 yards, seven touchdowns
and a two-point conversion
this season. That's eight trips to
the dance floor.
"It's hard to understand how
good your quarterback really is
until you watch other teams.
Now I can appreciate what we
have," Lofton acknowledged.
"But I think receivers comple
ment quarterbacks."
Receivers complement each
other too because as receiver
coach Rod Dowhower said,
"The abilities of Bill Kellar and
the tight ends put a lot of pres
sure on a defensive secondary;
which means they can't get
away with double-covering
Lofton all the time."The Uni
versity of Washington's secon
dary will agree with
Dowhower. While Lofton was
beating double-coverage for 12

catches, a record breaking 192
yards and 18 points, Bill Kellar
made nine receptions for 122
yards.
Assets
But most of Lofton's assets
are his own physical ones.
At 6-foot-3, 187, "I'm as big
or bigger than most people I /
come up against," Lofton said.
Besides getting him open
consistently on pass patterns,
his long legs are powerful
enough to make him a world
class long jumper (best jump:
26-9) and a fine sprinter (best
times: 20.7 and 46.6, respec
tively, in the 200 and 400 met
ers).
"Track gives me an oppor
tunity, which other players
don't have, to physically im
prove myself while in competi
tion. My speed in the 40 has
improved from 4.6 when I got
here, to 4.4."
As tor nis ball-catching ta
lents, "I think I have great
hands. That has to be my
biggest asset."
Assets, assets. What about
liabilities?
"My weakness is in carrying
the ball after it's caught. I'd like
to be as quick as Darrin (Nel
son). If I could be as quick as
that, I'd be unstoppable," Lof
ton boasted.
Guy Benjamin was right.
James Lofton glows with confi
dence.
"You can't question your
self," Lofton said. "When a
play is jcalled to me, I have no
negative thoughts. I know I'll
be open. If the ball is anywhere
near me, I'll catch it."
Lofton, a "clutch" receiver
(Did you see the end of the
UCLA game?), believes pres
sure is an inspiration to him.

"A receiver is called on so
little during the game, it's
ego-building for me to be cal
led on in tight situations.
Dropping the ball lowers
others' confidence in me, so
it's to my benefit not to."
Mental approach
A senior in industrial en
gineering, Lofton is convinced
that football is as much a men
tal as it is a physical game. His
intelligence, then, is another
energy source.
"Anyone who plays under
stands it's more than just a
game of run and hit. I'm not
that fast. I'm open because I
know the defense, I know the
route, and I know how to set
the man up," he said.
"Pure speed is good to have,
but it's an accessory, not the
ultimate weapon. Your mental
preparation has to be high, and
you have to be confident.
"If I spent as much time
thinking about academics as I
do about sports, I'd be Phi Beta
Kappa."
Lofton gives head coach Bill
Walsh credit for helping him
put things together.
"I don't see how anyone
could have been better for me
or the team," he says of Walsh.
"He puts a unique meaning on
the game. He says you're out
there to learn about yourself as
much as anything else."
Heavily scouted, Lofton
says, "pro ball will be a chal
lenge."
"Two years ago, it looked
like a distant dream. Now
agents are talking first or sec
ond round. It's hard to adjust
to."
Other things he has to adjust
to are comparisons with Gene
Washington and Tony Hill, two
of Stanford's previous con
tributions to the list of out
standing college receivers.
"I would like it if I could just
be remembered in the same
breath as Hill and
Washington," he said.
That shouldn't be hard, since
his end-zone dances will very
soon be the tune of some of
their old receiving records.
