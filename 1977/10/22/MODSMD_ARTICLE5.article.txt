## Happy Birthday to the Band 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
is a summary of today's presen
tation by the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, prepared for the Daily by
the Band, which is responsible
for its content.)
Ah, Saturday afternoon, the
time for even the hard-core
nerd to leave the secure sur
roundings of Meyer Library in
favor of the idyllic setting of
Stanford Stadium. The enter
prising Stanford student, how
ever, in the never-ending quest
for knowledge and admission
to their favorite medical
school, is still hard at work un
locking the secrets of nature.
Suddenly, with virtually no
warning, strains of precision
drumming bring a rapid halt to
the activities. The crowd rises
to perceive the origins of the
siren-like sounds. Slowly, to
the unharnessed glee of the
students and to the open dis
gust of the alumni, those ratty
fellows known as the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
come into focus and all hell
breaks loose. With considera
ble difficulty, the Incompara
bles stumble down the ramp
and spill out on the track in

preparation for today's very
special pre-game presentation.
The LSJUMB has invited over
1300 high school musicians to
help them celebrate an impor
tant moment in Stanford's his
tory, the 14th birthday of the
Band. Yes, it was in October
1963 that the Band ended a
month long strike to have its
first public intercourse with
Dr. Arthur P. Barnes. Dr.
Barnes immediately took con
trol of the Band by not taking
control, and still serves today
as the LSJUMB's spiritual
leader and musical director of
the student-owned and -oper
ated organization.
Since that fateful day, the
Band has radically changed the
meaning of halftime enter
tainment by simply dedicating
themselves to "Good Times
through Sex, Drugs and Vio
lence." And now after 14 years,
the time of fruition has come
as the Incomparables enter
puberty.
In honor of this momentous
occasion, the LSJUMB has
brought birthday cake for
everyone. To facilitate the
good times, the Band has
added some of their own in

gredients to the batter, a spice
in keeping with traditions of
sex, drugs and violence. Be
fore the old farts know what hit
them, the LSJUMB quickly il
lustrates their patented scatter
technique and take the field to
form the symbol of the upcom
ing Big Game, the Axe, accom
panied by the stirring strains of
the traditional "Fanfare." A
quick drum rolloff signals the
start of the party as the LSJUMB
invites all to "Come Join the
Band."
As they get progressively out
of control, the Band coagulates
into the number 14, signify
ing a decade and a half of faith
less (dis)service to Stanford
University, "My Old School."
The Band will next form a
birthday cake as they play a
special, Incomparable version
of "Happy Birthday." As
thoughts shift to more mun
dane things, the Incompara
bles move into formation to
present Dr. Barnes nationally
famous arrangement of the
"Star Spangled Banner." Char
lie "Chazmo" Bowles will do
the honors on the trumpet
solo.

locking the secrets of nature.
Suddenly, with virtually no
warning, strains of precision
drumming bring a rapid halt to
the activities. The crowd rises
to perceive the origins of the
siren-like sounds. Slowly, to
the unharnessed glee of the
students and to the open dis
gust of the alumni, those ratty
fellows known as the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
come into focus and all hell
breaks loose. With considera
ble difficulty, the Incompara
bles stumble down the ramp
and spill out on the track in

preparation for today's very
special pre-game presentation.
The LSJUMB has invited over
1300 high school musicians to
help them celebrate an impor
tant moment in Stanford's his
tory, the 14th birthday of the
Band. Yes, it was in October
1963 that the Band ended a
month long strike to have its
first public intercourse with
Dr. Arthur P. Barnes. Dr.
Barnes immediately took con
trol of the Band by not taking
control, and still serves today
as the LSJUMB's spiritual
leader and musical director of
the student-owned and -oper
ated organization.
Since that fateful day, the
Band has radically changed the
meaning of halftime enter
tainment by simply dedicating
themselves to "Good Times
through Sex, Drugs and Vio
lence." And now after 14 years,
the time of fruition has come
as the Incomparables enter
puberty.
In honor of this momentous
occasion, the LSJUMB has
brought birthday cake for
everyone. To facilitate the
good times, the Band has
added some of their own in

gredients to the batter, a spice
in keeping with traditions of
sex, drugs and violence. Be
fore the old farts know what hit
them, the LSJUMB quickly il
lustrates their patented scatter
technique and take the field to
form the symbol of the upcom
ing Big Game, the Axe, accom
panied by the stirring strains of
the traditional "Fanfare." A
quick drum rolloff signals the
start of the party as the LSJUMB
invites all to "Come Join the
Band."
As they get progressively out
of control, the Band coagulates
into the number 14, signify
ing a decade and a half of faith
less (dis)service to Stanford
University, "My Old School."
The Band will next form a
birthday cake as they play a
special, Incomparable version
of "Happy Birthday." As
thoughts shift to more mun
dane things, the Incompara
bles move into formation to
present Dr. Barnes nationally
famous arrangement of the
"Star Spangled Banner." Char
lie "Chazmo" Bowles will do
the honors on the trumpet
solo.

Ah, Saturday afternoon, the
time for even the hard-core
nerd to leave the secure sur
roundings of Meyer Library in
favor of the idyllic setting of
Stanford Stadium. The enter
prising Stanford student, how
ever, in the never-ending quest
for knowledge and admission
to their favorite medical
school, is still hard at work un
locking the secrets of nature.
