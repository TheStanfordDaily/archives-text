Toward aCRY
for Non-Accounting
Graduates
This is a unique fifteen-month, sixteen-course program
for graduates in the liberal arts, social sciences and
other non-accounting disciplines.
It consists of six months of study of the basics
of accounting; then three months of internship in a
public accounting firm, putting theory into practice;
then another six months of intensive study.
Entering the program isn't easy: The competition
is keen. But when you graduate, you'll have the degree
of Master of Science in Accounting, and you II be ready
for the CPA examination —and a rewarding career.
