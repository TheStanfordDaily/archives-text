Â©1977 JOS SCHLITZ BREWING CO. MILWAUKEE. WIS
THE DEAN OF BEER'S QUICKIE QUIZ.
Q: The figure "130" represents:
a) The number of mailmen in the U.S.
answering to the name of Louie.
b) Any combination of the numbers 70 and 60.
c) The number of times the word porcupine
can be written on a zucchini.
d) The number of Schlitz taste testers.
e) Both (b) and (d).
A: (e) I can think of no combination of 70
and 60 that does not equal 130. (If you
can, you now know why you are flunking math.)
I also can't think of anything better than
being a Schlitz taste tester. Except.perhaps.
owning Kuwait.
And Schlitz maintains a trained panel of over
130 of them. They're qualified and requalified
experts who make sure your taste for quality
is never disappointed.
Because Schlitz knows the final test for
flavor is yours alone.
Class dismissed.
THERE'S JUST ONE WORD
FOR BEER.
AND YOU KNOW IT.
