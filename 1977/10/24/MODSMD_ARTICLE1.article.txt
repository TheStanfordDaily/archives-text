### Will Nixon 
The South African government's
crackdown of black organizations
and leaders last Wednesday is part of
a consistent pattern of repression,
according to Peter Duignan, director
of African Studies at the Hoover Insti
tute.
In an interview Friday, Duignan
spoke of heavy governmental rep
ression in urban townships since last
May and June, when students forced
an end to the urban bantu councils in
an effort to repudiate the validity of
the apartheid system.
These areas have had no govern
ment since then except for what the
students and their parents have or
ganized themselves.
Several scores of black leaders have
been arrested and organizations
have been banned in recent months
as part of the continuing crackdown,
Duignan said.
Underground impossible
When asked how effective these
crackdowns were, Duignan said, "It
is almost impossible to form any kind
of underground movement because
they keep arresting the leaders." He
added that arrests reach down to a
very low level; anyone who even
works for a liberal organization is
suspect.
"As a young black leader you
would have to be incredibly brave to
remain in the townships and engage
in any illegal activity," said Duignan.
"The government will not tolerate
any kind of opposition which seems
to be gaining any support."
Last week's crackdown resulted in
part from the recent unrest that has
followed the death of black leader
Steve Biko Sept. 12 in prison. "Biko
was somewhat radical, but he was
opposed to radical violence," said
Duignan.
Biko founded the South African
Students' Organization, banned last
week, and was a leading force be
hind the black consciousness
movement which was also banned.
The black consciousness movement
is somewhat analagous to the black
power movement in the United
States, said Duignan.
Campaign tactic
Duignan also said the timing of the
crackdown is partially explained by
next month's elections in South Af
rica. Only whites are allowed to vote,
and Prime Minister John Vorster is
using this crackdown to impress the
whites that his government is in con
trol of the situation and will not tol
erate any black opposition, added
Duignan.
With the mandate of these elec
tions Vorster hopes "to make sig
nificant changes" in South Africa,
said Duignan. Traditionally no major
changes have been made in South
Africa without such a mandate com
ing first.
The changes Duignan anticipates
include the granting of more political
power to the Indians and coloreds,
the granting of some measure of self
government to the bantu townships,
and changing the South African par
liamentary system to grant the execu
tive more power.
In a way these recent arrests and
bannings are to appease the right
wing that the government is not
going to capitulate to violence.
"The whites are willing to make

the dynamics," said Duignan.
Fewer outbursts
In the future Duignan forsees
more periodic outbursts of violence,
but these would become fewer and
fewer in number as the arrests con
tinued. However, he added that the
underlying tension would remain.

One of those arrested Wednesday
whom Duignan interviewed during a
trip to South Africa last June was
Percy Qoboza, editor of The World,
the country's leading black news
paper.
Qoboza is "a very moderate man,
not a leftist," said Duignan. He
helped set up the Council of Ten to
oversee the affairs of Soweto, which
has been left without government
since its urban council was forced to
disband last spring.
Soweto is a large township of
Johannesburg with 1.2 million black
residents, which in recent years, has
been the scene of large student pro
tests.
When the urban council was dis
banded and the schools closed,
Duignan recalled, David Thebehali,
the mayor of Soweto, was forced to
hop like a frog through the township,
demonstrating the students' displea
sure with any black cooperation with
the government.
Human rights
Bernard Naude was another man
arrested whom Duignan spoke with
last June. Naude had founded the re
cently banned Christian Institute of
South Africa. Duignan described him
as being "not political, not an ac
tivist, but a man concerned with
human rights for all men." Duignan
added that Naude headed a limited
organization.
One of Naude's concerns had
been keeping track of persons ar
rested, because the government
rarely releases any information on
this subject.
"It is very surprising, however,"
said Duignan, "that South Africa has
fewer political prisoners than a coun
try such as Cuba." There are at most a
thousand people in South Africa who
have been "arrested, detained, or
banned, whereas there are four to
five thousand in Cuba."
Detention
People can be detained under sev
eral acts (such as a terrorism act or an
anti-Communism act) and be held up
to 90 days without lawyer or trial.
Being banned is like "being in
limbo," said Duignan. A banned per
son is confined to his home area, not
allowed to publish or be quoted, and
not allowed to meet with more than
two people at one time.
"When South Africa decided to
implement apartheid in 1948 they
didn't know exactly how to go about
it, and, now that they want to go
about dismantling, they're in the
same position," said Duignan.
Left to themselves, Duignan be
lieves, the South African could work
the situation out, but, "it's the exter
nal problem that makes this dif
ficult."
Banned organizations
The three major organizations ap
plying pressure according to Duig
nan are the African National Con
gress, the Pan-African Congress and
the South African Communist Party,
all of which were banned from the
country in 1962.
These organizations are demand
ing a one man-one vote system and a
democratic socialist state for South
Africa. "They have initiated a war of
national liberation against South Af
rica, and they do not appear willing
to compromise with the present re
gime," said Duignan.
When asked about American in

vestment in South Africa Duignan
replied that the South Africans
"could do without us in strictly dol
lars and cents terms."
American investments constitute
about 18 per cent of all foreign in
vestment in South Africa. "But the
United States companies do repre
sent a high technology that the South
Africans need/' Duignan added.
Symbolic effect
"An American withdrawal would
have more of a symbolic impact,"
said Duignan. "It would create the
atmosphere of a government under
siege, and would lead to hesitancy in
the business community."
"The consequences of disinvest
ment are unclear," continued Duig
nan. "It could harm the blacks more
than it could lead to their liberation.
It could harden the whites' attitudes
and make them unwilling to com
promise.
"The whites are better prepared
for austerity." Duignan pointed out
that many black workers rely solely
on their weekly pay checks for
money, that they have no savings or
other resources to support them
selves.
"Divestiture is almost a class issue
among the blacks," Duignan learned
from his trip. While he said black
churchmen, schoolteachers, or wel
fare workers want no more invest
ment, black businessmen or workers
might want even more American in
vestment which would mean more
jobs.
Positive policy
"A policy of economic develop
ment might be more helpful to the
situation," Duignan said. "An ex
panding economy would demand
more skilled workers than whites
could provide. The percentage of
blacks would therefore increase in
the work force, and in skilled posi
tions."

When asked about student protest
in the United States at campuses
such as Stanford, Duignan replied
that the South Africans "were very
aware of the protests.
"No matter what happens," Duig
nan said, "the whites are determined
to remain. South Africa is unlike the
other former colonial nations in Af
rica which recently have gained in
dependence. The South Africans
consider this their homeland, they
are not like the British or French in
Ghana or Senegal who were willing
to pack up and go home."

other resources to support them
selves.
"Divestiture is almost a class issue
among the blacks," Duignan learned
from his trip. While he said black
churchmen, schoolteachers, or wel
fare workers want no more invest
ment, black businessmen or workers
might want even more American in
vestment which would mean more
jobs.
Positive policy
"A policy of economic develop
ment might be more helpful to the
situation," Duignan said. "An ex
panding economy would demand
more skilled workers than whites
could provide. The percentage of
blacks would therefore increase in
the work force, and in skilled posi
tions."

When asked about student protest
in the United States at campuses
such as Stanford, Duignan replied
that the South Africans "were very
aware of the protests.
"No matter what happens," Duig
nan said, "the whites are determined
to remain. South Africa is unlike the
other former colonial nations in Af
rica which recently have gained in
dependence. The South Africans
consider this their homeland, they
are not like the British or French in
Ghana or Senegal who were willing
to pack up and go home."
The South African government's
crackdown of black organizations
and leaders last Wednesday is part of
a consistent pattern of repression,
according to Peter Duignan, director
of African Studies at the Hoover Insti
tute.
In an interview Friday, Duignan
spoke of heavy governmental rep
ression in urban townships since last
May and June, when students forced
an end to the urban bantu councils in
an effort to repudiate the validity of
the apartheid system.
These areas have had no govern
ment since then except for what the
students and their parents have or
ganized themselves.
Several scores of black leaders have
been arrested and organizations
have been banned in recent months
as part of the continuing crackdown,
Duignan said.
Underground impossible
When asked how effective these
crackdowns were, Duignan said, "It
is almost impossible to form any kind
of underground movement because
they keep arresting the leaders." He
added that arrests reach down to a
very low level; anyone who even
works for a liberal organization is
suspect.
"As a young black leader you
would have to be incredibly brave to
remain in the townships and engage
in any illegal activity," said Duignan.
"The government will not tolerate
any kind of opposition which seems
to be gaining any support."
Last week's crackdown resulted in
part from the recent unrest that has
followed the death of black leader
Steve Biko Sept. 12 in prison. "Biko
was somewhat radical, but he was
opposed to radical violence," said
Duignan.
Biko founded the South African
Students' Organization, banned last
week, and was a leading force be
hind the black consciousness
movement which was also banned.
The black consciousness movement
is somewhat analagous to the black
power movement in the United
States, said Duignan.
Campaign tactic
Duignan also said the timing of the
crackdown is partially explained by
next month's elections in South Af
rica. Only whites are allowed to vote,
and Prime Minister John Vorster is
using this crackdown to impress the
whites that his government is in con
trol of the situation and will not tol
erate any black opposition, added
Duignan.
With the mandate of these elec
tions Vorster hopes "to make sig
nificant changes" in South Africa,
said Duignan. Traditionally no major
changes have been made in South
Africa without such a mandate com
ing first.
The changes Duignan anticipates
include the granting of more political
power to the Indians and coloreds,
the granting of some measure of self
government to the bantu townships,
and changing the South African par
liamentary system to grant the execu
tive more power.
In a way these recent arrests and
bannings are to appease the right
wing that the government is not
going to capitulate to violence.
"The whites are willing to make
changes as long as they can control
the dynamics," said Duignan.
Fewer outbursts
In the future Duignan forsees
more periodic outbursts of violence,
but these would become fewer and
fewer in number as the arrests con
tinued. However, he added that the
underlying tension would remain.

One of those arrested Wednesday
whom Duignan interviewed during a
trip to South Africa last June was
Percy Qoboza, editor of The World,
the country's leading black news
paper.
Qoboza is "a very moderate man,
not a leftist," said Duignan. He
helped set up the Council of Ten to
oversee the affairs of Soweto, which
has been left without government
since its urban council was forced to
disband last spring.
Soweto is a large township of
Johannesburg with 1.2 million black
residents, which in recent years, has
been the scene of large student pro
tests.
When the urban council was dis
banded and the schools closed,
Duignan recalled, David Thebehali,
the mayor of Soweto, was forced to
hop like a frog through the township,
demonstrating the students' displea
sure with any black cooperation with
the government.
Human rights
Bernard Naude was another man
arrested whom Duignan spoke with
last June. Naude had founded the re
cently banned Christian Institute of
South Africa. Duignan described him
as being "not political, not an ac
tivist, but a man concerned with
human rights for all men." Duignan
added that Naude headed a limited
organization.
One of Naude's concerns had
been keeping track of persons ar
rested, because the government
rarely releases any information on
this subject.
"It is very surprising, however,"
said Duignan, "that South Africa has
fewer political prisoners than a coun
try such as Cuba." There are at most a
thousand people in South Africa who
have been "arrested, detained, or
banned, whereas there are four to
five thousand in Cuba."
Detention
People can be detained under sev
eral acts (such as a terrorism act or an
anti-Communism act) and be held up
to 90 days without lawyer or trial.
Being banned is like "being in
limbo," said Duignan. A banned per
son is confined to his home area, not
allowed to publish or be quoted, and
not allowed to meet with more than
two people at one time.
"When South Africa decided to
implement apartheid in 1948 they
didn't know exactly how to go about
it, and, now that they want to go
about dismantling, they're in the
same position," said Duignan.
Left to themselves, Duignan be
lieves, the South African could work
the situation out, but, "it's the exter
nal problem that makes this dif
ficult."
Banned organizations
The three major organizations ap
plying pressure according to Duig
nan are the African National Con
gress, the Pan-African Congress and
the South African Communist Party,
all of which were banned from the
country in 1962.
These organizations are demand
ing a one man-one vote system and a
democratic socialist state for South
Africa. "They have initiated a war of
national liberation against South Af
rica, and they do not appear willing
to compromise with the present re
gime," said Duignan.
When asked about American in

vestment in South Africa Duignan
replied that the South Africans
"could do without us in strictly dol
lars and cents terms."
American investments constitute
about 18 per cent of all foreign in
vestment in South Africa. "But the
United States companies do repre
sent a high technology that the South
Africans need/' Duignan added.
Symbolic effect
"An American withdrawal would
have more of a symbolic impact,"
said Duignan. "It would create the
atmosphere of a government under
siege, and would lead to hesitancy in
the business community."
"The consequences of disinvest
ment are unclear," continued Duig
nan. "It could harm the blacks more
than it could lead to their liberation.
It could harden the whites' attitudes
and make them unwilling to com
promise.
"The whites are better prepared
for austerity." Duignan pointed out
that many black workers rely solely
on their weekly pay checks for
money, that they have no savings or
other resources to support them
selves.
"Divestiture is almost a class issue
among the blacks," Duignan learned
from his trip. While he said black
churchmen, schoolteachers, or wel

Africa. "They have initiated a war of
national liberation against South Af
rica, and they do not appear willing
to compromise with the present re
gime," said Duignan.
When asked about American in

vestment in South Africa Duignan
replied that the South Africans
"could do without us in strictly dol
lars and cents terms."
American investments constitute
about 18 per cent of all foreign in
vestment in South Africa. "But the
United States companies do repre
sent a high technology that the South
Africans need/' Duignan added.
Symbolic effect
"An American withdrawal would
have more of a symbolic impact,"
said Duignan. "It would create the
atmosphere of a government under
siege, and would lead to hesitancy in
the business community."
"The consequences of disinvest
ment are unclear," continued Duig
nan. "It could harm the blacks more
than it could lead to their liberation.
It could harden the whites' attitudes
and make them unwilling to com
promise.
"The whites are better prepared
for austerity." Duignan pointed out
that many black workers rely solely
on their weekly pay checks for
money, that they have no savings or
other resources to support them
selves.
"Divestiture is almost a class issue
among the blacks," Duignan learned
from his trip. While he said black
churchmen, schoolteachers, or wel
fare workers want no more invest
ment, black businessmen or workers
might want even more American in
vestment which would mean more
jobs.
Positive policy
"A policy of economic develop
ment might be more helpful to the
situation," Duignan said. "An ex
panding economy would demand
more skilled workers than whites
could provide. The percentage of
blacks would therefore increase in
the work force, and in skilled posi
tions."

When asked about student protest
in the United States at campuses
such as Stanford, Duignan replied
that the South Africans "were very
aware of the protests.
"No matter what happens," Duig
nan said, "the whites are determined
to remain. South Africa is unlike the
other former colonial nations in Af
rica which recently have gained in
dependence. The South Africans
consider this their homeland, they
are not like the British or French in
Ghana or Senegal who were willing
to pack up and go home."
The South African government's
crackdown of black organizations
and leaders last Wednesday is part of
a consistent pattern of repression,
according to Peter Duignan, director
of African Studies at the Hoover Insti
tute.
In an interview Friday, Duignan
spoke of heavy governmental rep
ression in urban townships since last
May and June, when students forced
an end to the urban bantu councils in
an effort to repudiate the validity of
the apartheid system.
These areas have had no govern
ment since then except for what the
students and their parents have or
ganized themselves.
Several scores of black leaders have
been arrested and organizations
have been banned in recent months
as part of the continuing crackdown,
Duignan said.
Underground impossible
When asked how effective these
crackdowns were, Duignan said, "It
is almost impossible to form any kind
of underground movement because
they keep arresting the leaders." He
added that arrests reach down to a
very low level; anyone who even
works for a liberal organization is
suspect.
"As a young black leader you
would have to be incredibly brave to
remain in the townships and engage
in any illegal activity," said Duignan.
"The government will not tolerate
any kind of opposition which seems
to be gaining any support."
Last week's crackdown resulted in
part from the recent unrest that has
followed the death of black leader
Steve Biko Sept. 12 in prison. "Biko
was somewhat radical, but he was
opposed to radical violence," said
Duignan.
Biko founded the South African
Students' Organization, banned last
week, and was a leading force be
hind the black consciousness
movement which was also banned.
The black consciousness movement
is somewhat analagous to the black
power movement in the United
States, said Duignan.
Campaign tactic
Duignan also said the timing of the
crackdown is partially explained by
next month's elections in South Af
rica. Only whites are allowed to vote,
and Prime Minister John Vorster is
using this crackdown to impress the
whites that his government is in con
trol of the situation and will not tol
erate any black opposition, added
Duignan.
With the mandate of these elec
tions Vorster hopes "to make sig
nificant changes" in South Africa,
said Duignan. Traditionally no major
changes have been made in South
Africa without such a mandate com
ing first.
The changes Duignan anticipates
include the granting of more political
power to the Indians and coloreds,
the granting of some measure of self
government to the bantu townships,
and changing the South African par
liamentary system to grant the execu
tive more power.
In a way these recent arrests and
bannings are to appease the right
wing that the government is not
going to capitulate to violence.
"The whites are willing to make
changes as long as they can control
the dynamics," said Duignan.
Fewer outbursts
In the future Duignan forsees
more periodic outbursts of violence,
but these would become fewer and
fewer in number as the arrests con
tinued. However, he added that the
underlying tension would remain.

One of those arrested Wednesday
whom Duignan interviewed during a
trip to South Africa last June was
Percy Qoboza, editor of The World,
the country's leading black news
paper.
Qoboza is "a very moderate man,
not a leftist," said Duignan. He
helped set up the Council of Ten to
oversee the affairs of Soweto, which
has been left without government
since its urban council was forced to
disband last spring.
Soweto is a large township of
Johannesburg with 1.2 million black
residents, which in recent years, has
been the scene of large student pro
tests.
When the urban council was dis
banded and the schools closed,
Duignan recalled, David Thebehali,
the mayor of Soweto, was forced to
hop like a frog through the township,
demonstrating the students' displea
sure with any black cooperation with
the government.
Human rights
Bernard Naude was another man
arrested whom Duignan spoke with
last June. Naude had founded the re
cently banned Christian Institute of
South Africa. Duignan described him
as being "not political, not an ac
tivist, but a man concerned with
human rights for all men." Duignan
added that Naude headed a limited
organization.
One of Naude's concerns had
been keeping track of persons ar
rested, because the government
rarely releases any information on
this subject.
"It is very surprising, however,"
said Duignan, "that South Africa has
fewer political prisoners than a coun
try such as Cuba." There are at most a
thousand people in South Africa who
have been "arrested, detained, or
banned, whereas there are four to
five thousand in Cuba."
Detention
People can be detained under sev
eral acts (such as a terrorism act or an
anti-Communism act) and be held up
to 90 days without lawyer or trial.
Being banned is like "being in
limbo," said Duignan. A banned per
son is confined to his home area, not
allowed to publish or be quoted, and
not allowed to meet with more than
two people at one time.
"When South Africa decided to
implement apartheid in 1948 they
didn't know exactly how to go about
it, and, now that they want to go
about dismantling, they're in the
same position," said Duignan.
Left to themselves, Duignan be
lieves, the South African could work
the situation out, but, "it's the exter
nal problem that makes this dif
ficult."
Banned organizations
The three major organizations ap
plying pressure according to Duig
nan are the African National Con
gress, the Pan-African Congress and
the South African Communist Party,
all of which were banned from the
country in 1962.
These organizations are demand
ing a one man-one vote system and a
democratic socialist state for South
Africa. "They have initiated a war of
national liberation against South Af
rica, and they do not appear willing
to compromise with the present re

eral acts (such as a terrorism act or an
anti-Communism act) and be held up
to 90 days without lawyer or trial.
Being banned is like "being in
limbo," said Duignan. A banned per
son is confined to his home area, not
allowed to publish or be quoted, and
not allowed to meet with more than
two people at one time.
"When South Africa decided to
implement apartheid in 1948 they
didn't know exactly how to go about
it, and, now that they want to go
about dismantling, they're in the
same position," said Duignan.
Left to themselves, Duignan be
lieves, the South African could work
the situation out, but, "it's the exter
nal problem that makes this dif
ficult."
Banned organizations
The three major organizations ap
plying pressure according to Duig
nan are the African National Con
gress, the Pan-African Congress and
the South African Communist Party,
all of which were banned from the
country in 1962.
These organizations are demand
ing a one man-one vote system and a
democratic socialist state for South
Africa. "They have initiated a war of
national liberation against South Af
rica, and they do not appear willing
to compromise with the present re
gime," said Duignan.
When asked about American in

vestment in South Africa Duignan
replied that the South Africans
"could do without us in strictly dol
lars and cents terms."
American investments constitute
about 18 per cent of all foreign in
vestment in South Africa. "But the
United States companies do repre
sent a high technology that the South
Africans need/' Duignan added.
Symbolic effect
"An American withdrawal would
have more of a symbolic impact,"
said Duignan. "It would create the
atmosphere of a government under
siege, and would lead to hesitancy in
the business community."
"The consequences of disinvest
ment are unclear," continued Duig
nan. "It could harm the blacks more
than it could lead to their liberation.
It could harden the whites' attitudes
and make them unwilling to com
promise.
"The whites are better prepared
for austerity." Duignan pointed out
that many black workers rely solely
on their weekly pay checks for
money, that they have no savings or
other resources to support them
selves.
"Divestiture is almost a class issue
among the blacks," Duignan learned
from his trip. While he said black
churchmen, schoolteachers, or wel
fare workers want no more invest
ment, black businessmen or workers
might want even more American in
vestment which would mean more
jobs.
Positive policy
"A policy of economic develop
ment might be more helpful to the
situation," Duignan said. "An ex
panding economy would demand
more skilled workers than whites
could provide. The percentage of
blacks would therefore increase in
the work force, and in skilled posi
tions."

When asked about student protest
in the United States at campuses
such as Stanford, Duignan replied
that the South Africans "were very
aware of the protests.
"No matter what happens," Duig
nan said, "the whites are determined
to remain. South Africa is unlike the
other former colonial nations in Af
rica which recently have gained in
dependence. The South Africans
consider this their homeland, they
are not like the British or French in
Ghana or Senegal who were willing
to pack up and go home."
The South African government's
crackdown of black organizations
and leaders last Wednesday is part of
a consistent pattern of repression,
according to Peter Duignan, director
of African Studies at the Hoover Insti
tute.
In an interview Friday, Duignan
spoke of heavy governmental rep
ression in urban townships since last
May and June, when students forced
an end to the urban bantu councils in
an effort to repudiate the validity of
the apartheid system.
These areas have had no govern
ment since then except for what the
students and their parents have or
ganized themselves.
Several scores of black leaders have
been arrested and organizations
have been banned in recent months
as part of the continuing crackdown,
Duignan said.
Underground impossible
When asked how effective these
crackdowns were, Duignan said, "It
is almost impossible to form any kind
of underground movement because
they keep arresting the leaders." He
added that arrests reach down to a
very low level; anyone who even
works for a liberal organization is
suspect.
"As a young black leader you
would have to be incredibly brave to
remain in the townships and engage
in any illegal activity," said Duignan.
"The government will not tolerate
any kind of opposition which seems
to be gaining any support."
Last week's crackdown resulted in
part from the recent unrest that has
followed the death of black leader
Steve Biko Sept. 12 in prison. "Biko
was somewhat radical, but he was
opposed to radical violence," said
Duignan.
Biko founded the South African
Students' Organization, banned last
week, and was a leading force be
hind the black consciousness
movement which was also banned.
The black consciousness movement
is somewhat analagous to the black
power movement in the United
States, said Duignan.
Campaign tactic
Duignan also said the timing of the
crackdown is partially explained by
next month's elections in South Af
rica. Only whites are allowed to vote,
and Prime Minister John Vorster is
using this crackdown to impress the
whites that his government is in con
trol of the situation and will not tol
erate any black opposition, added
Duignan.
With the mandate of these elec
tions Vorster hopes "to make sig
nificant changes" in South Africa,
said Duignan. Traditionally no major
changes have been made in South
Africa without such a mandate com
ing first.
The changes Duignan anticipates
include the granting of more political
power to the Indians and coloreds,
the granting of some measure of self
government to the bantu townships,
and changing the South African par
liamentary system to grant the execu
tive more power.
In a way these recent arrests and
bannings are to appease the right
wing that the government is not
going to capitulate to violence.
"The whites are willing to make
changes as long as they can control
the dynamics," said Duignan.
Fewer outbursts
In the future Duignan forsees
more periodic outbursts of violence,
but these would become fewer and
fewer in number as the arrests con
tinued. However, he added that the
underlying tension would remain.

One of those arrested Wednesday
whom Duignan interviewed during a
trip to South Africa last June was
Percy Qoboza, editor of The World,
the country's leading black news
paper.
Qoboza is "a very moderate man,
not a leftist," said Duignan. He
helped set up the Council of Ten to
oversee the affairs of Soweto, which
has been left without government
since its urban council was forced to
disband last spring.
Soweto is a large township of
Johannesburg with 1.2 million black
residents, which in recent years, has
been the scene of large student pro
tests.
When the urban council was dis
banded and the schools closed,
Duignan recalled, David Thebehali,
the mayor of Soweto, was forced to
hop like a frog through the township,
demonstrating the students' displea
sure with any black cooperation with
the government.
Human rights
Bernard Naude was another man
arrested whom Duignan spoke with
last June. Naude had founded the re
cently banned Christian Institute of
South Africa. Duignan described him
as being "not political, not an ac
tivist, but a man concerned with
human rights for all men." Duignan
added that Naude headed a limited
organization.
One of Naude's concerns had
been keeping track of persons ar
rested, because the government
rarely releases any information on
this subject.
"It is very surprising, however,"
said Duignan, "that South Africa has
fewer political prisoners than a coun
try such as Cuba." There are at most a
thousand people in South Africa who
have been "arrested, detained, or
banned, whereas there are four to
five thousand in Cuba."
Detention
People can be detained under sev
eral acts (such as a terrorism act or an
anti-Communism act) and be held up
to 90 days without lawyer or trial.
Being banned is like "being in
limbo," said Duignan. A banned per
