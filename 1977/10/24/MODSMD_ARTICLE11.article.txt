# Political intimidation?
## German 'Berufsverbot': a timely topic 
### 
A German national

The term 'Berufsverbot' means
that, by administrative action, the
person concerned is banned from
doing the job for which he is qual
ified.
This subject is timely because of
the visit to Stanford tomorrow of a
high-ranking official of the Ministry
for Higher Education and Research of
the West German State North
Rhine-Westphalia, Ministerialrat Dr.
Arno Kaiser.
Hundreds of thousands of West
German applicants for civil service
jobs are being subjected to loyalty
checks by political authorities.
Applicants classified as enemies of
the constitution are prevented from
entering the public service.
On January 20, 1972, the "Princi
ples Relating to the Question of Ele
ments in the Public Service Hostile to
the Constitution" were adopted by
the Prime Ministers of thell German
states. Among other things they
state: "An applicant who engaged in
activities hostile to the constitution

will not be employed in the public
service."
The vague term "hostility to the
constitution" is a creation of this
"Radicals Decree," as it is called, and
cannot be found in the German
Grundgesetz, the constitutional
Fundamental Law.
Up to executive
The Federal Constitutional Court
adopted the term and left it largely to
the executive to decide who is an
enemy of the constitution. The
executive, which has never been
cleansed of former Nazis, employs a
wide variety of arbitrary criteria to
determine "hostility to the constitu
tion":
—Membership in constitutional
political parties and organizations
such as the Moscow and Peking
oriented communist parties,
—Support of such organizations
through election appeals or candi
dacy,
—Cooperation in alliances or as
sociations to which communists be
long (members of the ruling Social

Democratic and Free Democratic
Parties have been denied posts in the
public service for this reason),
—Membership in left-wing stu
dent organizations such as the SHB
(League of Social Democratic Uni
versity Students),
—Membership in the national or
ganization of conscientious objec
tors to military services,
—Personal contacts (marriage or
sharing a flat) with people who are
suspected of being enemies of the
constitution,
—Participation in demonstrations
protesting governmental policy,
e.g., its policy on the Vietnam War,
or the practice of 'Berufsverbot.'
Thus this article could be taken to
indicate hostility to the constitution.
Primary aim
The primary aim of the Radicals
Decree is to intimidate leftist political
opposition and especially those
members of the younger generation
who, in the course of a political
struggle on and off campus, attain an
awareness of the need for social
change.
Since well over one half of all
employed graduates from academic
institutions are employed by the
government, the political discrimina
tion established with the Radicals
Decree is a powerful threat. There
are about 3.5 million people, both
blue and white collar workers, in the
public service. Many of them, as
teachers, welfare workers, mailmen,
railway men and grave diggers, have
no alternative in the private labor
market.
The screening of an applicant takes
place as follows: The hiring board
enquires at the appropriate federal
state "Agency for the Protection of
the Constitution" (the Secret Ser
vice) if there are any "findings" avail
able about the applicant which could
justify doubts as to his "loyalty to the
constitution."
If relevant "findings" are available,
the applicant is usually summoned to
a "hearing." There, he has the op
portunity to allay the doubts. The
questions asked in such a hearingare
often concerned with membership
in political organizations, attitudes
towadrd Marxism, towards the con
stitution of the eastern German state,
towards communes, sit-ins, etc. If
the person concerned cannot elimi
nate the doubts as to his "loyalty to
the constitution," his application is
rejected. Not the hearing committee
but the applicant has to provide evi
dence.
When the application is rejected
the applicant can legally appeal the
administrative decision. His chances
in court are about one to two.

Since mid-1976 the democratic
credentials of the federal govern
ment and of the Social Democratic
Party have been questioned by the
social democratic and socialist par
ties of western Europe, especially in
the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark
and France. International and
domestic pressures have led the SDP
leadership to modify their position
on loyalty checks. In consequence,
the federal government adopted in
1976 eight guiding rules according to
which the hiring is to be carried out
under strict observation of liberal
principles (and according to the due
process of law).
Political discrimination
However, the chairwoman of the
Dutch Labor Party was right when
she called this cosmetic operation a
"better procedure" that neverthe
less still constitutes "political dis
crimination." In fact, political dis
crimination has increased by being
extended to jobs not belonging to
the public service. Some examples:
—In Lower Saxony and North
Rhine-Westphalia permission to
teach was withdrawn from teachers
in private schools recognized by the
state because they were members or
sympathizers of the German Com
munist Party.
—In West Berlin the Senate has
ordered the German Boy Scout As
sociation to dismiss one of their full
time staff because he had taken part
in meetings and demonstrations of a
communist group.
—In Lower Saxony the govern
ment authorized the Office for the
Protection of the Constitution to
allow private firms access to their
findings.
—Unions exclude members of
communist organizations and pub
licly identify them.
Academic freedom is the chief vic
tiiti of the political discrimination,
but its effects go beyond universities
and schools to strike at the funda
mental principles of democracy.
It is of utmost importance for the
struggle to defend civil rights in the
Federal Republic of Germany and
West Berlin that international public
opinion take a critical interest in the
question of 'Berufsverbot.' To sup
port German democracy the Ber
trand Russell Foundation is prepar
ingan international tribunal on polit
ical repression and 'Berufsverbot' in
the Federal Republic. (For more in
