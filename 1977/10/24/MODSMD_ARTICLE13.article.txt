# Hell week
## Pledges earn their keep 
### Lois Nesbitt 
Don't be alarmed by the
sudden appearance of a male
student in a gorilla suit some
weekend. He is probably a
fraternity pledge being in
itiated during what is affec
tionately known as "Hell
Week."
As Rob Valdez, president of
the Kappa Alpha (KA) fraternity
put it, "There is still a certain
mystique" about the Hell
Week pledges go through be
fore becoming active mem
bers. Many members prefer to
keep mum about their ac
tivities.
The fraternities that would
disclose information on pledge
initiation basically described
two kinds of organized ac-

tivities. First, there are "con
structive" jobs, such as at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE),
where the pledges come back
one week before classes start
in the fall to fix up the fraternity
house. They typically spend
four to five hours a day paint
ing, varnishing and scouring
the house.
On the lighter side, the
Theta Delta Chis have their
pledges fix them breakfast in
bed during Hell Week.
Another type of initiation rite
is the "fun" type. Scavenger
hunts in the Bay Area are a
Stanford tradition. As Reid Bu
tler, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council put it, this is
the week that "San Francisco is
being ravaged by Stanford."
Last year's Kappa Sigmas had
to produce a photograph of
themselves with stripper Carol
Doda, the illustrious topless
queen of the city.
The Theta Delts had to stand
in the fountain in front of the
Hyatt Regency Hotel and sing
"I Left My Heart in San Fran
cisco." The Delta Upsilons
(DUs) had to cause a traffic
jam.
Pranks
Local activities include a
wide variety of pranks, too.
Zeta Psi sent a naked pledge
through White Plaza wearing
two-foot long shoes.
The Theta Delts were re
quired to produce a number of
girls for a six o'clock breakfast.
The DU pledges traditionally
put on a lewd play at Tresidder.
This year's theme was, inno
cently enough, "The Wizard of
Oz." Several frats stage trivia
question and answer periods
involving chugging beer at
every missed question.
Pledges have also been
known to seek revenge on the
actives during Hell Week. The
DUs brought a Palo Alto fire
engine, sirens and all, onto
campus at an inopportune
hour. But according to Chris
Grell, a Kappa Sig, these ac
tivities are kept to a minimum
because the actives "usually
get them back anyway."
Despite the hassles, obnoxi
ous nicknames and embarras
sing situations, most frat men
look back goodnaturedly at
their Hell Weeks. It is a chance
to catch the fraternity spirit —
to get to be part of the group.
Valdez said he "never had
more fun in one week." And

Butler sees it as a time for
"the pledges to get together
and get to know each other,"
because in the frats you've
"got to start it out right."
These activities are a far cry
from the more violent initia
tion rites called "hazing" that
happen at some institutions.
John Davies, a student at the
University of Nevada at Reno,
died after his fraternity, the
Sundowners, forced him to
drink alcohol, whiskey, vodka
and gin for more than 24 hours.
Nineteerf-year-old Thomas
Fitzgerald, a junior at Queens
College, was fatally stabbed in
the heart during a mock-POW
interrogation staged as part of
his initiation into the school's
R.O.T.C. Pershing Rifles
fraternity. #
A pledge at the Monmouth
College chapter of Zeta Beta
Tau suffocated in a self-dug
"grave" on a rainy beach.
These are true accounts from
a Time magazine article circu
lated to Stanford's fraternity
presidents this fall. They are
examples of "hazing" which
had gotten out of hand.
'State Law
California state law, which
prohibits such activities, de
fines hazing as "any method of
initiation into a student organi
zation or any pastime or
amusement engaged in with
respect to such organization
which causes or is likely to
cause bodily danger or physi
cal harm to any student or
other educational institution in
this State."
In practice, hazing refers to
the more sadistic
aspects of fraternity initiation
rites. The initiation marks the
change in status from pledge
(or chosen candidate) to active
fraternity member. The ques
tion of whether or not hazing
occurs at Stanford elicits a mix
ture of responses.
First, hazing is illegal. Sec
ond, initiation rituals are tradi
tionally kept secret in many
fraternities. A third reason is
that most accounts of hazing
are rumors and hearsay, pas
sed among friends over beers.
Thing of past
The general consensus of
the fraternity men was that haz
ing here is a thing of the past in
many respects. Although the
more traditional, Southern
fraternities perpetuate the ac
tivities, most men here felt that

hazing is dead or dying at
fraternities.
Mike Cresto, president of
Kappa Sigma, said his fraternity
believes in "respecting their
(the pledges') rights" and av
oids "imposing embarrass
ment or undue pressure" on
the pledges.
He also mentioned that most
fraternities are on the rise
again since the 19605, and are
likely to be "extremely careful
about any precedents and trad
itions revived now."
Several men said they felt
students here would not toler
ate hazing and that rumors of
hazing activities could nega
tively affect the number of rush
candidates each year.
Reputation
For the administration, haz
ing is an issue which involves
both the reputation of the
school, and Stanford's eligibil
ity for certain state funds. The
housing office distributes
copies of the hazing law to
fraternity presidents each year.
But Tom Hornbeak, assistant
director for the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, does not
see hazing as a problem here.
He feels that the fraternity
members, and Stanford stu
dents in general, have a "de
cent level of respect for other
people," and that they would
not want to be involved in ac
tivities where others were "to
be coerced into doing some
thing."
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs, cited
the fact that the fraternities are
only one of a variety of student
housing options, so no one is
forced to join a frat just to get
housing. This is a problem at
several state schools, such as
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Hesitant to intervene
He also stressed the fact that
since the fraternities are on
campus, the school must as
sume greater responsibility for
their activities.
In reference to the recent
accusations that several Ber
keley frats were involved in
anti-semitic pranks, Robinson
said, "We don't want to be in
that position."
But apparently the administ
ration is hesitant to intervene
in supervising frat initiations.
Both deans did not say specifi
cally what actually goes on at
frat initiations here.

actives during Hell Week. The

Grell, a Kappa Sig, these ac
tivities are kept to a minimum
because the actives "usually
get them back anyway."

look back goodnaturedly at

"grave" on a rainy beach.
These are true accounts from
a Time magazine article circu
lated to Stanford's fraternity
presidents this fall. They are
examples of "hazing" which
had gotten out of hand.
'State Law
California state law, which
prohibits such activities, de
fines hazing as "any method of
initiation into a student organi
zation or any pastime or
amusement engaged in with
respect to such organization
which causes or is likely to
cause bodily danger or physi
cal harm to any student or
other educational institution in
this State."
In practice, hazing refers to
the more sadistic
aspects of fraternity initiation
rites. The initiation marks the
change in status from pledge
(or chosen candidate) to active
fraternity member. The ques
tion of whether or not hazing
occurs at Stanford elicits a mix
ture of responses.
First, hazing is illegal. Sec
ond, initiation rituals are tradi
tionally kept secret in many
fraternities. A third reason is
that most accounts of hazing
are rumors and hearsay, pas
sed among friends over beers.
Thing of past
The general consensus of
the fraternity men was that haz
ing here is a thing of the past in
many respects. Although the
more traditional, Southern
fraternities perpetuate the ac
tivities, most men here felt that

hazing is dead or dying at
fraternities.
Mike Cresto, president of
Kappa Sigma, said his fraternity
believes in "respecting their
(the pledges') rights" and av
oids "imposing embarrass
ment or undue pressure" on
the pledges.
He also mentioned that most
fraternities are on the rise
again since the 19605, and are
likely to be "extremely careful
about any precedents and trad
itions revived now."
Several men said they felt
students here would not toler
ate hazing and that rumors of
hazing activities could nega
tively affect the number of rush
candidates each year.
Reputation
For the administration, haz
ing is an issue which involves
both the reputation of the
school, and Stanford's eligibil
ity for certain state funds. The
housing office distributes
copies of the hazing law to
fraternity presidents each year.
But Tom Hornbeak, assistant
director for the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, does not
see hazing as a problem here.
He feels that the fraternity
members, and Stanford stu
dents in general, have a "de
cent level of respect for other
people," and that they would
not want to be involved in ac
tivities where others were "to
be coerced into doing some
thing."
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs, cited
the fact that the fraternities are
only one of a variety of student
housing options, so no one is
forced to join a frat just to get
housing. This is a problem at
several state schools, such as
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Hesitant to intervene
He also stressed the fact that
since the fraternities are on
campus, the school must as
sume greater responsibility for
their activities.
In reference to the recent
accusations that several Ber
keley frats were involved in
anti-semitic pranks, Robinson
said, "We don't want to be in
that position."
But apparently the administ
ration is hesitant to intervene
in supervising frat initiations.
Both deans did not say specifi
cally what actually goes on at
frat initiations here.


Delta Upsilon members stage "The Wizard of Oz" at Tresidder — one of many tyypes of activities in
which pledges participate before becoming full-fledged "actives."
Don't be alarmed by the
sudden appearance of a male
student in a gorilla suit some
weekend. He is probably a
fraternity pledge being in
itiated during what is affec
tionately known as "Hell
Week."
As Rob Valdez, president of
the Kappa Alpha (KA) fraternity
put it, "There is still a certain
mystique" about the Hell
Week pledges go through be
fore becoming active mem
bers. Many members prefer to
keep mum about their ac
tivities.
The fraternities that would
disclose information on pledge
initiation basically described
two kinds of organized ac-

tivities. First, there are "con
structive" jobs, such as at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE),
where the pledges come back
one week before classes start
in the fall to fix up the fraternity
house. They typically spend
four to five hours a day paint
ing, varnishing and scouring
the house.
On the lighter side, the
Theta Delta Chis have their
pledges fix them breakfast in
bed during Hell Week.
Another type of initiation rite
is the "fun" type. Scavenger
hunts in the Bay Area are a
Stanford tradition. As Reid Bu
tler, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council put it, this is
the week that "San Francisco is
being ravaged by Stanford."
Last year's Kappa Sigmas had
to produce a photograph of
themselves with stripper Carol
Doda, the illustrious topless
queen of the city.
The Theta Delts had to stand
in the fountain in front of the
Hyatt Regency Hotel and sing
"I Left My Heart in San Fran
cisco." The Delta Upsilons
(DUs) had to cause a traffic
jam.
Pranks
Local activities include a
wide variety of pranks, too.
Zeta Psi sent a naked pledge
through White Plaza wearing
two-foot long shoes.
The Theta Delts were re
quired to produce a number of
girls for a six o'clock breakfast.
The DU pledges traditionally
put on a lewd play at Tresidder.
This year's theme was, inno
cently enough, "The Wizard of
Oz." Several frats stage trivia
question and answer periods
involving chugging beer at
every missed question.

occurs at Stanford elicits a mix
ture of responses.
First, hazing is illegal. Sec
ond, initiation rituals are tradi
tionally kept secret in many
fraternities. A third reason is
that most accounts of hazing
are rumors and hearsay, pas
sed among friends over beers.
Thing of past
The general consensus of
the fraternity men was that haz
ing here is a thing of the past in
many respects. Although the
more traditional, Southern
fraternities perpetuate the ac
tivities, most men here felt that

hazing is dead or dying at
fraternities.
Mike Cresto, president of
Kappa Sigma, said his fraternity
believes in "respecting their
(the pledges') rights" and av
oids "imposing embarrass
ment or undue pressure" on
the pledges.
He also mentioned that most
fraternities are on the rise
again since the 19605, and are
likely to be "extremely careful
about any precedents and trad
itions revived now."
Several men said they felt
students here would not toler
ate hazing and that rumors of
hazing activities could nega
tively affect the number of rush
candidates each year.
Reputation
For the administration, haz
ing is an issue which involves
both the reputation of the
school, and Stanford's eligibil
ity for certain state funds. The
housing office distributes
copies of the hazing law to
fraternity presidents each year.
But Tom Hornbeak, assistant
director for the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, does not
see hazing as a problem here.
He feels that the fraternity
members, and Stanford stu
dents in general, have a "de
cent level of respect for other
people," and that they would
not want to be involved in ac
tivities where others were "to
be coerced into doing some
thing."
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs, cited
the fact that the fraternities are
only one of a variety of student
housing options, so no one is
forced to join a frat just to get
housing. This is a problem at
several state schools, such as
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Hesitant to intervene
He also stressed the fact that
since the fraternities are on
campus, the school must as
sume greater responsibility for
their activities.
In reference to the recent
accusations that several Ber
keley frats were involved in
anti-semitic pranks, Robinson
said, "We don't want to be in
that position."
But apparently the administ
ration is hesitant to intervene
in supervising frat initiations.
Both deans did not say specifi
cally what actually goes on at
frat initiations here.


Delta Upsilon members stage "The Wizard of Oz" at Tresidder — one of many tyypes of activities in
which pledges participate before becoming full-fledged "actives."
Don't be alarmed by the
sudden appearance of a male
student in a gorilla suit some
weekend. He is probably a
fraternity pledge being in
itiated during what is affec
tionately known as "Hell
Week."
As Rob Valdez, president of
the Kappa Alpha (KA) fraternity
put it, "There is still a certain
mystique" about the Hell
Week pledges go through be
fore becoming active mem
bers. Many members prefer to
keep mum about their ac
tivities.
The fraternities that would
disclose information on pledge
initiation basically described
two kinds of organized ac-

tivities. First, there are "con
structive" jobs, such as at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE),
where the pledges come back
one week before classes start
in the fall to fix up the fraternity
house. They typically spend
four to five hours a day paint
ing, varnishing and scouring
the house.
On the lighter side, the
Theta Delta Chis have their
pledges fix them breakfast in
bed during Hell Week.
Another type of initiation rite
is the "fun" type. Scavenger
hunts in the Bay Area are a
Stanford tradition. As Reid Bu
tler, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council put it, this is
the week that "San Francisco is
being ravaged by Stanford."
Last year's Kappa Sigmas had
to produce a photograph of
themselves with stripper Carol
Doda, the illustrious topless
queen of the city.
The Theta Delts had to stand
in the fountain in front of the
Hyatt Regency Hotel and sing
"I Left My Heart in San Fran
cisco." The Delta Upsilons
(DUs) had to cause a traffic
jam.
Pranks
Local activities include a
wide variety of pranks, too.
Zeta Psi sent a naked pledge
through White Plaza wearing
two-foot long shoes.
The Theta Delts were re
quired to produce a number of
girls for a six o'clock breakfast.
The DU pledges traditionally
put on a lewd play at Tresidder.
This year's theme was, inno
cently enough, "The Wizard of
Oz." Several frats stage trivia
question and answer periods
involving chugging beer at
every missed question.
Pledges have also been
known to seek revenge on the
actives during Hell Week. The
DUs brought a Palo Alto fire
engine, sirens and all, onto
campus at an inopportune
hour. But according to Chris
Grell, a Kappa Sig, these ac
tivities are kept to a minimum
because the actives "usually
get them back anyway."
Despite the hassles, obnoxi
ous nicknames and embarras
sing situations, most frat men
look back goodnaturedly at
their Hell Weeks. It is a chance
to catch the fraternity spirit —
to get to be part of the group.
Valdez said he "never had
more fun in one week." And

Butler sees it as a time for
"the pledges to get together
and get to know each other,"
because in the frats you've
"got to start it out right."
These activities are a far cry
from the more violent initia
tion rites called "hazing" that
happen at some institutions.
John Davies, a student at the
University of Nevada at Reno,
died after his fraternity, the
Sundowners, forced him to
drink alcohol, whiskey, vodka
and gin for more than 24 hours.

Fitzgerald, a junior at Queens
College, was fatally stabbed in
the heart during a mock-POW

fraternity. #

"grave" on a rainy beach.
These are true accounts from

lated to Stanford's fraternity

examples of "hazing" which
had gotten out of hand.
'State Law
California state law, which
prohibits such activities, de
fines hazing as "any method of
initiation into a student organi
zation or any pastime or
amusement engaged in with
respect to such organization
which causes or is likely to
cause bodily danger or physi
cal harm to any student or
other educational institution in
this State."
In practice, hazing refers to
the more sadistic
aspects of fraternity initiation
rites. The initiation marks the
change in status from pledge

fraternity member. The ques

In reference to the recent
accusations that several Ber
keley frats were involved in
anti-semitic pranks, Robinson
said, "We don't want to be in
that position."
But apparently the administ
ration is hesitant to intervene
in supervising frat initiations.
Both deans did not say specifi
cally what actually goes on at
frat initiations here.


Delta Upsilon members stage "The Wizard of Oz" at Tresidder — one of many tyypes of activities in
which pledges participate before becoming full-fledged "actives."
Don't be alarmed by the
sudden appearance of a male
student in a gorilla suit some
weekend. He is probably a
fraternity pledge being in
itiated during what is affec
tionately known as "Hell
Week."
As Rob Valdez, president of
the Kappa Alpha (KA) fraternity
put it, "There is still a certain
mystique" about the Hell
Week pledges go through be
fore becoming active mem
bers. Many members prefer to
keep mum about their ac
tivities.
The fraternities that would
disclose information on pledge
initiation basically described
two kinds of organized ac-

tivities. First, there are "con
structive" jobs, such as at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE),
where the pledges come back
one week before classes start
in the fall to fix up the fraternity
house. They typically spend
four to five hours a day paint
ing, varnishing and scouring
the house.
On the lighter side, the
Theta Delta Chis have their
pledges fix them breakfast in
bed during Hell Week.
Another type of initiation rite
is the "fun" type. Scavenger
hunts in the Bay Area are a
Stanford tradition. As Reid Bu
tler, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council put it, this is
the week that "San Francisco is
being ravaged by Stanford."
Last year's Kappa Sigmas had
to produce a photograph of
themselves with stripper Carol
Doda, the illustrious topless
queen of the city.
The Theta Delts had to stand
in the fountain in front of the
Hyatt Regency Hotel and sing
"I Left My Heart in San Fran
cisco." The Delta Upsilons
(DUs) had to cause a traffic
jam.
Pranks
Local activities include a
wide variety of pranks, too.
Zeta Psi sent a naked pledge
through White Plaza wearing
two-foot long shoes.
The Theta Delts were re
quired to produce a number of
girls for a six o'clock breakfast.
The DU pledges traditionally
put on a lewd play at Tresidder.
This year's theme was, inno
cently enough, "The Wizard of
Oz." Several frats stage trivia
question and answer periods
involving chugging beer at
every missed question.
Pledges have also been
known to seek revenge on the
actives during Hell Week. The
DUs brought a Palo Alto fire
engine, sirens and all, onto
campus at an inopportune
hour. But according to Chris
Grell, a Kappa Sig, these ac
tivities are kept to a minimum
because the actives "usually
get them back anyway."
Despite the hassles, obnoxi
ous nicknames and embarras
sing situations, most frat men
look back goodnaturedly at
their Hell Weeks. It is a chance
to catch the fraternity spirit —
to get to be part of the group.
Valdez said he "never had
more fun in one week." And

Butler sees it as a time for
"the pledges to get together
and get to know each other,"
because in the frats you've
"got to start it out right."
These activities are a far cry
from the more violent initia
tion rites called "hazing" that
happen at some institutions.
John Davies, a student at the
University of Nevada at Reno,
died after his fraternity, the
Sundowners, forced him to
drink alcohol, whiskey, vodka
and gin for more than 24 hours.
Nineteerf-year-old Thomas
Fitzgerald, a junior at Queens
College, was fatally stabbed in
the heart during a mock-POW
interrogation staged as part of
his initiation into the school's
R.O.T.C. Pershing Rifles
fraternity. #
A pledge at the Monmouth
College chapter of Zeta Beta
Tau suffocated in a self-dug
"grave" on a rainy beach.
These are true accounts from
a Time magazine article circu
lated to Stanford's fraternity
presidents this fall. They are
examples of "hazing" which
had gotten out of hand.
'State Law
California state law, which
prohibits such activities, de
fines hazing as "any method of
initiation into a student organi
zation or any pastime or
amusement engaged in with
respect to such organization
which causes or is likely to
cause bodily danger or physi
cal harm to any student or
other educational institution in
this State."
In practice, hazing refers to
the more sadistic
aspects of fraternity initiation
rites. The initiation marks the
change in status from pledge
(or chosen candidate) to active
fraternity member. The ques
tion of whether or not hazing
occurs at Stanford elicits a mix
ture of responses.
First, hazing is illegal. Sec
ond, initiation rituals are tradi
tionally kept secret in many
fraternities. A third reason is
that most accounts of hazing
are rumors and hearsay, pas
sed among friends over beers.
Thing of past
The general consensus of
the fraternity men was that haz
ing here is a thing of the past in
many respects. Although the
more traditional, Southern
fraternities perpetuate the ac
tivities, most men here felt that

hazing is dead or dying at
fraternities.
Mike Cresto, president of
Kappa Sigma, said his fraternity
believes in "respecting their
(the pledges') rights" and av
oids "imposing embarrass
ment or undue pressure" on
the pledges.
He also mentioned that most
fraternities are on the rise
again since the 19605, and are
likely to be "extremely careful
about any precedents and trad
itions revived now."
Several men said they felt
students here would not toler
ate hazing and that rumors of
hazing activities could nega
tively affect the number of rush
candidates each year.
Reputation
For the administration, haz
ing is an issue which involves
both the reputation of the
school, and Stanford's eligibil
ity for certain state funds. The
housing office distributes
copies of the hazing law to
fraternity presidents each year.
But Tom Hornbeak, assistant
director for the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, does not
see hazing as a problem here.
He feels that the fraternity
members, and Stanford stu
dents in general, have a "de
cent level of respect for other
people," and that they would
not want to be involved in ac
tivities where others were "to
be coerced into doing some
thing."
Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs, cited
the fact that the fraternities are
only one of a variety of student
housing options, so no one is
forced to join a frat just to get
housing. This is a problem at
several state schools, such as
the University of California at
Berkeley.
Hesitant to intervene
He also stressed the fact that
since the fraternities are on
campus, the school must as
sume greater responsibility for
their activities.
In reference to the recent
accusations that several Ber
keley frats were involved in
anti-semitic pranks, Robinson
said, "We don't want to be in
that position."
But apparently the administ
ration is hesitant to intervene
in supervising frat initiations.
