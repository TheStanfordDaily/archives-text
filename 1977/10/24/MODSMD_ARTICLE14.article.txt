# Women's Week explores variety of issues
## 
### 
ERA and legislation
"Do not relax now. The op
position is getting smarter
every day."
Although speaking on a vari
ety of topics including the ERA,
sterilization and abortion, this
was the primary message of
Lynne Yates-Carter, Esther
Talaveras and Pat Potter who
spoke Thursday at Tresidder.
The workshop, titled "ERA
and Legislation," was one of
many organized for Women's
Week activities.
Yates-Carter, a feminist at
torney, gave, a brief history of
the Equal Rights Amendment,
first introduced in 1923, and
explained why people react so
strongly to it today.
A few of the misconceptions
about the ERA are that men
would no longer support their
families, women and men
would share public bathrooms
and women would be forced to
do heavy labor, said Yates-
Carter.
The actual content of the
amendment is simple, she
said. "It speaks to discrimina
tion by states, by state agencies
and by the federal govern
ment."
The deadline for ratification
of the ERA by 38 states is
March, 1979.
Active phone and letter
campaigns are necessary,
either to extend the deadline,

or to pass the amendment in
the three remaining states
needed for ratification, said
Vates-Carter.
Talaveras is working with a
special project on sterilization
abuse in cooperation with the
Coalition for the Medical
Rights of Women.
According to Talaveras, doc
tors often perform steriliza
tions without properly inform
ing the patient of the consequ
ences of the operation.
Pat Potter, an administrator
at the Women's Community
Clinic in San Jose, warned that
abortion rights are still far from
certain.
Since 1967, when a law was
passed allowing abortion for
women who could prove that
pregnancy would be
psychologically damaging,
abortions had gradually be
come easier to obtain, said Pot
ter.
But as the pro-abortion cam
paign relaxed, anti-abortion
groups worked to pass new
legislation, Potter said.
"They didn't go away and
they started getting smarter,"
she said.
There are now 22 states
which have passed bills ending
the use of federal and state
money for abortions, and a
similar bill has been drafted in
California, she said.
According to these three
women, supporters of these is
sues must make their opinions

known; to legislators, to
members of Congress and to
the general public.
"Politics is the name of the
game," said Talaveras. "That's
where it's at."

Women and orgasm
Breasts and buttocks flashed
by on the screen. A lone male
wandered in, sat down with
evident interest and hastily left
when he realized this was no
blue movie.
The open display of female
anatomy was, in fact, the pre
lude to a serious discussion on
women and orgasm in a Wo
men's Week workshop last
Thursday.
Four men and about 120
women, mostly students, first
saw a film on the subject:
"Women and Orgasm — Out
in the Open." Discussion fol
lowed, led by Rae Larsen, co
founder of the Seattle Institute
for Sex Training, Education and
Research (SISTER).
Be patient, keep practicing,
and you'll become orgasmic,
advised the woman
psychologist in the film. She
works at a center in Berkeley
which seeks to make women
orgasmic by teaching them
simple techniques of mastur
bation.
The film subjects also gave
advice on achieving sexual
satisfaction.

"To have an orgasm you re
ally have to lose control. Be
animal and don't worry what
the other person's thinking,"
said one woman who learned
to loosen up after discussing
her problems with the Ber
keley psychologist.
Letting your partner know
what you like, she said, is
another vital step in getting
what you want — and need.
It's a woman's right, but also
her own responsibility, to have
an orgasm, continued another.
"Forget that 'right' kind of
orgasm. There is no wrong
kind," urged another woman
bluntly.
Despite the title of the film,
coming "out in the open" with
the intimate details of your sex
life when sitting in a brightly-lit
room with 120 others can be
difficult.
Women's Week leaders
hope therefore to establish
small discussion groups on a
regular basis. A start was made
at the rap session following the
second showing of the film.
"Don't sit forever in discus
sion groups, however,"
warned Larsen. "Get out and
find the way your body lives
with you."
Remember, too, that having
an orgasm isn't all there is to
sex. Feeling warm and loving
with another person is impor
tant, a memberof the audience
pointed out.
Loving, one would suspect,

is the key to a satisfactorily or
gasmic sex life.

Raven on O'Keefe
"I think I first saw Georgia
O'Keefe's paintings on the
calendars in gas stations. I
grew up in Colorado and I
guess they liked the skulls,"
one woman told Arlene Raven,
an art historian and critic, who
talked about O'Keefe to an au
dience of about 100 people
Wednesday.
Her lecture at the Terman
Building was one of the Wed
nesday Noon Lecture Series
sponsored by the Center for
Research on Women.
The creative work of women
can help "heal a wound that is
centuries and centuries old,"
said Raven. She explained that
women have been denied a
female perspective on their
lives.
In art, women have not been
"the creators of the vision, but
part of the vision," said Raven.
Her lecture demonstrated that
O'Keefe is one female artist
who succeeded in painting a
female perspective.
O'Keefe has not had the
greatest exposure, but the
popularity of herwork has con
tinued to grow and at age 90,
O'Keefe has finally gained rec
ognition as a great American
artist, said Raven.
Artists always alter what they

see, said Raven. She compared
slides of paintings by O'Keefe
and some of her male contem
poraries to show the differ
ences in treatment of the same
topic.
Raven said the American
landscape has been a favorite
topic of American artists. She
added that men's work por
trayed the earth as fertile, cha
otic and female. When man
applies order and civilization,
the earth returns her riches,
Raven said.
In O'Keefe's landscapes,
Raven pointed out that the
skins on the hills become
smooth and the hills take on a
human shape. They become
"the hills that have endured,
the women who have en
dured," said Raven.
Raven showed several of
O'Keefe's paintings in which a
small object is enlarged and
placed at eye level. Raven said
the paintings invited the vie
wer to stop and look at what
usually went unseen. Raven
said these paintings are sym
bolic of bringing attention to
women's works that have been
previously ignored.
Raven also talked about the
sexual imagery in O'Keefe's
work. She said she thought it
was important to discuss sexu
ality in the art of men and
women in order to
"humani/e" the artist's work.
After working in New York
early in the century, O'Keefe

moved to New Mexico where
she has maintained an isolation
which Raven claims was neces
sary for her survival. Her self
isolation is similar to the isola
tion of a single object in her
work, Raven said.
O'Keefe's work had been
trivialized and misinterpreted
by male critics who would not
recognize that her work was
based on experiences different
from their own, according to
Raven.
Raven said she thought
O'Keefe had been hurt by the
rejection of her work.
She added that O'Keefe was
still bitter about any effort to
explain her work. When Raven
went to interview her, O'Keefe
greeted her by saying, "Are
you going to mutilate my
work?"
Raven told the audience the
purpose of art criticism is to
add to the work and not to de
fine it.
Raven has been active in
helping women artists. She
teaches at the Feminist Studio
Workshop which she helped to
start.
She also was a founder of the
Center for Feminist Art and the
Woman's Building in Los
Angeles.
Raven is an editor of
"Chrysalis," a magazine of
woman's culture and has pub
lished articles on women's art
and feminist education.
