# Stanford edges WSU, 31-29
## Cards win aerial showdown 
### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford found the best way
to defense Washington State's
stellar quarterback Jack
Thompson — don't let him
have the ball.
Using a balanced offense,
the Cardinals dominated pos
session of the football on the
way to a 31-29 victory over the
Cougars Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
Stanford ran 93 plays to
WSU's 58 while amassing 575
yards total offense.
"We thought we had a good
enough offense to control the
tempo," Card wide receiver
Bill Kellar said. "Time and time
again we ground it out taking
seven or eight minutes a drive.
We felt the more we could be
on the field, the better off we'd
be."
"The key was to get the run
ning game going and the pas
sing game just followed," Kel
lar added.
"For our offense to function
we have to run — we passed
last week and lost (45-21 to
Washington)," Stanford quar
terback Guy Benjamin said.
This week Stanford ran and
Benjamin passed on the way to
the Cards' third conference
win against one loss. Stanford
is 5-2 overall.
Offensive line excels
"We controlled the ball ex
tremely well," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "Our offensive
line blocked well and our
fullbacks ran well."
The offensive line, after a
poor game in Seattle the week
before, blasted big holes
Saturday for halfback Darrin
Nelson and fullbacks John Fin
ley and Phil Francis.
Nelson gained 104 yards
against the Cougars and re
turned a 67-yard Gavin Hedrick
punt 72 yards before having 28
yards of it brought back on a
clipping penalty.
Finley rushed for 71 yards in
an outstanding effort while
Francis ran for 67 yards and
caught eight passes for another
70 yards.
In all, Stanford's ground
game garnered 245 yards and
gave Thompson and the WSU
offense little time with the
pigskin.
Despite Stanford's offensive
control, Thompson was able to

keep the Cougars within strik
ing distance throughout the
game.
Cards take lead
Tied at halftime, 14-14, Stan
ford jumped ahead in the third
quarter on a 28-yard field goal
by Ken Naber.
The teams then traded
touchdowns on four consecu
tive possessions with Stanford
remaining ahead, 31-29.
The Cardinals appeared
headed for another
touchdown as Benjamin led
Stanford from its own 34 to the
Cougar 3-yard line. With
third-and-goal the preseason
All-American threw a pass to
Nelson that looked anything
but All-America. Cougar safety
Ron Schwartz stepped in front
of Nelson and hijacked the
pass at the goal line.
"We told the quarterback to
throw for the touchdown if the
receiver was open," said
Walsh. "Otherwise we wanted
him to run upfield and we'd
take the field goal. Guy proba
bly won't do that again if he
plays 10 years in the NFL."
Asleep at the wheel?
"I must have gone asleep or
something," Benjamin said. "It
was an absurd throw."
Schwartz ran the pirated
Benjamin aerial back to the
Cougar 18. After a 6-yard com
pletion from Thompson to
halfback Harold Cillum,
Thompson came back to Cil
lum with a give over right
guard.
Gillum picked up threeyards
before he was met by weak
side linebacker Ray Cardinally
who tacked the Cougar
halfback and jarred the ball
from Gillum's hands. Defen
sive end Chuck Evans curled
around the loose ball, squelch
ing any Washington State
hopes of a last-minute win.
"The fumble killed us at the
end," said first-year WSU
coach Warren Powers. "We
did have some time left but you
haven't got a chance if you
don't have the football."
Using the clock
Benjamin kept the ball on
the ground, forcing the
Cougars to use their remaining
timeouts. With fourth-and
three and 1:40 left, Stanford
chose to go for a field goal from
the WSU 20. Naber's kick

pierced the uprights but
Washington State was called
for offsides. The Cards elected
to retain the ball rather than
the three points.
Four plays later Naber mis
sed on a 32-yard attempt but
Stanford had eaten up all but
six seconds of the time remain
ing. A desperation heave by
Thompson was intercepted by
wide receiver James Lofton,
who had been put into the
game for the deep prevent de
fense.
"What disturbed me was that
Stanford was able to run the
ball in the fourth quarter and
kill the clock," Powers said in
his post-game analysis.
Part of Stanford's intent in
running the ball was to aid the
effectiveness of the passing at
tack, part was to keep the ball
away from Thompson.
Cougars rebound
After Stanford grabbed a
10-point advantage in the third
quarter, Thompson came back
and found flanker Brian Kelly in
the end zone with a 5-yard toss
on the third play of the final
period.
Before a home crowd of
47,500, Benjamin brought Stan
ford 73 yards in 10 plays, the
last one a 12-yard bullet to Lof
ton. It was his second TD catch
of the afternoon and his ninth
of the season, tying the Stan
ford single season touchdown
reception mark set by Eric
Cross in 1972.
"Lofton is just a great foot
ball player," Walsh said. "He's
the greatest receiver I've ever
been associated with and I

worked with five Pro Bowl re
ceivers in the NFL."
Throwing short over the
middle and to the flats,
Thompson directed the
Cougars to another score.
"We score when we have
to," Thompson said after the
game. "We have to concen
trate more and score when we
don't have to."
Aerial circus
The long-awaited showdown
between the West Coast's top
collegiate quarterbacks pro
vided all the expected aerial
fireworks.
"I thought both quarter
backs put on one heck of a
show," Powers said.
"I'm sure glad we don't have
to play Thompson again this
year," Walsh said.
Stanford shuffled its defen
sive secopdary Saturday with
cornerback Rick Parker and
safety Robby Chapman getting
their first starts. Thompson
showed the pair as much as
they'll see from any quarter
back this season.
The WSU junior completed
19 of 24 passes for 274 yards,
one touchdown and one inter
ception.
Benjamin connected on 27 of
39 passes for 330 yards, three
touchdowns and one intercep
tion.
"You can't read where he
(Thompson) is throwing the
ball," said Stanford middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino.
"He showed me more than I
thought I'd see.
"The only guy better is the
one we see in practice."

Stanford ran 93 plays to
WSU's 58 while amassing 575
yards total offense.
"We thought we had a good
enough offense to control the
tempo," Card wide receiver
Bill Kellar said. "Time and time
again we ground it out taking
seven or eight minutes a drive.
We felt the more we could be
on the field, the better off we'd
be."
"The key was to get the run
ning game going and the pas
sing game just followed," Kel
lar added.
"For our offense to function
we have to run — we passed
last week and lost (45-21 to
Washington)," Stanford quar
terback Guy Benjamin said.
This week Stanford ran and
Benjamin passed on the way to
the Cards' third conference
win against one loss. Stanford
is 5-2 overall.
Offensive line excels
"We controlled the ball ex
tremely well," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "Our offensive
line blocked well and our
fullbacks ran well."
The offensive line, after a
poor game in Seattle the week
before, blasted big holes
Saturday for halfback Darrin
Nelson and fullbacks John Fin
ley and Phil Francis.
Nelson gained 104 yards
against the Cougars and re
turned a 67-yard Gavin Hedrick
punt 72 yards before having 28
yards of it brought back on a
clipping penalty.
Finley rushed for 71 yards in
an outstanding effort while
Francis ran for 67 yards and
caught eight passes for another
70 yards.
In all, Stanford's ground
game garnered 245 yards and
gave Thompson and the WSU
offense little time with the
pigskin.
Despite Stanford's offensive
control, Thompson was able to

keep the Cougars within strik
ing distance throughout the
game.
Cards take lead
Tied at halftime, 14-14, Stan
ford jumped ahead in the third
quarter on a 28-yard field goal
by Ken Naber.
The teams then traded
touchdowns on four consecu
tive possessions with Stanford
remaining ahead, 31-29.
The Cardinals appeared
headed for another
touchdown as Benjamin led
Stanford from its own 34 to the
Cougar 3-yard line. With
third-and-goal the preseason
All-American threw a pass to
Nelson that looked anything
but All-America. Cougar safety
Ron Schwartz stepped in front
of Nelson and hijacked the
pass at the goal line.
"We told the quarterback to
throw for the touchdown if the
receiver was open," said
Walsh. "Otherwise we wanted
him to run upfield and we'd
take the field goal. Guy proba
bly won't do that again if he
plays 10 years in the NFL."
Asleep at the wheel?
"I must have gone asleep or
something," Benjamin said. "It
was an absurd throw."
Schwartz ran the pirated
Benjamin aerial back to the
Cougar 18. After a 6-yard com
pletion from Thompson to
halfback Harold Cillum,
Thompson came back to Cil
lum with a give over right
guard.
Gillum picked up threeyards
before he was met by weak
side linebacker Ray Cardinally
who tacked the Cougar
halfback and jarred the ball
from Gillum's hands. Defen
sive end Chuck Evans curled
around the loose ball, squelch
ing any Washington State
hopes of a last-minute win.
"The fumble killed us at the
end," said first-year WSU
coach Warren Powers. "We
did have some time left but you
haven't got a chance if you
don't have the football."
Using the clock
Benjamin kept the ball on
the ground, forcing the
Cougars to use their remaining
timeouts. With fourth-and
three and 1:40 left, Stanford
chose to go for a field goal from
the WSU 20. Naber's kick

pierced the uprights but
Washington State was called
for offsides. The Cards elected
to retain the ball rather than
the three points.
Four plays later Naber mis
sed on a 32-yard attempt but
Stanford had eaten up all but
six seconds of the time remain
ing. A desperation heave by
Thompson was intercepted by
wide receiver James Lofton,
who had been put into the
game for the deep prevent de
fense.
"What disturbed me was that
Stanford was able to run the
ball in the fourth quarter and
kill the clock," Powers said in
his post-game analysis.
Part of Stanford's intent in
running the ball was to aid the
effectiveness of the passing at
tack, part was to keep the ball
away from Thompson.
Cougars rebound
After Stanford grabbed a
10-point advantage in the third
quarter, Thompson came back
and found flanker Brian Kelly in
the end zone with a 5-yard toss
on the third play of the final
period.
Before a home crowd of
47,500, Benjamin brought Stan
ford 73 yards in 10 plays, the
last one a 12-yard bullet to Lof
ton. It was his second TD catch
of the afternoon and his ninth
of the season, tying the Stan
ford single season touchdown
reception mark set by Eric
Cross in 1972.
"Lofton is just a great foot
ball player," Walsh said. "He's
the greatest receiver I've ever
been associated with and I

worked with five Pro Bowl re
ceivers in the NFL."
Throwing short over the
middle and to the flats,
Thompson directed the
Cougars to another score.
"We score when we have
to," Thompson said after the
game. "We have to concen
trate more and score when we
don't have to."
Aerial circus
The long-awaited showdown
between the West Coast's top
collegiate quarterbacks pro
vided all the expected aerial
fireworks.
"I thought both quarter
backs put on one heck of a
show," Powers said.
"I'm sure glad we don't have
to play Thompson again this
year," Walsh said.
Stanford shuffled its defen
sive secopdary Saturday with
cornerback Rick Parker and
safety Robby Chapman getting
their first starts. Thompson
showed the pair as much as
they'll see from any quarter
back this season.
The WSU junior completed
19 of 24 passes for 274 yards,
one touchdown and one inter
ception.
Benjamin connected on 27 of
39 passes for 330 yards, three
touchdowns and one intercep
tion.
"You can't read where he
(Thompson) is throwing the
ball," said Stanford middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino.
"He showed me more than I
thought I'd see.
"The only guy better is the
one we see in practice."

be."
"The key was to get the run
ning game going and the pas
sing game just followed," Kel
lar added.
"For our offense to function
we have to run — we passed
last week and lost (45-21 to
Washington)," Stanford quar
terback Guy Benjamin said.
This week Stanford ran and
Benjamin passed on the way to
the Cards' third conference
win against one loss. Stanford
is 5-2 overall.
Offensive line excels
"We controlled the ball ex
tremely well," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "Our offensive
line blocked well and our
fullbacks ran well."
The offensive line, after a
poor game in Seattle the week
before, blasted big holes
Saturday for halfback Darrin
Nelson and fullbacks John Fin
ley and Phil Francis.
Nelson gained 104 yards
against the Cougars and re
turned a 67-yard Gavin Hedrick
punt 72 yards before having 28
yards of it brought back on a
clipping penalty.
Finley rushed for 71 yards in
an outstanding effort while
Francis ran for 67 yards and
caught eight passes for another
70 yards.
In all, Stanford's ground
game garnered 245 yards and
gave Thompson and the WSU
offense little time with the
pigskin.
Despite Stanford's offensive
control, Thompson was able to

keep the Cougars within strik
ing distance throughout the
game.
Cards take lead
Tied at halftime, 14-14, Stan
ford jumped ahead in the third
quarter on a 28-yard field goal
by Ken Naber.
The teams then traded
touchdowns on four consecu
tive possessions with Stanford
remaining ahead, 31-29.
The Cardinals appeared
headed for another
touchdown as Benjamin led
Stanford from its own 34 to the
Cougar 3-yard line. With
third-and-goal the preseason
All-American threw a pass to
Nelson that looked anything
but All-America. Cougar safety
Ron Schwartz stepped in front
of Nelson and hijacked the
pass at the goal line.
"We told the quarterback to
throw for the touchdown if the
receiver was open," said
Walsh. "Otherwise we wanted
him to run upfield and we'd
take the field goal. Guy proba
bly won't do that again if he
plays 10 years in the NFL."
Asleep at the wheel?
"I must have gone asleep or
something," Benjamin said. "It
was an absurd throw."
Schwartz ran the pirated
Benjamin aerial back to the
Cougar 18. After a 6-yard com
pletion from Thompson to
halfback Harold Cillum,
Thompson came back to Cil
lum with a give over right
guard.
Gillum picked up threeyards
before he was met by weak
side linebacker Ray Cardinally
who tacked the Cougar
halfback and jarred the ball
from Gillum's hands. Defen
sive end Chuck Evans curled
around the loose ball, squelch
ing any Washington State
hopes of a last-minute win.
"The fumble killed us at the
end," said first-year WSU
coach Warren Powers. "We
did have some time left but you
haven't got a chance if you
don't have the football."
Using the clock
Benjamin kept the ball on
the ground, forcing the
Cougars to use their remaining
timeouts. With fourth-and
three and 1:40 left, Stanford
chose to go for a field goal from
the WSU 20. Naber's kick

pierced the uprights but
Washington State was called
for offsides. The Cards elected
to retain the ball rather than
the three points.
Four plays later Naber mis
sed on a 32-yard attempt but
Stanford had eaten up all but
six seconds of the time remain
ing. A desperation heave by
Thompson was intercepted by
wide receiver James Lofton,
who had been put into the
game for the deep prevent de
fense.
"What disturbed me was that
Stanford was able to run the
ball in the fourth quarter and
kill the clock," Powers said in
his post-game analysis.
Part of Stanford's intent in
running the ball was to aid the
effectiveness of the passing at
tack, part was to keep the ball
away from Thompson.
Cougars rebound
After Stanford grabbed a
10-point advantage in the third
quarter, Thompson came back
and found flanker Brian Kelly in
the end zone with a 5-yard toss
on the third play of the final
period.
Before a home crowd of
47,500, Benjamin brought Stan
ford 73 yards in 10 plays, the
last one a 12-yard bullet to Lof
ton. It was his second TD catch
of the afternoon and his ninth
of the season, tying the Stan
ford single season touchdown
reception mark set by Eric
Cross in 1972.
"Lofton is just a great foot
ball player," Walsh said. "He's
the greatest receiver I've ever
been associated with and I

worked with five Pro Bowl re
ceivers in the NFL."
Throwing short over the
middle and to the flats,
Thompson directed the
Cougars to another score.
"We score when we have
to," Thompson said after the
game. "We have to concen
trate more and score when we
don't have to."
Aerial circus
The long-awaited showdown
between the West Coast's top
collegiate quarterbacks pro
vided all the expected aerial
fireworks.
"I thought both quarter
backs put on one heck of a
show," Powers said.
"I'm sure glad we don't have
to play Thompson again this
year," Walsh said.
Stanford shuffled its defen
sive secopdary Saturday with
cornerback Rick Parker and
safety Robby Chapman getting
their first starts. Thompson
showed the pair as much as
they'll see from any quarter
back this season.
The WSU junior completed
19 of 24 passes for 274 yards,
one touchdown and one inter
ception.
Benjamin connected on 27 of
39 passes for 330 yards, three
touchdowns and one intercep
tion.
"You can't read where he
(Thompson) is throwing the
ball," said Stanford middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino.
"He showed me more than I
thought I'd see.
"The only guy better is the
one we see in practice."

Benjamin passed on the way to
the Cards' third conference
win against one loss. Stanford
is 5-2 overall.
Offensive line excels
"We controlled the ball ex
tremely well," Stanford coach
Bill Walsh said. "Our offensive
line blocked well and our
fullbacks ran well."
The offensive line, after a
poor game in Seattle the week
before, blasted big holes
Saturday for halfback Darrin
Nelson and fullbacks John Fin
ley and Phil Francis.
Nelson gained 104 yards
against the Cougars and re
turned a 67-yard Gavin Hedrick
punt 72 yards before having 28
yards of it brought back on a
clipping penalty.
Finley rushed for 71 yards in
an outstanding effort while
Francis ran for 67 yards and
caught eight passes for another
70 yards.
In all, Stanford's ground
game garnered 245 yards and
gave Thompson and the WSU
offense little time with the
pigskin.
Despite Stanford's offensive
control, Thompson was able to

keep the Cougars within strik
ing distance throughout the
game.
Cards take lead
Tied at halftime, 14-14, Stan
ford jumped ahead in the third
quarter on a 28-yard field goal
by Ken Naber.
The teams then traded
touchdowns on four consecu
tive possessions with Stanford
remaining ahead, 31-29.
The Cardinals appeared
headed for another
touchdown as Benjamin led
Stanford from its own 34 to the
Cougar 3-yard line. With
third-and-goal the preseason
All-American threw a pass to
Nelson that looked anything
but All-America. Cougar safety
Ron Schwartz stepped in front
of Nelson and hijacked the
pass at the goal line.
"We told the quarterback to
throw for the touchdown if the
receiver was open," said
Walsh. "Otherwise we wanted
him to run upfield and we'd
take the field goal. Guy proba
bly won't do that again if he
plays 10 years in the NFL."
Asleep at the wheel?
"I must have gone asleep or
something," Benjamin said. "It
was an absurd throw."
Schwartz ran the pirated
Benjamin aerial back to the
Cougar 18. After a 6-yard com
pletion from Thompson to
halfback Harold Cillum,
Thompson came back to Cil
lum with a give over right
guard.
Gillum picked up threeyards
before he was met by weak
side linebacker Ray Cardinally
who tacked the Cougar
halfback and jarred the ball
from Gillum's hands. Defen
sive end Chuck Evans curled
around the loose ball, squelch
ing any Washington State
hopes of a last-minute win.
"The fumble killed us at the
end," said first-year WSU
coach Warren Powers. "We
did have some time left but you
haven't got a chance if you
don't have the football."
Using the clock
Benjamin kept the ball on
the ground, forcing the
Cougars to use their remaining
timeouts. With fourth-and
three and 1:40 left, Stanford
chose to go for a field goal from
the WSU 20. Naber's kick

pierced the uprights but
Washington State was called
for offsides. The Cards elected
to retain the ball rather than
the three points.
Four plays later Naber mis
sed on a 32-yard attempt but
Stanford had eaten up all but
six seconds of the time remain
ing. A desperation heave by
Thompson was intercepted by
wide receiver James Lofton,
who had been put into the
game for the deep prevent de
fense.
"What disturbed me was that
Stanford was able to run the
ball in the fourth quarter and
kill the clock," Powers said in
his post-game analysis.
Part of Stanford's intent in
running the ball was to aid the
effectiveness of the passing at
tack, part was to keep the ball
away from Thompson.
Cougars rebound
After Stanford grabbed a
10-point advantage in the third
quarter, Thompson came back
and found flanker Brian Kelly in
the end zone with a 5-yard toss
on the third play of the final
period.
Before a home crowd of
47,500, Benjamin brought Stan
ford 73 yards in 10 plays, the
last one a 12-yard bullet to Lof
ton. It was his second TD catch
of the afternoon and his ninth
of the season, tying the Stan
ford single season touchdown
reception mark set by Eric
Cross in 1972.
"Lofton is just a great foot
ball player," Walsh said. "He's
the greatest receiver I've ever
been associated with and I

worked with five Pro Bowl re
ceivers in the NFL."
Throwing short over the
middle and to the flats,
Thompson directed the
Cougars to another score.
"We score when we have
to," Thompson said after the
game. "We have to concen
trate more and score when we
don't have to."
Aerial circus
The long-awaited showdown
between the West Coast's top
collegiate quarterbacks pro
vided all the expected aerial
fireworks.
"I thought both quarter
backs put on one heck of a
show," Powers said.
"I'm sure glad we don't have
to play Thompson again this
year," Walsh said.
Stanford shuffled its defen
sive secopdary Saturday with
cornerback Rick Parker and
safety Robby Chapman getting
their first starts. Thompson
showed the pair as much as
they'll see from any quarter
back this season.
The WSU junior completed
19 of 24 passes for 274 yards,
one touchdown and one inter
ception.
Benjamin connected on 27 of
39 passes for 330 yards, three
touchdowns and one intercep
tion.
"You can't read where he
(Thompson) is throwing the
ball," said Stanford middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino.
"He showed me more than I
thought I'd see.
"The only guy better is the
one we see in practice."

Stanford found the best way
to defense Washington State's
stellar quarterback Jack
Thompson — don't let him
have the ball.
Using a balanced offense,
the Cardinals dominated pos
session of the football on the
way to a 31-29 victory over the
Cougars Saturday at Stanford
Stadium.
Stanford ran 93 plays to
WSU's 58 while amassing 575
yards total offense.
"We thought we had a good
enough offense to control the
tempo," Card wide receiver
Bill Kellar said. "Time and time
again we ground it out taking
seven or eight minutes a drive.
We felt the more we could be
on the field, the better off we'd
be."
"The key was to get the run
ning game going and the pas
sing game just followed," Kel
lar added.
"For our offense to function
we have to run — we passed
last week and lost (45-21 to
Washington)," Stanford quar
terback Guy Benjamin said.
This week Stanford ran and
Benjamin passed on the way to
the Cards' third conference

is 5-2 overall.
