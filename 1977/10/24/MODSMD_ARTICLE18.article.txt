Coming off one of their best
performances of the 1977 sea
son — the 17-15, 15-10, 11-15,
15-3 win over San Jose State
Thursday night — the women's
volleyball team defeated
Fresno State 11-15, 15-1, 15-4
and 15-12 on Friday afternoon
in Roble Gym.
Fresno caught Stanford to
tally off-guard in the first game
of the match, showing both a
skilled offense and tough de
fense in its 15-11 decision. The
Cardinals quickly snapped out
of their slump, however, to
completely dominate the next
three games.
After the match, Stanford
head coach Art Lambert spoke

of the team's inconsistencies:
"It was a typical Stanford athle
tic team reaction," he said.
"We beat San Jose (last year's
league champions) last night
and came into today's match
with big heads."
"Once we put our minds to
it, we tore them apart," he
concluded.
Shawn Hoover's accurate
setting and Chris Anderson's
continued top-hotch play
raised the team's season mark
to 12-2. Their conference re
cord now stands at 5-0.
The Cards' next match is
Oct. 31 when they will take on
the University of San Francisco
in Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m.
