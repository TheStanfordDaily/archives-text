## Manzanita, Theta Chi win 
### Marcia Hadeler 
In a display of offensive
fireworks, Manzanita 21 beat
Branner 111 49-43 in an exciting,
"you should have been there,"
double-overtime IM football
game.
Theta Chi inched a win away
from Kappa Sig 11, 13-12, in
another thrilling overtime
game. A pass deflected in the
end zone fell into the waiting
arms of Theta Chi's Bruce
Turner, bringing the overtime
score to 12-6. Linden Stambler
carried the ball into the end
zone for the extra point. Kappa
Sig II scored another
touchdown, making the last
few moments tense, but failed
in its extra point attempt, giv
ing the win to Theta Chi.
Football to come
Great expectations? Not re
ally.
Neither the KA I team nor
Sigma Chi think they have an
"awesome team." But, this Fri
day (3 p.m., field 9) an exciting
game is sure to occur when the
two teams meet.
Both 'B' teams have a 2-0 re
cord.
Tom McCloskey will quar
terback for KA I, sending pas
ses to Jamie Murray and )ohn
Kirst, an ex-JV footballer hurt in
last week's game against
Eucalypto.
Although Kappa Alpha says
its team isn't big, it admits to
being fast.
Sigma Chi is undecided in its
choice for quarterback. Tom
Oliver had the honor last
week, Carlos Dalence the
week before. Owen Halliday, a
fast split end who caught three
of the five touchdown passes
against Mei lata Thi last week
will be in the game. Mike
Crennan, a 6-foot-5 defensive
tackle, will also be on hand.
"As long as we hold off their
rush, we'll be able to complete
our passes and score," said
Oliver.

Strategy.
"We have a lot of it, but we
haven't had to use it yet," said
Dave Erickson.

Dave Erickson and John Erb
represent SAE in the IM vol
leyball 'A' league.
Erickson, who spoke as if vol
leyball jargon was his native
tongue, explained his team's
strategy. "We use a lot of two
sets — one player sets the ball
up for the other about two feet
above the net. The other
player then comes down on it
with a quick spike, placing it in
the center of the opponent's
court."
Erb likes a knuckle serve — a
flat serve with no spin — be
cause it is difficult to return.
Erickson prefers a top-spin
serve that sinks fast on his op
ponents.
Both of them played on last

year's SAE six-man team, a
runner-up team in the finals.
They are 3-0 in their league.
Height may be the strategy of
Paloma's Mark "Okie" Suther
land and Will Sanford. Six
foot-three and 6-foot-2, re
spectively, they have an advan
tage when it comes to spiking
the ball.
"We have good control of
the ball," said Sanford. "We
watch where are opponents
are and place the ball where
they aren't."
When their opponents are
playing backcourt they set the
ball up and dink it.
Sanford is a freshman in
Paloma, Sutherland is his R.A.
They are 2-0 in their 'B' league.
