# Rape workshop closes Women's Week
## 
### Hardy Iredale 
The psychology of rape and what
can be done about it were the sub
jects of a Saturday workshop mark
ing the final day of Women's Week.
Workshop participants discussed
current attitudes toward rape, and
measures that can be taken in the
Stanford community to reduce the
threat of rape and provide support
for rape victims.
A proposal for establishing "rape
support groups" in Stanford dorms
was well received. The groups would
sensitize women to the threat of rape
and provide help for rape victims.
A booklet on rape with special re
levance to Stanford is being pre
pared by a local women's coopera
tive and will be out before the end of
November.
Feelings strong
Feelings ran strong among the
women present, as they spoke of the
rage felt by rape victims and of the
guilt and hypocrisy attached to rape
in our society.
"For most women, if they thought
rape was bad, going to the police was
even worse," was one participant's
comment.
Some emphasized the mixed and
often hypocritical feelings about
rape on the part of men, and in gen
eral on the part of society.
It was asserted that the rape victim
is both the accuser and the defen
dant in rape trials, and in a large
number of cases, rape victims don't
even report the crime until years la
ter.
Feel guilty
"A lot of women feel guilty be
cause they think they were asking for
it," observed one woman, adding
that in some cases "women who
have been raped think they must
have brought it on."
The consensus seemed to be that
these feelings are provoked by male
attitudes. "Rape is a crime of vio

lence, not of sex," observed work
shop leader Carol Sternhall.
In contrast, it was said, traditional
attitudes have regarded rape at best
as a crime against a woman's virtue,
at worst as a crime against male
property. Even today the tendency is
to see only the sexual aspect of rape,
disregarding that it is essentially a
pre-meditated act of violence.
"My husband keeps asking if it was

better than sex with him," was a
common complaint among women
who have been raped.
"When I talk to men about rape I
often get vicious jokes and incredi
ble defensiveness," said Sternhall.
"When you bring the subject of rape
up in the dorm," another participant
observed, "there is a lot of defen
siveness; if you're not laughed at,
you are thought of as being

paranoid."
Another complaint was that "when
men hear about Women Against
Rape (the group organizing the
workshop), they are included to such
responses as 'introduce me to the
women for rape.' "
The "traditional jock attitude" in
Stanford dorms was a major target
for criticism, particularly when it
