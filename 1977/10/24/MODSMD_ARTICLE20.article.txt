## Seating switch at Maples 
### Bruce Anderson 
Stanford is down by 10
points and the visiting team
brings the ball downcourt in
tent on increasing that advan
tage to 12.
A deft swipe at the basketball
gives Stanford the ball and two
points on a breakaway layin.
Up eight, the opposing
backcourtmen bring the ball
up the floor and attempt to
work the ball into the
frontcourt.
A pass is picked off by an
alert Stanford forward who
finds a streaking teammate
alone at the other end of the
court. An easy two.
The Maples Pavilion crowd
goes into a frenzy — whistling,
yelling, clapping and stomping
feet to show its approval of the
headsup defense.
"The crowd responds so en
thusiastically that the opposing
team will call timeout thinking
they've got to get things in con
trol, even though they're up by
six points," said Stanford bas
ketball coach Dick Dißiaso,
discussing how the proper
basketball atmosphere can
work to a basketball team's ad
vantage.
"Against Cal two years ago
(when Stanford came from 14
points down to tie the game at
the final buzzer, before losing

in a second overtime) the last
five or six minutes it was noisy
and exciting," Dißiaso said. "It
got the adrenalin flowing. The
players like to see a great at
mosphere, they play better."
That sort of basketball at
mosphere has often been mis
sing at Maples. But the Athletic
Department took a long stride
toward creating that atmos
phere recently when it ap
proved plans to convert the
entire bleacher section across
from the player benches into
student seating.
The bleachers on the east
side of Maples seat 880. In the
past, 330 of those seats were
sold to students, faculty and
staff members. The other 550
were sold in season tickets to
alumni and other Cardinal
fans.
Now the entire section will
be students with the Band and
the yell leaders seated in it.
Stanford will at last have what
every other school in the Pac-8
has: a consolidatd student
section.
"It's pretty hard to have
cohesive yelling with people
spread out all over, often with
some in the back section of the
pavilion," said yell leader Mike
Thurman, one of the people
who spoke in favor of the seat

ing change to Athletic Depart
ment administrators and
alumni representatives.
"Our first goal was to get
students together," Thurman
said. "Our second goal was to
get them close to the floor."
"The closer students are to
the floor, the more involved
they are in the game and the
more involved — emotionally
involved — the more the at
mosphere changes from rela
tive passive watching to en
thusiasm and noise," Dißiaso
said.
"When I go to eat in the stu
dent residences each
November, students ask,
'Coach, is there any way we can
get down on the floor?' "
"I think that we have had
student support but it hasn't
been noticeable because of the
separated seating," Dißiaso
added.
Other Pac-8 schools with un
ified student seating have had
little trouble being noticed,
particularly at the Pit — Ore
gon's Mac Court.
"Mac Court has great at
mosphere— it's not hostile but
enthusiastic excitement. It
pumps up the players on both
teams," Dißiaso said.
"At some places, we plan be
fore the game how to get mes
sages to our players and we've

resorted to hand signals. There
have been times here where
I've talked to players 30 feet
away."
But Dißiaso sees the quiet
evenings at Maples when stu
dents bring their books and
study during the game to avoid
the noise at UGLY as a thing of
the past.
"If students know that by
buying season tickets they will
have good seats every game,
it's conceivable to sell it (the
student section) out," Dißiaso
said. "As the program im
proves it may become a very
desireable thing to have a stu
dent season ticket."
And fan support at the games
will have a lot to do with how
much the program improves.
"When you walk in and see
the downstairs packed, it
juices you up a bit," Dißiaso
said.
"In a close game that goes
two points, three, one, two,
four, two, back to four — and
then all of a sudden you make a
couple steals and you're up by
eight," Dißiaso said depicting
an imaginery basketball
scenario, "the students go
crazy, responding enthusiasti
cally to the two baskets . . .and
they won't let the other team
come back."

said. "Our second goal was to
get them close to the floor."
"The closer students are to
the floor, the more involved
they are in the game and the
more involved — emotionally
involved — the more the at
mosphere changes from rela
tive passive watching to en
thusiasm and noise," Dißiaso
said.
"When I go to eat in the stu
dent residences each
November, students ask,
'Coach, is there any way we can
get down on the floor?' "
"I think that we have had
student support but it hasn't
been noticeable because of the
separated seating," Dißiaso
added.
Other Pac-8 schools with un
ified student seating have had
little trouble being noticed,
particularly at the Pit — Ore
gon's Mac Court.
"Mac Court has great at
mosphere— it's not hostile but
enthusiastic excitement. It
pumps up the players on both
teams," Dißiaso said.
"At some places, we plan be
fore the game how to get mes
sages to our players and we've

resorted to hand signals. There
have been times here where
I've talked to players 30 feet
away."
But Dißiaso sees the quiet
evenings at Maples when stu
dents bring their books and
study during the game to avoid
the noise at UGLY as a thing of
the past.
"If students know that by
buying season tickets they will
have good seats every game,
it's conceivable to sell it (the
student section) out," Dißiaso
said. "As the program im
proves it may become a very
desireable thing to have a stu
dent season ticket."
And fan support at the games
will have a lot to do with how
much the program improves.
"When you walk in and see
the downstairs packed, it
juices you up a bit," Dißiaso
said.
"In a close game that goes
two points, three, one, two,
four, two, back to four — and
then all of a sudden you make a
couple steals and you're up by
eight," Dißiaso said depicting
an imaginery basketball
scenario, "the students go
crazy, responding enthusiasti
cally to the two baskets . . .and
they won't let the other team
come back."
Stanford is down by 10
points and the visiting team
brings the ball downcourt in
tent on increasing that advan
tage to 12.
A deft swipe at the basketball
gives Stanford the ball and two
points on a breakaway layin.
Up eight, the opposing
backcourtmen bring the ball
up the floor and attempt to
work the ball into the
frontcourt.
A pass is picked off by an
alert Stanford forward who
finds a streaking teammate
alone at the other end of the
court. An easy two.
The Maples Pavilion crowd
goes into a frenzy — whistling,
yelling, clapping and stomping
feet to show its approval of the
headsup defense.
"The crowd responds so en
thusiastically that the opposing
team will call timeout thinking
they've got to get things in con
trol, even though they're up by
six points," said Stanford bas
ketball coach Dick Dißiaso,
discussing how the proper
basketball atmosphere can
work to a basketball team's ad
vantage.
"Against Cal two years ago
(when Stanford came from 14
points down to tie the game at
the final buzzer, before losing

in a second overtime) the last
five or six minutes it was noisy
and exciting," Dißiaso said. "It
got the adrenalin flowing. The
players like to see a great at
mosphere, they play better."
That sort of basketball at
mosphere has often been mis
sing at Maples. But the Athletic
Department took a long stride
toward creating that atmos
phere recently when it ap
proved plans to convert the
entire bleacher section across
from the player benches into
student seating.
The bleachers on the east
side of Maples seat 880. In the
past, 330 of those seats were
sold to students, faculty and
staff members. The other 550
were sold in season tickets to
alumni and other Cardinal
fans.
Now the entire section will
be students with the Band and
the yell leaders seated in it.
Stanford will at last have what
every other school in the Pac-8
has: a consolidatd student
section.
"It's pretty hard to have
cohesive yelling with people
spread out all over, often with
some in the back section of the
pavilion," said yell leader Mike
Thurman, one of the people
who spoke in favor of the seat

ing change to Athletic Depart
ment administrators and
alumni representatives.

said. "Our second goal was to

gives Stanford the ball and two
points on a breakaway layin.
Up eight, the opposing
backcourtmen bring the ball
up the floor and attempt to
work the ball into the
frontcourt.
A pass is picked off by an
alert Stanford forward who
finds a streaking teammate
alone at the other end of the
court. An easy two.
The Maples Pavilion crowd
goes into a frenzy — whistling,
yelling, clapping and stomping
feet to show its approval of the
headsup defense.
"The crowd responds so en
thusiastically that the opposing
team will call timeout thinking
they've got to get things in con
trol, even though they're up by
six points," said Stanford bas
ketball coach Dick Dißiaso,
discussing how the proper
basketball atmosphere can
work to a basketball team's ad
vantage.
"Against Cal two years ago
(when Stanford came from 14
points down to tie the game at
the final buzzer, before losing

in a second overtime) the last
five or six minutes it was noisy
and exciting," Dißiaso said. "It
got the adrenalin flowing. The
players like to see a great at
mosphere, they play better."
That sort of basketball at
mosphere has often been mis
sing at Maples. But the Athletic
Department took a long stride
toward creating that atmos
phere recently when it ap
proved plans to convert the
entire bleacher section across
from the player benches into
student seating.
The bleachers on the east
side of Maples seat 880. In the
past, 330 of those seats were
sold to students, faculty and
staff members. The other 550
were sold in season tickets to
alumni and other Cardinal
fans.
Now the entire section will
be students with the Band and
the yell leaders seated in it.
Stanford will at last have what
every other school in the Pac-8
has: a consolidatd student
section.
"It's pretty hard to have
cohesive yelling with people
spread out all over, often with
some in the back section of the
pavilion," said yell leader Mike
Thurman, one of the people
who spoke in favor of the seat

ing change to Athletic Depart
ment administrators and
alumni representatives.
"Our first goal was to get
students together," Thurman
said. "Our second goal was to
get them close to the floor."
"The closer students are to
the floor, the more involved
they are in the game and the
more involved — emotionally
involved — the more the at
mosphere changes from rela
tive passive watching to en
thusiasm and noise," Dißiaso
said.
"When I go to eat in the stu
dent residences each
November, students ask,
'Coach, is there any way we can
get down on the floor?' "
"I think that we have had
student support but it hasn't
been noticeable because of the
separated seating," Dißiaso
added.
Other Pac-8 schools with un
ified student seating have had
little trouble being noticed,
particularly at the Pit — Ore
gon's Mac Court.
"Mac Court has great at
mosphere— it's not hostile but
enthusiastic excitement. It
pumps up the players on both
teams," Dißiaso said.
"At some places, we plan be
fore the game how to get mes
sages to our players and we've

resorted to hand signals. There
have been times here where
I've talked to players 30 feet
away."
But Dißiaso sees the quiet
evenings at Maples when stu
dents bring their books and
study during the game to avoid
the noise at UGLY as a thing of
the past.
"If students know that by
buying season tickets they will
have good seats every game,
it's conceivable to sell it (the
student section) out," Dißiaso
said. "As the program im
proves it may become a very
desireable thing to have a stu
dent season ticket."
And fan support at the games
will have a lot to do with how
much the program improves.
"When you walk in and see
the downstairs packed, it
juices you up a bit," Dißiaso
said.
"In a close game that goes
two points, three, one, two,
four, two, back to four — and
then all of a sudden you make a
couple steals and you're up by
eight," Dißiaso said depicting
an imaginery basketball
scenario, "the students go
crazy, responding enthusiasti
cally to the two baskets . . .and
they won't let the other team
come back."
