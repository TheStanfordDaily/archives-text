# SJS thumps scotchers
## 
### Julie Fiedler 
Stanford's field hockey
team, now 4-2 in overall play,
split a pair of games over the
weekend. Saturday the Cards
faced an undefeated San Jose
team and weren't able to mar
the Spartan's record as they fell
3-0. Yesterday, however, the
scotchers rebounded to out
score Simon Fraser University,
3-1.
The consensus regarding
Sunday's play against Simon
Fraser was that "this is the best
we've played all season. Our
passes were better and
everyone was .playing much
sharper."
Kelly Westerwick, the team's
leading scorer, was responsi
ble for Stanford's first goal.
Late in the first half the
freshman from San Diego
scored on a one-on-one flick
assisted by forward Mandy
Read.
Eight minutes later Read fol

lowed a Westerwick shot in to
give Stanford the go-ahead
goal. Read scored Stanford's
final goal with a strong drive
shot during the opening mi
nutes of the second stanza.
"The first 15 minutes of the
second period were the best in
the game," said Kathy Levin
son, Stanford's only four-year
field hockey letter winner and
now coach of the junior varsity
program. "Everyone was in the
right position when shots were
made and we really outhustled
the other team."
Saturday, that wasn't the
case, however, as Card players
attributed the 3-0 loss to a lack
of aggressiveness throughout
the game.
"We went out to defend, not
attack," said freshman sweep
Jeanine Valadez. Sophomore
Nancy White added, "We just
psyched ourselves out."
The Spartan squad, how
ever, is not one easily beaten.

Last year's Northern California
champions have an extremely
deep and talented team. Be
sides having many returnees
from last year's squad, the
Spartans now boast Pommey
MacFarlane, a 24-year-old re
cruit from South Africa. Mac-
Farlane assisted on one of San
Jose's three scoring drives in
the first period.
Stanford's JVs also fell to the
Spartans, losing 4-1.
Although they hope to beat
San Jose'in the regionals, Stan
ford players praised their con
ference opponents.
White, one of 30 members
.selected to the U.S. field hoc
key squad, praised their out
standing stickwork and said,
"They just outplayed and out
ran us."
"They have no hesitation in
their play," first-year Stanford
coach Barbara Longstreth said.
"They start moving the ball
right away.
Longstreth also praised the
Stanford team. "I don't think
we know how good we are. Be
cause of a lack of competition
we haven't found total consis
tency." But, she said, "today
(Sunday) showed how we can
really work well as a team."
After a match with UOP here
on Wednesday, the Cards
travel to southern California to
face Pomona, Long Beach State
and San Diego State in a tough
two-day schedule.
"The results of the coming
competition will probably de
termine the rankings for the
regionals at Pomona,"
Longstreth said.
