Playing what assistant coach
Mike MacNama termed "very
poor defense," the Stanford
water polo team was upset by
UC-lrvine Saturday, 9-7, at Ir
vine's pool. The defeat fol
lowed a 9-3 victory by the Cards
over Long Beach State Friday
afternoon.
MacNama, referring to the
I rvine game, also attributed the
loss to a lack of offense during
the fourth quarter.
With three minutes left in
the third quarter, the Cards
scored a goal to take a 7-5 lead.
From then on, the Stanford at
tack collapsed and Irvine
scored four goals for the win.
"We started out slow," said
junior Robby Arnold. "We
were up by two going into the
fourth quarter, then we let
them off the hook."
"Our switching was poor,"
MacNama said. "Our com
munication was poor. Both our
individual and our team de
fense was poor. We're playing
with no consistency and it's

hard to win against good teams
when you're playing that way."
Stanford, which now has two
losses this season, will play Ir
vine again this Saturday at de-
Guerre.
"If we improve our defense
then," MacNama continued,
"we'll beat them."
"We've really got to tighten
up our defense and communi
cate with each other," Arnold
said. "Man for man, they're not
nearly as good as us. We just
couldn't put it together."
In Friday's win over Long
Beach State, junior Tom
Angelo scored three goals to
lead the team and freshman
goalie )ohn Gansel maintained
his average by blocking more
than 12 shots in the game, Ar
nold said.
Junior Dave Egan, who
started his first two games this
weekend, also played well,
MacNama said.
Before the rematch with Ir
vine on Saturday, the Cards
face USC Friday at 4 p.m. at
deCuerre.
