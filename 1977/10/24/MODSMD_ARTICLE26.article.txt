Study says death penalty ineffective
Washington — The death penalty rarely if ever deters
murder, according to a new statistical study.
The report in the University of Minnesota Law Review
disputes the widespread belief that some potential crim
inals will change their minds about committing murder
because they fear execution.
Washington researcher Brian Forst concluded in the
latest statistical analysis of the issue that "capital
punishment does not, on balance, deter homicides."
However, the report said there was some evidence
that a high murder conviction rate and prison sentences
for murders have a deterrent effect.
Forst, a senior research analyst at the Institute for Law
and Social Research, studied murder statistics for 32
states between 1960 and 1970, a decade when the mur
der rate was rising nationally and the number of execu
tions was declining. His study was published last sum
mer.
Panamanian returns favor treaty
Panama City — Panamanians crowded the polls in
schools, churches and stores yesterday in a national
referendum on the Panama Canal treaties negotiated
with the United States. Early unofficial returns showed
the treaties winning.approval by a margin of more than
2-to-1.
Soon after the polls had closed, preliminary returns
posted at the legislative palace showed the treaties gain
ing acceptance in three out of 10 provinces by 1938 to 832
votes.
A simple majority is needed for approval. The gov
ernment planned to announce the final, official count
Thursday.
Tax credits debated in Senate
Washington — The Senate debates the tax portion of
President jimmy Carter's energy package this week
while the House takes up a proposal to finance the Social
Security system.
The $40 billion package of tax credits for energy con
servation and production won approval Friday from the
Senate Finance Committee and is scheduled for Senate
debate Tuesday through the end of the week.
The bill is a Substitute for the energy taxes Carter
initially proposed to force conservation and reduce U.S.

reliance on oil imports.
But no matter what the Senate does, the legislation
will be sent to a joint House-Senate committee that
already has begun working out a compromise between
the different energy bills passed by each house.
Ethiopia stalls Somalian revolt
Mogadishu, Somalia — Despite sweeping successes by
Somali-backed rebels fighting for control of Ethiopia's
Ogaden region, diplomats here say Ethiopia With newly
received Soviet military supplies, may still blunt the sec
essionists' offensive.
In the past three months, guerrillas of the Western
Somalia Liberation Front have captured all but two key
towns in the sun-parched Ogaden region, an area com
prising about one-third of Ethiopia.
The rebels want to annex the territory, primarily inha
bited by ethnic Somalis, to neighboring Somalia.
But there is a growing consensus among diplomats
here that unless the insurgents can quickly capture the
last Ethiopian strongholds, Harrar and Diredawa, their
drive will be endangered by dwindling supplies.

Ethiopia stalls Somalian revolt
Mogadishu, Somalia — Despite sweeping successes by
Somali-backed rebels fighting for control of Ethiopia's
Ogaden region, diplomats here say Ethiopia With newly
received Soviet military supplies, may still blunt the sec
essionists' offensive.
In the past three months, guerrillas of the Western
Somalia Liberation Front have captured all but two key
towns in the sun-parched Ogaden region, an area com
prising about one-third of Ethiopia.
The rebels want to annex the territory, primarily inha
bited by ethnic Somalis, to neighboring Somalia.
But there is a growing consensus among diplomats
here that unless the insurgents can quickly capture the
last Ethiopian strongholds, Harrar and Diredawa, their
drive will be endangered by dwindling supplies.

Study says death penalty ineffective
Washington — The death penalty rarely if ever deters
murder, according to a new statistical study.
The report in the University of Minnesota Law Review
disputes the widespread belief that some potential crim
inals will change their minds about committing murder
because they fear execution.
Washington researcher Brian Forst concluded in the
latest statistical analysis of the issue that "capital
punishment does not, on balance, deter homicides."
However, the report said there was some evidence
that a high murder conviction rate and prison sentences
for murders have a deterrent effect.
Forst, a senior research analyst at the Institute for Law
and Social Research, studied murder statistics for 32
states between 1960 and 1970, a decade when the mur
der rate was rising nationally and the number of execu
tions was declining. His study was published last sum
mer.
Panamanian returns favor treaty
Panama City — Panamanians crowded the polls in
schools, churches and stores yesterday in a national
referendum on the Panama Canal treaties negotiated
with the United States. Early unofficial returns showed
the treaties winning.approval by a margin of more than
2-to-1.
Soon after the polls had closed, preliminary returns
posted at the legislative palace showed the treaties gain
ing acceptance in three out of 10 provinces by 1938 to 832
votes.
A simple majority is needed for approval. The gov
ernment planned to announce the final, official count
Thursday.
Tax credits debated in Senate
Washington — The Senate debates the tax portion of
President jimmy Carter's energy package this week
while the House takes up a proposal to finance the Social
Security system.
The $40 billion package of tax credits for energy con
servation and production won approval Friday from the
Senate Finance Committee and is scheduled for Senate
debate Tuesday through the end of the week.
The bill is a Substitute for the energy taxes Carter
initially proposed to force conservation and reduce U.S.

reliance on oil imports.
But no matter what the Senate does, the legislation
will be sent to a joint House-Senate committee that
already has begun working out a compromise between
