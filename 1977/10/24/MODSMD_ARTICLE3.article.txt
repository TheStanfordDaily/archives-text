Irregularities in the campaigns of
23 ASSU Senate candidates and the
potential disqualifications of some
Senators-elect will be discussed at a
public informational meeting this af
ternoon. ASSU Co-President Greg
Larson announced the meeting yes
terday.
The informal meeting, to be held
from 3 to 5 p.m. in the ballroom of
the Women's Clubhouse in Old Un
ion, will include the preliminary re
port of ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy.
The report recommends that
seven candidates definitely be dis
qualified from the election, and that
actions of 16 others be brought to the
attention of the Senate, said Murphy.
Some 61 undergraduates and
graduates were candidates.
The report will also include a
statement of other aspects of the
campaign for the Senate to consider,
said Larson.
Larson said the meeting was de
cided on Friday by ASSU officials
after it had been requested by some
Senate candidates.
The meeting will also deal with the
future of the proposed Elections Re
view Board (ERB), said Larson.
The ERB, the creation of which was
announced last Thursday, would in
vestigate campaign irregularities and
disqualify candidates.
Larson said the meeting will not be
a Senate meeting to discuss the Se
nate's formal business.
ASSU Senate Chairman Pat Flinn

said yesterday there is a good chance
that the first meeting will be next
week.
There is apparently no known pre
cedent for a recommendation that so
many candidates be considered for
disqualification, said Larson.
In 1974, five candidates were re
commended to be disqualified for il
legal posting of campaign literature.
The Senate voted to disqualify them
all.
Larson said if senators and alter
nates are disqualified, then the other
candidates would move up accord
ing to their vote totals.
Murphy said the new vote totals
for undergraduates, after counting
the overseas campuses' ballots, are
as follows.
