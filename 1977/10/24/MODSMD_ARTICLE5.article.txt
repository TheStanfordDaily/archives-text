# LAC, Cowell develop anxiety courses

### Ruth McCreight 
There are plenty of places around campus that
are bound to make a student squirm uncomforta
bly: Meyer Library during Dead Week, a profes
sor's office when one turns in a late paper, the
cashier's line at Maples on registration day.
However, there are a few oases designed to help
students relax and learn to handle their anxiety.
The Learning Assistance Center (LAC) and Cow
ell's Counseling and Psychological Services are
offering non-credit, four-week workshops on
managing anxiety in an academic environment.
The LAC's course meets twice weekly starting
Oct. 25; Cowell's course will start Oct. 26.
Sallie Kueny, instructor of the LAC's course on
test anxiety, said she sees stress as an often helpful
part of everyday life. However, she said, too much
tension can have a debilitating effect on one's
academic performance and emotional and physi
cal health.
Tremendous capacity
Kueny states, "We have a tremendous capacity
for regulating our response to events in our life,
and it takes specific training to get in touch with
those capacities."
The course employs many methods in teaching
students to release their tension. Autogenic train
ing, a series of relaxation techniques, eases the
tension in different parts of the body: the circulat
ory, respiratory, digestive, and muscular systems.
Progressive relaxation deals with how the whole
body feels, and enables one to release muscle
tension. Kueny said that meditative techniques are
also helpful in bringing about psychological and

emotional equilibrium.
Other methods used in the class include sys
tematic desensitization, breathing control, and
bio-feedback. Desensitization provides a way for
the student to numb himself or herself to stress
through imagining the anxiety-producing situa
tion (i.e. taking a test), imagining the tension and
then imagining relaxation.
Beneficial effect
This rehearsal has a very beneficial effect on the
real situation, Kueny said.
A bio-feedback session puts particular emphasis
on releasing muscular tension, and improving gal
vanic skin response and peripheral body tempera
ture.
The LAC course is being offered for the first time
in response to students' requests. The course is
specifically geared toward test anxiety, but the
techniques taught can prove useful in many facets
of a student's life.
"Most of us carry around a great deal of tension
— more than we're aware of," she says. "We need
to learn specific techniques to re-direct the energy
in creative way and experience a sense of well
being."
Dr. Richard Jacks, staff psychologist at Counsel
ing and Psychological Services, said he sees his
anxiety management workshop as a way of "teach
ing people they're not so helpless (in dealing with
stress) as they think they are."
Experience anxiety
He said he believes that people experience anx
iety when they avoid activities that they'd like to
engage in, from social situations to oral tests. Jacks

has been teaching this course for the past few
years, md has had a high rate of success in helping
students handle such anxiety-producing situa
tions.
Imagery is an important part of Jacks' workshop.
Imagining a stressful situation and its successful
resolution is one useful technique. The course
also employs methods for thought relaxation,
deep muscle relaxation and awareness of body
processes. Members of the class identify a specific
goal at the beginning of thecourse: a situation that
is particularly anxiety-producing and how they
would like to react.
The class meets for three weeks, skips three
weeks, and then meets again to reinforce the
progress the student has made toward reaching
the goal.
Jacks said that a wide variety of students have
enrolled in his course, coming from all fields of
interest, with good and poor grades, graduate
students as well as undergraduates.
The course was once geared specifically for
test-taking, but now it deals with any high stress
situation. This is "one of a series of workshops
offered at Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices," Jacks said. "There is an increasing em
phasis on teaching coping skills using an educa
tional model as opposed to a traditional medical
approach (seeing a psychiatrist)," he added.
Counseling and Psychological Services also of
fers workshops on child management skills, be
coming a professional woman, assertive com
munication and couple decision making.

Imagining a stressful situation and its successful
resolution is one useful technique. The course
also employs methods for thought relaxation,
deep muscle relaxation and awareness of body
processes. Members of the class identify a specific
goal at the beginning of thecourse: a situation that
is particularly anxiety-producing and how they
would like to react.
The class meets for three weeks, skips three
weeks, and then meets again to reinforce the
progress the student has made toward reaching
the goal.
Jacks said that a wide variety of students have
enrolled in his course, coming from all fields of
interest, with good and poor grades, graduate
students as well as undergraduates.
The course was once geared specifically for
test-taking, but now it deals with any high stress
situation. This is "one of a series of workshops
offered at Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices," Jacks said. "There is an increasing em
phasis on teaching coping skills using an educa
tional model as opposed to a traditional medical
approach (seeing a psychiatrist)," he added.

The Learning Assistance Center (LAC) and Cow
ell's Counseling and Psychological Services are
offering non-credit, four-week workshops on
managing anxiety in an academic environment.
The LAC's course meets twice weekly starting
Oct. 25; Cowell's course will start Oct. 26.
Sallie Kueny, instructor of the LAC's course on
test anxiety, said she sees stress as an often helpful
part of everyday life. However, she said, too much
tension can have a debilitating effect on one's
academic performance and emotional and physi
cal health.
Tremendous capacity
Kueny states, "We have a tremendous capacity
for regulating our response to events in our life,
and it takes specific training to get in touch with
those capacities."
The course employs many methods in teaching
students to release their tension. Autogenic train
ing, a series of relaxation techniques, eases the
tension in different parts of the body: the circulat
ory, respiratory, digestive, and muscular systems.
Progressive relaxation deals with how the whole
body feels, and enables one to release muscle
tension. Kueny said that meditative techniques are
also helpful in bringing about psychological and

emotional equilibrium.
Other methods used in the class include sys
tematic desensitization, breathing control, and
bio-feedback. Desensitization provides a way for
the student to numb himself or herself to stress
through imagining the anxiety-producing situa
tion (i.e. taking a test), imagining the tension and
then imagining relaxation.
Beneficial effect
This rehearsal has a very beneficial effect on the
real situation, Kueny said.
A bio-feedback session puts particular emphasis
on releasing muscular tension, and improving gal
vanic skin response and peripheral body tempera

The LAC course is being offered for the first time
in response to students' requests. The course is
specifically geared toward test anxiety, but the
techniques taught can prove useful in many facets
of a student's life.
"Most of us carry around a great deal of tension
— more than we're aware of," she says. "We need
to learn specific techniques to re-direct the energy
in creative way and experience a sense of well
being."
Dr. Richard Jacks, staff psychologist at Counsel
ing and Psychological Services, said he sees his
anxiety management workshop as a way of "teach
ing people they're not so helpless (in dealing with
stress) as they think they are."
Experience anxiety
He said he believes that people experience anx
iety when they avoid activities that they'd like to
engage in, from social situations to oral tests. Jacks

has been teaching this course for the past few
years, md has had a high rate of success in helping
students handle such anxiety-producing situa
