# Ken Kesey's influence continues at speech on 'dead rights'
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
As I watched and listened to
Ken Kesey last Thursday night
at Flint Center, I slowly began
to sense the unassuming
charisma and down-to-earth
charm that attracted and led
countless "beautiful people"
in starting the psychedelic
movement of the '60s — the
"hippies," the acid takers, the
high-loving heads and hip
world of San Francisco.
You start with Kesey's stir
rings among Stanfords' old
Perry Lane Bohemian intellec
tuals, then go to the free
flowing souls of his La Honda
communal core group — the
Merry Pranksters.
Then to Jerry Garcia and the
Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady,
the Hell's Angels, Jack
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg and
even Kesey's eastern quasi
counterpart Timothy Leary.
Where do you end? You
don't. Kesey's influence is still

great.
Those of you who know of
Kesey in this light are, I'm sure,
disappointed to have missed
him. Those who have read
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" (1962) or "Sometimes A
Great Notion" (1964) can partly
relate. Others should want to.
He spoke as part of a seminar
at De Anza college on "Life and
Death." With him was to be
Elizabeth Kubler Ross, physi
cian, author and "a sensitive
and caring pioneer in the field
of 'consciousness of death.' "
She was ill that night so her
colleague the Rev. Dr.
Mwalimu Imara spoke for the
first part of the program.
Moderator James Fadiman
introduced Kesey by recalling
their acquaintance when "Ken
was a nightworker at the Vete
ran's Hospital" (where he was
introduced to LSD and during
which time he began writing
"Cuckoo's Nest").

This was around 1958 when
he was a creative writing stu
dent here.
"I don't think I can properly
introduce Ken Kesey," Fadi
man said, "So I won't, lust be
aware that the next person who
walks out on stage will be . . .
Ken Kesey."
Applause. Kesey strode out
to the podium. He looked
older than I expected, grayish
red hair, like a wreath semi
circling his reddened, bald
scalp.
He had one of those aged
but-still-young looking faces —
a little frizzled, but hearty. I
could make out a muscular
physique under his big striped
velour shirt and eskimo-wool
vest.
"You know the Bay Area is
like a big laboratory to me," he
began. "And you feel like the
monster coming back to the
laboratory that created you and

Ken Kesey's most famous work, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," was
presented last May to Stanford students in a Roble Hall production.
checking out all the people
that have been keeping tabs on
you."
Again, as he talked, I tried to
picture Kesey, now 40, in all of
his past glory: on the bus with
the Merry Pranksters, endur
ing the heat and dizziness of
their consciousness-raising
cross-country trip; in control
of the Hell's Angels, of peace
rallies and religious youth
meetings; at the Acid-tests and
Haight-Ashbury; in the dayglo
ambience of his La Honda pad;
and as a fugitive in Mexico
evading the FBI for marijuana
charges.
Kesey talked on with a soft
Oregon accent and medium
low voice. It was rich in timbre
with a mild edge to it.
He talked to each person
separately, individually in that
audience, casually moving
about the stage in low boots,
smiling. Good style, but what
about content?
His subject was "dead
rights," a concept which he
never explained specifically,
but used as a general base for
speaking. It took him a minute
or two to get into it.
He referred to Merry Pranks
ter Neal Cassady, who died 11
years ago.
"Neal was a hero to a lot of
people. He had a way of never
choosing one of the two alter
natives in a situation. He would
always find another path," said
Kesey.

"That's what people don't
realize. Like at Governor
Brown's meeting today,"
Kesey referred to a discussion
he had earlier that day with
Brown and others on disarm
ing police.
"They had two choices —
'guns' and 'no guns' and there
are thousands of alternatives
between the two."
He described Cassady's im
aginative character, and then
told how Neal "went out" in
his own high speed style when
he died.
"One night Neal was high
... on acid. And when you're
on acid, you're in the hands of
the people around you, and
they can be very gentle with
you and things go smooth, or
they can really hurt you.
"Well, one night Neal got
with some not so gentle people
and they kind of played with
him — they challenged him to
count the number of railroad
ties between San Miguel
(Mexico) and some other city
about 10 miles away.
"So Neal goes out — this is
the kind of guy he was — with
out a shirt and holding a bottle
of tequila. The next day the
railroad crew found him beside
the tracks and took him to the
hospital. Before he died, his
last words were ... six
thousand four hundred twenty
eight.
"That's typical of Cassady.
That's the way he went out.
That's the way he was.

"How we go out is the way
we begin again afterwards,"
Kesey said. "And if you despair
and despair, you just lose more
and more of your soul until it
just disappears.
"If you look at it the right
way, if you look forward to it
. . . how we go out is so impor
tant."
Things were rolling pretty
well by this time and to really
get it off, Kesey asked, "Have
you ever thought of whooping
it up and having the dead folks
in?" He repeated this ". . . and
calling in the dead folk?"
"We're gonna do something
here," he rubbed his hands
and grinned. People squirmed.
"I haven't done this for a long
time. We're gonna do a gong
gong."
He instructed the crowd,
most of whom were older per
sons who came to hear Ross
and a few "hippie-types," in a
hyperventilation exercise.
They clasped hands and ended
with a "get up and hoot and call
in the dead however you
want."
We'did it. We held in the last
breath and "00000 . . ." the
sound of people 000-ing rose
in high pitched hoots like
human sirens.
I swooned and Dr. Imara
passed out on stage for a mo
ment. There was total audience
participation.
"Since I'm in the Bay Area,
I've gotta say something about
acid," said Kesey. The crowd

hooted and clapped enthusias
tically.
He said acid is a very spiritual
experience and when you take
it you are "sort of reborn into a
different person. But after a
few times, that new soul begins
to become suspicious of the
drug taker.
"It's just like urban re
newal," he smiled, implying
that one can get rid of the old
and build over it a number of
times, but you still really ha
ven't changed what you had.
In his discussion of life and
death, Kesey brought up the
value of "the container" and
how you can tell so much
about a society's values by its
containers.
"Look at the Egyptian
pyramids and the Grecian
urns," he said.
He said our wasteful society
will be known by future gener
ations for how it gave priority
to electric conveniences and
comforts over considerations
of the future.
"We will shave ourselves to
death," he said.
Kesey ended the presenta
tion with repeated emphasis
on the value of life.
He concluded the seminar
by saying, "We are all on a
journey through eternity. We
have all seen each other before
and will see each other again.
And it's how we treat each
other in these interactions that
determines how well we will
fare in the midterm of death."
As I watched and listened to
Ken Kesey last Thursday night
at Flint Center, I slowly began
to sense the unassuming
charisma and down-to-earth
charm that attracted and led
countless "beautiful people"
in starting the psychedelic
movement of the '60s — the
"hippies," the acid takers, the
high-loving heads and hip
world of San Francisco.
You start with Kesey's stir
rings among Stanfords' old
Perry Lane Bohemian intellec
tuals, then go to the free
flowing souls of his La Honda
communal core group — the
Merry Pranksters.
Then to Jerry Garcia and the
Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady,
the Hell's Angels, Jack
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg and
even Kesey's eastern quasi
counterpart Timothy Leary.

don't. Kesey's influence is still

a little frizzled, but hearty. I

"So Neal goes out — this is
the kind of guy he was — with
out a shirt and holding a bottle
of tequila. The next day the
railroad crew found him beside
the tracks and took him to the
hospital. Before he died, his
last words were ... six
thousand four hundred twenty
eight.
"That's typical of Cassady.
That's the way he went out.
That's the way he was.

"How we go out is the way
we begin again afterwards,"
Kesey said. "And if you despair
and despair, you just lose more
and more of your soul until it
just disappears.
"If you look at it the right
way, if you look forward to it
. . . how we go out is so impor
tant."
Things were rolling pretty
well by this time and to really
get it off, Kesey asked, "Have
you ever thought of whooping
it up and having the dead folks
in?" He repeated this ". . . and
calling in the dead folk?"
"We're gonna do something
here," he rubbed his hands
and grinned. People squirmed.
"I haven't done this for a long
time. We're gonna do a gong
gong."
He instructed the crowd,
most of whom were older per
sons who came to hear Ross
and a few "hippie-types," in a
hyperventilation exercise.
They clasped hands and ended
with a "get up and hoot and call
in the dead however you
want."
We'did it. We held in the last
breath and "00000 . . ." the
sound of people 000-ing rose
in high pitched hoots like
human sirens.
I swooned and Dr. Imara
passed out on stage for a mo
ment. There was total audience
participation.
"Since I'm in the Bay Area,
I've gotta say something about
acid," said Kesey. The crowd

hooted and clapped enthusias
tically.
He said acid is a very spiritual
experience and when you take
it you are "sort of reborn into a
different person. But after a
few times, that new soul begins
to become suspicious of the
drug taker.
"It's just like urban re
newal," he smiled, implying
that one can get rid of the old
and build over it a number of
times, but you still really ha
ven't changed what you had.
In his discussion of life and
death, Kesey brought up the
value of "the container" and
how you can tell so much
about a society's values by its
containers.
"Look at the Egyptian
pyramids and the Grecian
urns," he said.
He said our wasteful society
will be known by future gener
ations for how it gave priority
to electric conveniences and
comforts over considerations
of the future.
"We will shave ourselves to
death," he said.
Kesey ended the presenta
tion with repeated emphasis
on the value of life.
He concluded the seminar
by saying, "We are all on a
journey through eternity. We
have all seen each other before
and will see each other again.
And it's how we treat each
other in these interactions that
determines how well we will
fare in the midterm of death."
As I watched and listened to
Ken Kesey last Thursday night
at Flint Center, I slowly began
to sense the unassuming
charisma and down-to-earth
charm that attracted and led
countless "beautiful people"
in starting the psychedelic
movement of the '60s — the
"hippies," the acid takers, the
high-loving heads and hip
world of San Francisco.
You start with Kesey's stir
rings among Stanfords' old
Perry Lane Bohemian intellec
tuals, then go to the free
flowing souls of his La Honda
communal core group — the
Merry Pranksters.
Then to Jerry Garcia and the
Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady,
the Hell's Angels, Jack
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg and
even Kesey's eastern quasi
counterpart Timothy Leary.
Where do you end? You
don't. Kesey's influence is still

great.
Those of you who know of
Kesey in this light are, I'm sure,
disappointed to have missed
him. Those who have read
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" (1962) or "Sometimes A
Great Notion" (1964) can partly
relate. Others should want to.
He spoke as part of a seminar
at De Anza college on "Life and
Death." With him was to be
Elizabeth Kubler Ross, physi
cian, author and "a sensitive
and caring pioneer in the field
of 'consciousness of death.' "
She was ill that night so her
colleague the Rev. Dr.
Mwalimu Imara spoke for the
first part of the program.
Moderator James Fadiman
introduced Kesey by recalling
their acquaintance when "Ken
was a nightworker at the Vete
ran's Hospital" (where he was
introduced to LSD and during
which time he began writing
"Cuckoo's Nest").

This was around 1958 when
he was a creative writing stu
dent here.
"I don't think I can properly
introduce Ken Kesey," Fadi
man said, "So I won't, lust be
aware that the next person who
walks out on stage will be . . .
Ken Kesey."
Applause. Kesey strode out
to the podium. He looked
older than I expected, grayish
red hair, like a wreath semi
circling his reddened, bald
scalp.
He had one of those aged
but-still-young looking faces —
a little frizzled, but hearty. I
could make out a muscular
physique under his big striped
velour shirt and eskimo-wool
vest.
"You know the Bay Area is
like a big laboratory to me," he
began. "And you feel like the
monster coming back to the
laboratory that created you and

Ken Kesey's most famous work, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," was
presented last May to Stanford students in a Roble Hall production.
checking out all the people
that have been keeping tabs on
you."
Again, as he talked, I tried to
picture Kesey, now 40, in all of
his past glory: on the bus with
the Merry Pranksters, endur
ing the heat and dizziness of
their consciousness-raising
cross-country trip; in control
of the Hell's Angels, of peace
rallies and religious youth
meetings; at the Acid-tests and
Haight-Ashbury; in the dayglo
ambience of his La Honda pad;
and as a fugitive in Mexico
evading the FBI for marijuana
charges.
Kesey talked on with a soft
Oregon accent and medium
low voice. It was rich in timbre
with a mild edge to it.
He talked to each person
separately, individually in that
audience, casually moving
about the stage in low boots,
smiling. Good style, but what
about content?
His subject was "dead
rights," a concept which he
never explained specifically,
but used as a general base for
speaking. It took him a minute
or two to get into it.
He referred to Merry Pranks
ter Neal Cassady, who died 11
years ago.
"Neal was a hero to a lot of
people. He had a way of never
choosing one of the two alter
natives in a situation. He would
always find another path," said
Kesey.

"That's what people don't
realize. Like at Governor
Brown's meeting today,"
Kesey referred to a discussion
he had earlier that day with
Brown and others on disarm
ing police.
"They had two choices —
'guns' and 'no guns' and there
are thousands of alternatives
between the two."
He described Cassady's im
aginative character, and then
told how Neal "went out" in
his own high speed style when
he died.
"One night Neal was high
... on acid. And when you're
on acid, you're in the hands of
the people around you, and
they can be very gentle with
you and things go smooth, or
they can really hurt you.
"Well, one night Neal got
with some not so gentle people
and they kind of played with
him — they challenged him to
count the number of railroad
ties between San Miguel
(Mexico) and some other city
about 10 miles away.
"So Neal goes out — this is
the kind of guy he was — with
out a shirt and holding a bottle
of tequila. The next day the
railroad crew found him beside
the tracks and took him to the
hospital. Before he died, his
last words were ... six
thousand four hundred twenty
eight.
"That's typical of Cassady.

That's the way he was.

"How we go out is the way

to the podium. He looked
older than I expected, grayish
red hair, like a wreath semi
circling his reddened, bald
scalp.
He had one of those aged
but-still-young looking faces —
a little frizzled, but hearty. I
could make out a muscular
physique under his big striped
velour shirt and eskimo-wool
vest.
"You know the Bay Area is
like a big laboratory to me," he
began. "And you feel like the
monster coming back to the
laboratory that created you and

Ken Kesey's most famous work, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," was
presented last May to Stanford students in a Roble Hall production.
checking out all the people
that have been keeping tabs on
you."
Again, as he talked, I tried to
picture Kesey, now 40, in all of
his past glory: on the bus with
the Merry Pranksters, endur
ing the heat and dizziness of
their consciousness-raising
cross-country trip; in control
of the Hell's Angels, of peace
rallies and religious youth
meetings; at the Acid-tests and
Haight-Ashbury; in the dayglo
ambience of his La Honda pad;
and as a fugitive in Mexico
evading the FBI for marijuana
charges.
Kesey talked on with a soft
Oregon accent and medium
low voice. It was rich in timbre
with a mild edge to it.
He talked to each person
separately, individually in that
audience, casually moving
about the stage in low boots,
smiling. Good style, but what
about content?
His subject was "dead
rights," a concept which he
never explained specifically,
but used as a general base for
speaking. It took him a minute
or two to get into it.
He referred to Merry Pranks
ter Neal Cassady, who died 11
years ago.
"Neal was a hero to a lot of
people. He had a way of never
choosing one of the two alter
natives in a situation. He would
always find another path," said
Kesey.

"That's what people don't
realize. Like at Governor
Brown's meeting today,"
Kesey referred to a discussion
he had earlier that day with
Brown and others on disarm
ing police.
"They had two choices —
'guns' and 'no guns' and there
are thousands of alternatives
between the two."
He described Cassady's im
aginative character, and then
told how Neal "went out" in
his own high speed style when
he died.
"One night Neal was high
... on acid. And when you're
on acid, you're in the hands of
the people around you, and
they can be very gentle with
you and things go smooth, or
they can really hurt you.
"Well, one night Neal got
with some not so gentle people
and they kind of played with
him — they challenged him to
count the number of railroad
ties between San Miguel
(Mexico) and some other city
about 10 miles away.
"So Neal goes out — this is
the kind of guy he was — with
out a shirt and holding a bottle
of tequila. The next day the
railroad crew found him beside
the tracks and took him to the
hospital. Before he died, his
last words were ... six
thousand four hundred twenty
eight.
"That's typical of Cassady.
That's the way he went out.
That's the way he was.

"How we go out is the way
we begin again afterwards,"
Kesey said. "And if you despair
and despair, you just lose more
and more of your soul until it
just disappears.
"If you look at it the right
way, if you look forward to it
. . . how we go out is so impor
tant."
Things were rolling pretty
well by this time and to really
get it off, Kesey asked, "Have
you ever thought of whooping
it up and having the dead folks
in?" He repeated this ". . . and
calling in the dead folk?"
"We're gonna do something
here," he rubbed his hands
and grinned. People squirmed.
"I haven't done this for a long
time. We're gonna do a gong
gong."
He instructed the crowd,
most of whom were older per
sons who came to hear Ross
and a few "hippie-types," in a
hyperventilation exercise.
They clasped hands and ended
with a "get up and hoot and call
in the dead however you
want."
We'did it. We held in the last
breath and "00000 . . ." the
sound of people 000-ing rose
in high pitched hoots like
human sirens.
I swooned and Dr. Imara
passed out on stage for a mo
ment. There was total audience
participation.
"Since I'm in the Bay Area,
I've gotta say something about
acid," said Kesey. The crowd

hooted and clapped enthusias
tically.
He said acid is a very spiritual
experience and when you take
it you are "sort of reborn into a
different person. But after a
few times, that new soul begins
to become suspicious of the
drug taker.
"It's just like urban re
newal," he smiled, implying
that one can get rid of the old
and build over it a number of
times, but you still really ha
ven't changed what you had.
In his discussion of life and
death, Kesey brought up the
value of "the container" and
how you can tell so much
about a society's values by its
containers.
"Look at the Egyptian
pyramids and the Grecian
urns," he said.
He said our wasteful society
will be known by future gener
ations for how it gave priority
to electric conveniences and
comforts over considerations
of the future.
"We will shave ourselves to
death," he said.
Kesey ended the presenta
tion with repeated emphasis
on the value of life.
He concluded the seminar
by saying, "We are all on a
journey through eternity. We
have all seen each other before
and will see each other again.
And it's how we treat each
other in these interactions that
determines how well we will
fare in the midterm of death."
As I watched and listened to
Ken Kesey last Thursday night
at Flint Center, I slowly began
to sense the unassuming
charisma and down-to-earth
charm that attracted and led
countless "beautiful people"
in starting the psychedelic
movement of the '60s — the
"hippies," the acid takers, the
high-loving heads and hip
world of San Francisco.
You start with Kesey's stir
rings among Stanfords' old
Perry Lane Bohemian intellec
tuals, then go to the free
flowing souls of his La Honda
communal core group — the
Merry Pranksters.
Then to Jerry Garcia and the
Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady,
the Hell's Angels, Jack
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg and
even Kesey's eastern quasi
counterpart Timothy Leary.
Where do you end? You
don't. Kesey's influence is still

great.
Those of you who know of
Kesey in this light are, I'm sure,
disappointed to have missed
him. Those who have read
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" (1962) or "Sometimes A
Great Notion" (1964) can partly
relate. Others should want to.
He spoke as part of a seminar
at De Anza college on "Life and
Death." With him was to be
Elizabeth Kubler Ross, physi
cian, author and "a sensitive
and caring pioneer in the field
of 'consciousness of death.' "
She was ill that night so her
colleague the Rev. Dr.
Mwalimu Imara spoke for the
first part of the program.
Moderator James Fadiman
introduced Kesey by recalling
their acquaintance when "Ken
was a nightworker at the Vete
ran's Hospital" (where he was
introduced to LSD and during
which time he began writing
"Cuckoo's Nest").

This was around 1958 when
he was a creative writing stu
dent here.
"I don't think I can properly
introduce Ken Kesey," Fadi
man said, "So I won't, lust be
aware that the next person who
walks out on stage will be . . .
Ken Kesey."
Applause. Kesey strode out
to the podium. He looked
older than I expected, grayish
red hair, like a wreath semi
circling his reddened, bald
scalp.
He had one of those aged
but-still-young looking faces —
a little frizzled, but hearty. I
could make out a muscular
physique under his big striped
velour shirt and eskimo-wool

that one can get rid of the old
and build over it a number of
times, but you still really ha
ven't changed what you had.
In his discussion of life and
death, Kesey brought up the
value of "the container" and
how you can tell so much
about a society's values by its
containers.
"Look at the Egyptian
pyramids and the Grecian
urns," he said.
He said our wasteful society
will be known by future gener
ations for how it gave priority
to electric conveniences and
comforts over considerations
of the future.
"We will shave ourselves to
death," he said.
Kesey ended the presenta
tion with repeated emphasis
on the value of life.
He concluded the seminar
by saying, "We are all on a
journey through eternity. We
have all seen each other before
and will see each other again.
And it's how we treat each
other in these interactions that
determines how well we will
fare in the midterm of death."
As I watched and listened to
Ken Kesey last Thursday night
at Flint Center, I slowly began
to sense the unassuming
charisma and down-to-earth
charm that attracted and led
countless "beautiful people"
in starting the psychedelic
movement of the '60s — the
"hippies," the acid takers, the
high-loving heads and hip
world of San Francisco.
You start with Kesey's stir
rings among Stanfords' old
Perry Lane Bohemian intellec
tuals, then go to the free
flowing souls of his La Honda
communal core group — the
Merry Pranksters.
Then to Jerry Garcia and the
Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady,
the Hell's Angels, Jack
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg and
even Kesey's eastern quasi
counterpart Timothy Leary.
Where do you end? You
don't. Kesey's influence is still

great.
Those of you who know of
Kesey in this light are, I'm sure,
disappointed to have missed
him. Those who have read
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" (1962) or "Sometimes A
Great Notion" (1964) can partly
relate. Others should want to.
He spoke as part of a seminar
at De Anza college on "Life and
Death." With him was to be
Elizabeth Kubler Ross, physi
cian, author and "a sensitive
and caring pioneer in the field
of 'consciousness of death.' "
She was ill that night so her
colleague the Rev. Dr.
Mwalimu Imara spoke for the
first part of the program.
Moderator James Fadiman
introduced Kesey by recalling
their acquaintance when "Ken
was a nightworker at the Vete
ran's Hospital" (where he was
introduced to LSD and during
which time he began writing
"Cuckoo's Nest").

This was around 1958 when
he was a creative writing stu
dent here.
"I don't think I can properly
introduce Ken Kesey," Fadi
man said, "So I won't, lust be
aware that the next person who
walks out on stage will be . . .
Ken Kesey."
Applause. Kesey strode out
to the podium. He looked
older than I expected, grayish
red hair, like a wreath semi
circling his reddened, bald
scalp.
He had one of those aged
but-still-young looking faces —
a little frizzled, but hearty. I
could make out a muscular
physique under his big striped
velour shirt and eskimo-wool
vest.
"You know the Bay Area is
like a big laboratory to me," he
began. "And you feel like the
monster coming back to the
laboratory that created you and

Ken Kesey's most famous work, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," was
presented last May to Stanford students in a Roble Hall production.
checking out all the people
that have been keeping tabs on
you."
Again, as he talked, I tried to
picture Kesey, now 40, in all of
his past glory: on the bus with
the Merry Pranksters, endur
ing the heat and dizziness of
their consciousness-raising
cross-country trip; in control
of the Hell's Angels, of peace
rallies and religious youth
meetings; at the Acid-tests and
Haight-Ashbury; in the dayglo
ambience of his La Honda pad;
and as a fugitive in Mexico
evading the FBI for marijuana
charges.
Kesey talked on with a soft
Oregon accent and medium
low voice. It was rich in timbre
with a mild edge to it.
He talked to each person
separately, individually in that
audience, casually moving
about the stage in low boots,
smiling. Good style, but what
about content?
His subject was "dead
rights," a concept which he
never explained specifically,
but used as a general base for
speaking. It took him a minute
or two to get into it.
He referred to Merry Pranks
ter Neal Cassady, who died 11
years ago.
"Neal was a hero to a lot of
people. He had a way of never
choosing one of the two alter
natives in a situation. He would
always find another path," said
Kesey.

"That's what people don't
realize. Like at Governor
Brown's meeting today,"
Kesey referred to a discussion
he had earlier that day with
Brown and others on disarm
ing police.
"They had two choices —
'guns' and 'no guns' and there
are thousands of alternatives
between the two."
He described Cassady's im
aginative character, and then
told how Neal "went out" in
his own high speed style when
he died.
"One night Neal was high
... on acid. And when you're
on acid, you're in the hands of
the people around you, and
they can be very gentle with
you and things go smooth, or
they can really hurt you.
"Well, one night Neal got
with some not so gentle people
and they kind of played with
him — they challenged him to
count the number of railroad
ties between San Miguel
(Mexico) and some other city
about 10 miles away.
"So Neal goes out — this is
the kind of guy he was — with
out a shirt and holding a bottle
of tequila. The next day the
railroad crew found him beside
the tracks and took him to the
hospital. Before he died, his
last words were ... six
thousand four hundred twenty
eight.
"That's typical of Cassady.
That's the way he went out.
That's the way he was.

"How we go out is the way
we begin again afterwards,"
Kesey said. "And if you despair
and despair, you just lose more
and more of your soul until it
just disappears.
"If you look at it the right
way, if you look forward to it
. . . how we go out is so impor
tant."
Things were rolling pretty
well by this time and to really
get it off, Kesey asked, "Have
you ever thought of whooping
it up and having the dead folks
in?" He repeated this ". . . and
calling in the dead folk?"
"We're gonna do something
here," he rubbed his hands
and grinned. People squirmed.
"I haven't done this for a long
time. We're gonna do a gong
gong."
He instructed the crowd,
most of whom were older per
sons who came to hear Ross
and a few "hippie-types," in a
hyperventilation exercise.
They clasped hands and ended
with a "get up and hoot and call
in the dead however you
want."
We'did it. We held in the last
breath and "00000 . . ." the
sound of people 000-ing rose
in high pitched hoots like
human sirens.
I swooned and Dr. Imara
passed out on stage for a mo
ment. There was total audience
participation.
"Since I'm in the Bay Area,
I've gotta say something about
acid," said Kesey. The crowd

hooted and clapped enthusias
tically.
He said acid is a very spiritual
experience and when you take
it you are "sort of reborn into a
different person. But after a
few times, that new soul begins
to become suspicious of the
drug taker.
"It's just like urban re
newal," he smiled, implying
that one can get rid of the old
and build over it a number of
times, but you still really ha
ven't changed what you had.
In his discussion of life and
death, Kesey brought up the
value of "the container" and
how you can tell so much
about a society's values by its
containers.
"Look at the Egyptian
pyramids and the Grecian
urns," he said.

of the future.
"We will shave ourselves to

He concluded the seminar
by saying, "We are all on a
journey through eternity. We
have all seen each other before
and will see each other again.
And it's how we treat each

determines how well we will
