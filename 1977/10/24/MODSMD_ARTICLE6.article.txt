# Ken Kesey's influence continues at speech on 'dead rights'
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
As I watched and listened to
Ken Kesey last Thursday night
at Flint Center, I slowly began
to sense the unassuming
charisma and down-to-earth
charm that attracted and led
countless "beautiful people"
in starting the psychedelic
movement of the '60s — the
"hippies," the acid takers, the
high-loving heads and hip
world of San Francisco.
You start with Kesey's stir
rings among Stanfords' old
Perry Lane Bohemian intellec
tuals, then go to the free
flowing souls of his La Honda
communal core group — the
Merry Pranksters.
Then to Jerry Garcia and the
Grateful Dead, Neal Cassady,
the Hell's Angels, Jack
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg and
even Kesey's eastern quasi
counterpart Timothy Leary.
Where do you end? You
don't. Kesey's influence is still

great.
Those of you who know of
Kesey in this light are, I'm sure,
disappointed to have missed
him. Those who have read
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" (1962) or "Sometimes A
Great Notion" (1964) can partly
relate. Others should want to.
He spoke as part of a seminar
at De Anza college on "Life and
Death." With him was to be
Elizabeth Kubler Ross, physi

and caring pioneer in the field
of 'consciousness of death.' "
She was ill that night so her
colleague the Rev. Dr.
Mwalimu Imara spoke for the
first part of the program.
Moderator James Fadiman
introduced Kesey by recalling
their acquaintance when "Ken
was a nightworker at the Vete
ran's Hospital" (where he was
introduced to LSD and during
which time he began writing
"Cuckoo's Nest").

This was around 1958 when
he was a creative writing stu
dent here.
"I don't think I can properly
introduce Ken Kesey," Fadi
man said, "So I won't, lust be
aware that the next person who
walks out on stage will be . . .
Ken Kesey."
Applause. Kesey strode out
to the podium. He looked
older than I expected, grayish
red hair, like a wreath semi
circling his reddened, bald
scalp.
He had one of those aged
but-still-young looking faces —
a little frizzled, but hearty. I
could make out a muscular
physique under his big striped
velour shirt and eskimo-wool
vest.
"You know the Bay Area is
like a big laboratory to me," he
began. "And you feel like the
monster coming back to the
laboratory that created you and

Ken Kesey's most famous work, "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," was
presented last May to Stanford students in a Roble Hall production.
