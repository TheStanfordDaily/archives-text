# Is college worth it?
## Education's price 
### 
Richard Fearon

Despite the substantial increases
in tuition and living expenses that
have occurred at Stanford over the
last three years, a new study of the
highest-priced U.S. colleges ranks
Stanford a mere ninth.
MIT heads the list of most costly
schools, writes Mainliner Magazine,
requiring its undergraduates to pay
an estimated total (including enter
tainment) of $7950 per year. Harvard
comes in second, posting a total of
$7650.
The University of Pennsylvania,
Columbia, Princeton, Bennington
College, and Hampshire College oc
cupy spaces three through eight.
Stanford follows at $7365 per year
and Yale brings up the rear of the top
10, charging a mere $7175.
More astounding than the relative
ranking of schools is the absolute
size of the expenses incurred at th
ese, some of the nation's best private
universities.
Few parents would have estimated
three years ago that a freshman who
started Stanford at somewhere
around $5200 per year would now be
in the middle of the $7000 range.
The size of these figures should
cause prospective parents and stu
dents to seriously consider the
merits of attending elite private
schools over state schools, or, for
that matter, the merits of attending
college versus obtaining a job im
mediately after high school.
Reasons
One first needs to clarify his
reasons for attending college. Does
one go merely for the increased earn
ings he expects college graduates to
reap?
Surveys taken by the American
Council of Education have indicated
that a majority of college students
feel that ihe principal benefit of col
lege is monetary. However, it is not
so clear that a college education will
enable one to increase his lifetime
earnings.
Besides the costs incurred in
college-related expenses, a college
student foregoes the income he
could have earned had he been
working full-time. Today's freshman
at an elite school is likely to pay from
$30,000 to $35,000 merely on under
graduate education, and he is likely
to lose anywhere from $32,000 to
$50,000 in lost income.
$48,000 to $57,000 education
Deducting living expenses from
the income foregone by going to col
lege, a student at an expensive pri
vate school is paying from $48,000 to
$57,000 for his education. And in to
day's flooded job markets, a mere
bachelor's degree may not be suffi
cient to land a high-paying job.
Thus, a high percentage of stu

dents go on to graduate studies — at
Stanford, this number totals nearly
80 per cent. Add another $50,000 to
$75,000 in costs.
The total cost of someone attend
ing Stanford, and then obtaining a
JD/MBA degree from Harvard, for
example, can total almost $130,000. It
takes a hell of a lot of increased in
come to compensate for the value of
this $140,000, had it merely been
placed in a bank to collect interest.
Schooling a waste
Figures on average salaries of
those who are college graduates, as
opposed to those who are not, indi
cate that for many, college probably
failed to increase their earning
power. According to Jacob Mincer,
an economist at Columbia, "for, say,
20 to 30 per cent of students at any
level, the additional schooling has
been a waste, at least in terms of
earnings."
The only way to positively isolate
the causal link between college and
increased income would be to follow
the careers of the identical person, in
the first case, not having gone to col
lege, and in the second, having at
tended college. Such an experiment,
naturally, is impossible.
Education hinders
The proposition has been for
warded that, rather than augmenting
one's future earnings, education
merely hinders certain individuals,
since it may impair their creativity.
Numerous examples of financially
successful people who have little
formal education are presented to
corroborate this assertion.
Apart from an individual's decision
on whether to attend college, one
must also question whether such a
large portion of our resources
should be spent on higher educa
tion. This question is particularly
applicable to public universities and
to community colleges.
The costs of running a large public
university closely approximately
those of private colleges; for exam
ple, the budgets at Berkeley and
Stanford are of similar magnitude.
And since Berkeley charges its stu
dents so much less, the deficit must
be made up through tax revenues.
Tax money?
Should tax money go to students at
these schools?
Although one might argue that
public universities for the most part
provide an education that benefits
society in greater productivity, it is
difficult to argue that community col
leges fulfill the same function.
Presently, the United States is
educating many more people than
can find jobs requiring their
newly-acquired skills. The result of
this overeducation is that jobs for-

merly held by a mere high school
graduate end up being filled by
someone with more advanced
schooling — viz. the educational at
tainments of janitors, for example,
tend to advance.
Community colleges especially
aggravate this condition, since they
primarily educate the most marginal
of students. Therefore, assuming
that societal benefit is a rationale for
providing public funds for educa
tion, the public funding of commun
ity colleges should be greatly re
duced.
A proviso concerning these policy
prescriptions is in order, however.
Many contend that the benefits of
schooling are much more than in
creased career possibilities and
higher income flows. And I think it is
certainly true that education
broadens a person, making him
more aware of his place in the world
and of the meaning of his life.
In any calculation of the value of
education, the noneconomic
"value" needs to be kept in mind.
Thus, the answers to the educational
dilemmas presented earlier are not
nearly so perspicuous as they may
appear at first sight.

universities.
Few parents would have estimated
three years ago that a freshman who
started Stanford at somewhere
around $5200 per year would now be
in the middle of the $7000 range.
The size of these figures should
cause prospective parents and stu
dents to seriously consider the
merits of attending elite private
schools over state schools, or, for
that matter, the merits of attending
college versus obtaining a job im
mediately after high school.
Reasons
One first needs to clarify his
reasons for attending college. Does
one go merely for the increased earn
ings he expects college graduates to
reap?
Surveys taken by the American
Council of Education have indicated
that a majority of college students
feel that ihe principal benefit of col
lege is monetary. However, it is not
so clear that a college education will
enable one to increase his lifetime
earnings.
Besides the costs incurred in
college-related expenses, a college
student foregoes the income he
could have earned had he been
working full-time. Today's freshman
at an elite school is likely to pay from
$30,000 to $35,000 merely on under
graduate education, and he is likely
to lose anywhere from $32,000 to
$50,000 in lost income.
$48,000 to $57,000 education
Deducting living expenses from
the income foregone by going to col
lege, a student at an expensive pri
vate school is paying from $48,000 to
$57,000 for his education. And in to
day's flooded job markets, a mere
bachelor's degree may not be suffi
cient to land a high-paying job.
Thus, a high percentage of stu

dents go on to graduate studies — at
Stanford, this number totals nearly
80 per cent. Add another $50,000 to
$75,000 in costs.
The total cost of someone attend
ing Stanford, and then obtaining a
JD/MBA degree from Harvard, for
example, can total almost $130,000. It
takes a hell of a lot of increased in
come to compensate for the value of
this $140,000, had it merely been
placed in a bank to collect interest.
Schooling a waste
Figures on average salaries of
those who are college graduates, as
opposed to those who are not, indi
cate that for many, college probably
failed to increase their earning
power. According to Jacob Mincer,
an economist at Columbia, "for, say,
20 to 30 per cent of students at any
level, the additional schooling has
been a waste, at least in terms of
earnings."
The only way to positively isolate
the causal link between college and
increased income would be to follow
the careers of the identical person, in
the first case, not having gone to col
lege, and in the second, having at
tended college. Such an experiment,
naturally, is impossible.
Education hinders
The proposition has been for
warded that, rather than augmenting
one's future earnings, education
merely hinders certain individuals,
since it may impair their creativity.
Numerous examples of financially
successful people who have little
formal education are presented to
corroborate this assertion.
Apart from an individual's decision
on whether to attend college, one
must also question whether such a
large portion of our resources
should be spent on higher educa
tion. This question is particularly
applicable to public universities and
to community colleges.
The costs of running a large public
university closely approximately
those of private colleges; for exam
ple, the budgets at Berkeley and
Stanford are of similar magnitude.
And since Berkeley charges its stu
dents so much less, the deficit must
be made up through tax revenues.
Tax money?
Should tax money go to students at
these schools?
Although one might argue that
public universities for the most part
provide an education that benefits
society in greater productivity, it is
difficult to argue that community col
leges fulfill the same function.
Presently, the United States is
educating many more people than
can find jobs requiring their
newly-acquired skills. The result of
this overeducation is that jobs for-

merly held by a mere high school
graduate end up being filled by
someone with more advanced
schooling — viz. the educational at
tainments of janitors, for example,
tend to advance.
Community colleges especially
aggravate this condition, since they
primarily educate the most marginal
of students. Therefore, assuming
that societal benefit is a rationale for
providing public funds for educa
tion, the public funding of commun
ity colleges should be greatly re
duced.
A proviso concerning these policy
prescriptions is in order, however.
Many contend that the benefits of
schooling are much more than in
creased career possibilities and
higher income flows. And I think it is
certainly true that education
broadens a person, making him
more aware of his place in the world
and of the meaning of his life.
In any calculation of the value of
education, the noneconomic
"value" needs to be kept in mind.
Thus, the answers to the educational
dilemmas presented earlier are not
nearly so perspicuous as they may
appear at first sight.

college-related expenses, a college
student foregoes the income he
could have earned had he been
working full-time. Today's freshman
at an elite school is likely to pay from
$30,000 to $35,000 merely on under
graduate education, and he is likely
to lose anywhere from $32,000 to
$50,000 in lost income.
$48,000 to $57,000 education
Deducting living expenses from
the income foregone by going to col
lege, a student at an expensive pri
vate school is paying from $48,000 to
$57,000 for his education. And in to
day's flooded job markets, a mere
bachelor's degree may not be suffi
cient to land a high-paying job.
Thus, a high percentage of stu

dents go on to graduate studies — at
Stanford, this number totals nearly
80 per cent. Add another $50,000 to
$75,000 in costs.
The total cost of someone attend
ing Stanford, and then obtaining a
JD/MBA degree from Harvard, for
example, can total almost $130,000. It
takes a hell of a lot of increased in
come to compensate for the value of
this $140,000, had it merely been
placed in a bank to collect interest.
Schooling a waste
Figures on average salaries of
those who are college graduates, as
opposed to those who are not, indi
cate that for many, college probably
failed to increase their earning
power. According to Jacob Mincer,
an economist at Columbia, "for, say,
20 to 30 per cent of students at any
level, the additional schooling has
been a waste, at least in terms of
earnings."
The only way to positively isolate
the causal link between college and
increased income would be to follow
the careers of the identical person, in
the first case, not having gone to col
lege, and in the second, having at
tended college. Such an experiment,
naturally, is impossible.
Education hinders
The proposition has been for
warded that, rather than augmenting
one's future earnings, education
merely hinders certain individuals,
since it may impair their creativity.
Numerous examples of financially
successful people who have little
formal education are presented to
corroborate this assertion.
Apart from an individual's decision
on whether to attend college, one
must also question whether such a
large portion of our resources
should be spent on higher educa
tion. This question is particularly
applicable to public universities and
to community colleges.
The costs of running a large public
university closely approximately
those of private colleges; for exam
ple, the budgets at Berkeley and
Stanford are of similar magnitude.
And since Berkeley charges its stu
dents so much less, the deficit must
be made up through tax revenues.
Tax money?
Should tax money go to students at
these schools?
Although one might argue that
public universities for the most part
provide an education that benefits
society in greater productivity, it is
difficult to argue that community col
leges fulfill the same function.
Presently, the United States is
educating many more people than
can find jobs requiring their
newly-acquired skills. The result of
this overeducation is that jobs for-

merly held by a mere high school
graduate end up being filled by
someone with more advanced
schooling — viz. the educational at
tainments of janitors, for example,
tend to advance.
Community colleges especially
aggravate this condition, since they
primarily educate the most marginal
of students. Therefore, assuming
that societal benefit is a rationale for
providing public funds for educa
tion, the public funding of commun
ity colleges should be greatly re
duced.
A proviso concerning these policy
prescriptions is in order, however.
Many contend that the benefits of
schooling are much more than in
creased career possibilities and
higher income flows. And I think it is
certainly true that education
broadens a person, making him
more aware of his place in the world
and of the meaning of his life.
In any calculation of the value of
education, the noneconomic
"value" needs to be kept in mind.
Thus, the answers to the educational
dilemmas presented earlier are not
nearly so perspicuous as they may
appear at first sight.

Despite the substantial increases
in tuition and living expenses that
have occurred at Stanford over the
last three years, a new study of the
highest-priced U.S. colleges ranks
Stanford a mere ninth.
MIT heads the list of most costly
schools, writes Mainliner Magazine,
requiring its undergraduates to pay
an estimated total (including enter
tainment) of $7950 per year. Harvard
comes in second, posting a total of
$7650.
The University of Pennsylvania,
Columbia, Princeton, Bennington
College, and Hampshire College oc
cupy spaces three through eight.
Stanford follows at $7365 per year
and Yale brings up the rear of the top
10, charging a mere $7175.
More astounding than the relative
ranking of schools is the absolute
size of the expenses incurred at th
ese, some of the nation's best private
universities.
Few parents would have estimated
three years ago that a freshman who
started Stanford at somewhere
around $5200 per year would now be
in the middle of the $7000 range.
The size of these figures should
cause prospective parents and stu
dents to seriously consider the
merits of attending elite private
schools over state schools, or, for
that matter, the merits of attending
college versus obtaining a job im
mediately after high school.
Reasons
One first needs to clarify his
reasons for attending college. Does
one go merely for the increased earn
ings he expects college graduates to
reap?
Surveys taken by the American
Council of Education have indicated
that a majority of college students
feel that ihe principal benefit of col
lege is monetary. However, it is not
so clear that a college education will
enable one to increase his lifetime
earnings.
Besides the costs incurred in
college-related expenses, a college
student foregoes the income he
could have earned had he been
working full-time. Today's freshman
at an elite school is likely to pay from
$30,000 to $35,000 merely on under
