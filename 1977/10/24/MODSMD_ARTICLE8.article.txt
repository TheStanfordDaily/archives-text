# Preparing for Europe
## Exploring overseas from the New World 
### 
Tony Peet

Stanford in France, Stanford in
Italy, Stanford in England, Stanford
in East Palo Alto. Differences? Well,
you won't find the last program listed
in any University publication, even
though spending an off-campus year
close to screeching tires and Seven-
Elevens might be considered a valu
able cultural experience. Neverthe
less, moving overseas takes more
preparation than moving to East Palo
Alto, and I think potential applicants
need to consider a perspective which
extends beyond our overseas study
center.

Anyone who's just returned from
an overseas program with Stanford
knows that a lot of other people are
thinking of going. "What's it like?"
they wonder. Good question, and
one that should probably be asked
more often.
I spent last winter and spring at
Stanford in Tours, France and re
turned with good feelings about the
program. I didn't get a chance to see
all of our overseas centers while in
Europe, but in visiting a few I began
to realize that the differences bet

ween them are great and important
enough to warrant a pretty close look
if you're planning to go. Be aware
that the image in California and real
ity in Europe might not always coin
cide and that speaking Italian doesn't
guarantee a perfect fit into Stanford
in Italy. Other options exist.
Not for everyone
As with most things, Stanford
overseas is not for everyone. It
seems to me that the campuses try to
strike a balance between encourag
ing direct cultural experience,
European-related academics, travel,

and student social life. If that seems
too obvious, the point I'm trying to
make is that someone with an ex
treme interest in any of these areas
might be happier in a different and
probably less costly situation.
A student planning to travel for five
days each week might profit more
from a Eurail Pass and a copy of "Let's
Co Europe" than paying $2000 for a
few units which wouldn't seem that
worthwhile after such a quarter. In
other words, choosing an option tai
lored more to your overseas goals
might eliminate any waste or guilty
feelings which could result from not
"taking advantage" of all that Stan
ford overseas has to offer.
Another myth
Another myth that could use some
fresh air is the idea that spending
only one quarter at an overseas
center is not worthwhile. Most obvi
ously, one quarter is probably better
than none, but additionally someone
with a fairly advanced language abil
ity should consider a more challeng
ing or explorative second quarter
experience.
Although at least two quarters'
time is more than likely a prerequis
ite to getting to know a foreign cul
ture well, one town or city certainly
doesn't reflect a whole country, and I
think there's a lot to be gained by
spending one quarter with Stanford
and moving on to a foreign university
or related situation for the second if
your language ability can handle it.
The other, and equally valid, side of
the coin is that staying around to
build on the connections you've
made is also wnrthwhiio
An awareness of the specifics of
the program you're applying to and
the consideration that perhaps you'll
find yourself elsewhere for the sec
ond quarter are ideas that probably
don't get enough attention around
here. Stop into the Overseas Studies
office where they'll always be ready
to talk about things and, more impor
tantly, question students with diffe
rent interests who've been overseas
before.

Alto; you won't be able to walk over
there and find answers to your ques

only one quarter at an overseas
center is not worthwhile. Most obvi
ously, one quarter is probably better
than none, but additionally someone
with a fairly advanced language abil
ity should consider a more challeng
ing or explorative second quarter
experience.
Although at least two quarters'
time is more than likely a prerequis
ite to getting to know a foreign cul
ture well, one town or city certainly
doesn't reflect a whole country, and I
think there's a lot to be gained by
spending one quarter with Stanford
and moving on to a foreign university
or related situation for the second if
your language ability can handle it.
The other, and equally valid, side of
the coin is that staying around to
build on the connections you've
made is also wnrthwhiio
An awareness of the specifics of
the program you're applying to and
the consideration that perhaps you'll
find yourself elsewhere for the sec
ond quarter are ideas that probably
don't get enough attention around
here. Stop into the Overseas Studies
office where they'll always be ready
to talk about things and, more impor

before.

Stanford in France, Stanford in
Italy, Stanford in England, Stanford
in East Palo Alto. Differences? Well,
you won't find the last program listed
in any University publication, even
though spending an off-campus year
close to screeching tires and Seven-
Elevens might be considered a valu
able cultural experience. Neverthe
less, moving overseas takes more
preparation than moving to East Palo
Alto, and I think potential applicants
need to consider a perspective which
extends beyond our overseas study
center.

Anyone who's just returned from
an overseas program with Stanford
knows that a lot of other people are
thinking of going. "What's it like?"
they wonder. Good question, and
one that should probably be asked
more often.
I spent last winter and spring at
Stanford in Tours, France and re
turned with good feelings about the
program. I didn't get a chance to see
all of our overseas centers while in
Europe, but in visiting a few I began
to realize that the differences bet

ween them are great and important
enough to warrant a pretty close look
if you're planning to go. Be aware
that the image in California and real
ity in Europe might not always coin
cide and that speaking Italian doesn't
guarantee a perfect fit into Stanford
in Italy. Other options exist.
Not for everyone
As with most things, Stanford
overseas is not for everyone. It
seems to me that the campuses try to
strike a balance between encourag
ing direct cultural experience,
European-related academics, travel,

and student social life. If that seems
too obvious, the point I'm trying to
make is that someone with an ex
treme interest in any of these areas
might be happier in a different and
probably less costly situation.
A student planning to travel for five
days each week might profit more
from a Eurail Pass and a copy of "Let's
Co Europe" than paying $2000 for a
few units which wouldn't seem that
worthwhile after such a quarter. In
other words, choosing an option tai
lored more to your overseas goals
might eliminate any waste or guilty
feelings which could result from not
"taking advantage" of all that Stan
ford overseas has to offer.

fresh air is the idea that spending
