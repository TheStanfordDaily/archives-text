# Who's stopping the ERA?

The recent news that White House staffers are search
ing for ways to extend the March 1979 deadline of the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratification must surely
please supporters of the amendment.
Yet the extra three states needed to pass the amend
ment are nowhere in sight. Why have they done nearly
everything but secede to avoid ratifying the ERA?
Some folks might lay the bulk of the blame on state
legislators, since they are the people who actually pass
or reject the legislation. But although state legislators
may be guilty of numerous other things, they are not the
culprits in this case.
Cacophony
Legislators in the states close to ratification, but which
have not yet done so, have attempted to listen to the
voices of their constituents, and to act accordingly. In
this case, obviously, the most important and most vocal
constituents are the women themselves. Yet the
cacophony of a multitude of opposing voices is so pro
nounced that the legislators can't hear themselves think.
Faced with such a situation, the lawmakers are basing
their action, or inaction, on both fairness and self
preservation. They should not be expected to make a
commitment, either for or against the amendment,
which will damage both their eardrums and political
careers.
The problem, then, rests with the women. And, like
men on thousands of other occasions, they cannot seem
to decide amongst themselves what to do.
Against the ERA
For example, Phyllis Schafly, who has been termed
things other than a woman, travels about the country
speaking and writing columns against the ERA. Against
the very amendment that would give constitutional
backing to the fact that Phyllis Schafly and other women
can speak publicly and write publicly and sell used cars

on an equal basis with men.
Jane Fonda, on the other hand, has demonstrated that
liberal women can have a little irony in their careers, too.
Always an example of feminine independence in her
own life, she has played film roles as diverse as a
cutesy-pie college coed, a classy call girl, and most re
cently, a complex, modern role as Lillian Hellman's
friend, Julia. Her characters have been as contrasting as
American women are in real life.
The point is not that )ane Fonda and Phyllis Schafly are
hypocrites. They are definitely not. The point is that, like
men, they are very different from each other. Their sole
major traits in common are that they are both intelligent
and that they both express an ambiguity in their lifestyles
and their work.
Vast variety
Men do the same thing. The difficulty, then, with the
ERA seems to be that American women are as different
from each other as they are from American men. And
long before the present feminist movement began, they
had been proving their vast variety.
Betsy Ross sat at home and sewed flags. Ninety years
later, Harriet Tubman used newer models of the same
flags to cover up slave children smuggled North on the
Underground Railroad. And 50 years after that, Carrie
Nation was busy smashing up saloons while Susan B.
Anthony was quietly rounding up support for female
suffrage.
This diversity of American women is itself reason
enough for passage of the ERA, To make into law what
the women of this country already have proven by
example â€” thatthey can do what they want. Of course, it
is this same diversity which has stalled momentarily, and
maybe indefinitely, the passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment.
