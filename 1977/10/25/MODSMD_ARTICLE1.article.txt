# Hospital, radiologist to settle dispute on access to facility
## 
### Andrea James 
The University Hospital has until
Nov. 1 to negotiate with a radiologist
who has been denied access to the
facility.
Superior Court Judge Barton
Phelps said attorneys for the hospital
and counsel representing William
Hayden, a Palo Alto radiologist, must
meet to discuss a possible formal
hearing before the Board of Hospital
Directors.
Phelps gave his order last week
after listening to both sides respond
orally to the Judge's memorandum of
intended decision written in July. In
that memo, Phelps stated he would
decide in favor of Hayden and force
the hospital to admit him to the med
ical staff.
Shortage
The hospital currently has a severe
shortage of available beds and
operating room time.
"Hayden applied for a position on
the medical staff in February 1976,"
said Gale Mondry, assistant counsel
for medical affairs. "The department
chairman did not recommend
Hayden be admitted on the staff and
Hayden said he wanted a hearing be
fore the Board of Hospital Directors
to determine the reasons why he was
not admitted to the staff."
According to Mondry, a hearing
was arranged but arbitration was
broken off when one of the key wit
nesses became critically ill. Hayden
then took the case to court, claiming
he was entitled to a medical staff pos
ition and that he deserved a hearing
before the Board of Hospital Direc
tors.
At the time, Hayden was a clinical
faculty member, an "unpaid
teacher." He worked one day a
month at the hospital, treating pa

tients and teaching.
As part of the clinical faculty ar
rangement with the University,
Hayden could not keep any profes
sional fees charged to patients. In
stead, all monies were turned over to
the hospital, Mondry said.
Staff rights
As a member of the medical staff,
Hayden would have been able to
treat patients and bill them for his
services, keeping the doctor's fees.
Hayden claims the only basis for
refusal to the medical staff should be
incompetence or some other
specific reason. University lawyers
are basing their case on the hospital's
"closed staff rule" which limits
radiologists to certain kinds of physi
cians, said Mondry.
Hayden was unavailable for com
ment last night.
Since 1968, when the University
bought Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital
from the City of Palo Alto and created
the present community-university
hospital, three clashes have occur
red concerning the hospital's dual
role as a teaching hospital and Palo
Alto community hospital.
In September 1976, Dr. Norman
Shumway, cardiovascular surgery
department chief at the hospital,
cited crowded conditions as the
reason for denying surgical suites to
a four-man heart surgery team led by
Dr. Thomas Fogarty. However, hos
pital officials ruled thai Shumway
had no authority to make that deci
sion and overruled his judgment.
Two other local surgeons, Dr.
Grace Blair and Dr. Cornelius Alcot,
turned in hospital privilege applica
tions for Fogarty's team, but neither

application has been processed
within the time mandated by medical
by-laws. Shumway processes the ap
plications, the San lose Mercury re
ported recently.
Without Shumway's response, ap
plications for hospital privileges
cannot be reviewed by appropriate
committees.
