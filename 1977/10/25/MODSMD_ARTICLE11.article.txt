# The Bakke minority admissions case: opposing views
## A step backwards
### 
With some stops and starts, the United States has
been traveling a road towards equality for 23 years. This
morning that road breaks in two.
Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the
'separate but equal' doctrine in the case of Brown vs. the
Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, the courts and
the federal government have been helping us move
towards equality for all people, regardless of race, color
or national origin — towards a land where all enjoy the
same protection under the law, and have equal oppor
tunity in jobs and education. In the case of the Regents
of the University of California vs. Allan Bakke the U.S.
Supreme Court will be asked to choose which of two
paths the nation should follow in order to reach that goal
of true equality for all citizens. It is a perilous choice, for
if the court chooses the wrong path, we could be led
back to the place we were decades ago.
Allan Bakke's lawyers will argue today before the court
that their client was rejected by the UC Davis Medical
School due to a special admissions program that only
considers members of minority groups for admission.
Bakke is arguing that he was denied admission to medi
cal school because, in effect, he is white. This, says
Bakke, is a violation of his rights under the Fourteenth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which guarantees
equal protection under the law to "any person." Bakke's
argument is essentially that any admissions procedure
using race as a criterion is illegally discriminating. No
use of racial preference in admissions is "benign," says
Bakke, but is an evil "heretofore recognized by the
American judicial system."
Attorneys for the University of California will argue
that race must be used as a criterion in special admission
programs such as the one at the Davis medical school.
Minority applicants, says the university, have suffered
cultural disadvantages not shared by white applicants.
Therefore, these disadvantages may be reflected in the
minority applicants' scores in standardized tests and
grade point averages. The university argues that it is not
lowering its standards or seeking less than qualified
applicants as a result of these "racially sensitive" special
admissions programs. Consideration of race in Davis

medical school admissions, says the university, only be
gins after highly qualified applicants have been accepted
and exceptionally unqualified applicants have been re
jected. And, the university argues, it has an obligation to
integrate medical school classes, to increase minority
representation in the professions and to help break
down racial barriers and stereotypes.
The path the university points to is an inviting one. It
leads to the quick guarantee that a certain number of
black people will soon be doctors, that a certain number
of chicanos will soon be lawyers, that a certain number
of Asians will soon be corporate executives. But that
path, in the not too distant future, would prove to be the
wrong one.
For once we have accepted discrimination by race to
be permitted by the courts and legitimized by the gov
ernment, we are well on our way backwards — past the
civil rights legislation of the 19605, past Birmingham and
Little Rock, past the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision
that legally ended racial discrimination in the United
States.
"The equal protection clause of the (14th Amend
ment)," wrote U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas in 1974, "commands the elimination of racial
barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy our theory
as to how society ought to be organized. . . .If discrimi
nation by race is constitutionally permissible when
those who hold the reins of power come up with com
pelling reasons to justify it, then constitutional guaran
tees acquire an accordianlike quality."
Forbidding race to be used as a criterion in admissions
and hiring does not mean an end to affirmative action,
although enemies of equality will surely try to use it for
their own purposes.
We reassert our commitment to equality in jobs and
education for the historic victims of discrimination, with
more energy and devotion than ever. Special admissions
or recruitment programs for the "economically disad
vantaged" may very well be the best way of achieving
those ends. But whatever form affirmative action takes
in the future, it must preclude the possibility of legalized
racism, against anyone, or for anyone.
