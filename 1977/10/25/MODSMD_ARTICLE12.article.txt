## Healing a wound 
### 
The overriding question that the U.S. Supreme Court
faces today in the Allan Bakke case is whether institu
tions, such as the University of California, may consider
race as one criterion in school admissions and affirma
tive action hiring.
In our view, not only should the university be allowed
to consider race as a criterion — we feel that, at times, it
must.
For 112 years this nation has borne the legacy of slav
ery and has lived with discrimination against the non
white, non-anglo minority. It is a burden that continues
to weigh heavily on every major institution in this coun
try and on the lives of every citizen.
Possibly the greatest accomplishment of the 1960s was
that Americans came to accept the fact that a wound runs
through the heart of this nation, separating the
privileged majority from under-privileged minorities,
separating written promises from social realities. It was
in the 1960s that Americans came to agree that a wound
in the heart must heal.
As a result of the civil rights movement, the federal
government in recent years has committed itself to end
ing the majority's near-monopoly on the best neighbor
hoods, the best schools and the best jobs.
Universities and other institutions found, however,
that those who had suffered generations of discrimina
tion could not instantly compete with those who had
not.
Thus affirmative action came into being — an attempt
to bring about in schools and professions the type of
equality that already exists in the law of the land.
Professional schools, such as the UC Davis medical
school, responded to calls for affirmative action by set
ting up special admission programs that give members
of minority groups the initial boost necessary to integ
rate what have been nearly all white professions.
The faculty decided to let minorities into their classes
the only way they knew how — by taking race into
consideration, along with other factors, in evaluating
prospective students.
The Davis program did not admit unqualified mem
bers of minority groups into medical school. It merely

granted that one of many social obligations of the school
was to provide the public with qualified doctors from
minority communities.
In its decision, the California Supreme Court did not
disagree with the aim of the Davis special admission
program. It merely said that the Medical School should
try to achieve the same ends with a special admissions
program that did not use race as a criterion.
Unfortunately, it is impossible for a school like
Davis to be completely oblivious to race and ethnic
background while at the same time fulfilling its obliga
tion to integrate the medical profession. According to
research done by a number of UC professional school
deans, no other criterion, including taking students who
were raised in an "economically disadvantaged"
background, would achieve a fair representation of
minorities in professional schools.
Another criticism of the Davis program is perhaps a
more profound one. The university may be using race as
a criterion in admissions for benevolent purposes, but
what about the future? If allowed in this case, what
guarantees do we have that others with evil intent will
not misuse such a system in the future?
The answer is that there are no guarantees. Since the
1860s, the process of bringing about equality in an un
equal society has always been fraught with risks. But
because racially conscious admission procedures may
be abused in the future is no reason not to use them
now. For a greater threat is much closer at hand.
If the Supreme Court hands down a broad ruling in the
Bakke case, it could effectively put an end to affirmative
action programs, programs that are necessary to achieve
social equality. The court could once again rip open a
critical wound, and put an end to the healing process
that has just begun.

Thus affirmative action came into being — an attempt
to bring about in schools and professions the type of
equality that already exists in the law of the land.
Professional schools, such as the UC Davis medical
school, responded to calls for affirmative action by set
ting up special admission programs that give members
of minority groups the initial boost necessary to integ
rate what have been nearly all white professions.
The faculty decided to let minorities into their classes
the only way they knew how — by taking race into
consideration, along with other factors, in evaluating
prospective students.
The Davis program did not admit unqualified mem
bers of minority groups into medical school. It merely

granted that one of many social obligations of the school
was to provide the public with qualified doctors from
minority communities.
In its decision, the California Supreme Court did not
disagree with the aim of the Davis special admission
program. It merely said that the Medical School should
try to achieve the same ends with a special admissions
program that did not use race as a criterion.
Unfortunately, it is impossible for a school like
Davis to be completely oblivious to race and ethnic
background while at the same time fulfilling its obliga
tion to integrate the medical profession. According to
research done by a number of UC professional school
deans, no other criterion, including taking students who
were raised in an "economically disadvantaged"
background, would achieve a fair representation of
minorities in professional schools.
Another criticism of the Davis program is perhaps a
more profound one. The university may be using race as
a criterion in admissions for benevolent purposes, but
what about the future? If allowed in this case, what
guarantees do we have that others with evil intent will
not misuse such a system in the future?
The answer is that there are no guarantees. Since the
1860s, the process of bringing about equality in an un
equal society has always been fraught with risks. But
because racially conscious admission procedures may
be abused in the future is no reason not to use them
now. For a greater threat is much closer at hand.
If the Supreme Court hands down a broad ruling in the
Bakke case, it could effectively put an end to affirmative
action programs, programs that are necessary to achieve
social equality. The court could once again rip open a
critical wound, and put an end to the healing process
that has just begun.

Board split 4-3 on the Bakke case. Both the board's major

The overriding question that the U.S. Supreme Court
faces today in the Allan Bakke case is whether institu
tions, such as the University of California, may consider
race as one criterion in school admissions and affirma
tive action hiring.
In our view, not only should the university be allowed
to consider race as a criterion — we feel that, at times, it
must.
For 112 years this nation has borne the legacy of slav
ery and has lived with discrimination against the non
white, non-anglo minority. It is a burden that continues
to weigh heavily on every major institution in this coun
try and on the lives of every citizen.
Possibly the greatest accomplishment of the 1960s was
that Americans came to accept the fact that a wound runs
through the heart of this nation, separating the
privileged majority from under-privileged minorities,
separating written promises from social realities. It was
in the 1960s that Americans came to agree that a wound
in the heart must heal.
As a result of the civil rights movement, the federal
government in recent years has committed itself to end
ing the majority's near-monopoly on the best neighbor
hoods, the best schools and the best jobs.
Universities and other institutions found, however,
that those who had suffered generations of discrimina
tion could not instantly compete with those who had
not.
