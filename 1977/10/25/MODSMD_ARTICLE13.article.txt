# Stanford in Business aids summer interns
##

When you ask senior Bill
Rausch what he did this sum
mer, don't be surprised when
he tells you he flew from his
Pan Am office in New York to
Tokyo, Honolulu and San
Francisco to do a jet fueling
study.
Ask any of the 12 students
placed in summer internships
through Stanford in Business
what they did this summer and
chances are you will be
amazed.
The pay ranged from $800 to
$1100 a month for an average

three-month stint. All interns
"without exception" were of
fered internships at the com
panies next summer, accord
ing to Larry Cerf, co-director of
Stanford in Business, a
student-initiated organization.
Not Mickey Mouse
In a recent discussion with
Stanford in Business adviser
Robert Simon, assistant dean
for corporate relations at the
business school, the students
said their jobs were challeng
ing and definitely not Mickey
Mouse.
"I saw a good spectrum of
the company," said Rausch, an
engineering'aero-astro major
who worked at John F. Ken
nedy airport in New York. "I
met people in operations, ad
ministration, middle manage
ment and people on the
ramp."
After visiting various cities to
observe fueling procedures,
Rausch wrote up suggestions
on how to change the process
to prevent overfueling, one of
three major projects he had to
do this summer.
"From what I've seen,
suggestions tend to move

pretty slowly. I don't think any
thing will come directly out of
(my proposal) but someone
will probably remember it
when the problem arises again
later on," said Rausch.
Glenn Cole, a junor major
ing in mechanical engineering,
worked as a product engineer
keeping track of prototype
weights of 1979 Mustangs at
the Ford Motor Company in
Dearborn, Michigan.
Simon Jones had only taken
one computer class here be
fore he got his job writing
computer programs for testing
a micro processor for an elec
tronic engine control at Ford.
Jones, a junior electrical en
gineering student, said he
learned a lot about computers
in the advance product en
gineering department there.
"Just my boss knew about the
computers in our department
so I only had one source of in
formation. There were ten
older men there who didn't
have the computer
background to help me," said
Jones.
Getting to know the sociol
ogy of a corporation was a
sidelight to Carl Thorns' intern
ship as analyst of pricing opera
tions and revenue accounting
at Pan Am in New York.
Thorns said he wrote up a re
commendation which would
make the current labor inten-

sive pricing operation at Pan
Am more efficient.
Friction
"The problems of instituting
new programs in departments
is that it generates friction bet
ween the industrial engineers
and the departments," said
Thorns, a fifth year co
terminal industrial engineering
major.
"For example, to institute a

cost-reduction program would
show the particular depart
ment in a bad light," he said.
The value of an internship at
Levi Strauss Corporation in San
Francisco is having the oppor
tunity to see "what it's like
working in a business envi
ronment," according to senior
Kevin Martin.
Martin, an industrial en
gineering major, was respon
sible for examining and re
commending changes to a
compensation/benefits plan
for workers within the organi
zation.
"In the business world,
you're under a lot of pressure.
You can set up your own timet
able, but you've got to get your
work done," said Martin.
The value of an internship is
not only to provide jobs for
students, according to Howard
Zack, Stanford in Business co
director.
"Businesses get to know
what young people are think
ing. It's a sort of double expo
sure thing," Zack said.
Twelfth year
Stanford in Business, enter
ing its twelfth year of service, is
an organization whose basic
goals are to set up public dis
cussion panels on business,
cultivate an interest in intern
ship programs at companies
throughout the nation and
send resumes of students to
those companies, according to
the club officers.
"We generally do not re
quire a cover letter or addi
tional letters of recommenda
tion," said Cerf.
"Companies usually just
pick students from the re
sumes that we send them. Like
at Ford, one division Ijked all
the resumes we gave them and
it offered jobs to all (the stu
dents)," said Cerf.
This year's interns were re
quired to pay $50 from their
summer to cover costs
of the service, said Cerf.
Last year's budget was $200
from the ASSU, which was
spent on a brochure on Stan
ford in Business, having letters
autotyped and sent to 55 com
panies inquiring about intern
ships and printing up a letter of
recommendation from Arjay
Miller, dean of the business

school to the business leaders,
said Cerf.
This year, Cerf looks forward
to more funding from the
ASSU as well as from the Office
of Student Activities and the
Academic Organizations
Board.
The group's principal ad
visers are Simon and Callie El
liston, assistant to the director
of student employment at the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC).
Corporate manner
Simon, who worked in client
relations for SRI Interna
tional before coming to the
Biz School in 1970, said he has a
feeling for how corporations
communicate with each other
and the approaches they are
used to when being asked to
institute such things as intern
ship programs.
"I think a corporation that is

considering working with stu
dents in any way likes a very
straightforward, direct, rather
brief approach so that it can get
the essence of what the stu
dents have in mind and can
reach a tentative decision on
what it wants to do. A brief
written approach followed by a

face-to-face meeting and then
a letter proposal is a usual way
to do this," said Simon.
Company heads cannot eas
ily ignore Arjay Miller's cover
letter encouraging company
executives to consider employ
ing Stanford students interns
over the summer. Miller was
the president of Ford Motor
Company.
"I would like to think it (the
letter) would influence,corpo
rate decision makers," said
Simon. "I think Stanford has
such an outstanding reputa
tion nationally now, that more
and more students are getting
good jobs with only four years
of college schooling and train
ing."
Cerf said he sees little con
flict with Stanford In Business
and the CPPC.
"We concentrate primarily
on summer internships. We try

to get the internships started
and keep them going," he said.
Cerf added that Stanford in
Business is willing to assist any
group interested in looking for
jobs for their members such as
the Society of Black Scientists
and Engineers and Women in
Engineering.
