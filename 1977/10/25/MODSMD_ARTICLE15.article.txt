# Purlie: rollin' down South
## 
### 
"Purlie" is a good show in
the right place.
The Broadway hit which
opened last week at the tiny
Phoenix Theater in San Fran
cisco is well-suited to the
cabaret atmosphere: a knee
slapping musical reminiscent
in plot and characterization of
the gay '90s melodramas which
have succeeded in such inti
mate settings for years.
The characters are absurdly
one-dimensional in this
scaled-down version of Ossie
Davis' "Purlie Victorious,"
about the exploits of a black
preacher/con artist and friends
in the pre-Civil Rights South.
The plot is predictable; in the
end, good triumphs over evil
as you always knew it would.
But nobody minds. With a
beer or glass of wine in your
hand, you can settle back and
enjoy rousing songs, funny
posturing, fast-paced banter
and choreography that brings
the players' excitement to the

audience's tables.
Benjamin ]urand is a
dominating figure as Purlie Vic
torius, determined to bilk $500
out of the local plantation
squire — the Ol' Cap'n (Robert
Marshall) — to acquire Big
Bethel for his congregation. A
big man, his voice is resonant
and powerful as he preaches
about black liberation to the
delight of his girlfriend,
Lutiebelle (Sandra Baskin).
We're still with him, under his
sway, even when his ego gets
the best of his veracity in re
counting his brave defense of
freedom and black woman
hood.
Lazima Sana, as the grovel
ing yet cunning Uncle Tom
"deputy for the colored"
under the Ol' Cap'n, is a fine
counterweight to lurand's
strength. His caricature is
complete and surprisingly
realistic, right down to Sana's
ability to use his demeanor to
manipulate his old rebel boss.

But Sana puts in his best ef
fort as choreographer. Putting
good dance numbers onto the
Phoenix's tiny stage is no sim
ple task, but Sana makes use of
both stage and floor areas and
designs dances traditional
enough to fit the plot but mod
ern enough to radiate excite
ment.
The show's two main female
players — Baskin and Patsy
Cain as Missy — have strong,
appropriately church-type voi
ces which show themselves off
in the rousing opening an
them, "Walk Him Up the
Stairs." Jurand and Sana don't
fare quite as well in the songs,
but a lively three-piece piano
band is a help over the rough
spots.
The racial theme of the show

is never lost, and if the audi
ence ever begins to forget,
Marshall quickly steps in to
remind them. He is, perhaps
appropriately, the most
cardboard character in the
show and goes through the
motions of the old southern
racist amusingly if stiffly.
Marshall's long-haired son
Charlie (Scott Oglesby), whose
liberal talk is a constant aggra
vation to the patriarch, is a
character easy to play and Og
lesby does an adequate job.
"Purlie" is snappy, full of
great lines about the condi
tions of blacks in post-Civil
War "freedom," and is ever
so-slightly inspiring while mak
ing no pretense to be so.

The Outlaws headline ASSU Special Events' Oct. 29 concert in Frost
Amphitheatre. Opening the snow are Country Joe McDonald and

Mistress, an all-star group which promises hot music. More on The
Outlaws and an interview-review with Ronnie Laws Thursday.
"Purlie" is a good show in
the right place.
The Broadway hit which
opened last week at the tiny
Phoenix Theater in San Fran
cisco is well-suited to the
cabaret atmosphere: a knee
slapping musical reminiscent
in plot and characterization of
the gay '90s melodramas which
have succeeded in such inti
mate settings for years.
The characters are absurdly
one-dimensional in this
scaled-down version of Ossie
Davis' "Purlie Victorious,"
about the exploits of a black
preacher/con artist and friends
in the pre-Civil Rights South.
The plot is predictable; in the
end, good triumphs over evil
as you always knew it would.
But nobody minds. With a
beer or glass of wine in your
hand, you can settle back and
enjoy rousing songs, funny
posturing, fast-paced banter
and choreography that brings
the players' excitement to the

audience's tables.
Benjamin ]urand is a
dominating figure as Purlie Vic
torius, determined to bilk $500
out of the local plantation
squire — the Ol' Cap'n (Robert
Marshall) — to acquire Big
Bethel for his congregation. A
big man, his voice is resonant
and powerful as he preaches
about black liberation to the
delight of his girlfriend,
Lutiebelle (Sandra Baskin).
We're still with him, under his
sway, even when his ego gets
the best of his veracity in re
counting his brave defense of
freedom and black woman
hood.
Lazima Sana, as the grovel
ing yet cunning Uncle Tom
"deputy for the colored"
under the Ol' Cap'n, is a fine
counterweight to lurand's
strength. His caricature is
complete and surprisingly
realistic, right down to Sana's
ability to use his demeanor to
manipulate his old rebel boss.

But Sana puts in his best ef
fort as choreographer. Putting
good dance numbers onto the
Phoenix's tiny stage is no sim
ple task, but Sana makes use of
both stage and floor areas and
designs dances traditional
enough to fit the plot but mod
ern enough to radiate excite
ment.
The show's two main female
players — Baskin and Patsy
Cain as Missy — have strong,
appropriately church-type voi
ces which show themselves off
in the rousing opening an
them, "Walk Him Up the
Stairs." Jurand and Sana don't
fare quite as well in the songs,
but a lively three-piece piano
band is a help over the rough
spots.
The racial theme of the show

is never lost, and if the audi
ence ever begins to forget,
Marshall quickly steps in to
remind them. He is, perhaps
appropriately, the most
cardboard character in the
show and goes through the
motions of the old southern
racist amusingly if stiffly.
Marshall's long-haired son
Charlie (Scott Oglesby), whose
liberal talk is a constant aggra
vation to the patriarch, is a
character easy to play and Og
lesby does an adequate job.
"Purlie" is snappy, full of
great lines about the condi
tions of blacks in post-Civil
War "freedom," and is ever
so-slightly inspiring while mak
ing no pretense to be so.
