# West Bay's sharp 'Butterfly'
## 
### 
"Madame Butterfly," which
opens the West Bay Opera's
22nd season, lets the audience
hear by proxy through Puc
cini's ears the tragic dissolu
tion of a 19th century Asian-
American marriage.
It provides box office draw
because it is the ideal vehicle to
seduce non-opera goers
through its "hit" song, "Un bel
di," sung beautifully by Geor
gia Prugh (in the title role); and
its exotic sets (Stanford Drama
Prof. Wendell Cole); costumes
(Stanford's Ellen Chambers);
and lighting (Stanford lecturer
Michael Ramsaur).
In his West Bay debut, Mike
Scarpelli, who plays two
timing villain Lt. Pinkerton, ec
lipses the other performers
with his charismatic tenor that
holds without wavering and

reaches the last row as if it were
the first.
Stanford choral director Wil
liam Ramsey conducts a 24
piece orchestra whose string
section will no doubt levitate
from its opening night sous
terre level.
Neil Cooper as Sharpless,
the U.S. consul in Nagasaki, is
the perfect foil to Prugh's But
terfly in the second act duet
where he tries to tell her Pin
kerton has jilted her. Kathleen
Brown as Butterfly's servant
Suzuki is not only vocally but
visually fascinating with her
hunched, subservient shuffl
ing in exotic dress.
An opera buy at $5 a seat, the
West Bay is a valuable addition
to midpeninsula culture.

Center Oct. 29. The alternate
cast, with Stanford doctoral
candidate Stanley Engebretson
as Prince Yamadori, sings Oct.
