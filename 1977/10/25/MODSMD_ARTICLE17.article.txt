# CSN: the magic's still there
## 
### 
They've been deified and
maligned, heralded as
geniuses and fools. Their al
bums together have been clas
sics, but separately they have
met largely with critical ho
hums. They are perhaps the
most enigmatic band in rock's
short history: Crosby, Stills
and Nash. That's CSN folks,
not CSNY, and there's a big dif
ference. The former is a band
that has released only two al
bums (one in 1969 and the
other in 1977) and has never
toured as a single entity until
this past summer. And you've
all heard about the latter.
The first Crosby, Stills and
Nash album is a monument in
rock history, so much so that
even when played today it
sounds better than most con
temporary releases. With the
addition of Neil Young, they
cut two more albums ("Deja Vu"
and the live"Four Way Street"),
then broke up in 1970 at the
height of their success. Since
then, they have recorded and
toured in various combina
tions, but have never achieved
the massive popular acclaim as
individuals that they had as a
band. When they finally re
leased their new album, "CSN,"
last summer everyone won
dered whether or not they
could still make the old magic.
As can be expected, the album
was praised in some circles and
panned in others, but one
thing is certain: Crosby, Stills
and Nash remain one of the
great groups rock and roll has
produced, and Saturday
night's concert at the Oakland
coliseum is ample proof.
They begin their opening
electric set with three familiar
tunes from the CSNY days,
"Pre-Road Downs," "Love the
One You're With" and a beaut
iful version of "The Lee
Shore." Graham Nash, whose
soaring harmonies are the
trademark of the CSfsJ sound, is
in perfect voice. Stephen Stills,

clear-eyed and energetic,
dances happily around the
stage showing off his new
guitar pickup system that al
lows him to play electric guitar
unencumbered by a cord. Stills
uses this new-found mobility
to occasionally retreat behind
the drums and play to the
people seated in the rear of the
coliseum. David Crosby, ham
pered by a sore throat, lay
back, but still sang with preci
sion and played his characteris
tically flawless rhythm guitar.
Following Nash's "Wild
Tales" comes some material
from the new LP. The audi
ence, though a predominantly
older crowd, responds just as
readily to "Just A Song Before I
Co" and the harmonious
"Shadow Captain" as they did
to the opening songs. The
band finishes with a cooking
"Turn Back the Pages," then
takes a short break before re
turning for the acoustic set.
The Oakland Coliseum was
built for basketball, not for
music, and the sound there can
be described as awful at best,
which was especially unfortu
nate considering the delicate
nature of CSN's acoustic
music. This situation was not
aided by the overly zealous
fans who insisted on screaming
during the quiet songs, but the
band made the best of things.
With Stills on guitar and
Crosby and Nash harmonizing,
they perform a pinpoint ver
sions of "Suite: Judy Blue
Eyes" that drew an unbelieva
ble ovation. Stills' guitar play
ing is better than ever, and
while his voice simply is not
what it used to be he sounds
better now than he has live or
on record in the last five years.
When the audience finally
quiets down, Crosby explains
that Stephen used to play the
next song solo, but "Nash
couldn't resist doing it in three
part."
The rest of the set is one

highlight after another.
"Guinnevere," "Our House"
and the haunting "Cathedral"
all feature more excellent vocal
interplay. Then Stills goes to
the piano for "Myth of
Sisyphus," which he follows
with his one-man acoustic
guitar show, the
"Crossroads/Can't Catch Me"
medley.
Next a giant screen is low
ered behind the stage, and a
Cousteau society film of
whales provides a moving
backdrop for "Wind on the
Water" as they switch again to
electric music.
"Deja Vu" which features
Stills' best guitar solo of the
evening, "Fair Came," "Milit
ary Madness" and a short but
blistering "Carry On" closes
the show.
Throughout the evening,
Crosby, Stills and Nash per
form with more cohesion
than they ever have. The show
is shorter than the 316 hour
marathon shows CSNY used to
do, but this could be due partly
to Crosby's throat ailment.
Though his soreness kept him
mostly in the background,
Crosby's singing showed that
he remains one of the most im
aginative vocalists in rock.
And Graham Nash, long the
steadying influence of the
group, was noticeably content
as the show ran smoothly from
start to finish.
So it was just CSN this time
around, and a few points were
made quite clear. They are not,
and have never been, the mus
ical geniuses their fans have
made them out to be. Nor are
they the overrated, overpaid
has-beens that some members
of the press have dubbed
them. They are, put simply,
three talented and capable
musicians who together, even
after all this time, create some
of the best music being played
today.
