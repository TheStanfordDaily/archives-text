'Special Day' for Loren
The highlight of last week's
San Francisco Film Festival, "A
Special Day" is set in 1938
Rome, on the day Hitler and
Mussolini celebrate their first
meeting with a huge rally. The
film focuses on two people liv
ing in a large apartment com
plex who decide not to attend
the gathering: Antonietta, a
harried housewife who is taken
for granted by her husband
and six children; andCabriele,
an anti-fascist homosexual
who iost his job as a govern
ment radio announcer and is to
be shipped to a camp before
the day is over.
Antonietta and Gabriele are
strangers; she is ignorant and
poor; he is intelligent and
wealthy. But in their own ways
both have been oppressed by
the fascists, a regime that only
sees one role for women and
tortures those who are not
"normal." Antonietta and Gab
rielle live a moment of calm be
fore the storm and find in each
other the kindness and com
passion lacking in their lives.
This is a film about loneliness
and self-realization, subjects
hardly new to filmmakers. This
kind of movie lives or dies on
the strength of its perfor
mances.
"A Special Day" succeeds
because it has brilliant perfor
mances from its stars: Sophia
Loren as Antonietta and Mar
cello Mastroianni as Gabrielle.

Mastroianni's performance has
great dignity and force. But it is
Loren's performance that
makes this movie. It is so bril
liantly understated that it is al
most possible to forgive her for
appearing in garbage like "The
Cassandra Crossing." Her act
ing is flawless, and it makes
one regret that audiences see
her so infrequently.
The film has an added plus; it
is directed well by Ettore Scola,
one of the "new wave" Italians.
The story takes place in one
day, but the movie never suf
fers from compression, largely
because Scola uses fluid, mas
terful camerawork. He main
tains the film's inherent tense
ness by playing in the
background a radio broadcast
of the Hitler-Mussolini rally.
The broadcast serves to give
a sense of the world swirling
about the two as they try to find
hope in an impossible situa
tion.
"A Special Day" is a small
film, but it's so fundamentally
human and decent that one
can ignore its smallness or lack
of originality.
It's just a profoundly simple
film and in its purposely li
mited way, it reaches and
moves you.

Indifferent Lelouch
Somebody should tell
Claude Lelouch that he's work
ing too much. The last time I
counted, he had four films
either released or about to be
released. Lelouch seems to
have rushed into filming "Cat
and Mouse" without a script,
making it up as he went along.
This technique works for a
writer-director like John Hus
ton, but Lelouch can't write
well enough to pull it off.
The movie is provisionally a
murder mystery (and as such
would make a poor "Col
umbo"), but it is also a ro
mance — and at this level, it
works. Lelouch handles
romantic themes well ("A Man
and A Woman"), this film is no
exception.
Serge Reggiani plays the
aging detective who is in
trigued with the apparent
robbery-murder of a wealthy
estate owner. Reggiani's re
search leads him to the dead
man's wife, Michele Morgan,
whom he believes guilty but to
whom he is attracted. The
movie, when it discusses their
relationship, is a lot of fun. Re
ggiani and Morgan have charm
and grace and their middle-age
romance is sentimental yet be
lievable.

Reggiani is an empirical de
tective; to disprove Morgan's
alibi, he drives as fast as he can
from a Paris theater to Mor
gan's estate. Lelouch is an em
pirical director; he shows us
about 25 minutes of high speed
driving from the driver's view
point. (After 10 minutes, you
feel like you're at the Indy 500.)
But Lelouch is also talented
with the camera. He shoots his
own films and they always fea
ture skillful camera movement
and judicious editing.
If Lelouch gets a good script,
slows down his pace and takes
care and time with his next
movie, he'll have all the tools
he needs for a great film.
Bacall, an original
Charming, witty, urbane,
frank, beautiful. Star. Still
stunning at 53, Lauren Bacall
ended the film festival with two
hours of question and answer
and 90 minutes of film clips,
including the "Anytime you
want me, just whistle" scene
from "To Have and Have Not,"
the double entendre discus
sion about horses (Bogart:
"Can you be rated?" Bacall:
"Depends on who's in the sad
dle") from"The Big Sleep,"
and continuing through "Mur
der on the Orient Express"

where she shines among a
trainload of stars.
Bacall discussed her con
stant fights with producers
over her roles. She said her
switch from drama to comedy
was especially difficult; she
had to test for "How to Marry A
Millionaire" even though she
was an established star.
Bacall said she enjoyed the
stage's sense of immediacy the
ability to respond to the audi
ence. She deplored the movie
industry's "don't give a damn"
attitude about the theater;
"They still don't think I can do
musicals even though I did
'Applause' on Broadway."
She's currently working on a
TV movie ("We want to raise
their standards a bit") written
by Nora Ephron.
In today's commercial, TV
glutted world, there seems to
be a star a minute (to parap
hrase Warhol). These "stars"
do sitcoms or cop shows on TV
and make the People magazine
cover. We even have
"superstars" probably the
worst and most misused word
of our generation, like Farrah
Fawcett-Majors. It makes me
yearn for the time stars w&re
stars, and actors like Lauen
Bacall fit the bill.
