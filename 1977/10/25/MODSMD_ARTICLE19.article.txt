# ACT's 'Julius Caesar'
## Technical bravado but nothing resembling life 
### 
The problem with the American
Conservatory Theatre's production
of "Julius Caesar" is the problem
with most of its Shakespearean pro
ductions; it is over-produced and
under-felt. Dramatic speeches,
blood, flourishes and lingering
deaths are played for everything that
they are worth, and ambitious stag
ing methods point to bold interpreta
tions, but the actors are unable to
support the added load.
In all Shakespeare, an actor's abil
ity to grasp and communicate the
complex nature of his part is impor
tant above all else; unfortunately, in
"Caesar" just this element is lacking.
The ACT production sacrifices
character to staging — as a result
there are mechanical "moments"
but nothing resembling life.
Admittedly, there are good ideas.
The first set, with its wide pillars and
marble steps and sprawling banners,
effectively suggests a grandeur that

does justice to the theme. The light
ing, too, is excellent. It clearly em
phasizes the action of the play, espe
cially during the storm scene, and
immediately after Antony's oration,
when the red glow forebodes the vio
lence about to be unleashed. Finally,
director Edward Call's addition of
scavengers, deathly poor, who strip
the bodies of unguarded dead, is
good, since it furthers his concep
tion of the action as fundamentally
futile, with no heroes and no justice.
Indeed, the production might
work, if the actors were able to carry
off their roles with more constancy
and feeling. As it is, they kill it, none
more so than Jay O. Sanders. San
ders plays Antony; despite some
nice moments during his funeral
speech, during the rest of the play he
is flat and unmoving. In the first two
acts, he seems to be preoccupied
with seeming as virile as possible —
he appears at first as a professional

wrestler in Caesar's entourage —
and, consequently, is unable to
communicate the devotion to and
love for Caesar in any thing other
than the broadest physical (possibly
homosexual) sense. What's worse,
Sanders then abandons this charac
ter for one completely unrelated.
After Caesar's death he becomes a
stern, unscrupulous storm trooper
type, distinguishable from the rest of
the army only because he stands in
the center of the stage. The change is
unconvincing, and in the end when
he makes his moving speech over the
body of Brutus and then proceeds to
kick him down the stairs, the failure
of Sander's character becomes com
plete. In the end, he is in direct op
position to the text, and his kick re
duces an emotional passage to some
thing resembling a summons.
Daniel Davies is not much better.
As Brutus, Davies does manage to
improve some as the action progres
ses; he still is ineffective for the large
part of the play. His speech to the
commoners is weak; his relationship
with those close to him shows very
little nobility. For the most part,
Davies resembles one who has eaten
a box or two of No-Doz — he is star
tled by everything, always unsettled,
never able to deliver a line without
glancing to the heavens or grimac
ing. He is, in short, a rather nebulous
figure, and when Antony proclaims
over his body that "this was a man,"
the audience is not utterly con
vinced.
Raye Birk, as Cassius, manages to
do justice to his part, but he too is
ineffective due to problems from
outside. Although he tends to
explode at times one would expect a
conspirator to be at least quietly
splenetic, Birk does manage to get ac
ross feelings of inferiority to Brutus
and Caesar, and he does resist the
temptation to oversimplify his
thoughts. Yet Birk comes off badly,
due primarily to an excessive effort
on the part of the director to repre
sent all of the complexities in this
play on the stage rather than in the
words. Birk's movements seem
over-choreographed, and his pauses
melodramatic, and the poses he
takes before beginning his lines
seem nothing more than clutter.
Outward grandeur overshadows
inner subtlety.
It is much the same with Caesar.

Ray Reinhardt plays him vigorously
and with venom, but his actions are
unraveled by much gimmickery on
stage. From the beginning, Caesar's
entrances and exits, even in the
domestic scene in his house, are ac
companied by loud flourishes,
guards and attendants, and often the
din of screaming crowds. As a result,
Reinhardt cannot distinguish himself
as a human being, but only appears
as an impersonal dignitary. We per
ceive none of Caesar's complexities,
none of his affection for Brutus and
Antony or his envy of Cassius, none
of his mixture of pride, paranoia and
gentleness. Instead, we get a
simple-minded, pompous son-of-a
bitch.
And there are other procedural
woes. The music, for instance, is not
too different from that heard in old
episodes of The Twilight Zone —
rather than lending unity or dimen
sion, it furthers the feeling that
character is a decidedly unimportant
element.
The crowds, also, are a constant
distraction. Everyone in them has a
Quasimodo-like twitch; they spend
the majority of the evening racing
about chaotically shouting and
bumping into other commoners.
During Antony's crucial ovation over
Caesar's body, the crowd continually
interrupts the flow of the speech
with chants of "Brutus" and "re
venge" so that by the end, the rab
ble, and not Antony, dominates. The
only memorable image in this essen
tial scene is that of Antony, chased
up a pillar by the mob, attempting
futilely to be heard above their
shouts.
Again, these feelings ought not be
taken as an indictment of all of Call's
ideas about the themes in "Julius
Caesar." Instead, they should indi
cate that the production makes its
points in too external a manner. It is
extremely heavy-handed, and re
quires monumental performances to
be effective, but conceivably it could
be done. As it stands, however, the
technical bravado is annoying, the
acting is for the most part unmoving,
and the overall effect is similar to that
produced by excessive reliance on
Cliff Notes and Hi-Liters. This is an
artificial production of what need not
be an artificial play.

with most of its Shakespearean pro
ductions; it is over-produced and
under-felt. Dramatic speeches,
blood, flourishes and lingering
deaths are played for everything that
they are worth, and ambitious stag
ing methods point to bold interpreta
tions, but the actors are unable to
support the added load.
In all Shakespeare, an actor's abil
ity to grasp and communicate the
complex nature of his part is impor
tant above all else; unfortunately, in
"Caesar" just this element is lacking.
The ACT production sacrifices
character to staging — as a result
there are mechanical "moments"
but nothing resembling life.
Admittedly, there are good ideas.
The first set, with its wide pillars and
marble steps and sprawling banners,
effectively suggests a grandeur that

does justice to the theme. The light
ing, too, is excellent. It clearly em
phasizes the action of the play, espe
cially during the storm scene, and
immediately after Antony's oration,
when the red glow forebodes the vio
lence about to be unleashed. Finally,
director Edward Call's addition of
scavengers, deathly poor, who strip
the bodies of unguarded dead, is
good, since it furthers his concep
tion of the action as fundamentally
futile, with no heroes and no justice.
Indeed, the production might
work, if the actors were able to carry
off their roles with more constancy
and feeling. As it is, they kill it, none
more so than Jay O. Sanders. San
ders plays Antony; despite some
nice moments during his funeral
speech, during the rest of the play he
is flat and unmoving. In the first two
acts, he seems to be preoccupied
with seeming as virile as possible —
he appears at first as a professional

wrestler in Caesar's entourage —
and, consequently, is unable to
communicate the devotion to and
love for Caesar in any thing other
than the broadest physical (possibly
homosexual) sense. What's worse,
Sanders then abandons this charac
ter for one completely unrelated.
After Caesar's death he becomes a
stern, unscrupulous storm trooper
type, distinguishable from the rest of
the army only because he stands in
the center of the stage. The change is
unconvincing, and in the end when
he makes his moving speech over the
body of Brutus and then proceeds to
kick him down the stairs, the failure
of Sander's character becomes com
plete. In the end, he is in direct op
position to the text, and his kick re
duces an emotional passage to some
thing resembling a summons.
Daniel Davies is not much better.
As Brutus, Davies does manage to
improve some as the action progres
ses; he still is ineffective for the large
part of the play. His speech to the
commoners is weak; his relationship
with those close to him shows very
little nobility. For the most part,
Davies resembles one who has eaten
a box or two of No-Doz — he is star
tled by everything, always unsettled,
never able to deliver a line without
glancing to the heavens or grimac
ing. He is, in short, a rather nebulous
figure, and when Antony proclaims
over his body that "this was a man,"
the audience is not utterly con
vinced.
Raye Birk, as Cassius, manages to
do justice to his part, but he too is
ineffective due to problems from
outside. Although he tends to
explode at times one would expect a
conspirator to be at least quietly
splenetic, Birk does manage to get ac
ross feelings of inferiority to Brutus
and Caesar, and he does resist the
temptation to oversimplify his
thoughts. Yet Birk comes off badly,
due primarily to an excessive effort
on the part of the director to repre
sent all of the complexities in this
play on the stage rather than in the
words. Birk's movements seem
over-choreographed, and his pauses
melodramatic, and the poses he
takes before beginning his lines
seem nothing more than clutter.
Outward grandeur overshadows
inner subtlety.
It is much the same with Caesar.

Ray Reinhardt plays him vigorously
and with venom, but his actions are
unraveled by much gimmickery on
stage. From the beginning, Caesar's
entrances and exits, even in the
domestic scene in his house, are ac
companied by loud flourishes,
guards and attendants, and often the
din of screaming crowds. As a result,
Reinhardt cannot distinguish himself
as a human being, but only appears
as an impersonal dignitary. We per
ceive none of Caesar's complexities,
none of his affection for Brutus and
Antony or his envy of Cassius, none
of his mixture of pride, paranoia and
gentleness. Instead, we get a
simple-minded, pompous son-of-a
bitch.
And there are other procedural
woes. The music, for instance, is not
too different from that heard in old
episodes of The Twilight Zone —
rather than lending unity or dimen
sion, it furthers the feeling that
character is a decidedly unimportant
element.
The crowds, also, are a constant
distraction. Everyone in them has a
Quasimodo-like twitch; they spend
the majority of the evening racing
about chaotically shouting and
bumping into other commoners.
During Antony's crucial ovation over
Caesar's body, the crowd continually
interrupts the flow of the speech
with chants of "Brutus" and "re
venge" so that by the end, the rab
ble, and not Antony, dominates. The
only memorable image in this essen
tial scene is that of Antony, chased
up a pillar by the mob, attempting
futilely to be heard above their
shouts.
Again, these feelings ought not be
taken as an indictment of all of Call's
ideas about the themes in "Julius
Caesar." Instead, they should indi
cate that the production makes its
points in too external a manner. It is
extremely heavy-handed, and re
quires monumental performances to
be effective, but conceivably it could
be done. As it stands, however, the
technical bravado is annoying, the
acting is for the most part unmoving,
and the overall effect is similar to that
produced by excessive reliance on
Cliff Notes and Hi-Liters. This is an
artificial production of what need not
be an artificial play.

deaths are played for everything that
they are worth, and ambitious stag
ing methods point to bold interpreta
tions, but the actors are unable to
support the added load.
In all Shakespeare, an actor's abil
ity to grasp and communicate the
complex nature of his part is impor
tant above all else; unfortunately, in
"Caesar" just this element is lacking.
The ACT production sacrifices
character to staging — as a result
there are mechanical "moments"
but nothing resembling life.
Admittedly, there are good ideas.
The first set, with its wide pillars and
marble steps and sprawling banners,
effectively suggests a grandeur that

does justice to the theme. The light
ing, too, is excellent. It clearly em
phasizes the action of the play, espe
cially during the storm scene, and
immediately after Antony's oration,
when the red glow forebodes the vio
lence about to be unleashed. Finally,
director Edward Call's addition of
scavengers, deathly poor, who strip
the bodies of unguarded dead, is
good, since it furthers his concep
tion of the action as fundamentally
futile, with no heroes and no justice.
Indeed, the production might
work, if the actors were able to carry
off their roles with more constancy
and feeling. As it is, they kill it, none
more so than Jay O. Sanders. San
ders plays Antony; despite some
nice moments during his funeral
speech, during the rest of the play he
is flat and unmoving. In the first two
acts, he seems to be preoccupied
with seeming as virile as possible —
he appears at first as a professional

wrestler in Caesar's entourage —
and, consequently, is unable to
communicate the devotion to and
love for Caesar in any thing other
than the broadest physical (possibly
homosexual) sense. What's worse,
Sanders then abandons this charac
ter for one completely unrelated.
After Caesar's death he becomes a
stern, unscrupulous storm trooper
type, distinguishable from the rest of
the army only because he stands in
the center of the stage. The change is
unconvincing, and in the end when
he makes his moving speech over the
body of Brutus and then proceeds to
kick him down the stairs, the failure
of Sander's character becomes com
plete. In the end, he is in direct op
position to the text, and his kick re
duces an emotional passage to some
thing resembling a summons.
Daniel Davies is not much better.
As Brutus, Davies does manage to
improve some as the action progres
ses; he still is ineffective for the large
part of the play. His speech to the
commoners is weak; his relationship
with those close to him shows very
little nobility. For the most part,
Davies resembles one who has eaten
a box or two of No-Doz — he is star
tled by everything, always unsettled,
never able to deliver a line without
glancing to the heavens or grimac
ing. He is, in short, a rather nebulous
figure, and when Antony proclaims
over his body that "this was a man,"
the audience is not utterly con
vinced.
Raye Birk, as Cassius, manages to
do justice to his part, but he too is
ineffective due to problems from
outside. Although he tends to
explode at times one would expect a
conspirator to be at least quietly
splenetic, Birk does manage to get ac
ross feelings of inferiority to Brutus
and Caesar, and he does resist the
temptation to oversimplify his
thoughts. Yet Birk comes off badly,
due primarily to an excessive effort
on the part of the director to repre
sent all of the complexities in this
play on the stage rather than in the
words. Birk's movements seem
over-choreographed, and his pauses
melodramatic, and the poses he
takes before beginning his lines
seem nothing more than clutter.
Outward grandeur overshadows
inner subtlety.
It is much the same with Caesar.

Ray Reinhardt plays him vigorously
and with venom, but his actions are
unraveled by much gimmickery on
stage. From the beginning, Caesar's
entrances and exits, even in the
domestic scene in his house, are ac
companied by loud flourishes,
guards and attendants, and often the
din of screaming crowds. As a result,
Reinhardt cannot distinguish himself
as a human being, but only appears
as an impersonal dignitary. We per
ceive none of Caesar's complexities,
none of his affection for Brutus and
Antony or his envy of Cassius, none
of his mixture of pride, paranoia and
gentleness. Instead, we get a
simple-minded, pompous son-of-a
bitch.
And there are other procedural
woes. The music, for instance, is not
too different from that heard in old
episodes of The Twilight Zone —
rather than lending unity or dimen
sion, it furthers the feeling that
character is a decidedly unimportant
element.
The crowds, also, are a constant
distraction. Everyone in them has a
Quasimodo-like twitch; they spend
the majority of the evening racing
about chaotically shouting and
bumping into other commoners.
During Antony's crucial ovation over
Caesar's body, the crowd continually
interrupts the flow of the speech
with chants of "Brutus" and "re
venge" so that by the end, the rab
ble, and not Antony, dominates. The
only memorable image in this essen
tial scene is that of Antony, chased
up a pillar by the mob, attempting
futilely to be heard above their
shouts.
Again, these feelings ought not be
taken as an indictment of all of Call's
ideas about the themes in "Julius
Caesar." Instead, they should indi
cate that the production makes its
points in too external a manner. It is
extremely heavy-handed, and re
quires monumental performances to
be effective, but conceivably it could
be done. As it stands, however, the
technical bravado is annoying, the
acting is for the most part unmoving,
and the overall effect is similar to that
produced by excessive reliance on
Cliff Notes and Hi-Liters. This is an
artificial production of what need not
be an artificial play.
