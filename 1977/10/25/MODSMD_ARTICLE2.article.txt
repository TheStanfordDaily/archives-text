# Library task force to evaluate future services, operating costs
## 
### Barbie Fields 
In light of rapidly rising costs of
library acquisitions, Provost William
Miller has appointed a 16-member
task force to explore the nature of
library services here from 1980 to
2000.
"The task force was formed to get a
comprehensive look at funding lib
raries," said Vice Provost for Budget
and Planning Raymond Bacchetti.
Library acquisitions rank second
only to utilities in rising cost in
creases at the University. Currently
library costs total some 10.3 per cent
of the operating budget.
"The problem is that libraries —
unlike ships — cannot be drydocked
for outfitting or renewal," Bacchetti
said. "We have to improve them
while we maintain them."
The task force still must settle on
the subject matter to be studied, said
Susan Horst, associate provost and
task force member.
The study is expected to take 18 to
30 months to complete.
"This quarter will be spent on

educating ourselves in the universe
of scholarly publications," Horst
said. "We will look at the process of
acquiring collections, the preserving
and maintaining of collections, how
to most efficiently organize and pro
vide access to collections, and how
to best make use of available collec
tions. Right now we can't even say
how to go about it."
Library expenditures in the operat
ing budget this year are expected to
reach $11.2 million, up 8.8 per cent
from last year, according to the
budget.
One partial solution to the cost
problem is already in use. The
Stanford/UC-Berkeley cooperative
program has been in operation now
for seven months. Under this plan,
each university has specific areas in
which to collect costly journals and
little-used volumes. Borrowing
privileges are reciprocal and a shuttle
bus system between the campuses
operates daily to aid accessibility to
the works.
Ann Seeley, coordinator of the

cooperative said, "Materials that are
commonly needed at both campuses
will be there."
She said, however, both institu
tions "intend to build on current
strengths."
Library Director David Weber said
the main advantage of the co-op is
"increased accessibility right away"
for doctoral candidates who need
specialized materials.
Weber said that building on cur
rent strengths would not create im
portant deficiencies within the lib
raries' general collection.
"I do not believe the University
will suffer . . . because of the co-op.
We are committed to maintaining
strong research libraries in all major
fields," Weber said.
He said the program will "enable
us to hold back on buying some
works which would be rarely used
here" but need to be available.
"If we are careful, I don't believe it
will impair our research or teaching
programs to any great degree,"
Weber said.
