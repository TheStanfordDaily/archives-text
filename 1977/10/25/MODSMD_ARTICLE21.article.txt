China convenes early congress
Tokyo — The Chinese government, in a move to
consolidate Chairman Hua Kuo-feng's power, an
nounced today it would convene a new National
People's Congress next spring, two years ahead of
schedule.
Peking Radio said standing committees of the
current national legislature adopted the decision'
unanimously yesterday after a two-day meeting in
the Chinese capital.
Hua told standing committee members Sunday
that new national and local people's congresses
must be elected to eliminate the "poisonous in
fluence" of his radical opponents and "usher in a
high tide in socialist economic and cultural con
struction."
The current national congress, China's fourth,
was convened in January 1975 under a new con
stitution that set a five-year term for congress de
puties.
To set the stage for the fifth congress, Hua said,
new people's congresses will be elected in the
provinces, municipalities and autonomous reg
ions. These, in turn, will name deputies to the new
national legislature.
Under the influence of radical leaders, Hua said,
"some bad people wormed their way" onto local
congresses. New local representatives, he said,
"must be good so that the masses rejoice and
support them and feel encouraged when the lists
of members are announced.
"Smash-and-grabbers and persons who indulge
in creating disturbances in the hope of becoming
officials should be completely excluded," he said.
Panamanians approve treaty
Panama City — Panamanians have given over
whelming approval to treaties signed with America
that would give this country control of the Panama
Canal by the year 2000, officials announced yes
terday.
Comptroller General Damian Castillo said that
with 95 per cent of the ballots counted, the unoffi
cial results were 4b8,664 votes for the treaties and
228,697 against, for a 2-1 margin.

That ratio "is just about what the U.S. Senate
needs to approve the treaties," Castillo told repor
ters.
The treaties must be ratified by at least a two
thirds vote of the U.S. Senate before they can take
effect and President jimmy Carter is expected to
seek a Senate vote early next year. There is stiff
opposition in the Senate, and Carter administra
tion officials have said the accords may be in trou
ble there.
Castillo said between 96 and 98 per cent of
Panama's 800,000 eligible voters took part in Sun
day's plebiscite.
The main treaty, one of two signed by Panama
nian leader Cen. Omar Torrijos and Carter in
Washington, Sept. 7, will surrender the canal and
the 500-square-mile canal zone to Panama by the
year 2000.
The second document declares the waterway a
neutral zone and allows U.S. intervention in the
event of a threat to its security.
Carter observes Vet Day
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, observ
ing Veterans Day, called on the nation yesterday to
join him in a "demonstrable will to preserve free
dom in order to prevent war."
This, he said, would serve as "gratitude for
those in the past who have given their lives and
those who were willing to give their lives for the
preservation of the greatest nation on earth."
Carter spoke at the Memorial Amphitheater at
Arlington National Cemetery after placing a
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
A crowd of 3000 stood in mute reverence while
the ceremony unfolded.
Broader admissions policy urged
San Francisco — College admissions standards
must be broadened "beyond the traditional
yardsticks" to close the gap in the number of
minority professionals, Secretary of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare Joseph Califano said yesterday.
With the government awaiting a decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court in the Bakke case, Califano

said admissions tests should measure a wider
range of talents so more qualified minorities will
be found.
"Great reserves of human talent have been
locked up by our national legacy of slavery and
discrimination," Califano told educators at a meet
ing here of the College Entrance Examination
Board. "Your mission, as leaders in educational
admissions, is to ensure that this potential is rec
ognized.
"I would emphasize that we must continually
seek new ways of measuring true human poten
tial: ways that reach beyond the traditional
yardsticks," he said.
Black regent criticized for vote
Sacramento — Wilson Riles, California's first
black school superintendent, said yesterday he is
being criticized unfairly by the NAACP for his vote
on University of California admissions standards.
"I was offended that they tried to make it a race
issue," Riles said in an interview.
One NAACP leader picketed Riles and others
criticized him last Friday after he cast a decisive
vote in the UC regents' 13-12 vote to give some
what more weight to standardized test scores in
admissions, starting in the fall of 1979.
Nathaniel Colley, regional counsel for the Na
tional Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People and a longtime friend of Riles, called
his vote "shocking, outrageous and anti-black."
"It means fewer black students will be admitted
to the university," Colley said.
