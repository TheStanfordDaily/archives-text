"A positive result of the Bakke case could be the
reexamination of criteria for education," said African
and Afro-American Studies Program Director Prof.
Sylvia Wynter.
"We need to ask if a society that bases itself on
equality and equal opportunity can afford to have an
educational system which is so structurally unequal
even before people get to the university," said
Wynter, the University's first tenured black female
professor, in a recent interview.
She recently became director of African and Afro-
American Studies.
Speaking on her status on the faculty, Wynter said,
"I know that I've come in here because of two strug
gles: the struggles of blacks and the struggles of
women, and so it gives me a kind of confidence.
"I feel that I'm not only here as a person, but that
I'm representing a transition in consciousness."
Special asset
"What I see as my special asset, because I've had
such a long and varied career as a writer, is that I do
have a very comparative discipline and in many ways I
think that this is where lie the new areas in the logic of
the content of being black or a woman," Wynter said.
The African and Afro-American Studies program
here is not a department but instead includes profes
sors from various departments. Wynter said she sees
this as helpful in keeping the program from becom
ing "ghettoized."
Program phases
She said she believes the first phase of the program
— creation of the structural framework for the new

study area — was completed before she came to it.
She is here, she says, for the second phase, "the
intellectual institutionalization of the program."
"I think that I came to Stanford because of the
general feeling of the people in the program and of
the dean that we had to go now with the strengthen
ing of the development of intellectual life," she said.
Institute envisioned
Wynter said she envisions a research institute
"planned to provide interdisciplinary collaboration
between faculty and research associates relating to
the African and Afro-American experience."
Wynter is currently translating a 17th century
Spanish play, "Juan Latino," into English for a class
she will be teaching next year. The play has a black
aristocratic hero and Wynter said she hopes to pro
duce it on campus.
She is also responsible for teaching an interdiscip
linary core of seminars which she sees as "helping to
make up for the inability to have the autonomy of a
department to do certain things that you would like to
do."
Codings
As for the University, Wynter commented, "I think
that every society codes you to perceive yourself in
one way and basically what we do in a university is to
examine these codings."
Concerning the African and Afro-American Studies
program, the new program director said, "What new
areas of study do is to pose new questions and to look
at things in a different way. So, they eventually trans
form normative disciplines."
