## 
### Randy Keith Dan Fiduccia 
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy indicated yesterday he
will recommend to the senate that at
least six ASSU Senate candidates be
disqualified for campaign ir
regularities.
Murphy made his statement dur
ing a three hour meeting yesterday
->et up by ASSU officials to examine
publicly allegations of campaign
rules violations.
Also at the meeting, Senate
Chairman Pat Flinn said he would
tentatively schedule the first senate
meeting of the year for Thursday.
"I trust the senate will appoint an
election review board" at the first
meeting, said ASSU Co-president
Steve Westly.
In his preliminary report on cam
paign practices presented at yester
day's meeting, Murphy said he
would recommend that Senator
elect Janet Rappaport, Alternate
Senators-elect Robert Docters and
Sue O'Hara and candidate Mark Chin
all be disqualified for exceeding the
$50 campaign spending limit.
Murphy also said he will recom
mend disqualification of Senator
elect Dan Livingston and Alternate
Senator-elect Kevin Childress, and
also any Stanford Organizing Com
mittee (SOC) slate members who can
be identified as having prior know
ledge of an anonymous campaign
leaflet which attacked another can
didate.
Murphy said he will recommend
that Livingston be disqualified for his
role in writing an anonymous blue
leaflet attacking the SOC slate.
Livingston had previously admit
ted writing the first draft of the leaflet
and distributing it through the Con

servative Student Union, according
to Murphy.
Livingston did not deny the charge
at the meeting yesterday.
Murphy said he will also recom
mend that Childress be disqualified
tor lying to Murphy in the course of
the election commissioner's investi
gation into his campaign practices.
At the meeting yesterday Childress
said "I lied only about my own in
volvement," not that of his slate.
Childress ran on a slate with
Livingston and )ohn Hart.
At the meeting Murphy also said
he had "substantiated suspicion"
that some members of the SOC slate
had prior knowledge of a yellow leaf
let distributed on the first day of vot
ing.
Murphy said that on the basis of
statements made to him by two
people it was "impossible for some
SOC people not to have foreknow
ledge" of the yellow sheet.

Murphy also said one person who
called him said he had been warned
not to speak to Murphy.
All 10 undergraduate members of
SOC have signed statements say
ing they had no "involvement in the
idea, preparation, or distribution of
the leaflet that appeared in the Daily
Oct. 12."
The sheet was stuffed without au
thorization in the Daily by Stanford
alumnus Chris Cray and 25 as
sociates . The leaflet attacked Docters
and his slate.
Those members of SOC who had
knowledge of the yellow sheet prior
to its distribution will be recom
mended fordisqualification, Murphy
said.
At the meeting yesterday SOC
member Carlyle Kinnison said he had
investigated the allegations and "I'm
absolutely sure that no member of
the SOC slate has done anything out
of bounds of the (ASSU) constitution
or the bylaws."
ASSU Bylaws do not state that it is
possible grounds for disqualification
to stuff the Daily, lie to the elections
commissioner or to author an
anonymous campaign leaflet.
Three undergraduate SOC mem
bers contacted by the Daily last night
refused to comment when asked if
they had knowledge of the sheet be
fore its distribution.
Murphy also reported that Rap
paport spent "approximately $120"
on campaign material, primarily on
posters. He said, though, that two
days before the election she turned
in two-thirds of her posters to the
election commissioner's office.
Murphy added that Rappaport
claimed she had a misunderstanding
with the firm which printed her cam
paign material. Murphy said she
would be under the spending limit if
she were charged on pro-rated basis
only for the fraction of the posters
she used.
However, Murphy said, she would
still have exceeded the $50 limit had
she bought only 1100 posters. This is
because posters are cheaper in bulk,
he explained.
Rappaport yesterday refused to
discuss her campaign spending.
Murphy also said Docters, O'Hara
and Chin, who ran as a slate, ex
ceeded their campaign limit by about
$7. He said that Docters was claiming
sole responsibility for the misun
derstanding of estimates over the
telephone, which resulted in the
slate's actual costs being greater than
the printer's estimate.
The whole slate would have to bear
the responsibility, Murphy said.
Co-president Steve Westly said of
the meeting, "I'm glad we got things
out in the open. I thought Sean's ac
tions in the investigation were
exemplary," Westly added.

refused to comment when asked if
they had knowledge of the sheet be
fore its distribution.
Murphy also reported that Rap
paport spent "approximately $120"
on campaign material, primarily on
posters. He said, though, that two
days before the election she turned
in two-thirds of her posters to the
election commissioner's office.
Murphy added that Rappaport
claimed she had a misunderstanding
with the firm which printed her cam
paign material. Murphy said she
would be under the spending limit if
she were charged on pro-rated basis
only for the fraction of the posters
she used.
However, Murphy said, she would
still have exceeded the $50 limit had
she bought only 1100 posters. This is
because posters are cheaper in bulk,
he explained.
Rappaport yesterday refused to
discuss her campaign spending.
Murphy also said Docters, O'Hara
and Chin, who ran as a slate, ex
ceeded their campaign limit by about
$7. He said that Docters was claiming
sole responsibility for the misun
derstanding of estimates over the
telephone, which resulted in the
slate's actual costs being greater than
the printer's estimate.
The whole slate would have to bear
the responsibility, Murphy said.
Co-president Steve Westly said of
the meeting, "I'm glad we got things
out in the open. I thought Sean's ac
tions in the investigation were
exemplary," Westly added.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Sean Murphy indicated yesterday he
will recommend to the senate that at
least six ASSU Senate candidates be
disqualified for campaign ir
regularities.
Murphy made his statement dur
ing a three hour meeting yesterday
->et up by ASSU officials to examine
publicly allegations of campaign
rules violations.
Also at the meeting, Senate
Chairman Pat Flinn said he would
tentatively schedule the first senate
meeting of the year for Thursday.
"I trust the senate will appoint an
election review board" at the first
meeting, said ASSU Co-president
Steve Westly.
In his preliminary report on cam
paign practices presented at yester
day's meeting, Murphy said he
would recommend that Senator
elect Janet Rappaport, Alternate
Senators-elect Robert Docters and
Sue O'Hara and candidate Mark Chin
all be disqualified for exceeding the
$50 campaign spending limit.
Murphy also said he will recom
mend disqualification of Senator
elect Dan Livingston and Alternate
Senator-elect Kevin Childress, and
also any Stanford Organizing Com
mittee (SOC) slate members who can
be identified as having prior know
ledge of an anonymous campaign
leaflet which attacked another can
didate.
Murphy said he will recommend
that Livingston be disqualified for his
role in writing an anonymous blue
leaflet attacking the SOC slate.
Livingston had previously admit
ted writing the first draft of the leaflet
and distributing it through the Con

servative Student Union, according
to Murphy.
Livingston did not deny the charge
at the meeting yesterday.
Murphy said he will also recom
mend that Childress be disqualified
tor lying to Murphy in the course of
the election commissioner's investi
gation into his campaign practices.
At the meeting yesterday Childress
said "I lied only about my own in
volvement," not that of his slate.
Childress ran on a slate with
Livingston and )ohn Hart.
At the meeting Murphy also said
he had "substantiated suspicion"
that some members of the SOC slate
had prior knowledge of a yellow leaf
let distributed on the first day of vot
ing.
Murphy said that on the basis of
statements made to him by two
people it was "impossible for some
SOC people not to have foreknow
ledge" of the yellow sheet.

Murphy also said one person who
called him said he had been warned
not to speak to Murphy.
All 10 undergraduate members of
SOC have signed statements say
ing they had no "involvement in the
idea, preparation, or distribution of
the leaflet that appeared in the Daily
Oct. 12."
The sheet was stuffed without au
thorization in the Daily by Stanford
alumnus Chris Cray and 25 as
sociates . The leaflet attacked Docters
and his slate.
Those members of SOC who had
knowledge of the yellow sheet prior
to its distribution will be recom
mended fordisqualification, Murphy
said.
At the meeting yesterday SOC
member Carlyle Kinnison said he had
investigated the allegations and "I'm
absolutely sure that no member of
the SOC slate has done anything out
of bounds of the (ASSU) constitution
or the bylaws."
ASSU Bylaws do not state that it is
possible grounds for disqualification
to stuff the Daily, lie to the elections
commissioner or to author an
anonymous campaign leaflet.

he had "substantiated suspicion"
that some members of the SOC slate
had prior knowledge of a yellow leaf
let distributed on the first day of vot
ing.
Murphy said that on the basis of
statements made to him by two
people it was "impossible for some
SOC people not to have foreknow
ledge" of the yellow sheet.

Murphy also said one person who
called him said he had been warned
not to speak to Murphy.
All 10 undergraduate members of
SOC have signed statements say
ing they had no "involvement in the
idea, preparation, or distribution of
the leaflet that appeared in the Daily
Oct. 12."
The sheet was stuffed without au
thorization in the Daily by Stanford
alumnus Chris Cray and 25 as
sociates . The leaflet attacked Docters
and his slate.
Those members of SOC who had
knowledge of the yellow sheet prior
to its distribution will be recom
mended fordisqualification, Murphy
said.
At the meeting yesterday SOC
member Carlyle Kinnison said he had
investigated the allegations and "I'm
absolutely sure that no member of
the SOC slate has done anything out
of bounds of the (ASSU) constitution
or the bylaws."
ASSU Bylaws do not state that it is
possible grounds for disqualification
to stuff the Daily, lie to the elections
commissioner or to author an
anonymous campaign leaflet.
Three undergraduate SOC mem
bers contacted by the Daily last night
refused to comment when asked if
they had knowledge of the sheet be
fore its distribution.
Murphy also reported that Rap
paport spent "approximately $120"
on campaign material, primarily on
posters. He said, though, that two
days before the election she turned
in two-thirds of her posters to the
election commissioner's office.
Murphy added that Rappaport
claimed she had a misunderstanding
with the firm which printed her cam
paign material. Murphy said she
would be under the spending limit if
she were charged on pro-rated basis
only for the fraction of the posters
she used.
However, Murphy said, she would
still have exceeded the $50 limit had
she bought only 1100 posters. This is
because posters are cheaper in bulk,
he explained.
Rappaport yesterday refused to
discuss her campaign spending.
Murphy also said Docters, O'Hara
and Chin, who ran as a slate, ex
ceeded their campaign limit by about
$7. He said that Docters was claiming
sole responsibility for the misun
derstanding of estimates over the
telephone, which resulted in the
slate's actual costs being greater than
the printer's estimate.
The whole slate would have to bear
the responsibility, Murphy said.
Co-president Steve Westly said of
the meeting, "I'm glad we got things
out in the open. I thought Sean's ac
tions in the investigation were
exemplary," Westly added.
