# S. Africa sanctions called for by Young
## 
### 
United Nations, N.Y. (AP) — U.S.
Ambassador Andrew Young said yes
terday he personally favors some
form of sanctions against the gov
ernment of South Africa, which car
ried out a sweeping purge of black
leaders and organizations last week.
Young spoke with reporters fol
lowing a Security Council meeting
where black-ruled African nations
called on the council to order a man
datory arms embargo and other sanc
tions against South Africa's white
minority regime. The United States

previously has vetoed such an arms
embargo proposal.
Young replied "Yes" when asked if
he favored sanctions against the Pre
toria government.
He stressed that this was a per
sonal opinion and added: "The pres
ident and secretary of state will have
to decide what sanctions are approp
riate in these conditions."
But the black U.N. envoy, who ear
lier in the day met with President
Jimmy Carter in Washington, indi
cated the United States would seek
some middle ground short of a bind
ing arms embargo. "I certainly hope
we could come up with a position we
wouldn't have to veto . . . one we
could all agree to," he said.
Expects decision
Young added he expects the Car
ter administration to make a decision
within the next two days.
The council debate, scheduled to
run four days, was requested by the
49-nation African Croup after South
Africa banned virtually all important
black organizations, closed two
black-operated newspapers and ar
rested some 50 black leaders last
Wednesday.
Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri of
Tunisia opened the debate in the
15-member council with a call for ap
proval of four resolutions providing
tough punitive actions including an
arms embargo.
Sanctions
International sanctions against
South Africa could pose a problem
for the Carter administration's
southern Africa policy, part of which
has been to seek South African help
in arranging black majority rule in
neighboring Rhodesia.
The United States, Britain and Fr
ance in 1975 vetoed a resolution cal
ling for a mandatory worldwide ban
on sales of arms to South Africa. The
United States and Britain currently
abide by a voluntary arms embargo.
The three Western powers were
understood to be undecided on
whether to veto such an embargo
proposal.
In reaction to the South African
crackdown, the State Department
last week recalled its ambassador to
Pretoria, William Bowdler, for con
sultations. The Netherlands and
West Germany have done likewise.
Difficult choice
If the Western countries cannot
negotiate a more general condemna
tion of South Africa and instead must
vote on an arms embargo or
economic sanctions, the Carter ad
ministration will be faced with a dif
ficult choice.
A veto could undo some of
Young's success in improving U.S.
relations with black Africa. But voting
for sanctions would antagonize
South African whites and jeopardize
the U.S. position as a mediator in the
racial disputes in southern Africa.
The General Assembly debate on
another issue, South Africa's de
fiance of U.N. demands that it sur
render control of South-West Africa,
was drawing to a close yesterday.
Act condemned
The 86-nation nonaligned group
here issued a statement condemning
last week's crackdown as "one more
act of senseless oppression" in
South Africa. But the group, which
includes most African nations, did
not call for immediate sanctions
against South Africa.
Instead, it proposed that sanctions
be imposed later if South Africa does
not meet a deadline, not yet set, for
withdrawal from South-West Africa.

The 86-nation nonaligned group
here issued a statement condemning
last week's crackdown as "one more
act of senseless oppression" in
South Africa. But the group, which
includes most African nations, did
not call for immediate sanctions
against South Africa.
Instead, it proposed that sanctions
be imposed later if South Africa does
not meet a deadline, not yet set, for
withdrawal from South-West Africa.
United Nations, N.Y. (AP) — U.S.
Ambassador Andrew Young said yes
terday he personally favors some
form of sanctions against the gov
ernment of South Africa, which car
ried out a sweeping purge of black
leaders and organizations last week.
Young spoke with reporters fol
lowing a Security Council meeting
where black-ruled African nations
called on the council to order a man
datory arms embargo and other sanc
tions against South Africa's white
minority regime. The United States

previously has vetoed such an arms
embargo proposal.
Young replied "Yes" when asked if
he favored sanctions against the Pre
toria government.
He stressed that this was a per
sonal opinion and added: "The pres
ident and secretary of state will have
to decide what sanctions are approp
riate in these conditions."
But the black U.N. envoy, who ear
lier in the day met with President
Jimmy Carter in Washington, indi
cated the United States would seek
some middle ground short of a bind
ing arms embargo. "I certainly hope
we could come up with a position we
wouldn't have to veto . . . one we
could all agree to," he said.
Expects decision
Young added he expects the Car
ter administration to make a decision
within the next two days.
The council debate, scheduled to
run four days, was requested by the
49-nation African Croup after South
Africa banned virtually all important
black organizations, closed two
black-operated newspapers and ar
rested some 50 black leaders last
Wednesday.
Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri of
Tunisia opened the debate in the
15-member council with a call for ap
proval of four resolutions providing
tough punitive actions including an
arms embargo.
Sanctions
International sanctions against
South Africa could pose a problem
for the Carter administration's
southern Africa policy, part of which
has been to seek South African help
in arranging black majority rule in
neighboring Rhodesia.
The United States, Britain and Fr
ance in 1975 vetoed a resolution cal
ling for a mandatory worldwide ban
on sales of arms to South Africa. The
United States and Britain currently
abide by a voluntary arms embargo.
The three Western powers were
understood to be undecided on
whether to veto such an embargo
proposal.
In reaction to the South African
crackdown, the State Department
last week recalled its ambassador to
Pretoria, William Bowdler, for con
sultations. The Netherlands and
West Germany have done likewise.
Difficult choice
If the Western countries cannot
negotiate a more general condemna
tion of South Africa and instead must
vote on an arms embargo or
economic sanctions, the Carter ad
ministration will be faced with a dif
ficult choice.
A veto could undo some of
Young's success in improving U.S.
relations with black Africa. But voting
for sanctions would antagonize
South African whites and jeopardize
the U.S. position as a mediator in the
racial disputes in southern Africa.
The General Assembly debate on
another issue, South Africa's de
fiance of U.N. demands that it sur
render control of South-West Africa,
was drawing to a close yesterday.
