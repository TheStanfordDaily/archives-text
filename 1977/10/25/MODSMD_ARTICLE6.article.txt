# Cure necessary
## Doctors unhealthy 
### 
David Sartoris

During recent years, American
society has been increasingly ex
posed to warnings concerning the re
latively unhealthy lifestyle of its aver
age member. Medical research has
uncovered the dangers of cigarette
smoking, alcoholism, stress and
fatigue, as well as the importance of
proper dietary habits and regular
physical exercise.
As a result, millions of Americans
have responded appropriately, creat
ing a nation-wide health movement
which could ultimately decrease
physicians visits and lower health
care costs in the long-run. In view of
these trends, it is both disturbing and
ironic that the clinical side of
medicine often fails to practice what
its research side preaches.
The training of the American clini
cal physicians is a lengthy, rigorous
process usually involving four years
of college, four of medical school,
one of internship, and variable
amounts of residency time for diffe
rent specialties. Pressure begins im
mediately in the form of stiff compet
ition for places in medical school.
The medical student must assimi
late massive quantities of knowledge
during the pre-clinical years, and is
faced with increasing responsibility
and longer hours as a clinical clerk.
Interns in most hospitals see only oc
casional glimpses of the outside
world during their year of service,
and many residencies are equally
demanding-.
In the process, the individual is
subjected to chronic stress, loss of
sleep, hurried or missed meals, in
sufficient time for exercise, and the
need for stimuli such as coffee or
cigarettes to remain alert.
The end result is all too often a
prematurely aged, chronically
fatigued, out-of-shape, cigarette
smoking, coffee-and-alcohol addict,
ready to tell patients how to take care
of themselves.
This system clearly defeats its own
purpose in several important ways.
In the first place, by frequently re
quiring that life-and-death decisions
be made by individuals who haven't
slept in 36 hours, it breeds error sec
ondary to sub-optimal performance.
Secondly, even the most compas
sionate person finds motivation to
care for another human being sev
erly stifled by chronic fatigue and ex

ternal pressure.
Furthermore, it is unreasonable to
.expect a patient to follow his doctor's
advice conerning a smoking or
weight problem when the adviser
has failed to solve the same problem
himself.
A more rational and humane ap
proach to the learning and ultimate
practice of medicine, capable of
producing individuals whose com
passion has not been replaced by
cynicism, is clearly in order. The
happy, healthy, well-rested doctor is
likely to care more and err less in
interactions with patients, resulting
in better patient care, improved
physician-patient rapport, and less
frequent malpractice suits.
Several eastern hospitals have al
ready introduced "floating" intern
ships, whereby an individual is on
call all day, seven days per week, but
is replaced by a "float" each even
ing; interns alternate as "floats" for
variable intervals during their year of
service.
This arrangement contrasts mar
kedly with the present system at
most hospitals which often demands
periods of up to 48 hours without
sleep or freedom to leave the hospi
tal.
Other means of lowering the inci
dence of the "unhealthy physician
syndrome" might include in-hospital
recreational facilities for on-call

exercise, increased involvement of
other health care employes (nurses,
paramedics, physician assistants,
etc.) in patient monitoring, expan
sion of internship programs in cur
rently understaffed institutions and
teaching sessions designed to in
struct aspiring doctors in such mat
ters as diet, exercise and coping ef
fectively with stress.
At the level of the practicing physi
cians, group practices have begun to
ease the individual workload while
maintaining the familiarity and con
tinuity which are vital to optimal pa
tient care. A national health care sys
tem which allows for scheduled
hours and eliminates present
economic inventives for over
scheduling of patients would also be
beneficial.
Clearly, such measures will not
only improve the image of the physi
cian in the patient's eye, but will also
increase his/her productive years of
public service. Forced early retire
ment due to poor health and divorce
and suicide rates exceeding most
other American occupations are cre
dentials which do not belong in the
doctor's black bag. If the national
goal of a happy, healthy, fit society is
even to be fully realized, significant
efforts must first be made to heal the
healers.

uncovered the dangers of cigarette
smoking, alcoholism, stress and
fatigue, as well as the importance of
proper dietary habits and regular
physical exercise.
As a result, millions of Americans
have responded appropriately, creat
ing a nation-wide health movement
which could ultimately decrease
physicians visits and lower health
care costs in the long-run. In view of
these trends, it is both disturbing and
ironic that the clinical side of
medicine often fails to practice what
its research side preaches.
The training of the American clini
cal physicians is a lengthy, rigorous
process usually involving four years
of college, four of medical school,
one of internship, and variable
amounts of residency time for diffe
rent specialties. Pressure begins im
mediately in the form of stiff compet
ition for places in medical school.
The medical student must assimi
late massive quantities of knowledge
during the pre-clinical years, and is
faced with increasing responsibility
and longer hours as a clinical clerk.
Interns in most hospitals see only oc
casional glimpses of the outside
world during their year of service,
and many residencies are equally
demanding-.
In the process, the individual is
subjected to chronic stress, loss of
sleep, hurried or missed meals, in
sufficient time for exercise, and the
need for stimuli such as coffee or
cigarettes to remain alert.
The end result is all too often a
prematurely aged, chronically
fatigued, out-of-shape, cigarette
smoking, coffee-and-alcohol addict,
ready to tell patients how to take care
of themselves.
This system clearly defeats its own
purpose in several important ways.
In the first place, by frequently re
quiring that life-and-death decisions
be made by individuals who haven't
slept in 36 hours, it breeds error sec
ondary to sub-optimal performance.
Secondly, even the most compas
sionate person finds motivation to
care for another human being sev
erly stifled by chronic fatigue and ex

ternal pressure.
Furthermore, it is unreasonable to
.expect a patient to follow his doctor's
advice conerning a smoking or
weight problem when the adviser
has failed to solve the same problem
himself.
A more rational and humane ap
proach to the learning and ultimate
practice of medicine, capable of
producing individuals whose com
passion has not been replaced by
cynicism, is clearly in order. The
happy, healthy, well-rested doctor is
likely to care more and err less in
interactions with patients, resulting
in better patient care, improved
physician-patient rapport, and less
frequent malpractice suits.
Several eastern hospitals have al
ready introduced "floating" intern
ships, whereby an individual is on
call all day, seven days per week, but
is replaced by a "float" each even
ing; interns alternate as "floats" for
variable intervals during their year of
service.
This arrangement contrasts mar
kedly with the present system at
most hospitals which often demands
periods of up to 48 hours without
sleep or freedom to leave the hospi
tal.
Other means of lowering the inci
dence of the "unhealthy physician
syndrome" might include in-hospital
recreational facilities for on-call

exercise, increased involvement of
other health care employes (nurses,
paramedics, physician assistants,
etc.) in patient monitoring, expan
sion of internship programs in cur
rently understaffed institutions and
teaching sessions designed to in
struct aspiring doctors in such mat
ters as diet, exercise and coping ef
fectively with stress.
At the level of the practicing physi
cians, group practices have begun to
ease the individual workload while
maintaining the familiarity and con
tinuity which are vital to optimal pa
tient care. A national health care sys
tem which allows for scheduled
hours and eliminates present
economic inventives for over
scheduling of patients would also be
beneficial.
Clearly, such measures will not
only improve the image of the physi
cian in the patient's eye, but will also
increase his/her productive years of
public service. Forced early retire
ment due to poor health and divorce
and suicide rates exceeding most
other American occupations are cre
dentials which do not belong in the
doctor's black bag. If the national
goal of a happy, healthy, fit society is
even to be fully realized, significant
efforts must first be made to heal the
healers.
