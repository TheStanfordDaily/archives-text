Kent State gym experience
While I found Mike Shuman's dis
cussion of the campaign against the
building of the gym at Kent State
(Daily, Oct. 19) very thoughtful, I
cannot agree with his assessment
that the effort was essentially a waste
of time.
Shuman's cynicism about the pas
sions provoked by the gym manifests
a failure to grasp both the impor
tance of preserving one's history and
the potential power of symbols.
In a country that regularly writes its
entire history of internal dissent and
strife out of the textbooks, thus ob
literating it from the collective con
sciousness, the value of any attempts
to preserve and evoke that history
cannot be overestimated.

In this respect and in as much as
the move to stop the gym was from
the beginning clearly symbolic,
Shuman's point about the gym only
being on "the periphery of the shoot
ing site" is not terribly relevant.
As for the power of symbols —
don't forget it was the largely sym
bolic tearing down of the Bastille that
precipitated one of the most far
reaching revolutions in modern his
tory.
So who knows! Perhaps a seem
ingly insignificant athletic facility on
the campus of Kent State University
has not yet played out its historic role
in the struggle for radical change in
America.
