# Dominant senate slates need to be eliminated
## 
### 
Rob Docters

In the past few years a succession
of slates have swept into control of
the ASSU Senate. These slates have
included candidates sponsored by
the Chaparral, the Alliance for Radi
cal Change, the Black Students' Un
ion, the Conservative Student Union
and most recently, the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee.
The reason for the successes of
these slates is simple: because of the
great number of candidates, ranging
from 40 this year to over 80 a few
years back, the votes cast are suffi
ciently diffused that the absolute
number of votes needed to be
elected is not very high. A few years

ago one could be elected to the Se
nate with a mere 273 votes. Few vote
getters have ever received a mandate
more substantial than two per cent of
the electorate.
Put differently, these figures say
that a relatively small but cohesive
group can dominate the senate if it
wishes. This is what has happened
this year and in previous years.
Actually I don't believe there is
anything intrinsically wrong with
this. However, in practice this has
meant that the general run of stu
dents rarely has any representation
in the ASSU Senate. In practice it has
also lead to a fairly narrow, unrepre
sentative and often unproductive
body of senators.
This leads to the question of what
the makeup of the senate ought to
be. Under the present system, each
year's senate has been dominated by
a victorious slate, and the ASSU has
suffered for this fact. Does this mean
slates are undesirable?
I don't believe so. Slates can offer
three basic advantages over inde
pendent candidates:
1. They frequently are more ba
lanced, both in expertise and in
terests, than single candidates.
2. The depth of research possible
is greater with a slate, as the research
tasks can be split.
3. A slate, from two persons on
up, has more impact on the senate,
and hence is more likely to be able to
pursue a complete legislative prog
ram.
I note however, that the slate does
not have to be very large to do this.
One three-member slate elected last

year in fact proved more legislatively
productive (or in any event, more
prolific) that the larger six-member
slate that initially appeared to control
the senate.
H is only when a slate is dominant,
rather than merely influential, that it
destroys the possibility of discussion
and compromise in the interest of
minority views.
I would suggest that a non
dominant slate is able to pursue its
more positive goals effectively,
without being able to impose its less
acceptable views on the students as a
whole. I suggest this is a desirable
situation. The question then be
comes how to prevent the election of
slates which would dominate the se
nate?
At present all voters have 10 votes
in ASSU Senate elections. Most cast
an average of five votes. Those who
cast more either do so totally at ran
dom or cast all their votes for one
large slate. This is how the SOC Slate
was elected; 90 per cent of the votes
they received came from ballots
which contained votes for seven or
more members of that slate. In other
words, SOC was elected by about 550
people who cast all 10 of their votes
to them. Although I do not have ac
cess to any supportive data, I suspect
that this is how past slates have been
elected as well.
This suggests a fairly easy way of
preventing domination of the Senate
by a narrow interest group. If one
were to reduce the number of votes
people were able to cast, say to five,
this would prevent one small but
cohesive group from obtaining abso

lute control of the Senate.
With five votes, minority groups
would still be able to elect very pow
erful representatives of their in
terests to the senate, yet not be able
to irresponsibly manipulate that
body for a year. Few members of
large slates tend to run for re
election, so they are never held re
sponsible for their actions.
Limiting the number of votes to
five (the average cast) would also re
duce the number of random votes.
Few people ever know more than a
few of the candidates running or fully

support the platforms of more than a
couple of others. Perhaps with fewer
votes, people might be more
thoughtful about how they voted.
I believe that the events of this year
and the past several years point
strongly to the need for election re
form. Reducing the number of votes
to be cast seems a reasonable first
step that would eliminate a signific
ant defect that has crippled the per
formance of the ASSU senate.

elected as well.
This suggests a fairly easy way of
preventing domination of the Senate
by a narrow interest group. If one
were to reduce the number of votes
people were able to cast, say to five,
this would prevent one small but
cohesive group from obtaining abso

lute control of the Senate.
With five votes, minority groups
would still be able to elect very pow
erful representatives of their in
terests to the senate, yet not be able
to irresponsibly manipulate that
body for a year. Few members of
large slates tend to run for re
election, so they are never held re
sponsible for their actions.
Limiting the number of votes to
five (the average cast) would also re
duce the number of random votes.
Few people ever know more than a
few of the candidates running or fully

support the platforms of more than a
couple of others. Perhaps with fewer
votes, people might be more
thoughtful about how they voted.
I believe that the events of this year
and the past several years point
strongly to the need for election re
form. Reducing the number of votes
to be cast seems a reasonable first
step that would eliminate a signific
ant defect that has crippled the per
formance of the ASSU senate.

In the past few years a succession
of slates have swept into control of
the ASSU Senate. These slates have
included candidates sponsored by
the Chaparral, the Alliance for Radi
cal Change, the Black Students' Un
ion, the Conservative Student Union
and most recently, the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee.
The reason for the successes of
these slates is simple: because of the
great number of candidates, ranging
from 40 this year to over 80 a few
years back, the votes cast are suffi
ciently diffused that the absolute
number of votes needed to be
elected is not very high. A few years

ago one could be elected to the Se
nate with a mere 273 votes. Few vote
getters have ever received a mandate
more substantial than two per cent of
the electorate.
Put differently, these figures say
that a relatively small but cohesive
group can dominate the senate if it
wishes. This is what has happened
this year and in previous years.
Actually I don't believe there is
anything intrinsically wrong with
this. However, in practice this has
meant that the general run of stu
dents rarely has any representation
in the ASSU Senate. In practice it has
also lead to a fairly narrow, unrepre
sentative and often unproductive
body of senators.
This leads to the question of what
the makeup of the senate ought to
be. Under the present system, each
year's senate has been dominated by
a victorious slate, and the ASSU has
suffered for this fact. Does this mean
slates are undesirable?
I don't believe so. Slates can offer
three basic advantages over inde
pendent candidates:
1. They frequently are more ba
lanced, both in expertise and in
terests, than single candidates.
2. The depth of research possible
is greater with a slate, as the research
tasks can be split.
3. A slate, from two persons on
up, has more impact on the senate,
and hence is more likely to be able to
pursue a complete legislative prog
ram.
I note however, that the slate does
not have to be very large to do this.
One three-member slate elected last

year in fact proved more legislatively
productive (or in any event, more
prolific) that the larger six-member
slate that initially appeared to control
the senate.
H is only when a slate is dominant,
rather than merely influential, that it
destroys the possibility of discussion
and compromise in the interest of
minority views.
I would suggest that a non
dominant slate is able to pursue its
more positive goals effectively,
without being able to impose its less
acceptable views on the students as a
whole. I suggest this is a desirable
situation. The question then be
comes how to prevent the election of
slates which would dominate the se
nate?
At present all voters have 10 votes
in ASSU Senate elections. Most cast
an average of five votes. Those who
cast more either do so totally at ran
dom or cast all their votes for one
large slate. This is how the SOC Slate
was elected; 90 per cent of the votes
they received came from ballots
which contained votes for seven or
more members of that slate. In other
words, SOC was elected by about 550
people who cast all 10 of their votes
to them. Although I do not have ac
cess to any supportive data, I suspect
that this is how past slates have been
elected as well.

not have to be very large to do this.
One three-member slate elected last

year in fact proved more legislatively
productive (or in any event, more
prolific) that the larger six-member
slate that initially appeared to control
the senate.
H is only when a slate is dominant,
rather than merely influential, that it
destroys the possibility of discussion
and compromise in the interest of
minority views.
I would suggest that a non
dominant slate is able to pursue its
more positive goals effectively,
without being able to impose its less
acceptable views on the students as a
whole. I suggest this is a desirable
situation. The question then be
comes how to prevent the election of
slates which would dominate the se
nate?
At present all voters have 10 votes
in ASSU Senate elections. Most cast
an average of five votes. Those who
cast more either do so totally at ran
dom or cast all their votes for one
large slate. This is how the SOC Slate
was elected; 90 per cent of the votes
they received came from ballots
which contained votes for seven or
more members of that slate. In other
words, SOC was elected by about 550
people who cast all 10 of their votes
to them. Although I do not have ac
cess to any supportive data, I suspect
that this is how past slates have been
elected as well.
This suggests a fairly easy way of
preventing domination of the Senate
by a narrow interest group. If one
were to reduce the number of votes
people were able to cast, say to five,
this would prevent one small but
cohesive group from obtaining abso

lute control of the Senate.
With five votes, minority groups
would still be able to elect very pow
erful representatives of their in
terests to the senate, yet not be able
to irresponsibly manipulate that
body for a year. Few members of
large slates tend to run for re
election, so they are never held re
sponsible for their actions.
Limiting the number of votes to
five (the average cast) would also re
duce the number of random votes.
Few people ever know more than a
few of the candidates running or fully

support the platforms of more than a
couple of others. Perhaps with fewer
votes, people might be more
thoughtful about how they voted.
I believe that the events of this year
and the past several years point
strongly to the need for election re
form. Reducing the number of votes
to be cast seems a reasonable first
step that would eliminate a signific
ant defect that has crippled the per
formance of the ASSU senate.
