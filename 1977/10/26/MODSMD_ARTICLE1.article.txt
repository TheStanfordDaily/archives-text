# Livingston claims no wrongdoing

### Craig Dennis 
ASSU Senator-elect Dan
Livingston continued to deny his di
rect involvement in recent senate
campaign irregularities on last
night's KZSU Campus Conference
and stated he "absolutely expects"
to be seated when the senate first
convenes next Monday.
He said he sees "no reason why I
would not be seated." Livingston
appeared on last night's program
with Senate Chairman Pat Flinn.
In other election news, Election
Commissioner Sean Murphy an
nounced last night that he will no
longer recommend the disqualifica
tion of Alternate Senators-elect
Robert Docters and Sue O'Hara and
candidate Mark Chin for exceeding
the $50 campaign limit.
A memorandum from a local
printer was received by Murphy yes
terday indicating the over
expenditure error was the responsi
bility of the printing firm.
Docters said last night, "I could
have gotten the note (from the
printer) a week ago; I didn't realize
the impact. I am left with a feeling
there was damage done, and I am
sorry that is the case."
On Campus Conference,
Livingston said a blue campaign
sheet was originally conceived by
him, but after turning the idea and
first draft over to Conservative Stu
dent Union President Don Barton,
his involvement in its distribution
ceased.
He said the blue flyer had a
"legitimate political argument" and
that the First Amendment's freedom
of speech and press protected its
printing. Livingston said, "I at no
time attempted to conceal my role in
the flyers."
He continued, "I wouldn't say it
was misleading. I would say every
thing in there was a factual appraisal
of the issues."
Speaking on Murphy's involve
ment in the case to date, Livingston
said, "I think he has probably been
prejudiced in our case because of
misleading statements that were
made by Mr. (Kevin) Childress and
Mr. Barton, and therefore has oper
ated entirely with a presumption of
guilt without a presumption of any
innocence on any of our parts."
Livingston would not claim collec
tive responsibility for the actions of
Childress, his slate member, and of
Barton, their campaign manager.
"Collective responsibility is a term
conceived by the election commis
sioner that I think is without basis in
either a legal context or news con
text," he said.
Flinn, who has been investigating
the recently concluded campaign,
said, "What is perhaps most disturb
ing on this is not the individual viola
tions or whether or not their totals
add up, but what I feel is a pervading
sense of pettiness and politicking
that has seemed to overcome almost
everyone that has come in contact
with the whole issue."
He continued, "You have the SOC
(Stanford Organizing Committee)
candidates who on one hand earlier
in the election said they had no prior
involvement in any way; a very broad
sweeping statement they all signed
saying they didn't have any involve
ment with this.
"Now they are not willing to stand
by that statement," Flinn said, "and
what they are saying now is they
don't do anything to violate the ASSU
bylaws.
"They will not answer the ques
tion. Did they have anything to do
with that yellow sheet (which was
stuffed in copies of the Daily)? I don't
see why they are not willing to say
that, except for the fact they may be
worried that somehow they will have
to account for their actions. That's
the thing that's upsetting to me and I
think to many students."
Flinn said he was "amazed" at the
number of students that volunteered
to serve on his proposed Election Re
view Board (ERB). He said he is confi
dent the senate will approve the ERB
when it convenes Monday.
Flinn said, "The senate can dele
gate power and that's why I am cal
ling the meeting for Monday."

On Campus Conference,
Livingston said a blue campaign
sheet was originally conceived by
him, but after turning the idea and
first draft over to Conservative Stu
dent Union President Don Barton,
his involvement in its distribution
ceased.
He said the blue flyer had a
"legitimate political argument" and
that the First Amendment's freedom
of speech and press protected its
printing. Livingston said, "I at no
time attempted to conceal my role in
the flyers."
He continued, "I wouldn't say it
was misleading. I would say every
thing in there was a factual appraisal
of the issues."
Speaking on Murphy's involve
ment in the case to date, Livingston
said, "I think he has probably been
prejudiced in our case because of
misleading statements that were
made by Mr. (Kevin) Childress and
Mr. Barton, and therefore has oper
ated entirely with a presumption of
guilt without a presumption of any
innocence on any of our parts."
Livingston would not claim collec
tive responsibility for the actions of
Childress, his slate member, and of
Barton, their campaign manager.
"Collective responsibility is a term
conceived by the election commis
sioner that I think is without basis in
either a legal context or news con
text," he said.
Flinn, who has been investigating
the recently concluded campaign,
said, "What is perhaps most disturb
ing on this is not the individual viola
tions or whether or not their totals
add up, but what I feel is a pervading
sense of pettiness and politicking
that has seemed to overcome almost
everyone that has come in contact
with the whole issue."
He continued, "You have the SOC
(Stanford Organizing Committee)
candidates who on one hand earlier
in the election said they had no prior
involvement in any way; a very broad
sweeping statement they all signed
saying they didn't have any involve
ment with this.
"Now they are not willing to stand
by that statement," Flinn said, "and
what they are saying now is they
don't do anything to violate the ASSU
bylaws.
"They will not answer the ques
tion. Did they have anything to do
with that yellow sheet (which was
stuffed in copies of the Daily)? I don't
see why they are not willing to say
that, except for the fact they may be
worried that somehow they will have
to account for their actions. That's
the thing that's upsetting to me and I
think to many students."
Flinn said he was "amazed" at the
number of students that volunteered
to serve on his proposed Election Re
view Board (ERB). He said he is confi
dent the senate will approve the ERB
when it convenes Monday.
Flinn said, "The senate can dele
gate power and that's why I am cal
ling the meeting for Monday."
ASSU Senator-elect Dan
Livingston continued to deny his di
rect involvement in recent senate
campaign irregularities on last
night's KZSU Campus Conference
and stated he "absolutely expects"
to be seated when the senate first
convenes next Monday.
He said he sees "no reason why I
would not be seated." Livingston
appeared on last night's program
with Senate Chairman Pat Flinn.
In other election news, Election
Commissioner Sean Murphy an
nounced last night that he will no
longer recommend the disqualifica
tion of Alternate Senators-elect
Robert Docters and Sue O'Hara and
candidate Mark Chin for exceeding
the $50 campaign limit.
A memorandum from a local
printer was received by Murphy yes
terday indicating the over
expenditure error was the responsi
bility of the printing firm.
Docters said last night, "I could
have gotten the note (from the
printer) a week ago; I didn't realize
the impact. I am left with a feeling
there was damage done, and I am
sorry that is the case."
