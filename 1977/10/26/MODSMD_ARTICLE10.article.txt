# Israel's policy: What does it mean?
##

Myia Kaye

Sami Suleiman's column (Daily,
Oct. 6) contains some inaccuracies
and leaves unanswered the question
of why Isreal will not deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
As another Palestinian, I believe I can
to a great extent clarify the issues.
As a first point, it has to be remem
bered that the Palestinian refugees
are not, except as a propaganda mea
sure, an intrinsic or important issue
in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Arabs began massacring Jews in
Palestine in 1919. Their first major
war against Israel was in 1948 upon
the Jewish state's establishment.
Thus, far from being about refugees,
it is this war that caused the refugees
to exist! In plain terms, the Israeli-
Arab conflict is about the existence
of Israel — the Israelis want to exist

and the Arabs do not want them to.
As this does not sound very nice, and
certainly not at all legal, the refugees
are a handy peg on which to hang
their cause. For this reason, Palesti
nians have been kept refugees and
held forcibly in camps by their Arab
brethren for almost 30 years.
How did the Palestinian refugees
become so? Are all Palestinians re
fugees? What are their numbers? Just
before their attack in 1948, the Arab
nations announced they were going
to destroy Israel's Jews, and advised
the Arab population to leave, on the
understanding that they would re
turn after the Arab victory and reap
the spoils. Exact figures are unavaila
ble, but about one-half million took
advantage of the offer, a considera
ble number did not.
Of those who left, when the Arab
victory did not happen, a large
number settled in areas of former
Palestine, now Jordan, and became
Jordanians. Some found new jobs
and new lives in other Arab lands,
many in Kuwait, for example. The
remainder were kept in camps and
supported by the United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency (that is, the
nations of the world, mainly the
U.S.). These number today, about
one-half million.
The number of Arabs who did not
leave Israel at the enemy's behest in
1948, now numberoverone-half mill
ion. They are not refugees, but indi
genous citizens of the State of Israel,
living in their traditional villages and
towns, such as Nazareth.
Jewish Palestinian
I am one of the Palestinians who
did not side with my country's
enemies in 1948 and did not desert it.
I am a Jewish Palestinian, like the
many whose forefathers lived'in
Palestine for a century, and whose
ancestors lived there for many cen
turies.
While everyone must sympathize
with a fellow human in distress, my
general sympathy for the refugee
Palestinians is somewhat tempered
by the fact that they created their
own plight by an act of treason and
disloyalty against their state. No one
made them refugees. They did it
themselves. The question is scarcely
their 'rights' to the country they bet
rayed, but a human problem of how
to alleviate the plight of those who
are suffering, whether physically or
from lack of cohesion to a group.
If only all refugee problems, such
as those which arose in the musical
chairs games of Europe during two
world wars, were so easily physically
soluble! These Arab refugees belong
to a proudly self-proclaimed one
Arab nation. It is a rich nation, a very
rich one, in terms of land and money,
and poor in terms of population.
If the Arab nation would accept the
fact that Israel is here to stay and
drop their propaganda weapon, no
thing is lacking to reinstate the Arab
refugees within the vast lands of the
Arab nation as proud integrated citi
zens. If 'Palestine' has a mystique for
some individuals, there is an Arab
part of what was once Palestine, Jor
dan, created by the British some 40
years ago and refugees can find a
homeland there, among their own
people, on Palestinian soil. A large
number of the Jordanian population
consists of Palestinians. Even
financially-struggling Israel is manag
ing to settle, in jobs and homes, the
refugees in camps on the Gaza strip,
now under Israeli occupation — re
fugees kept literally prisoners in the
camps by the Egyptians before the
1967 war.
Why no talks?
Why will Israel not talk to the PLO
and why will Israel not take back
Palestinian refugees?

The PLO is not a vague group of
refugees with undefined aims. It is a
group of people with a clearly
specified aim laid out in an official
charter to which all PLO members
subscribe. This charter is not secret.
It has been published for all to read.
Its aim is the dismemberment and
destruction of the Jewish State and
the setting up in its place of a predo
minantly Arab state of Palestine. To
make sure that the replacement state
will be Judenrein, all Jews who en
tered Israel after 1948 are to be expel
led and lose their nationality — "go
back to their homes." No Jews are to
be permitted to enter. This would
dismember the state of Israel and en
sure its replacement by an Arab state
with a small Jewish ghetto. The
method is to be by terror and war, as
for example, the Munich, Ma'alot
and Lydda airport massacres.
How can Israel talk, then, with the
PLO? What is there to talk about?
How to begin committing suicide? At
what rate? Who first? Until those of
the Palestinian people who do not
support the PLO find a different
leadership, Israel has no Palestinians
to talk to.
Why Israel preferred?
Why does the unknown (where
does Suleiman's number "about (my
italics added) 47 per cent" come
from?) number of refugees prefer
the Jewish state of Israel as a place to
settle rather than the equally Palesti
nian Jordan?
As a citizen of Israel who has de
fended my country against those
self-same Palestinians and the Arab
armies of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt,
Saudi-Arabia and the Sudan in three
wars of aggression by the Arabs
aimed at the destruction of Israel,
may I be pardoned if I regard their
sudden desire to join me as fellow
citizens with a certain amount of
scepticism? The desire to regain the
properties they left — to assist the
enemy in 1948 — is just a wee bit, let's
not mince terms, ludicrous. It is
frightening, too — the Palestinians
have shown only too recently what
they do to their host countries,e.g.
Jordan and Lebanon.
The Americans who left Britain in
the 17th century to escape religious
persecution were not even siding
with any enemy. I have yet to meet a
Mayflower descendent who sets out
claims to, say, the area of London

where Euston railway station and the
Houses of Parliament now stand, on
the grounds that they were pasture
lands belonging to his ancestors who
fled Britain so long ago. I doubt if the
Mayflower Americans would expect
to be taken seriously if they de
manded England closed to all immig
ration except from America, and the
expulsion of all Englishmen from En
gland apart from those already there
before the Mayflower set sail. This, in
analogy, is precisely what the Pales
tinians claim!
Defensible borders needed
Why not a separate Palestinian
state next to Israel on the West Bank?
There might, indeed, be something
to talk about once the PLO charter is
torn up. But under this charter, who
would want neighbors with a sworn
aim to destroy you, sitting at the side
of your vulnerable eight-mile-wide
neck? Neighbors armed to the teeth
by Russia? I doubt if any thinking
person fails to acknowledge Israel's
necessity for defensible borders, nor
needs to read into this glaringly self
evident need, any hidden "expan
sionist aims."
In conclusion, in the 1940-50s, Is
rael absorbed an even greater
number — 800,000 — of Jewish re
fugees from Arab lands than there
are Palestinian refugees today. They
came stripped of all possessions.
Their health status was a public
health man's nightmare — rickets,
tuberculosis, eye disease, you name
it. The majority had no skills and
were illiterate. These Jewish re
fugees, within 20 years, were ab
sorbed by the tiny population into
the Jewish state. They do not seem to
suffer any mystique pangs for Iraq or
Egypt. They have a new land, jobs,
housing and health and education
for their children. As Jews, they live
in a Jewish country even if it is not the
country of their birth.
I suggest it is time we say bluntly to
the Arabs "Go thou and do likewise.
Stop using the Palestinians as prop
aganda. Start using them as fellow
Arabs." Israel will not go away and
cannot be made to go away. But she
can be a very good friend and the
Jews and Arabs working together,
the Israeli and Arab nations, could
make the Middle East a blessing and
not a curse.

group of people with a clearly
specified aim laid out in an official
charter to which all PLO members
subscribe. This charter is not secret.
It has been published for all to read.
Its aim is the dismemberment and
destruction of the Jewish State and
the setting up in its place of a predo
minantly Arab state of Palestine. To
make sure that the replacement state
will be Judenrein, all Jews who en
tered Israel after 1948 are to be expel
led and lose their nationality — "go
back to their homes." No Jews are to
be permitted to enter. This would
dismember the state of Israel and en
sure its replacement by an Arab state
with a small Jewish ghetto. The
method is to be by terror and war, as
for example, the Munich, Ma'alot
and Lydda airport massacres.
How can Israel talk, then, with the
PLO? What is there to talk about?
How to begin committing suicide? At
what rate? Who first? Until those of
the Palestinian people who do not
support the PLO find a different
leadership, Israel has no Palestinians
to talk to.
Why Israel preferred?
Why does the unknown (where
does Suleiman's number "about (my
italics added) 47 per cent" come
from?) number of refugees prefer
the Jewish state of Israel as a place to
settle rather than the equally Palesti
nian Jordan?
As a citizen of Israel who has de
fended my country against those
self-same Palestinians and the Arab
armies of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt,
Saudi-Arabia and the Sudan in three
wars of aggression by the Arabs
aimed at the destruction of Israel,
may I be pardoned if I regard their
sudden desire to join me as fellow
citizens with a certain amount of
scepticism? The desire to regain the
properties they left — to assist the
enemy in 1948 — is just a wee bit, let's
not mince terms, ludicrous. It is
frightening, too — the Palestinians
have shown only too recently what
they do to their host countries,e.g.
Jordan and Lebanon.
The Americans who left Britain in
the 17th century to escape religious
persecution were not even siding
with any enemy. I have yet to meet a
Mayflower descendent who sets out
claims to, say, the area of London

where Euston railway station and the
Houses of Parliament now stand, on
the grounds that they were pasture
lands belonging to his ancestors who
fled Britain so long ago. I doubt if the
Mayflower Americans would expect
to be taken seriously if they de
manded England closed to all immig
ration except from America, and the
expulsion of all Englishmen from En
gland apart from those already there
before the Mayflower set sail. This, in
analogy, is precisely what the Pales
tinians claim!
Defensible borders needed
Why not a separate Palestinian
state next to Israel on the West Bank?
There might, indeed, be something
to talk about once the PLO charter is
torn up. But under this charter, who
would want neighbors with a sworn
aim to destroy you, sitting at the side
of your vulnerable eight-mile-wide
neck? Neighbors armed to the teeth
by Russia? I doubt if any thinking
person fails to acknowledge Israel's
necessity for defensible borders, nor
needs to read into this glaringly self
evident need, any hidden "expan
sionist aims."
In conclusion, in the 1940-50s, Is
rael absorbed an even greater
number — 800,000 — of Jewish re
fugees from Arab lands than there
are Palestinian refugees today. They
came stripped of all possessions.
Their health status was a public
health man's nightmare — rickets,
tuberculosis, eye disease, you name
it. The majority had no skills and
were illiterate. These Jewish re
fugees, within 20 years, were ab
sorbed by the tiny population into
the Jewish state. They do not seem to
suffer any mystique pangs for Iraq or
Egypt. They have a new land, jobs,
housing and health and education
for their children. As Jews, they live
in a Jewish country even if it is not the
country of their birth.
I suggest it is time we say bluntly to
the Arabs "Go thou and do likewise.
Stop using the Palestinians as prop
aganda. Start using them as fellow
Arabs." Israel will not go away and
cannot be made to go away. But she
can be a very good friend and the
Jews and Arabs working together,
the Israeli and Arab nations, could
make the Middle East a blessing and
not a curse.

Sami Suleiman's column (Daily,
Oct. 6) contains some inaccuracies
and leaves unanswered the question
of why Isreal will not deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
As another Palestinian, I believe I can
to a great extent clarify the issues.
As a first point, it has to be remem
bered that the Palestinian refugees
are not, except as a propaganda mea
sure, an intrinsic or important issue
in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Arabs began massacring Jews in
Palestine in 1919. Their first major
war against Israel was in 1948 upon
the Jewish state's establishment.
Thus, far from being about refugees,
it is this war that caused the refugees
to exist! In plain terms, the Israeli-
Arab conflict is about the existence
of Israel — the Israelis want to exist

and the Arabs do not want them to.
As this does not sound very nice, and
certainly not at all legal, the refugees
are a handy peg on which to hang
their cause. For this reason, Palesti
nians have been kept refugees and
held forcibly in camps by their Arab
brethren for almost 30 years.
How did the Palestinian refugees
become so? Are all Palestinians re
fugees? What are their numbers? Just
before their attack in 1948, the Arab
nations announced they were going
to destroy Israel's Jews, and advised
the Arab population to leave, on the
understanding that they would re
turn after the Arab victory and reap
the spoils. Exact figures are unavaila
ble, but about one-half million took
advantage of the offer, a considera
ble number did not.
Of those who left, when the Arab
victory did not happen, a large
number settled in areas of former
Palestine, now Jordan, and became
Jordanians. Some found new jobs
and new lives in other Arab lands,
many in Kuwait, for example. The
remainder were kept in camps and
supported by the United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency (that is, the
nations of the world, mainly the
U.S.). These number today, about
one-half million.
The number of Arabs who did not
leave Israel at the enemy's behest in
1948, now numberoverone-half mill
ion. They are not refugees, but indi
genous citizens of the State of Israel,
living in their traditional villages and
towns, such as Nazareth.
Jewish Palestinian
I am one of the Palestinians who
did not side with my country's
enemies in 1948 and did not desert it.
I am a Jewish Palestinian, like the
many whose forefathers lived'in
Palestine for a century, and whose
ancestors lived there for many cen
turies.
While everyone must sympathize
with a fellow human in distress, my
general sympathy for the refugee
Palestinians is somewhat tempered
by the fact that they created their
own plight by an act of treason and
disloyalty against their state. No one
made them refugees. They did it
themselves. The question is scarcely
their 'rights' to the country they bet
rayed, but a human problem of how
to alleviate the plight of those who
are suffering, whether physically or
from lack of cohesion to a group.
If only all refugee problems, such
as those which arose in the musical
chairs games of Europe during two
world wars, were so easily physically
soluble! These Arab refugees belong
to a proudly self-proclaimed one
Arab nation. It is a rich nation, a very
rich one, in terms of land and money,
and poor in terms of population.
If the Arab nation would accept the
fact that Israel is here to stay and
drop their propaganda weapon, no
thing is lacking to reinstate the Arab
refugees within the vast lands of the
Arab nation as proud integrated citi
zens. If 'Palestine' has a mystique for
some individuals, there is an Arab
part of what was once Palestine, Jor
dan, created by the British some 40
years ago and refugees can find a
homeland there, among their own
people, on Palestinian soil. A large
number of the Jordanian population
consists of Palestinians. Even
financially-struggling Israel is manag
ing to settle, in jobs and homes, the
refugees in camps on the Gaza strip,
now under Israeli occupation — re
fugees kept literally prisoners in the
camps by the Egyptians before the
1967 war.
Why no talks?
Why will Israel not talk to the PLO
and why will Israel not take back
Palestinian refugees?

The PLO is not a vague group of
refugees with undefined aims. It is a

specified aim laid out in an official

Sami Suleiman's column (Daily,
Oct. 6) contains some inaccuracies
and leaves unanswered the question
of why Isreal will not deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
As another Palestinian, I believe I can
to a great extent clarify the issues.
As a first point, it has to be remem
bered that the Palestinian refugees
are not, except as a propaganda mea
sure, an intrinsic or important issue
in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Arabs began massacring Jews in
Palestine in 1919. Their first major
war against Israel was in 1948 upon
the Jewish state's establishment.
Thus, far from being about refugees,
it is this war that caused the refugees
to exist! In plain terms, the Israeli-
Arab conflict is about the existence
of Israel — the Israelis want to exist

and the Arabs do not want them to.
As this does not sound very nice, and
certainly not at all legal, the refugees
are a handy peg on which to hang
their cause. For this reason, Palesti
nians have been kept refugees and
held forcibly in camps by their Arab
brethren for almost 30 years.
How did the Palestinian refugees
become so? Are all Palestinians re
fugees? What are their numbers? Just
before their attack in 1948, the Arab
nations announced they were going
to destroy Israel's Jews, and advised
the Arab population to leave, on the
understanding that they would re
turn after the Arab victory and reap
the spoils. Exact figures are unavaila
ble, but about one-half million took
advantage of the offer, a considera
ble number did not.
Of those who left, when the Arab
victory did not happen, a large
number settled in areas of former
Palestine, now Jordan, and became
Jordanians. Some found new jobs
and new lives in other Arab lands,
many in Kuwait, for example. The
remainder were kept in camps and
supported by the United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency (that is, the
nations of the world, mainly the
U.S.). These number today, about
one-half million.
The number of Arabs who did not
leave Israel at the enemy's behest in
1948, now numberoverone-half mill
ion. They are not refugees, but indi
genous citizens of the State of Israel,
living in their traditional villages and
towns, such as Nazareth.
Jewish Palestinian
I am one of the Palestinians who
did not side with my country's
enemies in 1948 and did not desert it.
I am a Jewish Palestinian, like the
many whose forefathers lived'in
Palestine for a century, and whose
ancestors lived there for many cen
turies.
While everyone must sympathize
with a fellow human in distress, my
general sympathy for the refugee
Palestinians is somewhat tempered
by the fact that they created their
own plight by an act of treason and
disloyalty against their state. No one
made them refugees. They did it
themselves. The question is scarcely
their 'rights' to the country they bet
rayed, but a human problem of how
to alleviate the plight of those who
are suffering, whether physically or
from lack of cohesion to a group.
If only all refugee problems, such
as those which arose in the musical
chairs games of Europe during two
world wars, were so easily physically
soluble! These Arab refugees belong
to a proudly self-proclaimed one
Arab nation. It is a rich nation, a very
rich one, in terms of land and money,
and poor in terms of population.
If the Arab nation would accept the
fact that Israel is here to stay and
drop their propaganda weapon, no
thing is lacking to reinstate the Arab
refugees within the vast lands of the
Arab nation as proud integrated citi
zens. If 'Palestine' has a mystique for
some individuals, there is an Arab
part of what was once Palestine, Jor
dan, created by the British some 40
years ago and refugees can find a
homeland there, among their own
people, on Palestinian soil. A large
number of the Jordanian population
consists of Palestinians. Even
financially-struggling Israel is manag
ing to settle, in jobs and homes, the
refugees in camps on the Gaza strip,
now under Israeli occupation — re
fugees kept literally prisoners in the
camps by the Egyptians before the
1967 war.
Why no talks?
Why will Israel not talk to the PLO
and why will Israel not take back
Palestinian refugees?

The PLO is not a vague group of
refugees with undefined aims. It is a
group of people with a clearly
specified aim laid out in an official
charter to which all PLO members
subscribe. This charter is not secret.
It has been published for all to read.
Its aim is the dismemberment and
destruction of the Jewish State and
the setting up in its place of a predo
minantly Arab state of Palestine. To
make sure that the replacement state
will be Judenrein, all Jews who en
tered Israel after 1948 are to be expel
led and lose their nationality — "go
back to their homes." No Jews are to
be permitted to enter. This would
dismember the state of Israel and en
sure its replacement by an Arab state
with a small Jewish ghetto. The
method is to be by terror and war, as
for example, the Munich, Ma'alot
and Lydda airport massacres.
How can Israel talk, then, with the
PLO? What is there to talk about?
How to begin committing suicide? At
what rate? Who first? Until those of
the Palestinian people who do not
support the PLO find a different
leadership, Israel has no Palestinians
to talk to.
Why Israel preferred?
Why does the unknown (where
does Suleiman's number "about (my
italics added) 47 per cent" come
from?) number of refugees prefer
the Jewish state of Israel as a place to
settle rather than the equally Palesti
nian Jordan?
As a citizen of Israel who has de
fended my country against those
self-same Palestinians and the Arab
armies of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt,
Saudi-Arabia and the Sudan in three
wars of aggression by the Arabs
aimed at the destruction of Israel,
may I be pardoned if I regard their
sudden desire to join me as fellow
citizens with a certain amount of
scepticism? The desire to regain the
properties they left — to assist the
enemy in 1948 — is just a wee bit, let's
not mince terms, ludicrous. It is
frightening, too — the Palestinians
have shown only too recently what
they do to their host countries,e.g.
Jordan and Lebanon.
The Americans who left Britain in
the 17th century to escape religious
persecution were not even siding
with any enemy. I have yet to meet a
Mayflower descendent who sets out
claims to, say, the area of London

where Euston railway station and the
Houses of Parliament now stand, on
the grounds that they were pasture
lands belonging to his ancestors who
fled Britain so long ago. I doubt if the
Mayflower Americans would expect
to be taken seriously if they de
manded England closed to all immig
ration except from America, and the
expulsion of all Englishmen from En
gland apart from those already there
before the Mayflower set sail. This, in
analogy, is precisely what the Pales
tinians claim!
Defensible borders needed
Why not a separate Palestinian
state next to Israel on the West Bank?
There might, indeed, be something
to talk about once the PLO charter is
torn up. But under this charter, who
would want neighbors with a sworn
aim to destroy you, sitting at the side
of your vulnerable eight-mile-wide
neck? Neighbors armed to the teeth
by Russia? I doubt if any thinking
person fails to acknowledge Israel's
necessity for defensible borders, nor
needs to read into this glaringly self
evident need, any hidden "expan
sionist aims."
In conclusion, in the 1940-50s, Is
rael absorbed an even greater
number — 800,000 — of Jewish re
fugees from Arab lands than there
are Palestinian refugees today. They
came stripped of all possessions.
Their health status was a public
health man's nightmare — rickets,
tuberculosis, eye disease, you name
it. The majority had no skills and
were illiterate. These Jewish re
fugees, within 20 years, were ab
sorbed by the tiny population into
the Jewish state. They do not seem to
suffer any mystique pangs for Iraq or
Egypt. They have a new land, jobs,
housing and health and education
for their children. As Jews, they live
in a Jewish country even if it is not the
country of their birth.
I suggest it is time we say bluntly to
the Arabs "Go thou and do likewise.
Stop using the Palestinians as prop
aganda. Start using them as fellow
Arabs." Israel will not go away and
cannot be made to go away. But she
can be a very good friend and the
Jews and Arabs working together,
the Israeli and Arab nations, could
make the Middle East a blessing and
not a curse.

Palestinian refugees?

The PLO is not a vague group of
refugees with undefined aims. It is a
group of people with a clearly
specified aim laid out in an official
charter to which all PLO members
subscribe. This charter is not secret.
It has been published for all to read.
Its aim is the dismemberment and
destruction of the Jewish State and
the setting up in its place of a predo
minantly Arab state of Palestine. To
make sure that the replacement state
will be Judenrein, all Jews who en
tered Israel after 1948 are to be expel
led and lose their nationality — "go
back to their homes." No Jews are to
be permitted to enter. This would
dismember the state of Israel and en
sure its replacement by an Arab state
with a small Jewish ghetto. The
method is to be by terror and war, as
for example, the Munich, Ma'alot
and Lydda airport massacres.
How can Israel talk, then, with the
PLO? What is there to talk about?
How to begin committing suicide? At
what rate? Who first? Until those of
the Palestinian people who do not
support the PLO find a different
leadership, Israel has no Palestinians
to talk to.
Why Israel preferred?
Why does the unknown (where
does Suleiman's number "about (my
italics added) 47 per cent" come
from?) number of refugees prefer
the Jewish state of Israel as a place to
settle rather than the equally Palesti
nian Jordan?
As a citizen of Israel who has de
fended my country against those
self-same Palestinians and the Arab
armies of Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt,
Saudi-Arabia and the Sudan in three
wars of aggression by the Arabs
aimed at the destruction of Israel,
may I be pardoned if I regard their
sudden desire to join me as fellow
citizens with a certain amount of
scepticism? The desire to regain the
properties they left — to assist the
enemy in 1948 — is just a wee bit, let's
not mince terms, ludicrous. It is
frightening, too — the Palestinians
have shown only too recently what
they do to their host countries,e.g.
Jordan and Lebanon.
The Americans who left Britain in
the 17th century to escape religious
persecution were not even siding
with any enemy. I have yet to meet a
Mayflower descendent who sets out
claims to, say, the area of London

where Euston railway station and the
Houses of Parliament now stand, on
the grounds that they were pasture
lands belonging to his ancestors who
fled Britain so long ago. I doubt if the
Mayflower Americans would expect
to be taken seriously if they de
manded England closed to all immig
ration except from America, and the
expulsion of all Englishmen from En
gland apart from those already there
before the Mayflower set sail. This, in
analogy, is precisely what the Pales
tinians claim!
Defensible borders needed
Why not a separate Palestinian
state next to Israel on the West Bank?
There might, indeed, be something
to talk about once the PLO charter is
torn up. But under this charter, who
would want neighbors with a sworn
aim to destroy you, sitting at the side
of your vulnerable eight-mile-wide
neck? Neighbors armed to the teeth
by Russia? I doubt if any thinking
person fails to acknowledge Israel's
necessity for defensible borders, nor
needs to read into this glaringly self
evident need, any hidden "expan
sionist aims."
In conclusion, in the 1940-50s, Is
rael absorbed an even greater
number — 800,000 — of Jewish re
fugees from Arab lands than there
are Palestinian refugees today. They
came stripped of all possessions.
Their health status was a public
health man's nightmare — rickets,
tuberculosis, eye disease, you name
it. The majority had no skills and
were illiterate. These Jewish re
fugees, within 20 years, were ab
sorbed by the tiny population into
the Jewish state. They do not seem to
suffer any mystique pangs for Iraq or
Egypt. They have a new land, jobs,
housing and health and education
for their children. As Jews, they live
in a Jewish country even if it is not the
country of their birth.
I suggest it is time we say bluntly to
the Arabs "Go thou and do likewise.
Stop using the Palestinians as prop
aganda. Start using them as fellow
Arabs." Israel will not go away and
cannot be made to go away. But she
can be a very good friend and the
Jews and Arabs working together,
the Israeli and Arab nations, could
make the Middle East a blessing and
not a curse.

Sami Suleiman's column (Daily,
Oct. 6) contains some inaccuracies
and leaves unanswered the question
of why Isreal will not deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
As another Palestinian, I believe I can
to a great extent clarify the issues.
As a first point, it has to be remem
bered that the Palestinian refugees
are not, except as a propaganda mea
sure, an intrinsic or important issue
in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Arabs began massacring Jews in
Palestine in 1919. Their first major
war against Israel was in 1948 upon
the Jewish state's establishment.
Thus, far from being about refugees,
it is this war that caused the refugees
to exist! In plain terms, the Israeli-
Arab conflict is about the existence
of Israel — the Israelis want to exist

and the Arabs do not want them to.
As this does not sound very nice, and
certainly not at all legal, the refugees
are a handy peg on which to hang
their cause. For this reason, Palesti
nians have been kept refugees and
held forcibly in camps by their Arab
brethren for almost 30 years.
How did the Palestinian refugees
become so? Are all Palestinians re
fugees? What are their numbers? Just
before their attack in 1948, the Arab
nations announced they were going
to destroy Israel's Jews, and advised
the Arab population to leave, on the
understanding that they would re
turn after the Arab victory and reap
the spoils. Exact figures are unavaila
ble, but about one-half million took
advantage of the offer, a considera
ble number did not.
Of those who left, when the Arab
victory did not happen, a large
number settled in areas of former
Palestine, now Jordan, and became
Jordanians. Some found new jobs
and new lives in other Arab lands,
many in Kuwait, for example. The
remainder were kept in camps and
supported by the United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency (that is, the
nations of the world, mainly the
U.S.). These number today, about
one-half million.
The number of Arabs who did not
leave Israel at the enemy's behest in
1948, now numberoverone-half mill
ion. They are not refugees, but indi
genous citizens of the State of Israel,
living in their traditional villages and
towns, such as Nazareth.
Jewish Palestinian
I am one of the Palestinians who
did not side with my country's
enemies in 1948 and did not desert it.
I am a Jewish Palestinian, like the
many whose forefathers lived'in
Palestine for a century, and whose
ancestors lived there for many cen
turies.
While everyone must sympathize
with a fellow human in distress, my
general sympathy for the refugee
Palestinians is somewhat tempered
by the fact that they created their
own plight by an act of treason and
disloyalty against their state. No one
made them refugees. They did it
themselves. The question is scarcely
their 'rights' to the country they bet
rayed, but a human problem of how
to alleviate the plight of those who
are suffering, whether physically or
from lack of cohesion to a group.
If only all refugee problems, such
as those which arose in the musical
chairs games of Europe during two
world wars, were so easily physically
soluble! These Arab refugees belong
to a proudly self-proclaimed one
Arab nation. It is a rich nation, a very
rich one, in terms of land and money,
and poor in terms of population.
If the Arab nation would accept the
fact that Israel is here to stay and
drop their propaganda weapon, no
thing is lacking to reinstate the Arab
refugees within the vast lands of the
Arab nation as proud integrated citi
zens. If 'Palestine' has a mystique for
some individuals, there is an Arab
part of what was once Palestine, Jor
dan, created by the British some 40
years ago and refugees can find a
homeland there, among their own
people, on Palestinian soil. A large
number of the Jordanian population
consists of Palestinians. Even
financially-struggling Israel is manag
ing to settle, in jobs and homes, the
refugees in camps on the Gaza strip,
now under Israeli occupation — re
fugees kept literally prisoners in the
camps by the Egyptians before the
1967 war.
Why no talks?
Why will Israel not talk to the PLO

Palestinian refugees?
