Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.

been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in

panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.

Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.

Following is a report on "Exclusion of Investments in
Securities of Corporations with Assets within the Republic of
South Africa," an analysis by the Office of the Director of
Finance, October 1977:
Summary
It has been proposed that Stanford permanently exclude
from its endowment investments securities of corporations
that have a„„3ts within the Republic of South Africa. Stan
ford's Trustees have requested a financial cost and benefit
analysis of the proposal. This report contains the analysis.
Our research has indicated that there are 318 designated
companies with assets within the Republic of South Africa.
Of these companies, 111 represent about one-half of the
market valuj of that group of representative common stocks
known os the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks, a widely
accroted representative grouping of the entire stock market
in the United States.
The designated companies are concentrated in 31 industry
categories, including virtually all the stock value of com
panies in six industries. The six industry categories are as
follows:
1. Automotive
2. Chemicals
3. Electric Equipment
4. Office Equipment
5. International Oils
6. Drugs
Stanford currently has 24% of its equity portfolio in
vested in the first five industry categories on the above list.
Implementation of the proposal would require divestment
of about $125 million of endowment assets. Stanford would
Have to sell the securities of 59 corporations, in 21 different
industries. About 37% of the market value of our stock
holdings would have to be eliminated.
In the process of selling, we would be forced to totally
eliminate and exclude five industry categories, as noted
above. We would be required to sell 95% or more of our
holdings in a total of ten industry categories. The securities
eliminated in each industry would be those company's
securities which our investment managers currently believe
are the best to hold for investment purposes.
Stanford's investment securities have been selected to
meet the institution's need for adequate income and growth
in value. The financial effect of corporate investment within
South Africa is immaterial to the return of Stanford's
investment securities. That portion of annual dividends that
originates from corporate assets within South Africa is about
$25,000, compared to a total dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
Said another way, the contribution to earnings of all but a
couple companies from assets in South Africa is less than 1%.
Over 99% of earnings are unrelated to the issue of South
Africa, but would be eliminated from Stanford's return by
implementation of the divestment proposal.
A consideration of proposed divestment, and subsequent
exclusion, of designated investment securities begins with an
assessment of probable transaction costs. Our analysis has led
us to observe that transaction costs are only one of the costs
involved. Total transaction costs of divestment and exclusion
are estimated to be not less than $1,400,000.
Very likely, transaction costs would be much more. Our
analysis of such costs includes a determination of both the
one-time transaction costs for divestment and subsequent
reinvestment and the incremental costs associated with in
vesting in a more limited, less liquid market-place of allow
able securities.
This latter cost occurs because, in the event of divestment
and subsequent exclusion of designated companies, the lim
ited selection of possible replacements would have one-half
the market value that now exists, with available securities
typically in smaller capitalized companies that require in
creased spreads (transaction costs) to buy and sell.
A more significant cost associated with this proposal is
the probable diminution in value of the endowment due to
the constraints placed upon our professional investment
managers. Stanford's endowment has consistently outper
formed the market during the last eight years. Over this
period the stocks in Merged Endowment Pools A and B have
ranked in the top 1% and 3%, respectively, in comparative
performance analysis of 3600 major funds During 1976, the
value added by superior management was an additional $8.3
million in return above comparable market indices.
If divestment were pursued, the reduced range of invest
ment choices and loss of diversification would produce a
major restructuring of our portfolio. The restructuring would
greatly reduce the likelihood of our professional investment
managers continuing their superior performance. It is not
unreasonable to assume the result could be no value added by
the managers.
Another potential cost results from divestment and exclu
sion of designated companies. The restructured endowment
portfolio would be much less diverse, with elimination of five
industries and partial elimination of about fifteen more. Such
action would appear to raise serious questions with the
fiduciary responsibilities of our Trustees and the laws that
exist to both govern and protect Stanford University as an
endowed institution. Our analysis did not extend to the point
of attempting to quantify what might be these costs, but we
note this as an issue of significant concern.
Stanford is an eleemosynary institution that relies heavily
on philanthropy. A policy of maintaining a list of designated
companies for exclusion from investment would create signif
icant ri*k that future gift receipts would be reduced. The
designated companies have in the past given Stanford
$19,600,000. Currently, these same companies have out
standing pledges of $3,500,000. About one-half of the gift
receipts in Stanford's major corporate gifts program has come
from designated companies.
Excluding investments in companies on other than finan

cial criteria would likely create doubt as to whether Stanford,
in competition with other universities, should continue to
deserve financial support. Moreover, it is probable that the
corporations would be offended if they were not given an
opportunity to individually describe their roles within South
Africa.
Adoption of a designated list of excluded companies
could also jeopardize gift receipts from living individuals and
other sources. A significant portion of all personal gifts of
securities during the last three years were in securities of the
designated companies. These gifts amounted to $18,900,000
over the same three-year period. Again, exclusion of com
pany securities on other than financial criteria creates doubt
as to whether Stanford is a sufficiently deserving steward of
charitable gifts.
A less significant financial cost can be identified in regard
to Stanford's security loan program, wherein we lend securi
ties we hold to brokers. This program is a source of
incremental unrestricted income, which would be reduced by
exclusion of designated securities.
A nonfinancial consequence of divestment worth noting is
that Stanford would also relinquish its voting rights in the
proxy proposals put before the designated companies.
Background information
1. 318 companies were identified as "firms with
assets in South Africa."
2. Of these 318, 111 are included in the Standard
and Poor's 500 common stock index. We have used
the SSiP 500 and the reduced "SSiP 389" to analyze
diversification and expected return.
3. Stanford University owns 1,625,641 shares of
common and preferred stock : n 49 of these 111
companies. Market value on July 31, 1977 for these
shares is approximately $72,250,000, 37% of our total
stock investment.
4. Stanford University owns $16,531,000 (market
value) of long term debt obligations in 12 of these 111
companies.
5. On July 31, 1977, Stanford University held
approximately $36,000,000 of commercial paper
issued by nine of these 111 companies.
Following is the analysis on which the summary is based:
I. Identification of "firms operating within South Africa"—
Designated Companies
To resolve "the definitional problems implicit in identi
fying "firms operating within South Africa" we began with
the May 1976 list provided by the American Consulate
General in South Africa and the compilation for South Africa
in 1975 given in the Bth edition of the Directory of American

Firms Operating in Foreign Countries. The following is a
paragraph from the introduction to the Directory which
contains a brief explanation of the selection criteria:
This Directory includes only those companies in which
American firms or individuals have a substantial direct capital
investment. Foreign firms operating under contract, license,
or on a commission basis, where no actual American capital is
involved, or those in which American firms participate solely
on a royalty or profit-sharing basis, are omitted. Noncommer
cial enterprises and institutions such as churches, missions,
schools, and hospitals that are financed or operated by
American charitable or religious organizations have also been
omitted.
We then made the following additions:
1. Six banks known to have loaned monies to the South
African government and/or its corporations were
added to the list.
2. Three companies were added that were not in the
Directory but were known to have substantial business
dealings in South Africa. These were Standard Oil
Company of California, Texaco, and Caterpillar Trac
tor. They have made investments since the Directory
was compiled, or their participation in South Africa is
indirect through partial ownership of some other
corporation.
We did not delete Bethlehem Steel from the list despite
their response to an inquiry sent by UC-Berkeley indicating
that they should not be included. Therefore, a more rigorous
ly researched list may not include that particular company.
In total we identified 318 companies, which we refer to in
this analysis as "designated companies."
11. Characteristics of Stanford's Investments in Designated
Companies
The securities in Stanford's investment portfolio have
been selected to meet our need for substantial growth in
value and for an adequate and reasonably predictable income.
In general terms, at a specified degree of market risk, we seek
to maximize total return (dividends and capital gains) to our
investments.
The portfolio is broadly diversified with securities of 128
companies and representation in 35 industries. Each security
in the portfolio is selected with the aid of a substantial
amount of professional research. Currently, Stanford's port
folio contains the securities of 59 designated companies in 21
industries with a total market value of about $1 25 million.
The earnings which each designated company realizes
from assets within South Africa are inseparably commingled
with the company's entire earnings. Thus, dividends which
Stanford receives from the designated companies do not

contain a separate dividend from the South African assets.
Divestment of securities would result in divestment of the
dividends derived from all of the companies non-South
African investments.
The performance of corporate investments within South
Africa is not material to the financial performance of Stan
ford's investments. The proportion of each company's invest
ments within South Africa is typically a few tenths of 1%
nearly always less than 1%.
For example, Stanford's investment in the common stock
of Ford had a recent market value of $6.8 million. The total
corporate earnings associated with this stock during the past
year is about $1.1 million. Since Ford's assets within South
Africa are 0.003 of Ford's total investments, the commingled
portion of Stanford's Ford dividends that originated from
South African assets is about $1,500. Divestment of our Ford
stock holdings would necessarily mean elimination of our
investment and the return therefrom, of which over 99% is
unrelated to the issue of South Africa.
The commingled portion of all Stanford s annual divi
dends that originated from assets within South Africa is
roughly about $25,000, certainly no more than $45,000,
compared to a total portfolio dividend return in 1976 of
$8,900,000.
111. Effects of Divestment and Subsequent Exclusion of
Designated Companies
The effects of divestment and exclusion of South Afri
can-related securities fall into at least four separate catego
ries: (a) reduced investment choices, (b) effects on fund
raising (gift receipts), (c) transaction costs and (d) other. The
effects of the first two appear to be of much more signifi
cance than item (c), transaction costs. In the following
analysis, we attempt to quantify costs where possible, with
estimates and ranges noted.
(A) Reduced Investment Choices
In an attempt to determine the consequences of excluding
designated companies, we compared our list of securities with
the overall stock market. One hundred and eleven (111) of
the 318 designated companies are present in the Standard
and Poor's Index of 500 common stocks (usually referred to
as the S&P 500). This Index is a widely accepted surrogate
for the stock market and a well diversified selection of
stocks. Its current market value is about $625 billion, about
80% of the value of all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Our analysis focused on the exclusion of the 111 com
panies from the S&P 500. The reader should note that the
effects of excluding the additional 207 designated companies
have not been analyzed.
The 111 companies are not randomly distributed. Rather
they tend to cluster in certain industries and in almost all
cases are very large multinational firms. After tfveir exclusion,
the marketplace of Stanford's investment opportunities
would be one-half as large. Instead of 40 industries to
evaluate, there would be only 34, and 25 of these would be
reduced in size. One can assume that there would be
diminished opportunities for diversification in investments of
comparable quality. Clearly, it would be difficult to docu
ment that an adequate opportunity for investment diversifi
cation exists with the remainder.
The remaining collection of stocks and debt instruments
would differ greatly from Stanford's previous investment
market with lespect to growth, industry representation and
weighting, risk characteristics, and market liquidity of the
securities involved. These factors would have a large effect on
Stanford's future portfolio returns, and make more difficult
the selection of "prudent" investments within the fiduciary
context.
During and over the past eight years, our investment
managers have consistently evidenced superior security selec
tion and consequent market returns. This has been done
acting on investment criteria that touch upon financial return
and related risk. Last year, for example, the extra return
attributable to management was $8,300,000. Possible and
expected loss of future incremental returns is one of the
consequences of excluding designated companies.
Background Information
1. Capitalization and Liquidity—The 111 firms
combined represent over 46% of the total market
value of the S&P 500. Of the top 50 companies ranked
by total value, 29 are in the possible divestment
universe. (See Appendix I). These 29 companies alone
represent 12.5% of the recent New York Stock Ex
change daily volume. These factors are what led to the
projected increased transaction costs due to the widen
ing of the average bid-ask spread.
2. Industry Diversification—The Summary in
Appendix 111 shows the effect yf possible equity
divestment across industries for both the S&P 500 and
Stanford's portfolio. Notice the third column under
"S&P 500." This gives the market value of the design
ated stocks from that industry divided by the total
market value of the industry.
This shows which industries would be largely ex
cluded from future investment consideration. Six of
these lautos. chemicals, drugs, electric equipment and
office equipment, and international oils} have more
than 80% of the industry capitalization excluded.
As an example, in the auto industry American
Motors, Chrysler, Ford, CM., and White Motor are
included in the 111; only Cummins Engine Inc. and
Fruehauf Corporation are not. Regardless of the in
vestment attractiveness of these issues, Stanford'i fu
ture representation in the auto industry would have to
be small.
Note the third column under "Stanford." This
shows the market value of 'he designated stocks we
hold divided by our total holdings in that industry. As
can be seen, divestment would force greater than 95%
turnover in 10 industries and 100% turnover in six.
Those six industries alone represent over 20% of
Stanford's equity portfolio. Our holdings in those
industries were largely chosen by our fund manager,
and the transaction cost of their turnover is outlined
in Section C.
3. Fund Manager—Our fund manager has consis
tently earned superior market returns over the past
eight years. Although this may not continue into the
future, this management resulted in an additional
return on equity last year of 4.08% ($3.7 million I in
Merged Endowment Pool-A and 1.68% ($4.6 million)
in Merged Endowment Pool-B.
Analysis has shown that this return, obtained over
and above general movements in the market, is attribu
table to selecting individual stocks that perform better
than the average. If this is true, then the divestment of
the issues selected by our fund manager may involve a
substantial cost.
Similarly, the research activities of Capital Guard
ian are understandably dominated by the large capital
ization firms that we could not consider. Therefore,
that research could decrease in both quality and
quantity. Any realization-of continued superior results
in the future would be made more difficult by the
on-going constiaints of divestment, that is, with only
half as much market value to consider, near elimina
tion of six significant industries and partial elimination
of 25 more industries
(B) Effects on Fund Raising and Gift Receipts
Another identifiable cost of divestment and exclusion of
selected company securities is the probable reduction in
future gift receipts. It is reasonable to assume that corporate
giving from the designated companies would be diminished.
Stanford also receives gifts of stock in the designated
companies from individuals, foundations and the like. There
are a number of very large gifts that have been made in stock
of designated companies It is uncertain whether or not a
policy of exclusion would preclude all such gifts, but we
would expect that the numbe r would be reduced significant
ly. This is even more likely if a policy was adopted that
precluded holding certain stocks, since in many cases Stan
ford has 'ound it desirable and necessary to retain stocks
given to us, the more so when regulatory authorities require
that this be done.
To give a sense of the magnitude of gift receipts in
question, gifts from designated companies to Stanford have
amounted to a total of $19,600,000. In addition, gifts of
securities in the designated companies from individuals, in
lust the past three years, come to an additional amount of
$18,900,000
As a related concern, Stanford relies heavily on volunteers
to solicit gifts. Though no count was taken, it is likely that
some number of volunteers (also known as interested alumni)
are employed by designated companies A policy of discrimi
nation against these companies would likely have an effect on
the willingness of such volunteers to help Stanford.

1. Thirty-two of the designated companies have
given to Stanford, with gifts totaling $19,600,000. Of
this total, $5,300,000 was received during the past
three fiscal years, and currently there are outstanding
pledges of $3,500,000 from designated companies.
Designated companies have contributed about half of
Stanford's gift receipts in the major corporate gift
category.
2. A review of gift receipts over the last three
years evidences that living individuals have given Stan
ford $18,900,000 in securities of designated com
panies. Many of those securities have been retained,
and typically can be sold only in limited quantities
over time, and even then only once Stanford satisfies
and is in compliance with appropriate regulatory
bodies.
3. As part of Stanford's post-campaign efforts, the
Development Office currently is endeavoring to seek
substantial increases in the amount of gifts given by
corporations and living individuals. The consequences
of adopting the divestment policy would be expected
to have a chilling effect on the results of these efforts.
(C) Transactions Costs
This would include all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of alternative .n\/estments, as
well as the on-going transaction cost increases due to the
restrictions placed on the investment size and variety of the
investment market place. Their total amount is about $1.4
million.
Background Information
1. One-time divestment costs—See Appendix IV.
a. Brokerage fees-f/re calculations below are made
subject to these following assumed costs:
' Eight cents per share of stock not separately
held.
* Ten cents per share of stock separately held.-
' 3/16ths point (.001875) of market value on all
bonds.
' No cost on commercial paper.
These figures are representative of the costs Stan
ford has historically experienced. Eight cents a share is
a minimum. Actual fees could well be in a range of ten
to twelve cents, or more. The higher figure for the
separately held stock is due to the smaller lot size and
lack of liquidity in some of these issues. At the
minimum rates, the divestment of the assets listed in
Appendix II and the subsequent reinvestment of the
assets in similar nonrestricted securities would be
$331,500.
b. Bid-ask spread-Because the price necessary to
buy a security is slightly higher than the price one can
obtain by selling the security, each round trip into and
out of the securities market requires the investor to
absorb this bid ask spread Yhese costs are similar in

magnitude to the format brokerage fees, and were
calculated subject to the following assumed costs:
" 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on stock not separate
ly held.
' 3/16 (18.75 cents) per share on stock separately
held.
* 1/4 point (.0025) of market value on the bonds.
* no cost on commercial paper.
Divestment of the securities listed in Appendix II
and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds would
cost Stanford approximately $259,200. Again, these
costs are minimums, with actual costs possible up to
50% higher.
c. Banking fees—Stanford's custodial arrangement
calls for payment to be based in part on the number
and type of transactions that occur. The increase in
bank fees to perform the divestment and reinvestment
would be approximately $32,000.
These calculations indicate that the total one-time
transaction cost for divestment and the subsequent
reinvestment would be approximately $622,000.
2. Perpetual bid-ask expense
Exclusion of the 111 companies from investment
consideration would result in a higher concentration
of Stanford's assets in less liquid securities. Therefore,
the average bid-ask spread will be wider, resulting in an
additional cost each year proportional to the value of
securities traded. The yearly expenses can be conserva
tively estimated using the following assumptions:
a. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share on non
separately held stock.
b. Increase of 1/8 (12.5 cents) per share of sepa
rately held stock.
c. Increase of 1/16 pt. (.000625) of market value
for all bonds.
d. The above figures apply only to those securities
which would be divested.
e. Annual turnover of all securities wcjld be ap
proximately $125 million per year. This further
assumes that the portfolio will not increase in value.
The above assumptions result in an average shift
for the entire portfolio average of 1/16 th point
(.000625) for a yearly minimum expense increase of
$78,000. The present value of this regular, annually
recurring cost is about $780,000
(D) Other
It has been noted that a policy of exclusion of designated
companies would he expected to result in a diminution in
value of the endowment. This, in turn, brings forth the
concern about Stanford's, and the Board of Trustees', fidu
ciary duty to seek a maximum financial return. The consci
ous act of reducing this return, for nonfinancial reasons,
would appear to raise serious questions under the laws that
are applicable to Stanford University. Although we raise this
issue, we have not attempted to quantify the consequent
costs.
Stanford earns unrestricted income by lending securities

and investing the collateral in short-term instruments during
the period of the loan. If the designated securities could be
loaned a greater percent of the time than the securities that
would replace them in Stanford's portfolio, an income loss
would occur.
Voting rights in the designated companies
would be relinquished. There would be no financial
effect from loss of these voting rights.
Background Information
1. Twenty-five percent of all security lending
revenue last year was derived from issues of the 11
companies.
2. This represented about $75,000 in unrestricted
income which would be lost if we no longer held these
securities.
3. This total would be partly or totally offset by
the loan of the issues purchased to replace those
divested.
