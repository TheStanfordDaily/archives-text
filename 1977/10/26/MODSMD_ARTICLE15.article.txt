# Massy recommends against divestment action
## 
### 
To the Board of Trustees:
Earlier this year you requested an analysis and report on
the financial costs and benefits associated with a proposal
that Stanford University divest from its endowment all
securities of corporations with assets within the Republic of
South Africa. The attached report provides the analysis, both
of initial divestment and the consequent on-going exclusion
of designated corporate securities. This report is intended to
be an objective source document for your use and also for
those others who desire to evaluate the consequences of
exclusion on a more fully informed basis.
In my reading of this analysis, I find that the transaction
costs resulting from divestment, while significant, are not as
important as other costs that are associated with or may
result from adoption of a proposal to divest. One of the most
important consequences results from the reduced investment
choices available due to the exclusion of designated com
panies. It happens that in recent years our investment
managers have been able to produce a superior investment
return, with performance rankings at the top of comparative
fund evaluations. During 1976, as an example, the value
added by management was an additional $8,300,000. While I
readily recognize the difficulty of our managers continuing
this superior performance under any circumstances, a policy
of divestment would require the imposition of a lengthy list
of excluded securities. The resultant narrowing of alternatives
and loss of diversification can only make the investment
management job extremely difficult. It would be unreason
able to expect that our managers could continur to produce a
superior return, given these constraints.
Should there be a diminution in value of the Stanford
endowment, which the analysis suggests is a reasonable
expectation, the question then arises as to the implications
this might have for the University as a charitable trust and
the Trustees as fiduciaries. As noted in the 1971 Statement
of Investment Responsibility, it is both law and tradition that
our endowment funds shall be invested to seek a maximum
financial return commensurate with an appropriate level of

risk. A blanket action taken knowingly in the expectation
that it will result directly in a significantly lower total return
and higher investment risk appears to me to be in violation of
the spirit if not the letter of the law. While the analysis does
not quantify the costs associated with this concern, a signifi
cant cost element is obviously possible.
Another important consequence of a divestment policy
would be in the area of gift receipts. A designated list of 318
companies is also a boycott list. History evidences that acts
of exclusion or boycott all too often prompt a similar
reaction. A policy of exclusion would place in doubt the
future gifts both from designated companies and from donors
who would hold and who might give designated securities.
The consequent costs of foregone gifts are not easily pre
dicted. but are likely to be large, possibly on the order of
millions of dollars annually.
I would place as the least cost of divestment the transac
tion costs resulting from adoption of such a proposal. The
total noted in the report, in the amount of $1,400,000, is in
my opinion both significant and yet not as large as other
consequent costs.
Let me say that I, like you, abhor the South African
government's policy of apartheid. My feelings of frustration
and that of most others on the campus have been heightened,
if that is possible, by the events in South Africa during the
last few weeks. Yet despite personal frustration and intensity
of feeling, a particular course of action, and its likelihood of
significant impact, must be carefully measured against the
fact that Stanford's assets are held in trust, for worthy
purposes on which only institutions of our particular kind
and stature can deliver, now and for the future.
In transmitting this report, and based on the evidence
contained in it, I also submit to you my recommendation
that Stanford University should not take action to divest and
exclude investment securities of companies with assetc in the
Republic of South Africa.

would be in the area of gift receipts. A designated list of 318
companies is also a boycott list. History evidences that acts
of exclusion or boycott all too often prompt a similar
reaction. A policy of exclusion would place in doubt the
future gifts both from designated companies and from donors
who would hold and who might give designated securities.
The consequent costs of foregone gifts are not easily pre
dicted. but are likely to be large, possibly on the order of
millions of dollars annually.
I would place as the least cost of divestment the transac
tion costs resulting from adoption of such a proposal. The
total noted in the report, in the amount of $1,400,000, is in
my opinion both significant and yet not as large as other
consequent costs.
Let me say that I, like you, abhor the South African
government's policy of apartheid. My feelings of frustration
and that of most others on the campus have been heightened,
if that is possible, by the events in South Africa during the
last few weeks. Yet despite personal frustration and intensity
of feeling, a particular course of action, and its likelihood of
significant impact, must be carefully measured against the
fact that Stanford's assets are held in trust, for worthy
purposes on which only institutions of our particular kind
and stature can deliver, now and for the future.
In transmitting this report, and based on the evidence
contained in it, I also submit to you my recommendation
that Stanford University should not take action to divest and
exclude investment securities of companies with assetc in the
Republic of South Africa.
William F. Massy
Vice-President for Business and Finance
To the Board of Trustees:
Earlier this year you requested an analysis and report on
the financial costs and benefits associated with a proposal
that Stanford University divest from its endowment all
securities of corporations with assets within the Republic of
South Africa. The attached report provides the analysis, both
of initial divestment and the consequent on-going exclusion
of designated corporate securities. This report is intended to
be an objective source document for your use and also for
those others who desire to evaluate the consequences of
exclusion on a more fully informed basis.
In my reading of this analysis, I find that the transaction
costs resulting from divestment, while significant, are not as
important as other costs that are associated with or may
result from adoption of a proposal to divest. One of the most
important consequences results from the reduced investment
choices available due to the exclusion of designated com
panies. It happens that in recent years our investment
managers have been able to produce a superior investment
return, with performance rankings at the top of comparative
fund evaluations. During 1976, as an example, the value
added by management was an additional $8,300,000. While I
readily recognize the difficulty of our managers continuing
this superior performance under any circumstances, a policy
of divestment would require the imposition of a lengthy list
of excluded securities. The resultant narrowing of alternatives
and loss of diversification can only make the investment
management job extremely difficult. It would be unreason
able to expect that our managers could continur to produce a
superior return, given these constraints.
Should there be a diminution in value of the Stanford
endowment, which the analysis suggests is a reasonable
expectation, the question then arises as to the implications
this might have for the University as a charitable trust and
the Trustees as fiduciaries. As noted in the 1971 Statement
of Investment Responsibility, it is both law and tradition that
our endowment funds shall be invested to seek a maximum
financial return commensurate with an appropriate level of

risk. A blanket action taken knowingly in the expectation
that it will result directly in a significantly lower total return
and higher investment risk appears to me to be in violation of
the spirit if not the letter of the law. While the analysis does
not quantify the costs associated with this concern, a signifi
cant cost element is obviously possible.
Another important consequence of a divestment policy
would be in the area of gift receipts. A designated list of 318
companies is also a boycott list. History evidences that acts
of exclusion or boycott all too often prompt a similar
reaction. A policy of exclusion would place in doubt the
