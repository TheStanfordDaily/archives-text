# Mothers planning falltime festival
## 
### 
What do a hand-hooked rug,
bell pulls from Saudi Arabia,
bags from Bangladesh and
Rosalyn Carter's recipe for
strawberry cake have in com
mon?
They are all items slated to be
raffled or sold this weekend at
the Golden Boutique, a pot
pourri of arts and crafts contri
buted or made by members of
the Stanford Mothers' Club
from all around the world.
The club is also holding a
Chrysanthemum Champagne
Party, featuring hors
d'oeuvres, a show of the latest
fashions from Saks Fifth Av
enue modeled by Stanford ath
letic stars and the Dollies,
music by the Stanford Band
and of course, the delightful
bubbly.
"We earned $22,000 last year
for scholarships," said Patricia
Casey of the club. "We hope to
make as much or more this
year."
Mrs. Earl Schubert spent
three months hooking a rug
with a Stanford seal on it.
"We hope to optimize our

return on this item," said
Schubert, whose son, daugh
ter, son-in-law and daughter
in-law all went to Stanford.
Admission is five dollars to
the event scheduled for 1 to 5
p.m. Sunday at Syntex, 3401
Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto.
Football fans need not fear,
because the mothers have ar
ranged to have color televi
sions on the premises tuned to
the football games.
The annual fund-raising
event was formerly a tea party.
It has been expanded to in
clude the boutique which has
received contributions from
parents in all 50 states, Hong
Kong, Israel, France and Af
ghanistan.
Schubert, who has been in
the mothers' club for five
years, said one need not be a
mother of a Stanford student to
join the club.
"Although the vast majority
of mothers come into the club
when their children become
Stanford students. Once a
Stanford mother, always a
Stanford mother," she said.
General chairman for the
party is Mrs. Edgar Dethlefsen
of Portola Valley.
