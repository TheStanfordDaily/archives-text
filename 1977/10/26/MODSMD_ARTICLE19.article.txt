# Book makes fast food fun
## 
### Barbara Anscher 
Stanford students probably
spend a lot of time thinking
about food but do not like to
take time out from busy
schedules to prepare it. In
stead, they do their part to
keep the local fast-food places
in business.
For those who are searching
for healthier snack alterna
tives, a book recently pub
lished by two young Palo Alto
women may be the pot of gold
at the end of the food-lover's
rainbow.
About one year ago, Sharon
Elliot and Sandy Haight came
up with the idea for "The Busy
People's Naturally Nutritious
Decidedly Delicious Fast
Foodbook."
As its name suggests, the
book is a collection of recipes
which are simple and quick to
prepare as well as being nutri
tionally balanced. The em
phasis is not on following di
rections but on improvising
and experimenting in the pre
paration of everything from

sandwiches to main dishes to
desserts.
Elliot, who created the re
cipes, explains that the book is
designed to "get people to eat
right and have fun doing it.
Traditionally, nutrition educa
tion has been such a bore."
Elliot received her master's
degree here in 1971 for which
she designed and taught a
schoolwide nutrition program
for first through sixth graders.
In order to emphasize the
fun part of meal preparation,
the authors have added catchy
titles, such as "blender quen
chers" and "refrigerator
readies" as well as Haight's il
lustrations with each recipe.
The only nutrition informa
tion in the book is a brief exp
lanation of the four food
groups in the appendix. The
recipes in the book are nutri
tionally balanced so the reader
does not have to spend much
time deciding what to prepare,
said Elliot.

Elliot said the recipes are all
based on the principle of get
ting "the most nutrition for the
fewest calories."
"This book picks on things
people don't have enough of:
fruits, vegetables, fiber. We eat
too much protein . . . and we
need to cut down on sugar and
honey, to learn to taste what's
there instead of overdosing.
There are a few cookie recipes
in the book, and they call for
half the sugar and oil that most
recipes use," she said.
The authors are convinced
that there is a market for
specialized cookbooks of this
sort. Elliot originally conceived
of the idea when her students
in a natural nutrition class at
the Escondido Village Center
requested recipes that were
fast and quick to prepare.
Shortly after Elliot had com
piled enough recipes for a
book, a friend of her husband's
introduced her to Haight, and
the project was launched.
Haight is now illustrating spe
cial education filmstrips.

The two women decided to
make the book completely
their own project from start to
finish and formed their own
publishing company, aptly cal
led Fresh Press.
Haight's familiarity with
graphics and publishing (she
had worked for a year as a
graphic designer for a pub
lisher of music-related books
and records) meant that they
were not exactly novices to the
business.
The final step they now face
is putting the book on the mar
ket. Selling for $5.25, the
cookbook is available at the
Stanford Bookstore and in
many Palo Alto bookstores.
Elliot and Haight said they
would most likely stay in the
cookbook business. Elliot has
"five huge folders" of recipes
which she hopes to organize
into different kinds of books.
After all, the.fast foods book
is "just one approach" to a sub
ject which is often uppermost
in people's minds, Elliot said.

people don't have enough of:
fruits, vegetables, fiber. We eat
too much protein . . . and we
need to cut down on sugar and
honey, to learn to taste what's
there instead of overdosing.
There are a few cookie recipes
in the book, and they call for
half the sugar and oil that most
recipes use," she said.
The authors are convinced
that there is a market for
specialized cookbooks of this
sort. Elliot originally conceived
of the idea when her students
in a natural nutrition class at
the Escondido Village Center
requested recipes that were
fast and quick to prepare.
Shortly after Elliot had com
piled enough recipes for a
book, a friend of her husband's
introduced her to Haight, and
the project was launched.
Haight is now illustrating spe
cial education filmstrips.

The two women decided to
make the book completely
their own project from start to
finish and formed their own
publishing company, aptly cal
led Fresh Press.
Haight's familiarity with
graphics and publishing (she
had worked for a year as a
graphic designer for a pub
lisher of music-related books
and records) meant that they
were not exactly novices to the
business.
The final step they now face
is putting the book on the mar
ket. Selling for $5.25, the
cookbook is available at the
Stanford Bookstore and in
many Palo Alto bookstores.
Elliot and Haight said they
would most likely stay in the
cookbook business. Elliot has
"five huge folders" of recipes
which she hopes to organize
into different kinds of books.
After all, the.fast foods book
is "just one approach" to a sub
ject which is often uppermost
in people's minds, Elliot said.
Stanford students probably
spend a lot of time thinking
about food but do not like to
take time out from busy
schedules to prepare it. In
stead, they do their part to
keep the local fast-food places
in business.
For those who are searching
for healthier snack alterna
tives, a book recently pub
lished by two young Palo Alto
women may be the pot of gold
at the end of the food-lover's
rainbow.
About one year ago, Sharon
Elliot and Sandy Haight came
up with the idea for "The Busy
People's Naturally Nutritious
Decidedly Delicious Fast
Foodbook."
As its name suggests, the
book is a collection of recipes
which are simple and quick to
prepare as well as being nutri
tionally balanced. The em
phasis is not on following di
rections but on improvising
and experimenting in the pre
paration of everything from

sandwiches to main dishes to
desserts.
Elliot, who created the re
cipes, explains that the book is
designed to "get people to eat
right and have fun doing it.
Traditionally, nutrition educa
tion has been such a bore."
Elliot received her master's
degree here in 1971 for which
she designed and taught a
schoolwide nutrition program
for first through sixth graders.
In order to emphasize the
fun part of meal preparation,
the authors have added catchy
titles, such as "blender quen
chers" and "refrigerator
readies" as well as Haight's il
lustrations with each recipe.
The only nutrition informa
tion in the book is a brief exp
lanation of the four food
groups in the appendix. The
recipes in the book are nutri
tionally balanced so the reader
does not have to spend much
time deciding what to prepare,
said Elliot.

Elliot said the recipes are all
based on the principle of get
ting "the most nutrition for the
fewest calories."
"This book picks on things
people don't have enough of:
fruits, vegetables, fiber. We eat
too much protein . . . and we
need to cut down on sugar and
