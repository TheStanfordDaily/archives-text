# 'Prof's work threatens national security'

### Steven Burr 
An associate professor of electrical
engineering who has been working
on cryptology methods here asserts
that he has been indirectly pressured
by a National Security Agency (NSA)
scientist to cease publishing material
which members of the agency regard
as a potential threat to national sec
urity.
Assoc. Prof. Martin Hellman said a
letter sent by Joseph Meyer to the
Institute of Electric and Electronic
Engineers (lEEE), of which Hellman is
a member, warned that some of its
members might be in violation of
sections of the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations that pertain to
cryptology, the study of codes and
ciphers.
Hellman said his work involves try
ing to solve two cryptography prob
lems: enabling two people to con
verse securely over a phone using
coding scramblers and designing a
digital signature, which could not be
forged, for use in electronic transac
tions such as the storing of informa
tion in computer systems.
Hellman said the solution to these
problems would go a long way to
ward securing the privacy of informa
tion stored in computer banks.
Meyer in his letter specifically re
ferred to three publications in which
articles by Hellman were the only
ones pertaining to cryptology.
According to Science magazine,
Meyer is listed in the NSA directory
but when contacted by the magazine
refused to confirm that he worked
there.
Private citizen
Hellman said that Meyer is sup
posed to have written the letter as a
private citizen but probably had to
obtain permission from the NSA to
do so, though whether or not the
NSA initiated the letter itself is uncer
tain. "They (the NSA) never come
right out and say 'stop what you're
doing,' " he said.
According to NSA spokesman
Norman Boardman, "I can state for
the agency that we had nothing to do
with that letter. . . Meyer wrote that
letter as a private citizen. But with
respect to any letter of that nature
this agency would not prompt any
one to do it."
Science magazine went on to say
that even though Boardman ap
peared to know about both Meyer
and the letter he refused to comment
on whether he had seen the letter or

whether Meyer worked for the NSA.
Hellman said that John Schwartz of
the University legalcouncil's staff has
assured him that his research and
publications fall within the bounds of
legality and that the University will
stand by him should the NSA decide
to take legal action.
Codes as weapons
In his letter Meyer said, "I have
noticed in the past months that vari
ous lEEE groups have been publish
ing and exporting technical articles
on encryption and cryptology â€” a
technical field that is covered by
Federal Regulations. . . ."
Meyer then pointed out that in his
view unclassified technical data was
covered by various laws relating to
weapons technology exportation
and that before any researcher can
publish articles on encryption in the
United States he must have "prior

approval by a cognizant government
agency."
According to the laws specified in
Meyer's letter, encryption and cryp
tology data are classified as weapons.
Hellman said that he viewed
Meyer's statement as an "unwar
ranted intrusion on their part into my
work."
Hellman added that he would con
tinue to publish his work unless Uni
versity lawyers told him it was illegal.
The University will not be able to
aid the three graduate students who
work with Hellman (Whitfield Diffie,
Ralph Merkle and Steve Pohlyg),
should any legal action be taken
against them, since they are not Uni
versity employes.
They will therefore not participate
in the publication of any of their
work. All work will in the future be
published under Hellman's name.

According to Hellman, the major
concern of the NSA, the govern
ment's highest authority on secret
codes, is that foreign countries might
use any unbreakable code the
Americans come up with to protect
from espionage their secret docu
ments.
A recent article in the New York
Times revealed that many other sci
entists have complained of NSA ef
forts to curb the research and publi
cation of new cryptographic
methods, and that the NSA is trying
to bring certain kinds of research
completely under its own control.
Should that happen, said Hellman,
the quality of cryptography available
to commercial firms and private
users would deteriorate seriously,
since the NSA would naturally permit
only those codes which it could
break itself.
