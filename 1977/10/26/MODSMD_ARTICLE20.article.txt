# Center aids off-campus folk

Warm gold-toned carpeting,
yellow walls and gay, orange
window sills create a relaxing
atmosphere at the newly reno
vated Off Campus Student
Center located at the
Clubhouse in the Old Union.
"The purpose of the center
initially is to provide a
homebase for students living
off campus," said King Ming

Young, coordinator for off
campus and graduate student
activities in the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
Young said she would like to
form an advisory committee of
volunteers to plan activities for
off campus students similar to
those planned for students liv
ing on campus.
The center, which has been

in existence for three years,
was originally located at Tre
sidder before being moved to
the Clubhouse two years ago.
The center provides free
lockers, coffee and tea, a free
refrigerator, car pool informa
tion and local telephone
privileges each day from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
If demand were high
enough, Young said she would
consider keeping the center
open during the evening for
study groups and other meet
ings.
"Considering the fact there
are about 5500 students living
off campus, we would like the
center to be a focal point for
activities," said Young.
The center could provide
workshops on personal
budgeting or landlord/tenant
rights and form a lobbying
group similar to the Commit
tee on Parking and Transporta
tion to "defend concerns of off
campus students," Young said.
A kick-off activity is planned
from noon to 3 p.m. Friday in
White Plaza. The Off Campus
Student Center and the Tre
sidder Program Board will co
sponsor the New Games,
"non-competitive sports"
which use an enormous globe
and parachutes among other
things to bfing all students to
gether through sport.
The center is in the midst of a
staff search. Young said a stu
dent who qualifies for a federal
work/study plan and a student
not necessarily on the plan will
be needed to complete the
staff.

A cool way to start a lovely meal â€” Persian soup with a bit of chopped
walnut.
