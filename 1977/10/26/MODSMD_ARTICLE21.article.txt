# ROTC program: yesterday, today, tomorrow
## Alumni group hopes to reinstate ROTC 
### 
The New Founder's League
(NFL), a group of conservative
alumni, has mounted a sig
nificant campaign to reinstate
ROTC on the Stanford campus.
Michael Antonacci, NFL
president, said the group is
doing two things to help
reinstate ROTC. "We keep
editorializing the issue, to
keep it before the eyes of the
people," said Antonacci.
"I've been working with
former professors of military
science at Santa Clara to see
what is a reasonable approach
to get ROTC back," he said.
"We are trying to get people
together to approach the De
partment of Defense, the De
partment of the Army and the
Stanford Board of Trustees,"
Antonacci said.
"I went up last year at regist
ration and talked to quite a few
students interested in ROTC. I
know of some fine students
who went to Cal because they
wanted ROTC scholarships.
"Eventually I feel we'll get it
back. It is too good a thing not
to take advantage of. Stanford
owes it to the nation to en
courage people who in case of
emergency will fill a leadership
role."
President Richard Lyman,
however, says,"I have no
reason to foresee the return of
ROTC. Of all the efforts in the
past few years, there hasn't
been a demonstrated interest
in the students. In order for
there to be any likelihood of
ROTC returning, there has to
be substantial interest."
Some students here, how
ever, still fear the return of
ROTC. David Catanzarite, al
ternate senator-elect, feels that
ROTC is still an issue.
"More and more Santa Clara
University based ROTC
courses are being taught on
the Stanford campus," Catan
zarite said. "I don't want any
ROTC here." v

"ROTC uses the Stanford
buildings, facilities and clas
srooms," he said. "The Uni
versity should have nothing to
do with the military. The Uni
versity should represent
peace, against the military
industrial complex."
"Vietnam helped point out
how the University and the
military don't go together,"
Catanzarite continued. "There
is still a significant opposition
to it. It won't come back soon."
Dan Livingston, ASSU
senator-elect, however, feels
that ROTC is not an issue on
campus relative to other is
sues.
"I wouldn't object to having
ROTC come back," said
Livingston. "Students need the
aid. Every student has the right
to pursue his own college edu
cation."
"I am offended by others
who object to it,"he said.
"This supposedly ideal campus
should be open to all prog
rams."
The majority of the students
are apathetic, said Livingston.
"But there's a vocal minority
who would make it difficult for
ROTC to return."

Posters such as the one above have for years been a part of student protests here against ROTC on campus.
The University and students both seem to take a firm line that ROTC not return to Stanford.
