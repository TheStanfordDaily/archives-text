# Klan starts patrol for illegal aliens
## 
### 
San Diego (AP) — A Ku Klux
Klan group launched what it
called a "citizens watch" along
the 2000-mile-long Mexican
border yesterday, looking for
persons trying to illegally cross
into the United States.
The U.S. Border Patrol, other
officials and Mexican-
Americans denounced the ac
tion.
David Duke of Metairie, La.,
national director of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, said cars
carrying about 250 members of
the white-supremacist group
were involved — some 150 in
Texas and most of the rest in
southern California.
Duke told news conferences
across California last week that
500 to 1000 Klan members
would fan out along the 2000-
mile border from Brownsville,
Tex., to the Pacific Ocean.
There was no immediate exp
lanation why the number of ac
tual participants was smaller.
The Klan has said its aim is to
report illegal aliens to the Bor
der Patrol, and that Klan mem
bers will not try to make ar
rests.
Duke said precautions were
taken to avoid violence. No

one recruited from southern
California was armed, he said,
although "about a dozen cars
are marked and most of the
people will have Klan
patches."
Duke said Klansmen will ref
rain from any direct contact
with aliens. If any are found,
said Duke, "they're not going
to talk to them, or contact
them. But we'll be using citi
zens band radios and from a
contact point we'll tell U.S.
immigration people."
When the Klan announced
its plans last week, Herman
Baca, spokesman for the
Mexican-American community
in San Diego, said 40 organiza
tions would demonstrate
against the Klan on Saturday.
Duke said he had met coop
eration in meetings with "the
Community Relations Depart
ment of the Justice Depart
ment" and other agencies, but
Gerhardt said only the Border
Patrol has authority to deal
with aliens and "we cannot
convey that authority to any
other person or group . . . We
have had absolutely no contact
with the Klan."
