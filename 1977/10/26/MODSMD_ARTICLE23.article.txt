# Student interest in ROTC on the upswing
## 
### Peter Brett 
Presently, about 287 colleges
and universities have full-time
army ROTC programs, and
another 500 to 700 have cross
enrollment with other ROTC
programs, according to Cap
tain Ford McLain at the Univer
sity of San Francisco.
The university has a cross
enrollment program. McLain
said that over the last 10 years
there has been an overall de
cline in the number of ROTC
programs, but there has been a
recent shift in the trend.

"There was a decline at first
and now there is a small re
surgence," he said.
"The real benefit in ROTC is
not monetary," according to
McLain. He feels that a student
who participates in ROTC gets
the opportunity to broaden his
educational outlook.
"To go out and get a job with
a degree in English is not easy,"
McLain said. "ROTC will give
him leadership and manage
ment experience that will offer
him a greater selling point
when he goes out to get a job."
There are also many monet
ary benefits, McLain said. The
army offers scholarships.
These scholarships provide full
tuition, all book expenses, all
fees, in addition to $100 a
month during the academic
year. It does not pay for room
and board. McLain estimates
that the overall worth to the
student is between $40,000 and
$50,000 for a four-year scholar
ship.
Both male and female stu
dents can receive these scho
larships.
If a student is enrolled in the
scholarship program, he must
accept a 4-year active duty
military obligation on gradua
tion from college.
If a student has not received
a scholarship, he may just take
ROTC courses. On graduation
he may accept a commission
from the army in active duty at
$11,000 a year. Those who
won't go on active duty may go
into the Army reserve for six
years.
Students here who desire to
take ROTC courses for no cre
dit may do so off-campus at the
University of Santa Clara. Pre
sently, five students take ROTC
off-campus. According to Lt.
Colonel David R. Moore of the
Army, "There is an understand
ing with Stanford that we offer
the program for Stanford stu
dents as an extracurricular ac
tivity. For the five students, it's
worth taking."
Although they take some of

their courses at Santa Clara,
Stanford students enrolled in
off-campus ROTC take "the
bulk of their classes at Stan
ford," according to Moore.
Most of these classes are di
rected reading and seminars.
At the University of Santa
Clara, ROTC was never much
of a subject of activism. The
campus was very tranquil, ac
cording to Moore. Only Army
ROTC is offered, and about 85
to 100 people are enrolled, he
said.
The Army nominates the in
structors to the president of
the University. The president
then makes the appointment.
The instructors are not given
full faculty privileges, accord
ing to Moore. "We get no life
insurance, pension and other
insurance," he said. "We're
treated well. We're very wel
come at Santa Clara. There are
probably some who harbor re
servations, but the people are
generally very warm and recep
tive," says Moore.
At Texas A&M, Major John
Maloney of the Army said the
university never experienced
any trouble or protests during
the Vietnam era. "The prog
ram's always been strong," he
said. "We've had outstanding
support."
Enrollment is now on the in
crease, and A&M puts out 100
officers a year into the Army.
Overall, the armed services'
program on campus enroll
about 2200 students, Maloney
said.
The ROTC instructors are
given full faculty status, and an
academic rank equivalent to
assistant professors.
Most of the ROTC instruc
tors hold Master's degrees;
some are working toward Doc
torate degrees.
The campus attitudes toward
ROTC are very favorable now,
said Maloney. The president of
the student government is a
past corps commander. A good
percentage of student elected
officials is part of the cadet

corps, according to Maloney.
Bill Lacy, Army Lt. Col. and
instructor of freshman ROTC
courses at the University of
Arizona, said that at Arizona,
ROTC protests were never a
problem. "We've always been
a patriotic state," said Lacy.
The university enrolls 300 stu
dents in the Army ROTC prog
ram and 250 students in the Air
Force. Some 50 per cent of
these students are on full scho
larships.
At San Jose State, ROTC has
remained on campus since it
was first instituted, although
there was significant student
protest in 1970. According
to Army Captain Charles Lieb,
students from the groups seek
ing to end the war in Vietnam
barricaded buildings and
broke windows to protest the
ROTC program.
Presently, however, Lieb
said he has noticed an upsurge
of interest in ROTC. There are
more cadets enrolling, and
more inquiries about the
ROTC program, according to
Lieb. "There is a slightly re
newed interest, but basically
the students seem apathetic,"
says Lieb.
All ROTC instructors at San
Jose must have at least an M.A.,
according to Lieb. The instruc
tors also must be accepted by
the university. They are not
paid by the state, but by the
Army itself. Lieb said that the
instructors are given exactly
the same status as the rest of
the faculty: they serve on uni
versity committees and receive
the same benefits as faculty
members.
At UC-Berkeley, Lt. Col. Pat
rick Hatcher of the Army
teaches history courses; he
also holds a Ph.D. from Golden
Gate University. According to
Hatcher, ROTC was the subject
of much activism in the past.
"In the 19605, the whole sys
tem of what a university was for
was challenged by activist
groups.
"Questions arose such as

whether scientists and en
gineers could work with the
military-industrial complex.
These were generally academi
cally valid questions," accord
ing to Hatcher.
"Now, the academic com
munity decides," said Hatcher.
"Everyone who comes to Ber
keley must be nominated, and
then interviewed by the uni
versity. All courses are
evaluated by a committee from
the Academic Senate. The in
structors are given various
levels of faculty status (those
with Ph.D.s are given higher
status than those with M.A.s)."
The students know that
ROTC is at Berkeley, says
Hatcher. It's not a major issue.
At present the enrollment is
good, according to Hatcher.
All the major services, in addi
tion to the marines, are located
there.
ROTC never left the campus.
"We managed to ride out the
storm," says Hatcher.
