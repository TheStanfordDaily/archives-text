# ROTC at Stanford: sit-ins and strikes
## 
### Peter Brett 
By May, 1970, $15,000 worth
of windows had been broken.
There had been two separate
sit-ins at Old Union, two con
secutive nights of violent
streetfighting between stu
dents and police, culminating
in a student strike that virtually
shut down the entire campus
for several days.
The issue? ROTC.
The ROTC controversy has
long since died down, but its
result remains: no ROTC prog
ram exists on the Stanford
campus. In fact, the removal of
ROTC from campus was not
just a sudden student-initiated
expulsion; itwasalsotheresult
of time-consuming faculty
administration deliberation.
The Faculty Senate, as far
back as 1969, voted by more
than a three to one margin to
end academic credit for ROTC
courses taken by students en
tering in autumn 1970, or after.
However, University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer, under
pressure from the Department
of Defense, offered alternative
recommendations prompted
by suggestions from Stanford's
ROTC head, Colonel S.M.
Ramey early in 1970. He re
commended abolishing de

partmental status for ROTC!,
and including it as a part of the
Center for Military Studies.
Pitzer also asked for limited
academic credit for some of
the courses offered. The puni
tive clause, Pitzer advised,
should remain. Under the
punitive clause a student who
did not complete his contract
with the army would be im
mediately enlisted.
Only four days later, under
considerable time pressure,
the senate voted to implement
Pitzer's recommendations.
Several months later, Stan
ford protestors demanded
three major moves:
—an end to ROTC on cam
pus,
—a guarantee that the Uni
versity would provide financial
aid to cadets who would lose
their ROTC scholarships, and
—legal aid for students "en
trapped" in the punitive
clause.
The protesters felt ROTC
was the military's way of train
ing its middle management.
They wanted the university to
be free from any military or
governmental influence and
felt that no liberalizing influ
ences had yet been seen in the
military, despite ROTC's long
association with universities.
The protesters' demands
were eventually instituted. On
May 7,1970, the Faculty Senate
voted to end all academic cre
dit for ROTC. One month later,
a few days after the expansion
of the war into Cambodia, the
senate voted to ban future en
rollment of new students in
ROTC.
The last cadets graduated in
1973.
While many universities ac
ross the nation terminated
ROTC on their campuses, in
cluding Harvard, Yale and
Dartmouth, a large number of
universities retained their
ROTC programs throughout
the crises of the early '70s.
Some felt that ROTC contri
butes to the cosmopolitan di
versity of the university.
Others felt that termination of
the program denies the stu
dent the right to choose his
own courses. Furthermore,
they held that ROTC cadets
provide a liberalizing influence
in the armed forces, since
many of the commissioned of
ficers would come from liberal
universities.

association with universities.
The protesters' demands
were eventually instituted. On
May 7,1970, the Faculty Senate
voted to end all academic cre
dit for ROTC. One month later,
a few days after the expansion
of the war into Cambodia, the
senate voted to ban future en
rollment of new students in
ROTC.
The last cadets graduated in
1973.
While many universities ac
ross the nation terminated
ROTC on their campuses, in
cluding Harvard, Yale and
Dartmouth, a large number of
universities retained their
ROTC programs throughout
the crises of the early '70s.
Some felt that ROTC contri
butes to the cosmopolitan di
versity of the university.
Others felt that termination of
the program denies the stu
dent the right to choose his
own courses. Furthermore,
they held that ROTC cadets
provide a liberalizing influence
in the armed forces, since
many of the commissioned of
ficers would come from liberal
universities.
By May, 1970, $15,000 worth
of windows had been broken.
There had been two separate
sit-ins at Old Union, two con
secutive nights of violent
streetfighting between stu
dents and police, culminating
in a student strike that virtually
shut down the entire campus
for several days.
The issue? ROTC.
The ROTC controversy has
long since died down, but its
result remains: no ROTC prog
ram exists on the Stanford
campus. In fact, the removal of
ROTC from campus was not
just a sudden student-initiated
expulsion; itwasalsotheresult
of time-consuming faculty
administration deliberation.
The Faculty Senate, as far
back as 1969, voted by more
than a three to one margin to
end academic credit for ROTC
courses taken by students en
tering in autumn 1970, or after.
However, University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer, under
pressure from the Department
of Defense, offered alternative
recommendations prompted
by suggestions from Stanford's
ROTC head, Colonel S.M.
Ramey early in 1970. He re
commended abolishing de

partmental status for ROTC!,
and including it as a part of the
Center for Military Studies.
Pitzer also asked for limited
academic credit for some of
the courses offered. The puni
tive clause, Pitzer advised,
should remain. Under the
punitive clause a student who
did not complete his contract
with the army would be im
mediately enlisted.
Only four days later, under
considerable time pressure,
the senate voted to implement
Pitzer's recommendations.
Several months later, Stan
ford protestors demanded
three major moves:
—an end to ROTC on cam
pus,
—a guarantee that the Uni
versity would provide financial
aid to cadets who would lose
their ROTC scholarships, and
—legal aid for students "en
trapped" in the punitive
clause.
The protesters felt ROTC
was the military's way of train
ing its middle management.
They wanted the university to
be free from any military or
governmental influence and
felt that no liberalizing influ
ences had yet been seen in the
military, despite ROTC's long
association with universities.
