# Movie theaters to show commercials
## 
### 
New York (AP) — If you hope
to escape the noisy barrage of
commercials on television by
taking in a movie, you may be
in for an unpleasant surprise.
Beginning today, up to three
minutes of commercials will be
appearing before each feature
on the silver screens in 1800
theaters in major U.S. cities.
But the big-screen commer
cials won't be as obnoxious as
many of those on television,
says a spokesman for one thea
ter chain.
Because the cost of the
movie commercials is high —
about $18 per 1000 viewers
compared with about $4 per
1000 viewers for many televi
sion commercials — industry
officials expect a "high class"
product in the movie houses.
"These will be soft, enter
taining commercials, not the

kind of hard-sell commercial
you see on TV for deodorants,"
said one spokesman.
In addition, spokesmen say
that, unlike TV commercials,
the movie ads will not interfere
with the continuity of the
show.
Persons involved in the new
trend say commercials in
movie theaters are needed to
help offset declining earnings.
And, underone plan, proceeds
from the commercials will be
used to produce movies to
counter what some theater
owners say is a shortage of
films.
A few theaters around the
country have been experi
menting recently with local ads
for neighborhood businesses
and some theaters have for
years used still slides to adver
tise local businesses.
