# Naber gets his kicks with Cardinals

### Ivan Maisel 
Among football players,
placekickers are a different
breed. They play less than any
other first-stringers but any
coach will tell you that the dif
ference between a good sea
son and a bad one often lies in
the foot of the placekicker.
At Stanford that foot belongs
to Ken Naber, the lanky
freshman sensation from Cin
cinnati, Ohio. His perfor
mance has been impressive.
Naber is 10-for-14 on field go
als, and 14-for-16 on conver
sion attempts. His leg is as
strong as it is accurate; Naber
has successfully kicked field
goals from 47 and 46 yards out.
Naber will be the first to
admit that the art of place
kicking lies as much in the
head as in the foot.

"Concentration is the key,"
Naber said. "You have to relax
and just think about kicking.
You can't worry about the
score, or the crowd. You just
go out and kick the ball. If you
make it, fine."
Using a soccer-style kick
Naber has been making them,
too. Naber attributes this to six
years of soccer in grammar
school and high school. Naber
did not play football until his
sophomore year at Moeller
High School in Cincinnati.
"My football coach coaxed
me to come out for the team as
a sophomore, and I just natur
ally kicked it soccer-style."
Prep studs
And kick he did. Moeller
High School is currently the
two-time defending Ohio state

champions and was unde
feated in both championship
seasons, Naber's junior and
senior years. Moeller is still at
the top of the heap as evi
denced by an article on the
team in Sports Illustrated (Oct.
10).
Last year Naber was 44 of 47
on PATs and also punted for a
42.7 average. (Naber was re
cruited as a punter, and said he
hopes to replace senior Brad
Fox as punter next season.)
However, on field goals,
Naber hit only one of six.
Realizing that there was work
to be done, Naber set his sights
on getting ready for Stanford's
1977 season.
"Over the summer I worked
a lot on my mental game. I just
told myself that the key was to
be relaxed and kick smoothly.

Part of my problem last year
was that I tried to blast the ball.
"I worked to cut down my
strength and swing my leg
through the ball. I also worked
on kicking angles, from tee to
goalpost."
Ohio transplants
Naber is one of two Stanford
recruits from the Cincinnati
area. The other? Coach Bill
Walsh, offensive co-ordinator
for the Cincinnati Bengals for
eight years.
"Coach Walsh makes me
feel a little bit at home, but he
is not the main reason for me
coming out here," Naber said.
"The factor that swung my de
cision to come here was the
academics. Stanford's
academics were better than
those of the other schools that
recruited me (including such

NCAA heavyweights as Ohio
State and Notre Dame). Coach
Denny Green was also instru
mental in my decision (Green
handles the Midwest recruiting
for Stanford)." .
A final factor in Naber's deci
sion to enroll at Stanford in
cluded realizing a boyhood
dream. "Since I was little, I've
always wanted to play against
national legends. I looked for
ward to the UCLA game and am
looking forward to the USC
game, both because of their
traditions. I'll be up for the Big
Game, but these two really
mean something special."
Quick start
Naber began the season
making seven straight field
goals but has since tailed off,
hitting three of his last seven.
"You feel like you let your
self and the team down
whenever you miss a kick," he
said. "As far as the crowd goes,
you can't worry about them.
Once you get on the field, you
never even realize they're
there."
The crowd, however, has
realized that Ken Naber is
there. His strong performance
has warmed the hearts of
coaches and fans alike. Kickers
are plentiful, but good ones
are scarce, and to know that
Stanford has a good one for the
coming years brings a smile to
coach Bill Walsh's face.
