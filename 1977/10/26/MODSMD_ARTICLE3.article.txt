### Andrea James 
The State Bureau of Medical Quality Assurance
(BMQA) is investigating claims made by a Stanford
physician and a doctor's union concerning billing pro
cedures at the Medical Center, Bob Rowland, executive
director of the bureau, said yesterday.
Rowland said the complaints made by Dr. Eugene
Dong, associate professor of cardiovascular surgery at
the center, and the Union of American Physicians were
received by the BMQA two weeks ago.
Both Dong and the union claim Stanford is violating
section 2008 of the California Business Code which
states, in part, that medical schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional services rendered pa
tients."
"We are currently evaluating the nature of the allega
tions and the supporting material," Rowland said. "The
complaints are accompanied with a substantial amount
of documents and we now have a stack of evidence,
including individual patients' bills and correspondence,
about three or four inches high."
Rowland added that the documents supplementing
the allegations are not public information. Earlier in Oc
tober, Dong had in his possession photostats of bills
showing sums owed to unidentified doctors and 1968
correspondence questioning the University's confor
mance with section 2008.
Carl Hitchner, associated staff counsel of the medical
center's legal department, told the Daily earlier this
month that Stanford's billing procedures are totally
within the law.
"There are two legal entities involved here," he said.

"Stanford University and Stanford University Hospital.
The hospital is an owned subsidiary of the University.
The faculty physicians are employed by the University
and not by the hospital."
The hospital is staffed with Palo Alto physicians who
are not faculty members and are not paid by the Univer
sity, and faculty staff members. Both types of physicians
are considered independent contractors, according to
Hitchner.
Rowland said the BMQA has not yet questioned Stan
ford officials regarding the case.
"The bureau has a variety of powers to enforce laws,"
Rowland said. "However, I can't speculate as to what
measures will be taken if Stanford is found to be in
violation of section 2008."
Rowland said, "There have been intimations from a
variety of sources that the board is trying to protect
Stanford. This is totally not true. In any case where the
consumer interest is being compromised by the delivery
of medical care, the bureau moves aggressively to cor
rect that situation."
Rowland became executive director of the bureau in
june of this year. Prior to obtaining that position, he was
employed by Stanford as business manager for the De
partment of Medicine.
As business manager, Rowland was responsible for
the financial transactions in the medical center.
He said that there is no conflict of interest in this case.
"I used to work at Stanford but that's all. I have no
interest in the University whatsoever, no financial or
other ties. I go to football games there, but that's about
it."

"Stanford University and Stanford University Hospital.
The hospital is an owned subsidiary of the University.
The faculty physicians are employed by the University
and not by the hospital."
The hospital is staffed with Palo Alto physicians who
are not faculty members and are not paid by the Univer
sity, and faculty staff members. Both types of physicians
are considered independent contractors, according to
Hitchner.
Rowland said the BMQA has not yet questioned Stan
ford officials regarding the case.
"The bureau has a variety of powers to enforce laws,"
Rowland said. "However, I can't speculate as to what
measures will be taken if Stanford is found to be in
violation of section 2008."
Rowland said, "There have been intimations from a
variety of sources that the board is trying to protect
Stanford. This is totally not true. In any case where the
consumer interest is being compromised by the delivery
of medical care, the bureau moves aggressively to cor
rect that situation."
Rowland became executive director of the bureau in
june of this year. Prior to obtaining that position, he was
employed by Stanford as business manager for the De
partment of Medicine.
As business manager, Rowland was responsible for
the financial transactions in the medical center.
He said that there is no conflict of interest in this case.
"I used to work at Stanford but that's all. I have no
interest in the University whatsoever, no financial or
other ties. I go to football games there, but that's about
it."
The State Bureau of Medical Quality Assurance
(BMQA) is investigating claims made by a Stanford
physician and a doctor's union concerning billing pro
cedures at the Medical Center, Bob Rowland, executive
director of the bureau, said yesterday.
Rowland said the complaints made by Dr. Eugene
Dong, associate professor of cardiovascular surgery at
the center, and the Union of American Physicians were
received by the BMQA two weeks ago.
Both Dong and the union claim Stanford is violating
section 2008 of the California Business Code which
states, in part, that medical schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional services rendered pa
tients."
"We are currently evaluating the nature of the allega
tions and the supporting material," Rowland said. "The
complaints are accompanied with a substantial amount
of documents and we now have a stack of evidence,
including individual patients' bills and correspondence,
about three or four inches high."
Rowland added that the documents supplementing
the allegations are not public information. Earlier in Oc
tober, Dong had in his possession photostats of bills
showing sums owed to unidentified doctors and 1968
correspondence questioning the University's confor
mance with section 2008.
Carl Hitchner, associated staff counsel of the medical
center's legal department, told the Daily earlier this
month that Stanford's billing procedures are totally
within the law.
"There are two legal entities involved here," he said.

"Stanford University and Stanford University Hospital.
The hospital is an owned subsidiary of the University.

and not by the hospital."
