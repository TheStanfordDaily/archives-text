# Cardinal sins
## Pressbox rumblings 
### Bruce Anderson 
Sixteen professional football scouts repre
senting nine NFL teams and two scouting
combines were on hand Saturday when Stan
ford defeated the Washington State Cougars
31-29 at Stanford Stadium.
The scouts came to take futures on Cougar
quarterback Jack Thompson, a senior with
one year of eligibility left, and a trio of WSU
defensive backs.
But mostly the scouts came to ogle over
three Stanford players — James Lofton, Cor
don King and Guy Benjamin.
"Benjamin, King and Lofton are all possi
ble first-round picks," said Bill Young, a
scout for the New Orleans Saints.
The three had pressbox binoculars trained
on their every move Saturday. Pencils racing,
the scouts scribbled out copious notes on
everything from which cartoons Benjamin
watches at Rickey's Hyatt House Saturday
morning to the duration of Lofton's
touchdown tangos in the end zone.
All three Cardinals gave a good accounting
of themselves during the conference victory.
Lofton, the top receiver in the conference
with 38 receptions, earned Pacific-8 Offen
sive Player of the Week honors with his five
grabs for 92 yards and two touchdowns. The
two TDs gave the senior speedster nine for
the season, tying the Stanford record for
single season touchdown receptions.
Scouts drool over Lofton's 6-foot-3 frame
and 4.4 40 speed. As well, Lofton is an ex
tremely intelligent individual who is applying
to graduate engineering schools despite the
near certainty of a professional career.
"Lofton is potentially the best receiver I've
worked with," Stanford coach Bill Walsh said
Monday. "He has great poise under stress.
"The professionals will consider him the
best receiver in college. I can't conceive of
any one better."
"Lofton is close to being the best receiver
in the country," said Young.
Bob Schmitz, a scout for the Pittsburgh
Steelers, agreed that Lofton is a first-round
prospect and added that the Stanford flanker
has been particularly impressive the last few
outings.
King has been rated among the top two or
three pro prospects at tackle by a number of
scouts, said Gary Cavalli, Stanford sports in

formation director.
King has professional size — 6-foot-6, 270
pounds — and quickness — 4.9 in the 40.
Young said that King could step right into a
starting role on many NFL teams.
While King and Lofton may find themselves
immediately thrust into NFL starting lineups,
Benjamin may have to wait longer to test his
arm against the game's finest as a pro starter.
"Quarterbacks have to sit a while and get
seasoned," Young said. "But Benjamin has a
lot of pro ability."
Benjamin, like King and Lofton, has pro
size, standing 6-foot-4. He also has a pro arm.
He leads the NCAA's in passing and directs a
more sophisticated offense than most pro
teams, and any other collegiate eleven uses.

Scouts are also giving the eye to split end
Bill Kellar. Kellar lacks pro speed, but has
outstanding hands which scouts cannot ig
nore. The senior from Hillsboro, Ore., is 13th
in the nation in pass receiving with 32 recep
tions.

It was bound to happen. With the impotent
San Francisco 49ers floundering on the way
to five straight losses and Stanford emerging
as one of the top offensive powers in col
legiate football, the rumors that the 49ers
were looking at first-year Stanford coach Bill
Walsh to replace Ken Meyer were bound to
begin making the rounds.
Rumors to this effect have been circulated
by members of the Bay Area sports media for
several weeks now.
San Francisco general manager Joe
Thomas, who hired Meyer and would be re
sponsible for dismissing the first-year 49er
coach, was at the Stanford-WSU game Satur
day ostensibly to scout players and not
coaches.
When asked about the Walsh rumors,
Thomas responded with a classic nondenial
denial: "this is the first time I've heard those
rumors. I've been out of town all week.
Rumors are the funniest things in the world."
Whether or not the 49ers are interested in
Walsh, Walsh is definitely not interested in
the 49ers. Stanford fans need not worry
about losing their coach to the Candlestick
Comedy Kids.
