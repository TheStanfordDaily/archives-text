Nuclear reactor shut down
Pleasanton — A shutdown was ordered yes
terday of a 20-year-old nuclear reactor which
manufactures radioactive isotopes used in
medical diagnosis and therapy because an ear
thquake fault may be only 200 feet away.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission or
dered General Electric Co. to shut down the
test reactor, which generates no electricity,
pending a study of whether the fault poses any
hazard.
"We're confident that when all the findings
are in, it will be determined that it's not a cause
for major concern," CE spokesman Dave
Crowley said.
He said the reactor is one of the nation's
major producers of medical radioactive
isotopes. The GE isotopes are used for eight
million patients a year, Crowley said.
But medical experts say reactors elsewhere
can gear up for increased production to avoid
any serious long-term shortage, he said.
The NRC ordered the shutdown to be made
Oct. 27 because immediate disruption of the
supply of the isotopeTechnetium 99M "would
have a significant impact on the life-saving
uses of this material."
Crowley said the reactor has a perfect safety
record, despite frequent minor earthquakes in
the region 30 miles east of San Francisco.
Newton accused by prostitute
Oakland — Self-acknowledged prostitute
Raphaelle Gray told a jammed courtroom yes
terday she saw Black Panther leader Huey
Newton laughing over the body of a fellow
streetwalker he is accused of murdering.
Testifying at Newton's pre-trial hearing in
Oakland Municipal Court, Gray, 32, also
known as Crystal Gray, told a titillating tale of
hookers fleeing in the night from a gunman
she identified in court as Newton.
On Monday, Alameda County deputy Dist.
Atty. Tom Orloff said in court three gunmen

tried to kill Cray on Sunday after breaking into
her apartment. She was not hurt, but one of
the gunmen was killed.
A slight, articulate woman with chestnut hair
and a soft voice, Gray said she and the woman
Newton is accused of slaying, Kathleen Smith,
17, were working as prostitutes on an Oakland
street corner on Oct. 6, 1974.
Throughout the testimony, Newton re
mained impassive, showing no emotion. Or
loff said he considers Cray "my most impor
tant witness."
In his cross examination, defense attorney
Sheldon Otis sought to destroy the credibility
of Gray, citing a long list of aliases she used and
asked if she denied having been arrested sev
eral times under these names.
Gray admitted to using some of the aliases,
but denied having been arrested under them.
After the hearing, Municipal Judge Robert
Friborg will decide whether to bind over New
ton to Superior Court for trial. Newton is free
on $80,000 bail. Besides the murder charge, he
also is accused of pistol-whipping tailor Pre
ston Callins.
Arab official mistakenly shot
Abu Ohabi, United Arab Emirates — A top
official of the United Arab Emirates was shot
and killed yesterday in a burst of gunfire appa
rently meant for Syria's foreign minister.
Police sources said a white-robed Palesti
nian gunman from Syria was arrested while
trying to hijack a Czechoslovak cargo plane
after the shooting at Abu Dhabi airport, but
three other gunmen escaped.
Saif bin Ghobash, 47, minister of state and
No. 2 man in the foreign ministry, was shot
while seeing off Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul
Halim Khaddam. Ghobash suffered bullet
wounds in the chest and arm and died at a
nearby military hospital.
Khaddam, who was not harmed, later told
reporters in Damascus there were several
gunmen and "they came from Baghdad," seat

of the government in Iraq. The two countries
are ruled by rival factions ot the socialist Baath
ist party.
There was little doubt in this emirate con
federation at the mouth of the Persian Gulf that
Khaddam, one of Syrian President Hafez As
sad's closest advisers, was the target of yester
day's attack.
An Arab reporter covering the departure
ceremony said one or more gunmen fired pis
tols as Ghobash and Khaddam entered a de
parture lounge. The Syrian minister jumped
aside and ran and Ghobash dropped to the
floor, the reporter said.
Airport officials said one gunman took seven
airport workers hostage after the shooting and
forced them into a Czechoslovak cargo plane
in an attempt to hijack it, but he was arrested.
Energy bill provision rejected
Washington — The House-Senate committee
working on energy legislation yesterday re
jected a provision that eventually would have
prohibited automakers from building fuel
inefficient cars.
The Senate had approved the ban on so
called "gas-guzzlers" as an alternative to Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's proposed tax on such
vehicles.
Yesterday's action by the conference com
mittee came as the full Senate began work on a
bill containing $40 billion in tax credits for
energy conservation and production but none
of the energy taxes recommended by the pres
ident.
The restriction on automakers would have
begun in 1980 with cars that got less than 16
miles on a gallon of gasoline. Instead, House
conferees indicated they planned to stick by
the administration's tax plan.
Since Senate conference leaders indicated
an equally strong intention to stand behind the
rival Senate plan for a ban, the development
produced the first major apparent deadlock of

the conference committee.
Meanwhile, President Carter raised again
the possibility that he might cancel a planned
four-continent trip scheduled to begin on
Nov. 22 if Congress does not complete work
on the energy bill by then.
Humphrey's return applauded
Washington — Hubert H. Humphrey, his
body frail but his voice vowing in familiar ca
dence to fight for his health and his beliefs,
returned yesterday to the Senate and an emo
tional welcome.
More than 70 senators were on the floor
when Humphrey entered the chambers at 2
p.m. The galleries were filled.
For five minutes senators and onlookers
applauded while the Minnesota Democrat
moved around the chamber shaking hands. He
embraced Robert Byrd, who beat him in the
contest for majority leader, and Vice President
Walter Mondale, his Minnesota protege.
The long fight with cancer has wasted his
body, but the Humphrey grin was broad as he
acknowledged the prolonged applause.
The spoken tributes were short. Only Byrd,
Republican leader Howard Baker, and Wen
dell Anderson, the other Minnesota senator,
spoke.
Then Humphrey stood at his desk for the
first time since he learned he has inoperable
cancer. And, characteristically, he spoke
longer than all of them combined.
"I got wound up," apologized Humphrey. "I
didn't intend to be that long, but that's the
story of my life."
