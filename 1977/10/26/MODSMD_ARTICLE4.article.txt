# Report to trustees says
## No divestment of S.A. stocks 
### Will Nixon 
Stanford should not divest itself of
holdings in American corporations
with assets in South Africa, Vice Pres
ident for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massy has recommended to the
Board of Trustees.
In a letter attached to the cost
benefit study released today to the
trustees Massy wrote, "I . . . submit
to you my recommendation that
Stanford University should not take
action to divest and exclude invest
ment securities of companies with
assets in the Republic of South Af
rica."
The cost benefit study of divesti
ture was one of four demands origi
nally presented to the Board of Trus

tees on April 28 by the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP).
The report, requested by the trus
tees last June, shows that divestiture
would cost the University several
million dollars a year.
The report also states that, "Stan
ford receives about $25,000, certainly
no more than $45,000" each year
from dividends originating from as
sets in South Africa.
The report says this represents less
than one per cent of the $8.9 million
received from all dividends in 1976.
In order to divest, the University
would have to dispose of about $125
million in endowment assets spread
among 59 corporations in 21 diffe
rent industries. Holdings in these
corporations represent about 37 per
cent of the University's total stock
investment.
The University's portfolio has a
broad range of securities in 128 com
panies in 35 industries.
Transactional costs which "include
all brokerage and bank fees for the
sale and subsequent repurchase of
alternative investments," would cost
about $1.4 million.
The report states that "it is reason
able to assume" that corporate and
individual gifts "would be di
minished" if divestiture occurred.
"About one-half of the gift receipts
in Stanford's major corporate gifts
program have come from"the cor
porations that would be included in
divestiture.
Companies whose stock Stanford
would divest itself of have given
$19.6 million to the University with
$5.3 million coming in the past three
fiscal years. There are also $3.5 mill
ion in outstanding pledges from
these corporations.
Over the past three years private
individuals have given the University
$18.9 million in securities from these
corporations.
Divestiture would have a "chilling
effect" on the Development Office's
drive to "seek substantial increases"
in gifts to the University.
The report, which Rodney Adams,
director of finance and co-author of
the report, has called "unpre
cedented," identifies 318 "firms with
assets in South Africa." Of these, 111
are listed in Standard and Poor's 500
common stock index. The report
only looked into these 111 corpora
tions, of which the University has
holdings in 59.
The Standard and Poor's index
represents "a well diversified selec
tion of stocks" and the 111 firms
examined by the report "in almost all
cases are very large multi-national
firms."
"One of the most important con
sequences results from the reduced
investment choices available due to
the exclusion of designated com
panies," wrote Massy in his letter to
the trustees.
Over the past eight years, the re
port points out, the University's in
vestment managers have outper
formed the market indexes.
"During 1976, the value added by
superior management was an addi
tional $8.3 million in return above
comparable market indices." Dives
titure and boycotting of companies
having assets in South Africa could
result in "no value added by the
managers."
