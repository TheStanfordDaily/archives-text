# Big Game Bonfire axed

### Emily Sachar 
The University decided Monday
to withhold permission for the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) to
construct the traditional Big Came
Bonfire, according to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
Citing "an acute awareness of
the need to protect our environ
ment . . . made especially acute
this year because of the drought,"
Lyons asked the IFC to set aside its
plans for the annual blaze.
The IFC is annoyed because its
report on the Bonfire was not
heard by a University bonfire
committee before the decision
was made, according to Reid Bu
tler, president of the IFC.
Tuesday presentation
A year ago, the IFC established a
Bonfire research timetable with
the University. The IFC was to
look into various procedural as
pects of the Bonfire. A month ago,
the Student Affairs Bonfire Com
mittee and the IFC set yesterday as
the date for presentation of the
IFC's findings.
"We prepared a 39-page pre

sentation addressing all the im
portant issues: fire permits, fi
nancial information, security, ev
erything we should go into," Bu
tler said.
It was thought that the decision
about the Bonfire would be made
after the IFC presentation yester
day, Butler said.
"But the decision was made
Monday without notification to
us," Butler said.
Institutional issues
"They explained that there
were institutional questions re
garding the Bonfire. But they
never heard our side of the story.
Nobody had even seen the re
port," Butler said.
In a letter to Butler, Lyons
explained some of the major con
cerns with the fire.
"The Bonfire appears to many
as a disregard for our environ
mental responsibilities. They are
right. The fire does pollute the air
and the lakebed. It abuses our en
vironment. It symbolizes energy
waste. It's a luxury; the weekend
can succeed without it," Lyons

said.
The Bay Area Air Pollution Con
trol Board asked in 1975 that the
University . . substitute a more
environmentally acceptable event
for the Bonfire." The Senate and
presidents of the ASSU have also
taken public positions in opposi
tion to the Bonfire in recent years,
Lyons said.
"I think it's inappropriate that a
decision was made without hav
ing considered the report pre
pared by the IFC," said ASSU Co-
President Greg Larson. "Many
students put in a lot of time and
input. Regardless of my position
on the issue, this work should
have been considered."
In their report, the IFC addres
sed some of the environmental
questions, those relating specifi
cally to the procedural topics, said
Butler.
"Our impression from the Uni
versity earlier was that the Bonfire
was not considered to be a major
polluter. We also thought we
