# Repeal needed
## Minimum wage is racist 
### 
Doug Bandow

The Congress has just reinforced
the most racist law on its books —
with nary a cry of anguish from the
country's minority communities.
This law, the minimum wage, at
tempts to "accomplish by decree the
impossible dream" (economist M.
Bruce Johnson).
The intellectual bankruptcy of its
supporters is best illustrated by
AFL-CIO representative Andrew T.
Biemiller's testimony that an in
creased minimum wage would con
tribute to the economic recovery by
"increasing the buying power of
those workers who must spend every
dime they earn."
If it was true that simple legislation
would conjure up dollars out of
never-never-land, the minimum
should be raised to $5, $10, or $50 an
hour. But the proponents realize the
lunacy of this approach: an increase
to $3 is no more philosophically or
economically justified than $50, but it
is eminently more politically palat
able.
Both the philosophical and practi
cal arguments are fatuous. The
philosophical argument usually boils
down to the contention that
everyone has the right to a guaran
teed minimum income. The problem
with this is that income must be pro
duced; the basis of our society is that
one's productivity determines one's
earnings. One simply does not "de
serve" more than one is capable of
producing.
However, it is another matter to
argue that society should provide a
minimum standard of living for
everyone. This position is not un
reasonable, but it should be society
that pays for the standard. It is
ridiculous to discriminate against
certain employers, who happen to
be labor intensive with low produc
tivity workers, and require that they
alone shoulder the burden of paying
workers more than they can pro
duce. In fact, the incongruous result
is effectively a tax on those
employers who provide jobs to those
who most need them — those
nearest the poverty line and lacking
skills, experience, and education.
We are punishing employers who
employ the most nearly unemploy
able.
Society should provide
Thus if the society decides that
everyone should receive at least a
certain minimum standard of living,
the society should provide it. This

bankrupt policy of arbitrarily placing
the burden on employers who pro
vide employment for those who
most need it is immoral, and insane.
The practical effects of the
minimum wage law only reinforce its
utter philosophical foolishness.
Labor Secretary Raymond Marshall
admitted that a rise to $2.65 (Con
gress has pushed it over $3 over the
next few years) would destroy 90,000
jobs. Note, that is destroy 90,000
jobs. And this estimate is conserva
tive; Marshall must pay homage to
George Meany, while others have es
timated the job loss into the millions.
In fact, for years economists have
recognized this fact. Charles Roos, at
one time the director of research for
the depression-era National Recov
ery Administration, estimated that
the NRA's minimum wage codes
forced about one-half million blacks
onto relief in 1934. UCLA economist
Finis Welch estimates that teenage
employment has been reduced by as
much as 40 per cent in low-wage
states like Arkansas, and 14 per cent
in higher wage states like Illinois and
New Jersey.
Economist David Kaun has found
that statutory wage minimums re
sulted in plant closings and the re
placement of labor by other produc
tive inputs.
Bare facts
The bare facts tell the same story.
During the early 1950s black and
white teenage unemployment were
both at about eight per cent. In the
late 1950s the minimum wage rate
went from 75 cents to one dollar an
hour, and black and white teenage
unemployment rose to 20 and 13 per
cent, respectively. The unemploy
ment rates have continued to diverge
as the minimum wage rates have in
creased — nearly one in every two
black teenagers is now unemployed.
The reason for this phenomenon
was discussed in a study prepared for
the Joint Economic Committee by
black economist Walter Williams, of
Temple University. Economic forces
simply do not give way to political
myopia. Those who lack the training,
skills, education, and experience to
produce the statutory minimum will
not be hired; employers are forced
to substitute part-time workers,
more highly skilled workers, and
equipment. Quite simply, busines
ses are not loss-making enterprises.
The law particularly burdens those
who are most "marginal" and "dis

advantaged." Marginal workers are
disproportionately composed of the
young; because of a lack of job skills
and maturity, blacks; and because of
race discrimination and socio
economic factors, women, the ill
educated, and the physically hand
icapped.
Economic illiteracy
Unfortunately, our legislators con
tinue in their myopic economic illit
eracy. They continue to support this
regressive, reactionary, chauvinistic,
and racist device for the advantage of
middle-aged, educated, and skilled
white males. The very people who
are supposed to be helped are hurt in
a devastating fashion.
Four of every 10 black teenagers
can't find work — is it better to be
unemployed at $2.30 an hour rather
than be employed at $2 an hour?
Should we deny someone the oppor
tunity to gain training and work ex
perience because he isn't skilled
enough to earn $2.30 an hour? Is
forced unemployment better for the
country, his family, his future
employment opportunities, and his
self-respect?
The pernicious minimum wage has
for too long devastated America's
minorities. The time for repeal is
now.
