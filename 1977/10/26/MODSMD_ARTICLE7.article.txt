ASSU Senate elections
I am disturbed by this campus' re
sponse to the unfortunate cir
cumstances surrounding the recent
ASSU Senate elections. Clearly, the
issues have been blown entirely out
of proportion, most notably by the
elections commissioner, the Senate
chairman, the Stanford Daily, and a
few students who are all unable to
recognize how ludicrous their ac
tions really are.
Specifically, I am speaking of the
reaction to the controversial flyers
that were distributed by pro- and
anti-radical supporters immediately
prior to the elections, which the
Daily characterized as "the most rep
rehensible campaign tactics this
campus has ever seen." ("Watergate
Comes Home," Oct. 18.) I rather
doubt that.
I can think of other incidents of the
past three years that better qualify for
such a title. Even if one believes that
the authors of the flyers lacked prop
riety, it is unarguable that neither
side violated any of the provisions of
the ASSU bylaws.
Why, then, all the fuss? Who was
really hurt or helped by these flyers?
In terms of the election results, cer
tainly not the candidates. The ASSU
Senate carries such little importance
on this campus that the only ones
who keep abreast of its business are
the senators and their friends who
voted for them.
In fact, I believe it quite possible
for a student to go to school here for
four years and not be aware of more
than a few doings of that not-so
august body. Indeed, to suggest that
the credibility of the senate was di
minished by the actions of a few is
tantamount to suggesting that
Richard Nixon lost credibility after
the David Frost interviews.
Regrettably, the behavior of the
elections commissioner, the senate
chairman, the Stanford Daily and the
others is far more reprehensible than
anything done by or on behalf of any
of the senate candidates in light of
their unnecessary attacks on those
allegedly involved. In particular,
Senator-elect Dan Livingston has suf
fered severe persecutions in the
Daily, as well as from certain indi
viduals, despite the fact no one has
proven any wrong-doings on his
part.
And the end is not in sight. The
elections commissioner supported
by the senate chairman plans to ap
point a five-member commission to
investigate this Dead Dog further.
The commission will accomplish lit
tle except stretching this controversy
beyond the limits of sensibility. One
thing is sure: It won't uncover any

thing that we don't know already.
Lastly, the Daily, in equating this
situation to Watergate, sorely points
out their misunderstanding of the is
sues. The parallel between the two is
at best weak, largely because there

are no criminals in this case. Though
the Lord knows they are looking as
hard as they can to find one.
