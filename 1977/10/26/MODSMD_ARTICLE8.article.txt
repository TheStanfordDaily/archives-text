# Kent State
## Gym crusade valid 
### 
Randy Stross

To hear Mike Shuman tell it (Daily,
Oct. 19), the Kent State "Move the
Gym" movement could hardly be
more frivolous. By not bothering to
address the questions raised by the
protestors, Shuman was able to por
tray the movement as one simply of
"feverish emotions" and lacking a
substantive base. But the only place
important issues were absent was
Shuman's column, not Kent State.
Of the many things we did not
learn in the column, the current gym
site is a relatively new one. When the
beginning of construction planning
started, in the early 19605, university
officials purchased land specifically
for the gym on another side of the
campus. It was only in 1970 when the
gym's location was moved to the cur
rent controversial site. Including two
other open areas adjacent to physical
education facilities on other parts of
the campus, there are no less than
three other places the gym could
conveniently be built. Why, then,
the administration's obstinancy in
not relocating the site?
Contrary to Shuman's depiction of
the geography of the May 4,1970 vio
lence, the current gym site is not on
the periphery but at the center of the
National Guard movements. In fact,
the landscaping planned will carve
out famous Pagoda Hill, where the
shots were fired. When I visited the
campus last month, the bulldozers
had already started removing the
trees at the foot of the hill.
It is the very centrality of the cur
rent site to the events of May 4 that
has generated the administration's
refusal to move the gym to any of the
alternate sites. And the university's
willingness to pay in dollars and ill
feeling such a heavy price to have its
way stands as testimonial to the sen
sitivity of the memories associated
with the current site.
On aesthetic grounds, the gym
lays waste the last remaining open
site of greenery on the central cam
pus. Even apolitical students at Kent
State have become angered over the
gym's-destruction of that area of the
campus.

In addition, the administration has
been willing to pour over $200,000 in
overtime police pay and expenses re
lated to suppressing student protest
of the current site. The security costs
have now surpassed the amount that
would have been needed for relocat
ing the structure to an alternate site.
The repeated arrests of movement
leaders and round-the-clock de
ployment of armed police at the site
have hardly endeared the administ
ration further to the students, yet no
cost seems too high for the university
to persist with construction.
The "Stop the Gym" movement
has tried to spark national, as well as
local, reflection on how we want to
handle our recent past. If the Viet
nam War is to be banished to the
realm of the antiquarian, then we
should go on with the gym's con
struction and let the dulling effect of
time work its wondrous way.
But if the war's human devastation
is to be commemorated, doesn't it
make sense to preserve the Kent
State site, where four lives were
taken in the struggle to end the war?
There, in Ohio, is the one spot in the
U.S. that brought the comfortably
distant carnage unleashed in Asia
not-so-comfortably home.
The Shuman column pitched the
protestors' goals in reductio ad ab
surdum terms, sarcastically saying,
"the survival of humanity depended
upon thwarting the building pro
ject." No, but the extinguishing of
the past means extinguishing les
sons, and the "Stop the Gym"
movement has sought to head off a
paving over of the Vietnam War.
It has not claimed to be the only
worthwhile struggle in the country,
but it certainly should be considered
among the ranks of today's impor
tant active movements in the U.S.
The successful completion of the
gym on the current site will be a blow
not only to the Ohio protestors, but
to the ability of all of us to com
memorate and remember the war.

To hear Mike Shuman tell it (Daily,
Oct. 19), the Kent State "Move the
Gym" movement could hardly be
more frivolous. By not bothering to
address the questions raised by the
protestors, Shuman was able to por
tray the movement as one simply of
"feverish emotions" and lacking a
substantive base. But the only place
important issues were absent was
Shuman's column, not Kent State.
Of the many things we did not
learn in the column, the current gym
site is a relatively new one. When the
beginning of construction planning
started, in the early 19605, university
officials purchased land specifically
for the gym on another side of the
campus. It was only in 1970 when the
gym's location was moved to the cur
rent controversial site. Including two
other open areas adjacent to physical
education facilities on other parts of
the campus, there are no less than
three other places the gym could
conveniently be built. Why, then,
the administration's obstinancy in
not relocating the site?
Contrary to Shuman's depiction of
the geography of the May 4,1970 vio
lence, the current gym site is not on
the periphery but at the center of the
National Guard movements. In fact,
the landscaping planned will carve
out famous Pagoda Hill, where the
shots were fired. When I visited the
campus last month, the bulldozers
had already started removing the
trees at the foot of the hill.
It is the very centrality of the cur
rent site to the events of May 4 that
has generated the administration's
refusal to move the gym to any of the
alternate sites. And the university's
willingness to pay in dollars and ill
feeling such a heavy price to have its
way stands as testimonial to the sen
sitivity of the memories associated
with the current site.
On aesthetic grounds, the gym
lays waste the last remaining open
site of greenery on the central cam
pus. Even apolitical students at Kent
State have become angered over the
gym's-destruction of that area of the
campus.

In addition, the administration has
been willing to pour over $200,000 in
overtime police pay and expenses re
lated to suppressing student protest
of the current site. The security costs
have now surpassed the amount that
would have been needed for relocat
ing the structure to an alternate site.
The repeated arrests of movement
leaders and round-the-clock de
ployment of armed police at the site
have hardly endeared the administ
ration further to the students, yet no
cost seems too high for the university
to persist with construction.
The "Stop the Gym" movement
has tried to spark national, as well as
local, reflection on how we want to
handle our recent past. If the Viet
nam War is to be banished to the
realm of the antiquarian, then we
should go on with the gym's con
struction and let the dulling effect of
time work its wondrous way.
But if the war's human devastation
