JAPANESE FILM SERIES
I An Autumn Afternoon
x Friday, October 28 '
II Directed by Vasujiro Ozu
y An Autumn Afternoon is about the transient joys of ,
* family life and the loneliness of parents after children leave ?
Ij home. The film is less a story than an examination of a !
I/ particular period in a person's life. It is Ozu's fifty-third and
y final film. The last panel in that great fresco with which he x
has so completely captured Japan as it is. The simplicity of
the picture is the result of a style brought to perfection.
Nothing is wanting, nothing is extraneous. At the same time
Ozu's regard was never kinder, never wiser. There is a
mellowness about this picture which is stronger than nos
talgia.
