## Margie Adam, 'sharing in song her anger and whimsy' Popularizing feminism via music 
### 
Those who saw Margie
Adam's Saturday concert
walked away feeling as if they
knew her personally. By
philosophizing, clowning, and
sharing in song her anger and
whimsy, she bridged the tradi
tional gap between performer
and audience. She presented
herself in totality — dedicated
feminist, talented artist and
woman of contagious energy
and joy.
Adam describes herself as a
"cultural worker," implying
both political commitment and
conscious responsibility to
her audience. "A cultural
worker is a woman (in this
case) who has chosen to com
municate ideas that will change
the human condition," she
explained. "There is no differ
ence between a political
worker and a cultural worker.
It is only the medium in which
we operate that is different.
"The first time a woman
came up to me and told me
'this concert has changed my
life,' that was a big part of my
radicalization as a conscious
artist. I am no longer able to get
up on that stage and just sing
and not understand the re
sponsibility I have as a role
model."
Popularizing feminism is
another important part of
Adam's music. "Feminism has
developed a language that
communicates our aspirations,

our struggles, the things- that
make us angry, our hopes and
our strategies. It is a code be
cause it is born of a certain
level of consciousness."
Adam believes that the artist
must translate the language of
the movement into terms ac
cessible and applicable to
everyone's life. She has pro
duced an album on her own
Pleiades label for which the en
tire recording process — per
formance, arrangement and
production — was done by
women. "Most women have
not had access to the inroads
into the industry that I have.
Part of what will create a parity
between men and women is an
understanding of the
economics involved, of who
controls the pursestrings of the
world.
"What that means to those of
us who understand that, is that
we must not only discuss it
rhetorically, but back it up with
our lives and where we put our
money.
"I choose to work with
women on the stage because
there aren't enough women
onstage. I choose to work with
women on sound and lights
because women do not yet
have enough access to that
kind of technology. Part of my
responsibility as a political
woman is to make those spaces
available for women whenever
I can.

"When we no longer see the
adjectives female drummer or
female bassist, I won't need to
put special energy into sup
porting women in business, on
the stage and in technology.
"What makes women's
music different is not that we
don't sing love songs anymore
. . . all of us love to be loved,
and have things to say about
that experience. It is what we
say that's different. We try to
define our relational entities
where two people come to
gether as strong, whole human
beings.
"That kind of love is a very
political concept.
"People say 'women's
music, that must be political.'
Absolutely. The politics in my
mind is the communication of
how we should relate to each
other as human beings."
The title of the Pleiades'
album is simply "Margie
Adam — Songwriter." For a
long time, she could not see
herself as a performer because
of the stereotype attached to
women onstage — the razzle
dazzle, fast-and-flashy act. She
began her shows with "I'm not
really a performer. . but au
diences loved her "act" and
she gradually defined her role.
"Now, I can't imagine myself
not on stage. It's scary, though,
maintaining my power and
being vulnerable at the same
time.

"But we must accept the re
sponsibility of understanding
that we are about the business
and the art and the economics
of disseminating an extraordi
nary possibility for all people.
Then v\e can go beyond the
cult of personality which says
that someone is more impor
tant than someone else. Be
cause of what? How is it that
the performer is more impor
tant than the woman who is
volunteering to counsel a
woman who has just come off
the streets after being raped?"
Adam said she found it "part
of my work to take this tre
mendous flood of energy com
ing at me from the audience
and recycle it back into the au
dience. Everyone walks out
being more, not just me.
Everyone has a better sense of
what the possibilities are. •
"The audience has been
conditioned by the media to
expect that this 'women's lib
thing' is going to be hostile..
I've been thinking — how is it
that this movement, which is
part of the movement for

human liberation of this cen
tury, got the word liberation
shortened? If anyone ever cal
led a person involed in black
liberation a black libber there
would be hell to pay.
"Everyone knows what that
means. It is extremely signific
ant to me that the men and
women involved in this move
ment are called women's lib
bers.
"There is a concern on the
part of the audience in general
that the art we're developing in
women's culture is going to be
somehow anti-male. There is
unfortunately an equation of
pro-women work with anti
male sentiment. The last thing
we want to do as we're de
veloping a pro-woman culture
is to build into it a negative
philosophy.
"When people come to a
concert of women's music they
carry with them that
negativism, that fear, that it
won't be about them, that it
will be assaultive to them. The
stuggle of women is the strug
gle of all people."
