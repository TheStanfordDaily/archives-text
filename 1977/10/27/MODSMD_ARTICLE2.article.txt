Carter may veto energy bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter indicated
yesterday he will veto the energy bill if it raises natural
gas prices higher than the $1.75 per thousand cubic
feet level he originally proposed, a delegation of
congressmen said.
"The $1.75 figure is as far as we should go It should
not be amended," Rep. Andrew Maguire (D-N.J.),
quoted Carter as telling the group.
The current price is about $1.46 per thousand cubic
feet.
"The president told us that he would veto a bad bill,
that he agrees with us that we don't need a bill just for
the sake of having a bill and if the bill tilts too much
toward the oil company interests, he certainly would
not support it," said Rep. Anthony Moffitt (D-Conn.).
Spokesmen for the group told reporters they came
away feeling they had a commitment from Carter that
he would veto any measure with higher gas prices.
IBM antitrust charges dismissed
San Francisco — A federal judge yesterday dismis
sed charges of monopoly and attempted monopoly in
an antitrust suit against International Business
Machines (IBM) but let stand a $2.7 million damage
award against IBM for allegedly violating California
law.
The rulings by U.S. District Court Judge Ray
McNichols were on motions made by both IBM and
Forro Precision Inc. in the 1974 suit in which a jury
rendered a partial verdict last Sept. 16.
The jury failed to reach a verdict on claims that IBM
had unlawfully conspired to restrain trade and
monopolize the electronic data processing industry.
Forro had sought damages of at least $24 million.
Jurors did award general damages of $2.7 million to

Forro Precision of Woodland Hills, Calif., on its claim
that IBM intentionally interfered with prospective
business relationships in violation of state law. It also
gave IBM $260,777 on a counterclaim alleging misap
propriation of trade secret information. However,
the jury could not decide whether to award punitive
damages.
House cuts Social Security change
Washington — The House voted yesterday against
bringing more than six million government workers
under Social Security, a change that would have re
duced the stiff tax increases needed to save the sys
tem from going broke.
The 386-38 vote came as the House considered
amendments to a bill to bail Social Security out of its
financial troubles by nearly tripling Social Security
taxes for many American workers over the next 10
years.
The bill would shift a greater portion of the tax
burden to upper-income workers, but it would mean
higher taxes for all 104 million Americans who pay
into Social Security.
The action on an amendment against bringing
more workers into the system overruled the House
Ways and Means Committee.
Under the bill as amended, the maximum Social
Security tax would go up during the next decade from
the present $965 per year to $2982.
With the new workers paying into the program, the
maximum tax in 1987 would have been $2732.
The amendment, by Rep. Joseph Fisher (R-Va.),
calls for a two-year study of bringing the workers
under the program. Federal workers now have sepa
rate retirement plans and employes of state and local
governments and of nonprofit organizations may

form independent plans.
U.S., Russia exchange war lecturers
Moscow — The American and Soviet armed forces
have quietly begun an exchange of lecturers as part of
"confidence building" between the two super
powers, according to U.S. and Soviet sources.
The first lectures, which neither the American nor
the Soviet side publicized at the time, took place
Sept. 26 in Moscow and Sept. 28 in Leningrad. Brig.
Gen. John Bard, commandant of cadets at the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, lectured two groups
of high-ranking Soviet officers on American Pacific
amphibious operations in World War 11.
The Soviets will send a lecturer to U.S. military
institutes next month, American sources said, but the
topic of the talk is not yet known.
A Soviet Defense Ministry spokesman acknow
ledged the exchange program yesterday and said the
American talks "were very interesting but from the
historical point of view there was almost nothing
new. In our opinion the lecture of the Russian
speaker to be given in the United States has been
better prepared."
An exchange of this type is very useful for Soviet-
American relations and (or detente in general," the
Soviet spokesman said. "The speeches were given in
good Russian."
Bard, a former student of Russian, read his speech
in Russian from a prepared text.
