# Outlaws coming
## 
### 
The Outlaws will bring
their soaring vocals to Stan
ford with this Saturday's 1
p.m. concert in Frost Am
phitheatre. Opening the
show will be Country Joe
McDonald and Mistress, an
all-star band which includes
musicians from the ensem
bles of Steve Miller, Boz
Scaggs and other top
names.
The Outlaws first broke
into big time radio with
"There Goes Another Love
Song," a top 40 hit from
their debut album, "Out
laws." Other hot songs on
that LP include "Green
Grass and High Tides,"
which features a guitar duel
between Hughie Thomas
son and Billy (ones.
Between nonstop tours,
The Outlaws cut their sec
ond album, "Lady in Wait
ing," which uses complex
harmonies and a swept

blue-grass sound. But, in
keeping with the band's rov
ing spirit, the album also has
several punchy rock songs.
With "Hurry Sundown,"
their third album, The Out
laws condensed their weav
ing harmonies and guitar
work into their most rep
resentative pfece. The LP
contains Thomasson's title
song, Henry Paul and
Monte Yoho's
"Gunsmoke," and Billy
jones' beautiful "Night
Wines" ballad.
The Outlaws consist of
lead guitarists Thomasson
and Jones, rhythm guitarist
Paul and a rhythm section of
bassist Harvey Dalton Ar
nold and drummer Yoho.
Tickets for the Frost con
cert, sponsored by ASSU
Special Events, are $5.50 for
students, $6.50 general ad
mission and $7.50 on the
day of the show.
