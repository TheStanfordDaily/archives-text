Ronnie Laws brought his sex
tet to Stanford for two shows at
Memorial Auditorium on
Saturday. The crowd was small,
yet enthusiastic about Laws'
tasteful combination of jazz,
funk and rock.
In an interview before the
concert Laws commented "the
performer owes it to his audi
ence to always put out real ef
fort, to always put on a show."
"It's important to keep the
communication lines open be
tween the audience and the ar
tist, being able to really satisfy
the public in their musical
taste. Being able to exercise a
relative freedom in this field is
one of my goals. To be expres
sive, not to be inhibited as an
artist."
Laws' music has gone
through many changes since
his early work with Earth, Wind
and Fire and the Crusaders.
Laws said, "Each album should

I don't know what the mem
bers of Kansas — Rich Wil
liams, Phil Ehart, Dave Hope,
Steve Walsh, Robby Steinhardt
and Kerry Livgren — use in
their hair, but the fact remains
that they're not getting older,
they're getting better. Their
fifth album, "Point of Know Re
turn," reveals influences from
their contemporaries as have
their previous albums, but
more importantly, the unique
sound which Kansas has the
ability to create is more fully
developed here than on any of
their previous albums.
Perhaps the most strikingly
good quality of this album is its
lyrics. From the poignant pro

show evidence of a transition
in a positive sense. I consider it
part of my task to show some
growth from record to record.
"I feel the jazz-rock fusion is
good. It promotes a musical
variety within a group. Today
when you go hear a group you
are probably going to hear
more than one style of playing.
Ten years ago one would be
hearing a very distinctive style.
The audience is now getting
more than in the past."

Even though Laws is defi
nitely part of today's music
scene he can still remark upon
his style's roots. "My playing is
part of the Texas tradition. It's
rooted in the blues and south
ern tradition." In his concert
Laws displayed both the mod

ern and traditional elements of
his playing.
Success has not made Laws
complacent about his future.
"There are always goals. As
long as you're living there is
always things to learn and
things to achieve."
At the concert, Laws' group
gave a loud and hard driven
performance. Laws' reed work,
and some keyboard playing by
Barnaby Finch (a flamboyant
name but, I am assured, his
real one) were the best part of
the performance. Laws has
shown clearly that he can work
in popular mediums without
selling short his musical ta
lents. For example, Laws' third
solo of the night bristled with
chromatic runs and figurations
reminiscent of Charlie Parker.

"There are always goals. As
long as you're living there is
always things to learn and
things to achieve."
At the concert, Laws' group
gave a loud and hard driven
performance. Laws' reed work,
and some keyboard playing by
Barnaby Finch (a flamboyant
name but, I am assured, his
real one) were the best part of
the performance. Laws has
shown clearly that he can work
in popular mediums without
selling short his musical ta
lents. For example, Laws' third
solo of the night bristled with
chromatic runs and figurations
reminiscent of Charlie Parker.

Jazz

Ronnie Laws brought his sex
tet to Stanford for two shows at
Memorial Auditorium on
Saturday. The crowd was small,
yet enthusiastic about Laws'
tasteful combination of jazz,
funk and rock.
In an interview before the
concert Laws commented "the
performer owes it to his audi
ence to always put out real ef
fort, to always put on a show."
"It's important to keep the
communication lines open be
tween the audience and the ar
tist, being able to really satisfy
the public in their musical
taste. Being able to exercise a
relative freedom in this field is
one of my goals. To be expres
sive, not to be inhibited as an
artist."
Laws' music has gone
through many changes since
his early work with Earth, Wind
and Fire and the Crusaders.
Laws said, "Each album should

I don't know what the mem
bers of Kansas — Rich Wil
liams, Phil Ehart, Dave Hope,
Steve Walsh, Robby Steinhardt
and Kerry Livgren — use in
their hair, but the fact remains
that they're not getting older,
they're getting better. Their
fifth album, "Point of Know Re
turn," reveals influences from
their contemporaries as have
their previous albums, but
more importantly, the unique
sound which Kansas has the
ability to create is more fully
developed here than on any of
their previous albums.
Perhaps the most strikingly
good quality of this album is its
lyrics. From the poignant pro

show evidence of a transition
in a positive sense. I consider it
part of my task to show some
growth from record to record.
"I feel the jazz-rock fusion is
good. It promotes a musical
variety within a group. Today
when you go hear a group you
are probably going to hear
more than one style of playing.
Ten years ago one would be
hearing a very distinctive style.
The audience is now getting
more than in the past."

Even though Laws is defi
nitely part of today's music
scene he can still remark upon
his style's roots. "My playing is
part of the Texas tradition. It's
rooted in the blues and south
ern tradition." In his concert
Laws displayed both the mod

ern and traditional elements of
his playing.
Success has not made Laws
complacent about his future.
