# Kansas in full bloom
## 
### 
test of "Sparks of the Tem
pest," to the appropriate
paradox of "Paradox," Walsh
and Livgren demonstrate their
fine lyrical abilities. Walsh and
Livgren outdo even them
selves, though, on the title
song and "Closet Chronicles."
Rare indeed are lyrics which
simultaneously: 1) fit the musi
cal requirements of a song; 2)
can stand alone as poetry; and
3) tell a story which leaves the
listener breathless. Both
"Point of Know Return," the
story of a sailor risking his life
on a voyage to the unknown,
and "Closet Chronicles," an
epitaph of an unforgettable
man, have such lyrics.

But lyrics alone cannot make
an album; it is the match of
good lyrics with good music
which produces real quality.
Kansas succeeds on this count

as well. The title sorig, "Point
of Know Return" is an obvious
follow-up to Kansas' smash,
"Wayward Son."
The album shows a marked
increase in emphasis on
Steinhardt's violin and viola
playing. Like the violin on
"Closet Chronicles," the one
on "Nobody's Home" is beaut
iful. Moving through small vio
lin excursions, the song finally
reaches the piano-violi duet in
the song's middle — a duet that
could find a place in the heart
of the most ardent classical
music lover.
In contrast, "Lightning's
Hand" is a rocker, reminiscent
of the Who at their best.
Kansas has produced an
album which is good — in fact,
very good — but which has
flaws. By simply ignoring the
bad passages, one has an
album which, though a bit
short, makes a worthy con
tribution.
