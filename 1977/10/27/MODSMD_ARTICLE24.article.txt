# 'Short Eyes': realistic prison drama
## 
### 
Though most Americans
agree that our penal system is a
disgrace and needs to be re
formed, the question of how to
change prisons is a largely neg
lected issue. Film, however,
has been one medium which
has consistently placed the
topic before the public's eye.
The brilliant "I Am a Fugitive
from a Chain Gang" of 1932
takes a grim look at the prisons
of the South; the trashy "The
Longest Yard" of 1974 takes a
"funny" look at the conflict be
tween guards and inmates. In
between there have been
many good and bad looks at
prisons from every conceiva
ble angle.
But of the prison movies to
date, "Short Eyes" achieves a

unique realism and authentic
ity. It was filmed entirely in
Brooklyn's "Tombs," an old
(and infamous) institution,
where Puerto Rican writer
Miguel Pinero actually served
time. Most of the large ensem
ble of relatively unknown ac
tors in the film are convincing
as prisoners.
But if you are looking for
answers or statements from
this movie, forget it. What you
will find is, for the most part, an
honest examination of prison
ers and their peculiar set of
standards. The film is the story
of a group of inmates and their
encounter with a "short eyes,"
a prison term for child rapist.
Child rapists, by inmates' stan
dards, are the lowest scum on

earth. Both the guards and the
inmates terrorize the rapist,
and the prisoners end up slit
ting his throat.
There are two central charac
ters in the movie; Clark Davis
(the rapist), and Julio (a young
Puerto Rican who refuses to
have sex with the other in
mates). The others are defined
by their feelings towards these
characters. The film is directed
in workmanlike fashion by
Robert M. Young. Young is an
unobtrusive director; he lets
the words do most of the work.
He adroitly handles the film's
climactic scenes by using the
time-honored technique of
quick cutting to heighten ten
sion. Except for an early scene
in which Freddy Fender and
Curtis Mayfield lead a "sing
along" — which is so embar
rassingly wrong that one won
ders if Young were forced by
the money men to include it for
the sake of some "names" in
the cast — Young is very much
in control.
The actors, too, give a good
account of themselves. Their
characterizations have a
noticeable economy of effort
along with a naturalistic quality
that lends strength and be
lievability to the film. When
Murphy (played with savage in
tensity by Joe Carberry), spits
in Davis' face, the action car
ries much more force than any
words could. Good perfor
mances include those by Tito
Goya as Julio, Shawn Elliot as
Paco, a macho character with
very human weaknesses, and
Jose Perez as Juan, an under
standing and intelligent Puerto

Rican who is trying to break
loose from the system but
deep down knows he can't.
The outstanding perfor
mance, though, is given by
Bruce Davison in the extraor
dinarily difficult role of the
"short eyes," Clark Davis.
Davison's performance, thank
fully, has none of the cheap
tricks other actors (good ac
tors, too) have fallen for when
portraying rapists or mental
cases. The long scene where
he confesses everything to
Juan is particularly effective.
Davis reveals himself to be very
pitiful; he can't remember
some of his crimes and he
whines, "I can't help myself."
In a very graphic description of
his first rape, he says that the
little Puerto Rican girl had
"wanted it,"and had urged
him on. One wonders if this
exemplifies writer Pinero's

own attitude toward women
and children or whether he just
wants us to hate this pathetic
"whitey."
Indeed, one of the major
problems for the audience in
this film is how to deal with the
rapist. Should we feel sorry for
him, or should we want him to
be treated the way he is as
punishment for what he has
done? In the movie, Juan sym
bolizes this conflict. He tells
Davis that he could have killed
him for what he said about the
Puerto Rican child, but he
doesn't, and he's against Davis'
murder at the end.
One feels that Pinero is st
raining to make some sort of
statement with all this. He
doesn't succeed, and that
probably helps the film. It
would be all wrong as a "mes
sage film" (most message films
are). But you wish thatlhe film

weren't so "surface" and had
dealt with some of the deeper,
more complex reasons why
inmates condone murder,
arson or even rape of adult
women but not child rape (is it
a statement of a last shred of
dignity to draw the line some
where?). These questions are
never asked.
But "Short Eyes," for the
majority of its 100 minutes, is
an intelligent, ferocious and
brutal piece of filmmaking.
There won't be many people
who will like this film (in the
sense an entertainment film
like "The Sting" is liked), but it
has real emotions and genuine
people in it, unlike the recent
embalming going on in some
of the big new Hollywood re
leases.

punishment for what he has
done? In the movie, Juan sym
bolizes this conflict. He tells
Davis that he could have killed
him for what he said about the
Puerto Rican child, but he
doesn't, and he's against Davis'
murder at the end.

raining to make some sort of

doesn't succeed, and that
probably helps the film. It
would be all wrong as a "mes
sage film" (most message films
are). But you wish thatlhe film

weren't so "surface" and had
dealt with some of the deeper,
more complex reasons why
inmates condone murder,
arson or even rape of adult
women but not child rape (is it
a statement of a last shred of
dignity to draw the line some
where?). These questions are
never asked.
But "Short Eyes," for the
majority of its 100 minutes, is
an intelligent, ferocious and
brutal piece of filmmaking.
There won't be many people
who will like this film (in the
sense an entertainment film
like "The Sting" is liked), but it
has real emotions and genuine
people in it, unlike the recent
embalming going on in some
of the big new Hollywood re

Film
Though most Americans
agree that our penal system is a
disgrace and needs to be re
formed, the question of how to
change prisons is a largely neg
lected issue. Film, however,
has been one medium which
has consistently placed the
topic before the public's eye.
The brilliant "I Am a Fugitive
from a Chain Gang" of 1932
takes a grim look at the prisons
of the South; the trashy "The
Longest Yard" of 1974 takes a
"funny" look at the conflict be
tween guards and inmates. In
between there have been
many good and bad looks at
prisons from every conceiva
ble angle.
But of the prison movies to
date, "Short Eyes" achieves a

unique realism and authentic
ity. It was filmed entirely in
Brooklyn's "Tombs," an old
(and infamous) institution,
where Puerto Rican writer
Miguel Pinero actually served
time. Most of the large ensem
ble of relatively unknown ac
tors in the film are convincing
as prisoners.
But if you are looking for
answers or statements from
this movie, forget it. What you
will find is, for the most part, an
honest examination of prison
ers and their peculiar set of
standards. The film is the story
of a group of inmates and their
encounter with a "short eyes,"
a prison term for child rapist.
Child rapists, by inmates' stan
dards, are the lowest scum on

earth. Both the guards and the
inmates terrorize the rapist,
and the prisoners end up slit
ting his throat.
There are two central charac
ters in the movie; Clark Davis
(the rapist), and Julio (a young
Puerto Rican who refuses to
have sex with the other in
mates). The others are defined
by their feelings towards these
characters. The film is directed
in workmanlike fashion by
Robert M. Young. Young is an
unobtrusive director; he lets
the words do most of the work.
He adroitly handles the film's
climactic scenes by using the
time-honored technique of
quick cutting to heighten ten
sion. Except for an early scene
in which Freddy Fender and
Curtis Mayfield lead a "sing
along" — which is so embar
rassingly wrong that one won
ders if Young were forced by
the money men to include it for
the sake of some "names" in
the cast — Young is very much
in control.
The actors, too, give a good
account of themselves. Their
characterizations have a
noticeable economy of effort
along with a naturalistic quality
that lends strength and be
lievability to the film. When
Murphy (played with savage in
tensity by Joe Carberry), spits
in Davis' face, the action car
ries much more force than any
words could. Good perfor
mances include those by Tito
Goya as Julio, Shawn Elliot as
Paco, a macho character with
very human weaknesses, and
Jose Perez as Juan, an under
standing and intelligent Puerto

Rican who is trying to break
loose from the system but
deep down knows he can't.
The outstanding perfor
mance, though, is given by
Bruce Davison in the extraor
dinarily difficult role of the
"short eyes," Clark Davis.
Davison's performance, thank
fully, has none of the cheap
tricks other actors (good ac
tors, too) have fallen for when
portraying rapists or mental
cases. The long scene where
he confesses everything to
Juan is particularly effective.
Davis reveals himself to be very
pitiful; he can't remember
some of his crimes and he
whines, "I can't help myself."
In a very graphic description of
his first rape, he says that the
little Puerto Rican girl had
"wanted it,"and had urged
him on. One wonders if this
exemplifies writer Pinero's

own attitude toward women
and children or whether he just
wants us to hate this pathetic
"whitey."
Indeed, one of the major
problems for the audience in
this film is how to deal with the
rapist. Should we feel sorry for
him, or should we want him to
be treated the way he is as
punishment for what he has
done? In the movie, Juan sym

in Davis' face, the action car
ries much more force than any
words could. Good perfor
mances include those by Tito
Goya as Julio, Shawn Elliot as
Paco, a macho character with
very human weaknesses, and
Jose Perez as Juan, an under
standing and intelligent Puerto

Rican who is trying to break
loose from the system but
deep down knows he can't.
The outstanding perfor
mance, though, is given by
Bruce Davison in the extraor
dinarily difficult role of the
"short eyes," Clark Davis.
Davison's performance, thank
fully, has none of the cheap
tricks other actors (good ac
tors, too) have fallen for when
portraying rapists or mental
cases. The long scene where
he confesses everything to
Juan is particularly effective.
Davis reveals himself to be very
pitiful; he can't remember
some of his crimes and he
whines, "I can't help myself."
In a very graphic description of
his first rape, he says that the
little Puerto Rican girl had
"wanted it,"and had urged
him on. One wonders if this
exemplifies writer Pinero's

own attitude toward women
and children or whether he just
wants us to hate this pathetic
"whitey."
Indeed, one of the major
problems for the audience in
this film is how to deal with the
rapist. Should we feel sorry for
him, or should we want him to
be treated the way he is as
punishment for what he has
done? In the movie, Juan sym
bolizes this conflict. He tells
Davis that he could have killed
him for what he said about the
Puerto Rican child, but he
doesn't, and he's against Davis'
murder at the end.
One feels that Pinero is st
raining to make some sort of
statement with all this. He
doesn't succeed, and that
probably helps the film. It
would be all wrong as a "mes
sage film" (most message films
are). But you wish thatlhe film

weren't so "surface" and had
dealt with some of the deeper,
more complex reasons why
inmates condone murder,
arson or even rape of adult
women but not child rape (is it
a statement of a last shred of
dignity to draw the line some
where?). These questions are
never asked.
But "Short Eyes," for the
majority of its 100 minutes, is
an intelligent, ferocious and
brutal piece of filmmaking.
There won't be many people
who will like this film (in the
sense an entertainment film
like "The Sting" is liked), but it
has real emotions and genuine
people in it, unlike the recent
embalming going on in some
of the big new Hollywood re
leases.

Film
Though most Americans
agree that our penal system is a
disgrace and needs to be re
formed, the question of how to
change prisons is a largely neg
lected issue. Film, however,
has been one medium which
has consistently placed the
topic before the public's eye.
The brilliant "I Am a Fugitive
from a Chain Gang" of 1932
takes a grim look at the prisons
of the South; the trashy "The
Longest Yard" of 1974 takes a
"funny" look at the conflict be
tween guards and inmates. In
between there have been
many good and bad looks at
prisons from every conceiva
ble angle.
But of the prison movies to
date, "Short Eyes" achieves a

unique realism and authentic
ity. It was filmed entirely in
Brooklyn's "Tombs," an old
(and infamous) institution,
where Puerto Rican writer
Miguel Pinero actually served
time. Most of the large ensem
ble of relatively unknown ac
tors in the film are convincing
as prisoners.
But if you are looking for
answers or statements from
this movie, forget it. What you
will find is, for the most part, an
honest examination of prison
ers and their peculiar set of
standards. The film is the story
of a group of inmates and their
encounter with a "short eyes,"
a prison term for child rapist.
Child rapists, by inmates' stan
dards, are the lowest scum on

earth. Both the guards and the
inmates terrorize the rapist,
and the prisoners end up slit
ting his throat.
There are two central charac
ters in the movie; Clark Davis
(the rapist), and Julio (a young
Puerto Rican who refuses to
have sex with the other in
mates). The others are defined
by their feelings towards these
characters. The film is directed
in workmanlike fashion by
Robert M. Young. Young is an
unobtrusive director; he lets
the words do most of the work.
He adroitly handles the film's
climactic scenes by using the
time-honored technique of
quick cutting to heighten ten
sion. Except for an early scene
in which Freddy Fender and
Curtis Mayfield lead a "sing
along" — which is so embar
rassingly wrong that one won
ders if Young were forced by
the money men to include it for
the sake of some "names" in
the cast — Young is very much
in control.
The actors, too, give a good
account of themselves. Their
characterizations have a
noticeable economy of effort
along with a naturalistic quality
that lends strength and be
lievability to the film. When
Murphy (played with savage in
tensity by Joe Carberry), spits
in Davis' face, the action car
ries much more force than any
words could. Good perfor
