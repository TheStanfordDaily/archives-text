# Ballet stars in San Jose
## 
### 
Apparently, Suzanne Farrell
and Peter Martins are not well
known around here. Every
time I mention that they will be
dancing with other "Stars of
the American Ballet" in San
Jose this weekend, all I get
back is blank looks and "who's
that?"
Farrell and Martins are, to
put it mildly, outstanding dan
cers. They are stars of the New
York City Ballet Company
(NYCB), one of the best in the
world. Farrell in particular is
one of the most important
American dancers of the cur
rent generation. She was origi

nally a protege of George
Balanchine, the prolific
choreographer and resident
genius of NYCB. She left the
company for several years and
returned two seasons ago, an
even better dancer. Those who

have seen her recently say that
a new sensitivity and humanity
have been added to her old vir
tues of precision and verve.
Martins came to NYCB from
Denmark in 1967 and had some
difficulty becoming a Balan

chine dancer. After four years
of struggling to overcome his
own ego, Martins made the dif
ficult transition to concentrat
ing on dance and not just on
the image of himself dancing.
This is essential for a Balan
chine dancer because NYCB as
a matter of policy does not iso
late its stars from the rest of the
company.
Some say there are no real
stars in the New York City Bal
let. That is not true. Come Fri
day in the San Jose Center for
the Performing Arts, Farrell
and Martins will no doubt
prove they are stars of the first
magnitude.
