# Another book about Harvard's law school

### 
ONE L, by Scott Turow (Put
nam, 300 pages, $8.95)
If you are planning to attend
law school, by all means read
"One L," by Scott Turow. The
book excellently describes the
emotional and intellectual
pressures which dominate
most law students' first year of
study. While Turow's book
may not enable you to avoid
those pressures, it may at least
provide some awareness of
what you are about to experi
ence. Later, in the midst of the
first year, it may be a comfort to
remember that others have
suffered similar fears and
doubts. Turow's reflections on
the significance of his experi
ence furnish a valuable
perspective for evaluation of
your own initial year.
But "One L" will be of in
terest as well to non-lawyers
and practicing attorneys. The
book is a beautifully written,
straightforward, personalized
account of the author's life as a
One L, as first year students at
Harvard Law School are called.
It is also significant as an
examination of the profes
sional training which most
lawyers receive, since law
school curricula and teaching
methods are largely uniform
throughout the country.
As Turow observes, the law
school environment shapes
the way future attorneys view
themselves and their work, in
fluences their values, and de
termines how they will use
their often powerful positions
in American society. He dis

cusses the fierce competition
which exists at Harvard not
only because the institution,
through its stringent entrance
requirements, selects students
who are compulsive "over
achievers" and "academic suc
cess addicts," but because the
structure of law school educa
tion constantly demands this
response. The competitive at
mosphere combines with
other pressures which result in
a large percentage of Harvard
Law graduates entering corpo
rate practice — not only the av
ailability of jobs and the money
to be made, but the pervasive
assumption at Harvard and
elsewhere that large corporate
practice firms will provide the
best resources, the most inf
luential clients and cases, the
best opportunities to rise to
the top of the profession and
be looked upon as successful.
The political and moral im
plications of such an approach
do not appear to be seriously
questioned at Harvard except
by some few students. One
first year man concludes that
he will never accept a schizop
hrenic life in which he works
for Standard Oil during the day
and then goes home to read his
Sierra Club literature at night.
One wonders whether by his
third year he will have found a

way to justify exactly that sort
of existence.
Turow questions the suffi
ciency of law school training.
He points out that most of the
curriculum involves the study
of appellate court opinions. No
attention is given to the practi
cal skills needed by lawyers on
a day to day basis, such as
counseling clients, drafting a
contract, or negotiating the
settlement of a dispute. Such
skills are developed by the stu
dent, if at all, during extracur
ricular work or summer jobs.
This produces graduates who

are adept at writing legal argu
ment, but who are ill-equipped
to deal with much of the ordi
nary work of the practicing
lawyer.
"One L" is a description of
the law profession's initiation
process from the point of view
of an alternately enthusiastic
and reluctant neophyte. Turow
discusses his and his fellow
students' often painful aware
ness of the implications of
being taught to "think like a
lawyer," which involves the
systematic development of
one's intellectual powers of
deductive reasoning and the

deliberate elimination of
thought based on so-called ir
rational emotional responses
to people and events.
The tension this creates in
the minds of the students mir
rors a problem inherent in
Anglo-American jurisprudence
— the assumption that reason
alone will provide the best sol
ution for human conflicts.
"One L" richly depicts the
psychological environment of
law school and is an interesting
study of individual and group
reactions under the particular
conditions of stress which pre
vail there. Students come to
Harvard having been enorm
ously successful in both
academia and a wide range of
professions. Turow himself
taught creative writing at Stan
ford before his enrollment.
However, the huge amounts of
work, the difficult nature of the
material to be learned, the
large classes and lack of indi
vidual attention to students,
the emphasis on grades earned
solely by performance during
year-end exams, and the "Soc
ratic method" of teaching
whereby professors interro
gate students in front of the
class, all combine to create an
atmosphere of massive anxi
ety. During the year sophisti
cated adults who formerly th

rived on competition and
academic accomplishment be
come like a group of children
who vacillate between adora
tion and hatred of their surro
gate parents, the professors.
They are like siblings, alter
nately either protecting each
other, sometimes uniting to
rebel against their situation, or
competing against each other
shamelessly, scheming to edge
out their peers in the race to
make Law Review.
That such an experience can be
psychologically destructive is
obvious. Turow speculates that
many students do not recover
from it, that they become cyni
cal and protectively withdrawn
and carry that attitude with
them into the profession.
"One L" graphically exposes
many of the problems in law
school education today.
Though no grand solutions are
proposed, some suggestions
are made — smaller classes,
more practical training, and
less emphasis on final exam
grading as the only method of
student evaluation. The
strength of the book, however,
lies in its presentation of the
difficulties. It deserves serious
attention as a perceptive com
mentary on one of our most
influential institutions.

ONE L, by Scott Turow (Put

If you are planning to attend
law school, by all means read
"One L," by Scott Turow. The
book excellently describes the
emotional and intellectual
pressures which dominate
most law students' first year of
study. While Turow's book
may not enable you to avoid
those pressures, it may at least
provide some awareness of
what you are about to experi
ence. Later, in the midst of the
first year, it may be a comfort to
remember that others have
suffered similar fears and
doubts. Turow's reflections on
the significance of his experi
ence furnish a valuable
perspective for evaluation of
your own initial year.
But "One L" will be of in
terest as well to non-lawyers
and practicing attorneys. The
book is a beautifully written,
straightforward, personalized
account of the author's life as a
One L, as first year students at
Harvard Law School are called.
It is also significant as an
examination of the profes
sional training which most
lawyers receive, since law
school curricula and teaching
methods are largely uniform
throughout the country.
As Turow observes, the law
school environment shapes
the way future attorneys view
themselves and their work, in
fluences their values, and de
termines how they will use
their often powerful positions
in American society. He dis

cusses the fierce competition
which exists at Harvard not
only because the institution,
through its stringent entrance
requirements, selects students
who are compulsive "over
achievers" and "academic suc
cess addicts," but because the
structure of law school educa
tion constantly demands this
response. The competitive at
mosphere combines with
other pressures which result in
a large percentage of Harvard
Law graduates entering corpo
rate practice — not only the av
ailability of jobs and the money
to be made, but the pervasive
assumption at Harvard and
elsewhere that large corporate
practice firms will provide the
best resources, the most inf
luential clients and cases, the
best opportunities to rise to
the top of the profession and
be looked upon as successful.

ONE L, by Scott Turow (Put
nam, 300 pages, $8.95)
If you are planning to attend
law school, by all means read
"One L," by Scott Turow. The
book excellently describes the
emotional and intellectual
pressures which dominate
most law students' first year of
study. While Turow's book
may not enable you to avoid
those pressures, it may at least
provide some awareness of
what you are about to experi
ence. Later, in the midst of the
first year, it may be a comfort to
remember that others have
suffered similar fears and
doubts. Turow's reflections on
the significance of his experi
ence furnish a valuable
perspective for evaluation of
your own initial year.
But "One L" will be of in
terest as well to non-lawyers
and practicing attorneys. The
book is a beautifully written,
straightforward, personalized
account of the author's life as a
One L, as first year students at
Harvard Law School are called.
It is also significant as an
examination of the profes
sional training which most
lawyers receive, since law
school curricula and teaching
methods are largely uniform
throughout the country.
As Turow observes, the law
school environment shapes
the way future attorneys view
themselves and their work, in
fluences their values, and de
termines how they will use
their often powerful positions
in American society. He dis

cusses the fierce competition
which exists at Harvard not
only because the institution,
through its stringent entrance
requirements, selects students
who are compulsive "over
achievers" and "academic suc
cess addicts," but because the
structure of law school educa
tion constantly demands this
response. The competitive at
mosphere combines with
other pressures which result in
a large percentage of Harvard
Law graduates entering corpo
rate practice — not only the av
ailability of jobs and the money
to be made, but the pervasive
assumption at Harvard and
elsewhere that large corporate
practice firms will provide the
best resources, the most inf
luential clients and cases, the
best opportunities to rise to
the top of the profession and
be looked upon as successful.
The political and moral im
plications of such an approach
do not appear to be seriously
questioned at Harvard except
by some few students. One
first year man concludes that
he will never accept a schizop
hrenic life in which he works
for Standard Oil during the day
and then goes home to read his
Sierra Club literature at night.
One wonders whether by his
third year he will have found a

way to justify exactly that sort
of existence.
Turow questions the suffi
ciency of law school training.
He points out that most of the
curriculum involves the study
of appellate court opinions. No
attention is given to the practi
cal skills needed by lawyers on
a day to day basis, such as
counseling clients, drafting a
contract, or negotiating the
settlement of a dispute. Such
skills are developed by the stu
dent, if at all, during extracur
ricular work or summer jobs.
This produces graduates who

are adept at writing legal argu
ment, but who are ill-equipped
to deal with much of the ordi
nary work of the practicing
lawyer.
"One L" is a description of
the law profession's initiation
process from the point of view
of an alternately enthusiastic
and reluctant neophyte. Turow
discusses his and his fellow
students' often painful aware
ness of the implications of
being taught to "think like a
lawyer," which involves the
systematic development of
one's intellectual powers of
deductive reasoning and the

deliberate elimination of
thought based on so-called ir
rational emotional responses
to people and events.
The tension this creates in
the minds of the students mir
rors a problem inherent in
Anglo-American jurisprudence
— the assumption that reason
alone will provide the best sol
ution for human conflicts.
"One L" richly depicts the
psychological environment of
law school and is an interesting
study of individual and group
reactions under the particular
conditions of stress which pre
vail there. Students come to
Harvard having been enorm
ously successful in both
academia and a wide range of
professions. Turow himself
taught creative writing at Stan
ford before his enrollment.
However, the huge amounts of
work, the difficult nature of the
material to be learned, the
large classes and lack of indi
vidual attention to students,
the emphasis on grades earned
solely by performance during
year-end exams, and the "Soc
ratic method" of teaching
whereby professors interro
