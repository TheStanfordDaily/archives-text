# Shining 'Superstar,' crisp British hit
## 
### 
'Jesus Christ Superstar'
"Jesus Christ Superstar," at the Con
cord Pavilion, is a masterful production,
intense and powerful. Both leads, Ted
Neeley as Christ and Carl Anderson as
Judas, originally played their roles in the
film version of the musical. Gary Coddard
directs with a sure touch. Tony Jenkins'
choreography is outstanding, though not
always professionally executed.
The musical accompaniment was re
sponsible for many flaws. Keyboard in
rock opera should ideally be part of the
melody but much of the original score in
this production has been transcribed to
the keyboard. There were many blatant
mistakes in the playing, such as a French
horn cracking in the middle of an exposed
solo. All too often, the rhythm section
drowned the musicians. Because of this,
the tempos were faster" than originally
written. Goddard said he did this to add
power and pace to the show. The guitar
work on "Pilate's Dream" is superlative.
Though the singing in general was ex
cellent, especially on the part of Leole Jiles
(Mary Magdalene) and Paul Ainsley
(Herod), the special effects were the most
fascinating part of the show. Though few
in number they were simple and stunning.
Judas stands centerstage, for instance, as

he sings and wails, sinking into the stage
enveloped in light. For the crucifixion,
Jesus walks slowly into a backstage
chamber which pours white smoke. As he
disappears, Judas enters, singing
"Superstar," the show's major theme.

As far as productions of "Jesus Christ
Superstar" go, this is as good as any, mix
ing both brilliant moments with faults
(weak voices, overpowering music).
Concord Pavilion's stage is but invisi
ble from the grass so you should buy re
served seats.

Oct. 28 at Concord.)
'Move Over, Mrs. Markham'
Have you ever wondered how the
British do it? The way to find out is to
attend a performance of College of San
Mateo's "Move Over, Mrs. Markham,"
the hilarious contemporary comedy by
Ray Cooney and John Chapman.
The clever dialogue shows an English
example of sexual farce similar to plays like
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to

the Forum" and those by Kaufman and
Hart. The basic theme revolves around the
attempts of the Markhams to extricate
themselves from the disastrous affairs
(due to a lack of marital relations in their
marriage) of the Lodges, their best friends.
Also running around are an interior de
signer and a maid trying to use the Mar
kham's apartment for a love tryst.
Ed Plishka (as Philip Markham, the
highly conservative man of the house) is
good, especially in the scene during which
he is carefully taught the standard
methods of "goosing" or when he acci
dentally seduces the beautiful telephone
operator (radiantly played by Karen
Johnson.)
Rod Abernethy (as Walter Pangborn)
and Muriel Rice (as Olive Harriet Smythe)
ably support the humor as the former
searches for his Emmy Lou with flowers,
champagne, and bowler and the other
talks to anyone about her Woofers.
One of the finest aspects of the show are
the colorful negligees of the actresses
which have been carefully selected to suit
each one's figure and coloring.

(Herod), the special effects were the most
fascinating part of the show. Though few
in number they were simple and stunning.
Judas stands centerstage, for instance, as

he sings and wails, sinking into the stage
enveloped in light. For the crucifixion,
Jesus walks slowly into a backstage
chamber which pours white smoke. As he
disappears, Judas enters, singing
"Superstar," the show's major theme.

As far as productions of "Jesus Christ
Superstar" go, this is as good as any, mix
ing both brilliant moments with faults
(weak voices, overpowering music).
Concord Pavilion's stage is but invisi
ble from the grass so you should buy re
served seats.

'Move Over, Mrs. Markham'
Have you ever wondered how the
British do it? The way to find out is to
attend a performance of College of San
Mateo's "Move Over, Mrs. Markham,"
the hilarious contemporary comedy by
Ray Cooney and John Chapman.
The clever dialogue shows an English
example of sexual farce similar to plays like
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to

the Forum" and those by Kaufman and
Hart. The basic theme revolves around the
attempts of the Markhams to extricate
themselves from the disastrous affairs
(due to a lack of marital relations in their
marriage) of the Lodges, their best friends.
Also running around are an interior de
signer and a maid trying to use the Mar
kham's apartment for a love tryst.
Ed Plishka (as Philip Markham, the
highly conservative man of the house) is
good, especially in the scene during which
he is carefully taught the standard
methods of "goosing" or when he acci
dentally seduces the beautiful telephone
operator (radiantly played by Karen
Johnson.)
Rod Abernethy (as Walter Pangborn)
and Muriel Rice (as Olive Harriet Smythe)
ably support the humor as the former
searches for his Emmy Lou with flowers,
champagne, and bowler and the other
talks to anyone about her Woofers.
One of the finest aspects of the show are
the colorful negligees of the actresses
which have been carefully selected to suit
each one's figure and coloring.

Drama

'Jesus Christ Superstar'
"Jesus Christ Superstar," at the Con
cord Pavilion, is a masterful production,
intense and powerful. Both leads, Ted
Neeley as Christ and Carl Anderson as
Judas, originally played their roles in the
film version of the musical. Gary Coddard
directs with a sure touch. Tony Jenkins'
choreography is outstanding, though not
always professionally executed.
The musical accompaniment was re
sponsible for many flaws. Keyboard in
rock opera should ideally be part of the
melody but much of the original score in
this production has been transcribed to
the keyboard. There were many blatant
mistakes in the playing, such as a French
horn cracking in the middle of an exposed
solo. All too often, the rhythm section
drowned the musicians. Because of this,
the tempos were faster" than originally
written. Goddard said he did this to add
power and pace to the show. The guitar
work on "Pilate's Dream" is superlative.
Though the singing in general was ex
cellent, especially on the part of Leole Jiles
(Mary Magdalene) and Paul Ainsley
(Herod), the special effects were the most
fascinating part of the show. Though few
in number they were simple and stunning.
