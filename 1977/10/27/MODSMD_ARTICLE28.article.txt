# CAT wins with a pair of Henry's
## 
### 
The California Actors
Theatre's production of "This
Star of England, Part Two"
merits a reaction similar to the
acclaim the first part received.
This adaptation of Shakes
peare's "Henry V" by Dakin
Mathews can be denoted out
standing at the very least. In
this case, the alteration of the
Bard's words deserves unqual
ified praise and no significant
changes in the plot or rhythm
were detectable. "Henry V" is
the continuation of Prince
Hal's emergence as King of En
gland as he valiantly fights for
his birthrights in France
through the bloody fields of
Harfleur and Agincourt.

This story strives to express
Hal's final metamorphosis
from "drinking buddy extraor
dinaire" into the hero king and
conqueror of France. Byron
Jennings, whose appearance in
"Henry IV" brought much
praise, has again proved him
self as a professional per
former through his believabil
ity. Both his laughter at the
Dauphin's gift of tennis balls
and his sorrow at his men's
sickness are real, which makes
it real for the audience also. So
real does he become that it is
simple to laugh at his embar
rassment as he proposes to
Katherine.
Of special note is CAT vete
ran Tom Ramirez who as swag
gering Pistol successfully fills
the position of fool left vacant
by the death of Falstaff (played
by Dakin Mathews in "Henry
IV"). But, at one point, Stefan
Fischer (as Captain Fluellen),
steals the admiration of the au
dience as he forces Pistol to eat
a leek in punishment for slight
ing that same national emblem
of Wales.
Although this historical play
depicts a particularly bloody
period of history, the piece
turns out to be even funnier
than its predecessor. Dann H.
Florek and Will Huddleston de
light the crowd with the antics
of the silly King Charles VI and
his immature son. Margaret
Laurence and Carolyn Reed
tease the audience into mirth
with their language lesson; this
is especially delightful since it
is almost completely in French.
Pistol, Nym and Bardolph pro
vide an additional comic ele
ment with their slapstick fight.
After this outstanding pro
duction of "Henry V" has
completed a two week solo
run, the CAT plans to alternate
both sections of "This Star of
England" until Nov. 27.

Hal's emergence as King of En
gland as he valiantly fights for
his birthrights in France
through the bloody fields of
Harfleur and Agincourt.

This story strives to express
Hal's final metamorphosis
from "drinking buddy extraor
dinaire" into the hero king and
conqueror of France. Byron
Jennings, whose appearance in
"Henry IV" brought much
praise, has again proved him
self as a professional per
former through his believabil
ity. Both his laughter at the
Dauphin's gift of tennis balls
and his sorrow at his men's
sickness are real, which makes
it real for the audience also. So
real does he become that it is
simple to laugh at his embar
rassment as he proposes to
Katherine.
Of special note is CAT vete
ran Tom Ramirez who as swag
gering Pistol successfully fills
the position of fool left vacant
by the death of Falstaff (played
by Dakin Mathews in "Henry
IV"). But, at one point, Stefan
Fischer (as Captain Fluellen),
steals the admiration of the au
dience as he forces Pistol to eat
a leek in punishment for slight
ing that same national emblem
of Wales.
Although this historical play
depicts a particularly bloody
period of history, the piece
turns out to be even funnier
than its predecessor. Dann H.
Florek and Will Huddleston de
light the crowd with the antics
of the silly King Charles VI and
his immature son. Margaret
Laurence and Carolyn Reed
tease the audience into mirth
with their language lesson; this
is especially delightful since it
is almost completely in French.
Pistol, Nym and Bardolph pro
vide an additional comic ele
ment with their slapstick fight.
After this outstanding pro
duction of "Henry V" has
completed a two week solo
run, the CAT plans to alternate
both sections of "This Star of
England" until Nov. 27.
