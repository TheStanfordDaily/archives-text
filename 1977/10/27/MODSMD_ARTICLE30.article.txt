The United States Attorney's
office in San Francisco last
April asked the FBI to investi
gate alleged research fraud on
the part of Assoc. Prof, of
Surgery Zoltan Lucas, the Daily
has learned.
The assistant U.S. Attorney
who requested the investiga
tion confirmed yesterday that
he was familiar with the case
but said he couldn't comment
on any on-going investigation,
in keeping with Department of
lustice policy.
The request for the FBI inves

tigation stems from a letter
written in April to Asst. U.S. At
torney David Bancroft by As
soc. Prof, of Cardiovascular
Surgery Eugene Dong.
In his letter, Dong alleged
that Lucas had told the Na
tional Institutes of Health
(NIH) that Lucas had com
pleted and submitted to pub
lishers a number of articles
produced under an NIH grant.
Dong also alleged that Lucas
had not done so.
Dong said in his letter that
his allegation was supported
by testimony Lucas gave in a
civil suit filed against Lucas by

one of Lucas' former research
assistants.
Bancroft said in a letter of
reply to Dong that he had "re
quested that the FBI conduct a
preliminary investigation of
the matter. . . ."
"We will then evaluate
whether further investigation
and litigation (civil or criminal)
are appropriate," Bancroft ad
ded.
University Counsel John
Schwartz said yesterday "This
is the first time I have heard
that the FBI is investigating
Stanford."
Lucas could not be reached
for comment.
The allegations about Lucas'
research first surfaced this
summer when the University
learned that Lucas may have
made conflicting statements
about whether he has submit
ted certain articles to journals
for publication.
Over the past several years
Dong has made several allega
tions about Lucas' research to
University department chair
men, the NIH and most re
cently to the U.S. Senate Sub
committee on Health.
Schwartz said last night that
during testimony in a lawsuit
filed by a former associate
against Lucas, Lucas made
some comments regarding his
publications, and "somebody
noticed they were inconsistent
with his reports to the NIH."
This is the court testimony
which Dong referred to in his
letter to Bancroft.
A NIH investigator reported
to Medical Center officials this
summer that he had received a
report that Lucas had not sub

mitted articles for publication
after he had told the NIH that
he had.
"Somebody notified the NIH
and they notified us,"
Schwartz added last night.
The NIH is awaiting the Uni
versity's report on this matter
before completing its own in
vestigation, the NIH inves
tigator said this summer.
"The University has been
looking into the applications
for grants and contracts sub
mitted by Lucas over the
course of the years he has been
here and that is still under
way," Schwartz added.
Dong said that he "called to
the attention of the NIH in De
cember 1975 about conflicts in
one grant request made by
Lucas."
The NIH investigator met
with both Clayton Rich, dean
of the Medical School, and
Schwartz and he was told at
that time that a faculty commit
tee had investigated the allega
tions and had found nothing
wrong, according to Dong.
A 1975 NIH probe led to the
resignation last year of another
Medical School professor fol
lowing University charges that
the professor deposited re
search fees in a personal bank
account.
After the resignation of
former Microbiology Prof.
Leonard Hayflick, the NIH
charged Hayflick with selling
cell specimens that were fed
eral property.
Hayflick denied any wrong
doing in connection with his
NIH work or his University
employment.
