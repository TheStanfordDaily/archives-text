# Garbage may be possible University energy source

Garbage may fuel boilers for
an on-campus power plant to
heat and power the University
community. Originator of the
concept, Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Robert Eustis said the
two-phase project will involve
graduate students in the
laboratory experimentation
and system analysis of the
trash-fired plant.
Eustis recently visited the
Department of Energy in
Washington, D.C. to negotiate
a substantial research grant for
the first phase of the project.
"We should know fn a
month how much money is av
ailable," Eustis said. The De
partment of Energy was very
favorable to the proposal, he
said.
The Stanford project would
utilize minimally processed
trash from a proposed Santa
Clara County Joint Power Au
thority (JPA) trash collecting
plant at a rate of 800 to 1000
tons per day.
A special fluid-bed boiler
would burn the lighter garbage
materials trucked in nightly
from the central plant. The
fluid-bed boiler has a four
foot-thick bed of hot sand
through which air circulates.
The refuse flows into the com
bustion chamber to be burned
with almost 99 per cent effec
tiveness.
Water will be circulated
through the chamber in pipes
to control both the tempera
ture of combustion and also to
provide clean steame energy.
This steam will provide the
power source to heat buildings
and turn the power-producing
turbines, according to Eustis'
proposal.
Gas produced by refuse
combusion will be released to
the environment only after ex
tensive preparation and will
meet the very strict Bay Area
pollution standards, said Eus
tis.
Cost of the plant is estimated
at $20 to $30 million, said Eus
tis. Operational costs of the
plant, however, will be offset
by revenues Stanford collects
for treating the garbage.
The Santa Clara Board of
Supervisors declared Monday
that all cities should look for
new methods of trash disposal.
No new traditional trash
dumps will be allowed in the
county. The Stanford project

would provide an answer to
trash problems for Palo Alto,
Sunnyvale, Mountain View,
Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and
Cupertino.
Development of alternative
energy sources are a very high
priority at Stanford, according
to Jason Mavis, director of
plant services. "Our energy bill
at Stanford this year will run in
excess of five million,"he said.
The second phase of the pro
ject will involve the modifica
tion and testing of a fluid-bed
boiler already in existence at
the Combustion Power Co. of
Menlo Park. Eustis said he
hopes to involve graduate stu
dents both in the laboratory
work at combustion power and
also in systems analysis part of
the project at the University.

Phase one of the project will
involve approximately nine
months of research and test
ing, according to Eustis. If the
test results are favorable, Plant
Services will work with the
mechanical engineering de
partment to install a model
trash-fired plant on-campus
within three years.
"Only a few acres of land will
be involved on the campus,"
Eustis stated. A large land
commitment would be needed
by the JPA for the construction
of the central trash collecting
plant and the preliminary trash
processing before trucking to
the University.
Eustis said the development
of the Stanford plant would be
mutually beneficial to all par
ties concerned.

from the central plant. The
fluid-bed boiler has a four
foot-thick bed of hot sand
through which air circulates.
The refuse flows into the com
bustion chamber to be burned
with almost 99 per cent effec
tiveness.
Water will be circulated
through the chamber in pipes
to control both the tempera
ture of combustion and also to
provide clean steame energy.
This steam will provide the
power source to heat buildings
and turn the power-producing
turbines, according to Eustis'
proposal.
Gas produced by refuse
combusion will be released to
the environment only after ex
tensive preparation and will
meet the very strict Bay Area
pollution standards, said Eus
tis.
Cost of the plant is estimated
at $20 to $30 million, said Eus
tis. Operational costs of the
plant, however, will be offset
by revenues Stanford collects
for treating the garbage.
The Santa Clara Board of
Supervisors declared Monday
that all cities should look for
new methods of trash disposal.
No new traditional trash
dumps will be allowed in the
county. The Stanford project

would provide an answer to
trash problems for Palo Alto,
Sunnyvale, Mountain View,
Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and
Cupertino.
Development of alternative
energy sources are a very high
priority at Stanford, according
to Jason Mavis, director of
plant services. "Our energy bill
at Stanford this year will run in
excess of five million,"he said.
The second phase of the pro
ject will involve the modifica
tion and testing of a fluid-bed
boiler already in existence at
the Combustion Power Co. of
Menlo Park. Eustis said he
hopes to involve graduate stu
dents both in the laboratory
work at combustion power and
also in systems analysis part of
the project at the University.

Phase one of the project will
involve approximately nine
months of research and test
ing, according to Eustis. If the
test results are favorable, Plant
Services will work with the
mechanical engineering de
partment to install a model
trash-fired plant on-campus
within three years.
"Only a few acres of land will
be involved on the campus,"
Eustis stated. A large land
commitment would be needed
by the JPA for the construction
of the central trash collecting
plant and the preliminary trash
processing before trucking to
the University.
Eustis said the development
of the Stanford plant would be
mutually beneficial to all par
ties concerned.
Garbage may fuel boilers for
an on-campus power plant to
heat and power the University
community. Originator of the
concept, Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Robert Eustis said the
two-phase project will involve
graduate students in the
laboratory experimentation
and system analysis of the
trash-fired plant.
Eustis recently visited the
Department of Energy in
Washington, D.C. to negotiate
a substantial research grant for
the first phase of the project.
"We should know fn a
month how much money is av
ailable," Eustis said. The De
partment of Energy was very
favorable to the proposal, he
said.
The Stanford project would
utilize minimally processed
trash from a proposed Santa
Clara County Joint Power Au
thority (JPA) trash collecting
plant at a rate of 800 to 1000
tons per day.
A special fluid-bed boiler
would burn the lighter garbage
materials trucked in nightly
from the central plant. The
fluid-bed boiler has a four
foot-thick bed of hot sand
through which air circulates.
The refuse flows into the com
bustion chamber to be burned
