# Carter to support U.N. arms embargo

Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter will support a
U.N. embargo on arms sales to
South Africa to demonstrate
American distaste for mass ar
rests and the banning of black
publications by the Pretoria
government, it was learned
yesterday.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew
Young consulted yesterday
with French, British, West
German and Canadian dip
lomats in New York in an effort

to frame a joint strategy within
the Security Council for deal
ing with the South Africa issue.
The council is debating a re
quest by African countries for a
mandatory arms embargo and
a resolution calling on all gov
ernments to halt new invest
ment in South Africa.
Investment sanctions
Young said earlier this year
that sanctions on new invest
ment for fixed periods might
be an appropriate course of ac

tion against South Africa's pol
icy of racial segregation. In his
discussions he is exploring that
kind of approach, but it is
known that the Carter ad
ministration is not ready to
support a massive assault on
the South African economy.
U.S. economic sanctions
could have a more serious im
pact on Pretoria than support
for a global arms embargo
since the United States is South
Africa's largest trading partner.

Last year American firms sold
South Africa $1.35 billion worth
of goods. U.S. firms have an
investment of about $1.5 bill
ion in the country.
Carter is expected to discuss
his South Africa decision at a
news conference this after
noon. In the meantime, in
formed officials at the White
House and State Department
were instructed to guard
against any "leaks."
Present embargoes
The United States and Britain
already observe virtually air
tight arms embargoes of their
own against South Africa. But
some police equipment and
other "gray-area" gear, such as
spare parts for old Cl3O trans
port planes, are sent to South
Africa from the United States.
France has been a prominent
arms supplier for the African
nation, but U.S. officials said
they understood that country
also is now observing an em
bargo.
A world confrontation with
South Africa has been building
over the death last month of
Steve Biko, a black power
leader, and the subsequent
crackdown on blacks, their
newspapers and white suppor
ters. A final autopsy report
concluded yesterday that the
cause of Biko's death while in
detention was "extensive brain
injury."


After earlier efforts to record a scorching epochal
sensation produced less than epochal material,
the Truly Redactable Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band gave it another go yester
day, at 3 p.m., in Frost Amphitheater. It went

better, they say — those swearing revenge on
whoever it was that interrupted every Tuesday
afternoon midterm from here to Milpitas should
schedule the album scratching parties for De
cember.
