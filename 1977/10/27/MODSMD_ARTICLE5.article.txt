# Natural gas: an issue up in the air
## 
### 
One of the major con
troversies of the energy
debate centers on the question
of the price of natural gas. Al
though apparently of limited
significance, this issue has, and
will continue to have, far
reaching consequences for the
energy-consuming public.
California, for example, gets 55
per cent of its energy from
natural gas. SRI International,
formerly Stanford Research In
stitute, estimates that Califor
nia has lost 76,000 manufactur
ing jobs since 1971 due to
dwindling gas supplies and
projects the loss of as many as
800,000 jobs in this state by
1981. For most other parts of
the country, the news will not
be much better. Those states
which do not produce any
natural gas, such as those of
the Midwest or Northeast, will
face almost certain curtail
ments, some possibly as severe
as those which shut down
Ohio and Pennsylvania for
weeks last winter. Even in
states which produce natural
gas, such as Texas or Louisiana,
the price of gas at the well head
has increased by about 1000
per cent in the last 10 years.
Unfortunately, this is a very
complex issue with a long his
tory behind it. The almost
complete absence of good
statistics is enough to frustrate
any observer accustomed to
working quantitatively, while
the plethora of misleading
numbers can be a cause of
dismay to non-scientists. The
dogmatic Marxists or free
market economists may be in
the know but the lay reader de
serves to be informed. The
story is an interesting one
which needs to be understood
if an intelligent decision is to
be made.
Fifty years ago natural gas was
generally considered to be a
bothersome byproduct of oil
exploration. No market existed
for it and even if there had
been one, its transportation
was beyond the technology of
the time. The gas was burned at
the well head ("flared off" is
the professional term). Over a
period of years the oil com
panies began to use some of

the gas in their field operations
at the well site and local indus
tries began to buy gas and lay
their own pipelines. It was ob
vious, however, that natural
gas was still an under-utilized
resource and that each oil
company had monopoly con
trol over the gas supply and
price in any given local area.
These were real problems and
in those days it was still fash
ionable to believe that the fed
eral government had the
answers, so in stepped the
Federal Power Commission
(FPC).
The Natural Gas Act was pas
sed in 1938. It gave the FPC the
authority to regulate the sale of
natural gas across state lines.
Authority conferred is not al
ways authority used, however;
the FPC only claimed jurisdic
tion over those relatively few
gas companies which de
veloped, produced and distri
buted their gas in the interstate
market. Any producer which
sold its gas to a separate
pipeline company was exempt
from regulation. One such
producer which did not ship
gas in its own pipelines was
Phillips Petroleum Company.
When Phillips tried to raise the
price of gas above the regu
lated price, the state of Wis
consin took it to court. As is
always the case in natural gas
matters, the appeals took years
but in 1954 the United States
Supreme Court upheld the de
cision in favor of Wisconsin.
The high court charged the FPC
with the duty of setting "just
and reasonable" rates for vir
tually all interstate gas com
merce so as "to protect con
sumers against exploitation at
the hands of the gas com
panies."
The sentiments of the Presi
dent and Congress on regula
tion had changed considerably
in the 16 years since the pas
sage of the Natural Gas Act. It
was expected that a new bill
would be passed which would
exempt most big producers
from regulation, as had been
the case before the Phillips de
cision of 1954. Congress pas
sed such a bill in 1956 but it was
vetoed by President
Eisenhower after the public

exposure of "a series of lobby
ing scandals" (as Business
Week magazine so nicely un
derstates it).
It should be noted that the
federally regulated price for
gas generally functioned as a
"price floor" during the early
years of the FPC. The idea was
to set the interstate price high
enough to encourage com
panies to build pipelines and

develop gas as a viable energy
resource. Cas sold in the unre
gulated intrastate market (gas
sold within the state in which it
is produced) was cheaper dur
ing the early years of regulation
than the gas sold in the in
terstate market. This is a con
fusing but extremely important
point. At any given time there
are at least two prices for
natural gas: one is the intras
tate price which is not regu
lated; the other is the in
terstate price which is regu
lated.

During the '40s and '50s
natural gas was often in over
supply. The federal price was
high enough to encourage
companies to produce and sell
gas, but the cost was lower
than competing fuels such as
oil. This situation encouraged
customers to buy gas and use it
as a cheap, readily available
energy source. Some indus
tries became completely de
pendent on natural gas. These
industries included glass kilns,
some fertilizer and chemical
manufacturing and grain farm
ing. Many of the companies in
these industries relocated in
gas producing states where the
price of gas was lower than the
federally-regulated price.
Placed on this firm foundation,
the consumption of natural gas
has continued to increase
throughout the '60s and '70s —
and so has the price.
In 1964 the regulated price of
gas was about $.16 per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf). To
provide more incentive for
producers to meet growing
demand, the price was in
creased to $.19 per Mcf in 1969.
The amount of gas in proven
reserves (gas which has been
discovered but not yet de
veloped and used) began to
decline in the late '60s — a de
velopment alarming because
declining reserves would be
followed by declining produc
tion while the demand for the
clean efficient fuel continued
to grow. Gas producers de
manded more money for exp
loration and development. In
1971 they petitioned the FPC
for an increase in the price of
regulated gas to $.19 per Mcf.
This price, they assured the
FPC, would be sufficient to en
sure an adequate supply of
natural gas through October of
1977. The FPC granted $.26 per
Mcf in October 1971. Proven
gas reserves continued to de
cline.
One major problem with
"proven" gas reserves should
be noted here: they do not
seem to be very accurate. The
data on proven reserves comes
from the American Gas Associ
ation (AGA), a gas industry
trade group. The AGA data has
been shown to underestimate

reserves by as much as 37 per
cent according to spot checks
done by the United States
Geological Survey and FPC
staff reports. One AGA official
has testified that he did not re
port a very large gas field at the
request of the Mobil Oil Com
pany.
As gas reserves continued to
decline in the early '70s, the
producers petitioned the FPC
for another price increase.
When reviewing producer as
surances made during the pre
vious rate hike case, one of the
five FPC commissioners stated
that either "the producers
didn't know what they were
talking about, or the Commis
sion should never have lis
tened to them." Nonetheless,
the price of gas was increased
to $.42 per Mcf in June of 1974
and to $.50 per Mcf in De
cember ot the same year. Cit
ing increasing demand, con
tinually decreasing reserves
and increasing curtailments
(gas shortages) the producers
petitioned the FPC for another
price increase in late 1975. The
two divisions of the FPC staff
disagreed on their recommen
dations to the commissioners
for the level of the new price.
One division recommended
$.58 per Mcf and the other divi
sion recommended $.62 per
Mcf. The Commission raised
the price to $1.42 per Mcf.
Consumer groups were out
raged. Energy statisticians
were incredulous. The gas in
dustry intensified its campaign
to deregulate natural gas,
which would allow the price to
go even higher. The situation
has remained in this state for
the last year.
Sometime during the '60s,
when the demand for gas
began to exceed supply, the
unregulated intrastate market
price had risen above the regu
lated interstate price. The fed
erally regulated price for the
interstate market ceased to
function as a price floor and
began to function as a price
ceiling. The most important
consequence of this new situa
tion was that more gas was
going to the intrastate market
than to the interstate market.
