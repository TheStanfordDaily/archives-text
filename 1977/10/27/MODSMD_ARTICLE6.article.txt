# Gas

### 
The intrastate market had
plenty of gas but it was expen
sive. New gas at the well head
cost the intrastate market
about $2.00 per Mcf and the
cost of gas flowing in the
pipelines now averages about
$1.14 per Mcf in Texas. This
contrasts with $1.42 per Mcf for
new gas in the interstate mar
ket with the flowing gas averag
ing about $.50 per Mcf. These
confusing figures can be
explained as follows:
When a natural gas well is
developed and ready to be
hooked up to a pipeline, a con
tract is signed. The contract
generally requires that all of
the gas that comes from that
well for the next 20 years (the
average life of most wells) be
sold at the same price to the
same market (either intrastate
or interstate). The process of
signing a contract for the price
and market is known as the
"deducation" of a gas well.
Once the contract is signed the
price and the market of a gas
well can not be altered (except
for national emergencies) until
that contract expires. The price
that the gas from any given well
can bring for the producer de
pends on two things: the mar
ket chosen and the date. Pro
ducers of natural gas who drill
on land can choose either the
intrastate or the interstate
market. They understandably
choose the market which

brings them the highest price
on that date. The producer is
then committed to produce as
much gas as that well can
reasonably deliver to the cho
sen market for the agreed
upon price for the specified
number of years. All gas which
is produced off-shore (in the
Gulf of Mexico, for example)
must by law go to the interstate
market. In this case, as with
on-shore wells, the producer
may choose not to dedicate or
even develop a gas well unless
the current federally-regulated
price will bring a high enough
return on his investment.
All of this means that the
total cost of gas as it flows
through a pipeline is the
weighted average of all the dif
ferent quantities of gas priced
at different levels in that
pipeline. So, for example, if
you operate a pipeline, you
may carry gas from two diffe
rent wells. Half of your gas may
come from a well dedicated in
1960 at $.10 per Mcf and half of
your gas may come from a well
dedicated in 1975 for $1.90 per
Mcf. The cost of the gas to you
is the average, or $1.00 per
Mcf. You, as a pipeline
operator, will sell the gas to a
gas utility, which will sell the
gas to a family home or a busi
ness.
The importance of all these
transactions is that they cost
money. The price paid for gas
at the well head is only about 20
per cent of the final cost to in
dividual consumers as they
burn the gas in their homes.
The other 80 per cent of the
cost to the consumer goes to
the pipeline companies and
the utilities.
This argument is often used
with great success by the oil
companies when they petition
for a price hike or lobby for
deregulation. By raising the
