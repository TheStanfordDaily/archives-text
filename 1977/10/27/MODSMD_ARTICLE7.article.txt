price of newly discovered gas,
the FPC is not immediately
hurting the consumer because
the new, higher price will
gradually be introduced as the
percentage of more recently
discovered gas grows in the
pipelines. Even then the price
paid to the producer is only 20
per cent of the total cost to the
consumer. As a consequence,
even though the price of newly
discovered, federally
regulated gas at the well head
has increased over 700 per cent
in the last decade, the cost to
consumers hasgrown by only a
fraction of that amount.
The purpose of increasing
the price of newly disco
vered gas is to encourage pro
duction. The oil and gas com
panies argue that most or all of
the gas which was easy to find
and develop is either gone or
already in use. New gas is
going to be expensive to find
and expensive to develop. The
industry maintains that it is
using all of the gas it can find
which is not too expensive to
develop with the current
prices, or placed out of reach
of the companies by the en
vironmental concerns of the
federal government.
The industry also states that
deregulation will be a valuable
incentive for consumers to
conserve gas. They note that
much natural gas is presently
being used for tasks where less
precious fuels such as oil or
even coal could be used. How
ever gas will continue to be
used as long as it is cheaper
than the equivalent amount of
oil.
The gas producers conclude
their argument for deregula
tion by pointing to the already
deregulated intrastate market
where there is an abundance of
gas and strong conservation
measures are in force without
any government red tape,
bureaucracy or delay. The pro
ducers state that they want to
help the country but unless
they are given enough money
to explore and develop new re
serves, the supply of gas will
continue to fall as the demand
continues to increase. Then,
when winter comes, there will
not be enough gas to go
around at any price (a la Day
ton, Ohio in February, 1977)
and everyone will be hurt.
Needless to say, the con
sumer groups do not agree
with this analysis. Consumers
have two basic complaints:
first, the high prices which were
allowed by the FPC in July of
1977 and which are prevalent in
the intrastate market; and sec
ond, the gas shortages, which
are becoming increasingly
dangerous to individuals, in
dustries, and the economies of
the non-gas-producing states.
Many consumer groups be
lieve that the oil industry is sit
ting on gas (which it will not
report in the reserve data or
develop) in an attempt to force
the government to increase or
even deregulate prices.
Consumer groups do not be
lieve that production is tied to
the level of prices proposed by
the oil industry. They cite the
interstate market price which
increased by over 700 per cent
(during the Republican,
industry-dominated tenure of
the FPC) from 1969 through
1976, while reserves continued
to decline. They cite the
purchase of Montgomery
Ward and the attempted
purchase of Anaconda Copper
by ARCO as evidence that
money received from fuel pro
ducts does not always go to fi
nance the exploration and de
velopment of new fuel
sources.
The consumer groups also

note the fact that all of the op
erable gas drilling rigs in this
country are already being used
and that all manufacturers of
drilling rigs are operating at
peak capacity. What, they ask,
are the oil companies going to
spend all of their "needed"
new money on if there are not
any more drilling rigs availa
ble?
The consumer groups also
challenge the suggestion that
deregulation of natural gas
prices would be synonymous
with a free market price. They
believe that the natural gas in
dustry is dominated, if not con
trolled, by the large oil com
panies who will set the price of
natural gas to their own advan
tage. The consumer groups
point to the experience of the
intrastate market for natural
gas where, in the face of excess
supply, the price continued to
climb.
Finally, and perhaps most
emphatically, the consumer
groups point to the human as
pects of very great and very
rapid price increases. Many
firms in highly gas dependent
industries are being severely
pressed if not destroyed, thus
increasing the already unac
ceptably high level of un
employment. They emphasize
that the poor will be hit the
hardest of all when they can't
pay their heating bills in the
ghettos of the Northeast dur
ing the dead of winter.
This is obviously an
emotionally-charged, com
plex controversy. After cutting
through the rhetoric, the oil
industry and the consumer
groups both wish to maximize
the supply of natural gas and
distribute it more equally ac
ross the country by re-creating
one unified national natural
gas market. The two groups
differ on the question of the
means appropriate to reach the
desired ends and on their con
cerns about conservation. The
industry wishes to achieve one
market by deregulating the in
terstate price, thereby creating
a relatively uniform, deregu
lated price, which most obser
vers feel would rise to about
$2.30 per Mcf for newly dedi
cated natural gas. The industry
feels that the increase in price
alone would be sufficient to
encourage conservation. The
consumer groups wish to
create a single, unified, na
tional price structure by reg
ulating all newly dedicated
natural gas at a price less than
$1.42 per Mcf. They would like
to encourage increased supply
by breaking up, nationalizing
or otherwise threatening the
oil companies. Their concern
with conservation is less well
defined and is generally con
fined to converting wasteful
industries to other fuels and to
extending tax credits to indi
viduals who insulate their
homes.
Both groups have their sup
porters in Congress. The gas
and oil industry is strongly rep
resented in the Senate whereas
the consumer groups tend to
dominate in the House of Rep
resentatives. Last year the Se
nate voted for the deregulation
of natural gas and the House
voted for the regulation of the
intrastate markets. They were
so far apart that the bills never
even went to a committee to
attempt a compromise. The
situation remained fairly static
until April of this year when a
new and powerful advocate for
a compromise position
emerged: President Carter.
The President took a diffe
rent approach to the natural
gas question in an attempt to
build an acceptable and effec
tive compromise solution. By

placing conservation as the
cornerstone to his policy he
focused the emphasis of the
debate on demand rather than
the supply. Since the latter was
emphasized by both the oil in
dustry and the consumer
groups, Carter's position
alienated both groups.
The President proposed a
single, nationally regulated
price, which angered the oil
industry, but at a higher level
than the controversial figure of
$1.42 per Mcf promulgated by
the FPC, which angered the
consumergroups. By choosing
$1.75 per Mcf for new gas, the
President hoped to accomplish
a number of ends. First, it was
thought that this would pro
vide the oil industry with a
great deal of money for explo
ration and development. Sec
ond, this price makes the gas
level approximately equal in
cost to the current price of the
equivalent amount of oil. In
dustries and private consum
ers would no longer have a
price incentive to use gas over
oil for relatively inefficient fuel
uses. The price of gas would be
controlled to ensure the con
tinuation of this relationship
between gas and oil. Third, rol
ling back the price on the in
trastate markets would al
leviate some of the hardship on
dependent industries and in
dividual consumers. Fourth,
the price would be high
enough to encourage conser
vation. Fifth, the regulation
would help restrain, if not con
trol the oil industry's tenden
cies toward domination of gas
consumers. Sixth, a single na
tional price for new gas would
create a single national market,
which would spread the avail
able gas more equitably.
To encourage industries
which presently use gas ineffi
ciently to convert to oil, the
President proposed a tax on
gas wasters and a tax credit to
help finance the conversion.
The President also proposed a
tax credit for people who insu
late their homes, and rebates
in the form of tax credits for the
poor so that their additional
energy expenditures due to in
creased prices would not un
fairly burden them.
The immediate reaction to
the President's plan by every
major interest group in the
country was negative. Over the
last few months, however, the
consumer groups have come
to support his natural gas
proposals (even though they
still do not like the $1.75 per
Mcf price level). The House has
passed the Carter program
largely intact. The Senate
(perhaps unduly influenced by
lobbyists for the oil and gas in
dustry) has completely de
stroyed the President's prog
ram, voting instead to deregu
late all new natural gas. The
President has chosen to make
the oil industry out as the vil
lains in this affair, thus identify
ing an enemy and avoiding
damage to the tender egos of
Senator Majority Leader
Robert Byrd and other key
Senators.
The Energy Bill in its many
forms has moved to the con
ference committee in an effort
to find some middle ground.
Whether the conference
committee will be able to find a
means of compromise, and
what the two houses of Con
gress and the Administration
will do with the result of the
committee's efforts are ques
tions without answers at this
time. Two things are fairly cer
tain however: whatever will
happen will happen in the next
10 days and when it does, it will
mean tens of billions of dollars
to millions of Americans.
