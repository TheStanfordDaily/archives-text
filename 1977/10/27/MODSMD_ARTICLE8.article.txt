# Trouble in Germany-a question of right against left
## 
### 
The recent hijack and the
kidnaping and subsequent
murder of leading industrialist
Hans Martin Schleyer have
once again focused attention
on West Germany and its ter
rorists. And once again, obser
vers are faced with the ques
tion: why should intelligent
young people in an apparently
democratic, economically sta
ble country turn into violent,
irrational rebels?
It is not, perhaps, possible to
answer this question fully, but
during the year I spent study
ing in Munich, I gained some
insight into the nature of West
Germany's political problems.
First, one should emphasize
that the number of terrorists is
very small. Worldwide media
reports concentrate largely on
"events," gradually making
these into a "trend." One
could therefore be forgiven for
believing that West Germany is
a land about to fall under the
domination of hordes of left
wing extremists. But this belief
is also nurtured by the reaction
of West German authorities to
acts of terrorism. Every time
there is another kidnaping,
bombing or hijack, you need
no newspaper to tell you. The
increased number of police on
city streets, on motorways and
at the borders relay the mes
sage loud and clear.
Collar-length hair, beard
and/or glasses, and jeans will
be enough to ensure that
young men are double
checked on the Fahnungsliste,
a three-inch volume listing
political and criminal suspects
which is issued with meticul
ous care to all German border
police. Every country in the
world has an equivalent list,
but nowhere else in Western
Europe is it so frequently in

evidence: every time you cross
the border, every time you are
foolish enough to resemble
the police stereotype of a stu
dent revolutionary.
Here is another example. In
May 1976, 700 police broke up a

peaceful meeting of 500 stu
dents at Munich University.
The students had been granted
official permission by the uni
versity authorities to meet and
discuss planned changes in en
trance requirements and de
gree exams. The police sealed
off all exits to the main univer
sity building, swarmed up
stairs, and took the names and
fingerprints of all 500 students.
The police asserted that the
students had disrupted a lec
ture in order to hold their now
suddenly illegal meeting.
On the next day, no Munich
newspaper questioned the
truth of this fictitious police as
sertion. Some gave the story
sensational play. Protest was
rife amongst the students
falsely portrayed as left wing
radicals. Three weeks after
wards, elections were held for
the two student members of
the university parliament. The
large number of conservative
law and medical students in
Munich usually ensures that
the successful candidates are
members of RCDS, the student
organization attached to the
ultra-conservative Christian
Social Union. That year, one
left-winger and one conserva
tive were elected. Not what the
authorities who sent police
into the university wanted, I

imagine, but a direct consequ
ence of their action.
Marches and protests sub
sequent to the police raid were
co-sponsored by Communist
groups. Anyone who partici
pated ran the risk of being
identified as a Communist

both by police and the
populace as a whole — if you
are seen under a red flag, you
can expect to be treated as
Communist.
This polarization between
right and left is the greatest
threat to West German stabil
ity. Both sides are to blame for
its increase. Those who press
for moderate, non-violent
change in that highly ordered
society are left with no effec
tive voice. Frustrated liberals
often become impatient, angry
left-wingers. And the less frus
trated moderates might
perhaps just as well become
extremists. For that is how
much of the German popula
tion sees them. In Munich I
often heard the word "stu
dent" spat out as if it gave the
speaker a bad taste in the
mouth. He or she quite obvi
ously believed (sometimes
even said) that any student was
a communist hell-bent on de
struction of the system which
gives material security.
If the media in West Ger
many continue to report stu
dent affairs in the way de
scribed above, and to accept
official versions of such events
without question, then popu
larmisunderstandingof the na
ture of student protest is
bound to continue. West Ger

man news reporting is deser
vedly praised for its excellent
foreign coverage, but high
lighting Soviet dissent does no
thing to explain dissent at
home.
Of course I saw Germany
with a student's eye. Students
are not the majority of the
population, and in a democ
racy the will of the majority
rules. One hopes it is the will of
an informed majority. Too little
is written or broadcast about
the Berufsverbot (see Mon
day's opinions page column).
This practice restricts the op
portunities for students to be
employed by the civil service as
teachers or public officials.
And yet, when I asked a group
of 20 German students in Eng
land to help me prepare a
broadcast about Berufsverbot,
only three of them know what I
was talking about. The three
who helped me with that
broadcast, like the author of
the Daily column, wished to
remain anonymous. With good
reason. One teaching assistant
at their university had been
forbidden to continue his work
there because he had spoken
out against the murder of Al
lende and the new Chilean rul
ers, and had supported calls
for lower rents in university
dorms. Both speeches had
been made at student meet
ings four years before the ban.
German intellectuals could
therefore, it seems, be forgi
ven for sitting back and proc
laiming woefully that their soc
iety is moving in the wrong di
rection, but that unfortunately
the majority will not listen to
their words of wisdom. This is
very much the tradition
amongst their intellectual
forebears. Butclingingtoone's
own philosophy in the dogged

belief that it is right does no
thing to stem the dangerous
drift toward extremism. If any
thing, isolation breeds a dis
torted view of society and its
politics. You are one step
nearer withdrawing into the
self-styled terrorist life, believ
ing that the gun will make your
politics work.
A letter from a German
friend last week demonstrated,
however, that liberal intellec
tuals face criticism if they do
speak out. Heinrich 8011, 1972
winner of the Nobel Prize for
Literature, was recently de
nounced as an "intellectual in
stigator of violence," even
though he has never sup
ported the politics and
methods of the terrorists. The
letter contained other omin
ous news. Helmut Kohl, leader
of the parliamentary opposi
tion, nearly won the election
last October with the slogan
"Freedom or socialism?" He
recently demanded that the
Social Democrats in power in
troduce a legal penalty for
"slander of the state." Interest
ingly, this version of "free
dom" is already in operation in
East Cermany — but the con
servative Herr Kohl must surely
be unaware of that.
It all adds up to what two
American political scientists,
Lipset and Raab, have called
the "politics of unreason."
Kohl's demand made me
laugh, it seemed so ridiculous.
But what is happening in West
Germany now is more frighten
ing than amusing. "A man who
laughs/ Has simply not yet
heard/ The terrible news"
wrote Brecht in 1938. The news
from West Germany in 1977
need not be so terrible, if
moderation prevails.
