# The 						Palestinian problem-another view of its history
## 
### 
Despite their improved
standard of living, the Palesti
nian refugees now demand —
and understandably so — their
own homeland. They have
proclaimed themselves a sepa
rate national entity deserving
of a separate nation. It is not
the position of the Israelis or
the world to deny their nation
hood. However, two facts must
be reckoned with: firstly, Israel
too was proclaimed a legiti
mate nation by the U.N. in
1948. The right of the Jewish
people for self-determiniation
is equivalent to the right now
claimed by the Palestinian re
fugees. Secondly, while the
Palestinians do deserve a
homeland of their own, the
P.L.O. most certainly does not.
Israel's adamant refusal to
negotiate with the P L.O. re

gariding the solution of the
Palestinian refugee problem is
understandable when one
examines the record of this ter
rorist organization. Novelist
Leon Uris, in an open letter to
Senator Floyd Haskell of Col-

orado wrote: "The P.L.O. is
emotionally and constitution
ally bound to 'the liquidation
of J ;wish existence in the Mid
dle East'. . . to 'eradicate Israel
from the map.' " Zuheir Muh
sein, head of the pro-Syrian
P.L.O. military organization
As-Saika and head of the P.L.O.
Military Operations Depart

ment, said in a recent inter
view: "The Palestinian posi
tions regarding the recognition
(of Israel) are clear — there will
be no settlement the price of
which is recognition of Israel."
The P.L.O. is a dangerous or-

ganization. The P.L.O. that
wishes to attend the peace
conference in Geneva is the
same P.L.O. that has been re
sponsible for massive hijack
ings of American and European
civil aircraft, assassinations and
massacre after massacre of
total innocents. It is the same
P.L.O. responsible for the

murder of civilians and women
in Israeli fields, as well as
school children by sneak at
tacks on Israel. It is the same
P.L.O. involved in the oblitera
tion of the single Arab democ
racy in Lebanon and in the sys
tematic destruction of the
Christian community there. It
is no wonder that Israel refuses
to sit at a peace table.
What then is the solution to
the problem of the Palestinian
refugees? Firstly, recognition
of Israel's right to exist and a
guarantee of an immediate and
lasting peace by the Arab world
is a necessary prerequisite for
any settlement. Creating a
P.L.0.-headed Palestinian
state in the West Bank or any
territory immediately adjacent
to Israel before such recogni
tion would be equivalent to

committing national suicide by
Israel. Secondly, proper and
appropriate representation of
the Palestinians at Geneva is
necessary. Pseudo
representation by terrorist
P.L.O. members could not
possibly lead to either a long
lasting peace agreement or the
creation of a stable, peaceful
Palestinian state. Lastly, the
recognition by the world at
large that the creation of and
solution to the Palestinian
problem is equally the respon
sibility of both Israel and the
Arab States, is necessary be
fore either Israel or the Arab
States can approach the prob
lem with mutual respect, sin
cerity and a true desire to solve
the problem.
