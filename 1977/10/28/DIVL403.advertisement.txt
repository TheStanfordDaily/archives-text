Outlaws at Frost
The Outlaws headline ASSU Special Event's
Frost Amphitheatre concert, tomorrow at 1
p.m.
Tickets, $5.50 for students, are on sale at
Tresidder Box Office and will be available at
the same price at the door.
Opening the show will be Mistress, the all
star band of Greg Douglas (lead guitarist for
Steve Miller); David Walker (ex-Fleetwood
Mac front man); and David Brown (Boz Scaggs'
bass player).
Country Joe McDonald will follow Mistress
with his popular country-rock music.
The Outlaws climax the show with their di
verse repertoire of rock, country and blue
grass jazz. With three albums and a packed
concert schedule, they are one of America's
fastest-rising music groups.
