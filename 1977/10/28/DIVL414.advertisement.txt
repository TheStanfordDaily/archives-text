Naturally, no one person is going to "solve" the
energy problem singlehandedly; it's going to take a
lot of concerned people, working together, to even
begin to solve the problems of fuel conservation,
wild life preservation, recycling, smog-free rapid
transit fume incineration and water purification.
The thing is... as concerned as we are about these
problems, and others, at PG&E we don't think
"concern" is enough. The concern has to motivate
action. And that's what we're coming to grips with.
Here-and-now, how-to realities.
So, if you're a "how-to" person, a person who's
more than an idealistic abstractionist, there may be
an opportunity for you with us to work toward
solutions to problems that concern you.
Sure, we've got the establishment benefits that
make life a little easier to cope with, like good pay
and employee benefits. But we've also got the
things that make life worth living. Realistic
challenges.
If you're a graduating civil, electrical or
mechanical engineer, and you've never thought
about working for (and/or with) us before,
give us a thought. Send your resume to John
