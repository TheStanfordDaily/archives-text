# Synchrotron radiation lab opens new research areas
## 
### Hardy Iredale 
Dedication ceremonies were held
yesterday for the recently-completed
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory.
George Pimental, deputy director
of the National Science Foundation,
said the new facility "opens up new
areas of research simply not possible
before."
The synchrotron facility directs a
beam of photons off high-energy cir
culating electrons in the SLAC stor
age ring. The resultant beam of light
can be used for a large variety of ex
periments.
Pimental emphasized the "unique
capabilities" gained through the use
of synchrotron radiation. "We can all
be confident that exciting frontiers
will be opened," he said, owing to
the "unusual versatility and poten
tial" of synchrotron research.
The new facilities make possible
innovation in fields ranging from
chemistry to material science. In ad
dition, "it may be that some of the
most novel scientific payoffs from
these facilities will come from kinds
of research not even considered
when they were designed," Pimental
said.
Pimental pointed to a time in the
near future when synchrotron re
search will enable scientists to relate
the structure to the function of
molecules. He added that such re
search should enable biologists to
better understand the role of the en
zyme in living systems.
Synchrotron radiation, according
to Pimental, is now on the verge of
becoming a major research field in
the United States.
A 1976 report by the National Re
search Council predicted an eight

fold increase in the demand for some
types of synchrotron facilities by
1986.
Accordingly, the 1978 budget of
the National Science Foundation and
the Energy Research and Develop
ment Agency provides funding for a
major expansion of the facility here.
"When the current building phase
is completed," Pimental said, "the
United States will have one of the
world's strongest research
capabilities" in this field.
The need for easy access to the
facility was also emphasized. Pimen

tal observed that the new facility
opens up large new areas of re
search. "Consequently, it is ex
tremely important that these power
ful facilities attract and serve the
largest and most diversified user
communities possible," he said.
Andrew Sessler, who spoke as
chairman of the new facility's Sci
ence Policy Board, invoked an old
comment of Disraeli: " 'A university
should be a place for light and liberty
and learning.' Well," observed Ses
sler, "Stanford has long had liberty
and learning; now it will have light!"

communities possible," he said.
Andrew Sessler, who spoke as
chairman of the new facility's Sci
ence Policy Board, invoked an old
comment of Disraeli: " 'A university
should be a place for light and liberty
and learning.' Well," observed Ses
sler, "Stanford has long had liberty
and learning; now it will have light!"

facility will open up new areas of research in fields ranging
from chemistry to material science.
Dedication ceremonies were held
yesterday for the recently-completed
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory.
George Pimental, deputy director
of the National Science Foundation,
said the new facility "opens up new
areas of research simply not possible
before."
The synchrotron facility directs a
beam of photons off high-energy cir
culating electrons in the SLAC stor
age ring. The resultant beam of light
can be used for a large variety of ex
periments.
Pimental emphasized the "unique
capabilities" gained through the use
of synchrotron radiation. "We can all
be confident that exciting frontiers
will be opened," he said, owing to
the "unusual versatility and poten
tial" of synchrotron research.
The new facilities make possible
innovation in fields ranging from
chemistry to material science. In ad
dition, "it may be that some of the
most novel scientific payoffs from
these facilities will come from kinds
of research not even considered
when they were designed," Pimental
said.
Pimental pointed to a time in the
near future when synchrotron re
search will enable scientists to relate
the structure to the function of
molecules. He added that such re
search should enable biologists to
better understand the role of the en
zyme in living systems.
Synchrotron radiation, according
to Pimental, is now on the verge of
becoming a major research field in
the United States.
A 1976 report by the National Re
search Council predicted an eight

fold increase in the demand for some
types of synchrotron facilities by
1986.
Accordingly, the 1978 budget of
the National Science Foundation and
the Energy Research and Develop
ment Agency provides funding for a
major expansion of the facility here.
"When the current building phase
is completed," Pimental said, "the
United States will have one of the
world's strongest research
capabilities" in this field.
The need for easy access to the
facility was also emphasized. Pimen

tal observed that the new facility
opens up large new areas of re
search. "Consequently, it is ex
tremely important that these power
ful facilities attract and serve the
largest and most diversified user
communities possible," he said.
