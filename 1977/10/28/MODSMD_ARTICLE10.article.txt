# Palestinians guilty?
## A 						history of the Palestine problem 
### 
Jean Myers

In his recent article (Daily, Oct.
13), Sami Suleiman claims that the
Palestinian Arabs are innocent vic
tims, paying for the atrocities in
flicted on the Jews by Hitler.
Suleiman has distorted history in two
essential ways.
First of all, a Palestinian Arab was as
guilty as Hitler in the slaughter of six
million Jewish men, women and
children. And secondly, it is the Is
raelis who have been forced to pay,

with their//Ves, for the wrongs which
the Arabs have committed, not only
against the Jews, but also against
their own Arab brothers.
Suleiman conveniently starts tel
ling his own personal version of his
tory in 1922. But if you go back 40
years further to the 1880s, when the
story of modern-day Israel actually
begins, the picture is completely dif
ferent.
The land which was called Pales
tine was a small part of the vast Ot
toman Empire. It was inhabited
primarily by two groups of people; a
community of Jews called the Yishuv
who had remained in their holy land
since the destruction of the Second
Temple 2000 years before, and a
small community of Arabs, mainly
Bedouin nomads.
It is estimated that there were no
more than 150,000 Arabs in the entire
land of Palestine in the early 1880s,
which included all of present-day
Jordan as well as Israel, a total of
45,000 square miles (ref. Turkish cen
sus of 1875; Encyclopedia Britannica,
11th edition, 1910; Alexander Keith's
"The Land of Israel," Edinburgh,
1884).
Desert and swamp
The Palestine of 1880, therefore,
had a population less than half that of
the town of Bakersfield, in an area
the size of the state of Pennsylvania.
It was mostly desolate desert and
swamp. Palestine was considered
"merely a part of southern Syria"
(ref. "The Arab Awakening" by
George Antonius).
It was not until the Jewish pioneers
of the first and second Aliyahs (be
ginning in the early 1880s) purch
ased, reclaimed, and began to culti
vate the untilled lands, that there was
an influx of Arabs from neighboring
lands, lured by the improving condi
tions. Thus, it was the Jewish settle
ment of Palestine that brought about
the improved conditions and Arab
population increases between 1880
and 1920.
On Nov. 2,1917, Britain issued the
Balfour Declaration promising Pales
tine as a homeland for the Jews. On
April 25,1920, after the defeat of the
Ottoman Empire in World War I, the
League of Nations awarded Britain
the Mandate over Palestine.
In 1921, Britain requested of the
League of Nations that Article 25 be
inserted into the Mandate, which
provided that, contrary to the origi
nal Mandate, an area of 35,000 square
miles be severed from the originally

mandated area and designated as a
separate Palestinian Arab state. This
35,000 square miles is today's Jordan,
an independent Arab state encom
passing nearly 80 per cent of Pales
tine.
All Jewish-owned lands in this area
were expropriated without compen
sation, and all Jewish presence oblit
erated. In the scant remaining 10,000
square miles still promised them, the
Jewish settlers continued to reclaim
the swamps and the desert which
they had purchased. While Jewish
immigration was severely limited by
Britain, there were no quotas on
Arab immigration, and the Arab
population, attracted by green fields,
increased to 800,000 by 1929.
Great benefit
The economic and agricultural
progress wrought by the Jewish
settlers, as well as their democratic
ideals, were of great benefit to nearly
everyone — Jew and Arab alike. But
for that tiny group of Arab feudal
landowners, five or six clans in all,
who owned 80 per cent of all Arab
owned land in Palestine, the Zionists
were a threat to their control over the
poor Arab peasants.
Haj Amin el Husseini, who was ap
pointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in
1920 by Britain, was one such feudal
landlord. His overwhelming dream
was to be king of Palestine, and he
saw the Zionist influence on his Arab
"subjects" as a threat to his dream.
So, using his powerful religious posi
tion to manipulate the uneducated
fellahin, he set out to desfroy the
Zionists. It was he who instigated a
series of riots and pogroms against
the Jews in 1922, 1929 and 1933,
which resulted in horrible mas
sacres. He also ordered the assassi
nation of hundreds of Arabs who re
sisted his drive for power, and, ironi
cally, he ended up killing more Arabs
than Jews.
Haj Amin el Husseini was a per
sonal friend of Adolf Hitler — the
great majority of the Arab populace
supported the Nazis. In 1933 Hus
seini entered into secret agreement
with the Nazis,and in 1941 hewentto
Germany. Until 1940 Hitler's policy
regarding the Jews had been, at first,
forced expulsion and extortion; la
ter, ghettoization: upon his arrival in
1941, Husseini used all his influence
to agitate against ghettoization of the
Jews and for their extermination. His
efforts led to the Nazis' final solution
— the planned destruction of the
Jewish race (see Bartley Crum's "Be-

hind the Silken Curtain," pp. 108-
115).
No, the Arabs were not innocent
victims of Hitler's atrocities; rather,
they shared in his guilt.
Palestine Mandate
By the end of World War 11, British
policies in Palestine had caused such
dissent and unrest that, in 1947, Bri
tain handed the Palestine Mandate to
the United Nations for a solution.
The U.N. voted 33 to 13 that the re
maining 20 per cent of Palestine be
further partitioned into a second
Palestinian Arab state and a Jewish
state containing 6000 square miles
out of Palestine's original 45,000. The
Jews accepted the U.N. partition, but
the Arabs, who at that time had
3,487,180 square miles comprising 12
independent nations, refused to
allow the lews their tiny slice of ter
ritory hardly larger than Connec
ticut.
In 1948, the combined armies of
Syria, Egypt, Transjordan, Lebanon
and Iraq, invaded the newly
proclaimed, U.N. sanctioned State of
Israel, with the stated intent of driv
ing the Jews into the sea. It was this
Arab attack which caused many
Arabs to leave their homes. The Oc
tober 12, 1963 Cairo daily, Akhbar
el-Yom, recorded:
"15 May 1948 arrived ... on that
very day the Mufti of Jerusalem ap
pealed to the Arabs of Palestine to
leave the country . . . because the
Arab armies were about to enter and
fight in their stead against the Jews
and oust them from Palestine." The
Israelis made every effort to per
suade the Arabs to remain.
West bank
When the 1948 war ended, Jordan
had illegally occupied and later an
nexed the West Bank which was to
have been part of the Second Arab
Palestinian State. (This annexation
has never been recognized by any
country other than Britain and Pakis
tan.) Likewise, Egypt occupied the
Gaza Strip.
From 1948 until 1967, when these
territories were in Arab hands, no at
tempt was made to establish a Pales
tinian Arab state on the West Bank.
Instead, those Arabs who had left
their homes were herded into re
fugee camps and kept there — by
their fellow Arabs — in squalid con
ditions for 20 years, used as political
pawns in the war against Israel. In
contrast, 650,000 of the Jewish re
fugees who were driven, destitute,
from their homes in Arab lands after
1948, fled to Israel and were all as
similated and integrated into the tiny
struggling new state.
In the years 1948 to 1973 the Arabs
instigated four wars against Israel,
each time under the banner of Jihad,
or holy war, and with the stated pur
pose of annihilating the Jewish state.
Israel has never expanded its borders
one inch except when defending it
self against wars of extermination.
The Arabs cannot be merely seek
ing a return to the pre-1967 borders;
if that were the case they would
never have instigated the 1967 war.
They cannot be seeking a Palestinian
Arab State, for there already exists
one — Jordan — where Palestinian
Arabs have full citizenship rights.
They cannot even be seeking a sec
ond Palestinian state on the West
Bank; they never made a move to
establish one in 1948 when it was of
fered to them by the U.N., nor were
there are attempts made from 1948
until 1967, when the West Bank was
in Arab hands. They are seeking one
thing only — the complete destruc
tion of the State of Israel.

It is indeed sad that the Palestinian
Arab refugees were held prisoners in
the oil-rich Arab lands by their own
brothers — simply as pawns in the
game of Israel's extermination. The
Israelis have compassion for these
people and have always been willing
to talk with them and work with them
— as long as they can speak to a
group whose covenant does not in
clude the intent to destroy Israel. The
Israelis have been victims too many
times, and they cannot afford to
commit suicide to "right" the wrongs
which the Arabs committed against
their fellow Arabs, as well as the
Jews.
Suleiman claims that "next year in
Jerusalem" is now the slogan for the
Palestinian Arabs. For 2000 years,
Jews prayed that they could spend
"next year in Jerusalem." From 1948
to 1967, when Jerusalem was in Jor
danian hands, no Jew could enter the
Old City to visit his holy sites or his
family's graves. But since 1967,
Jerusalem is an open city for all
faiths. For the first time, Moslems,
Christians, and Jews can all spend
"this year in Jerusalem."

In his recent article (Daily, Oct.
13), Sami Suleiman claims that the
Palestinian Arabs are innocent vic
tims, paying for the atrocities in
flicted on the Jews by Hitler.
Suleiman has distorted history in two
essential ways.
First of all, a Palestinian Arab was as
guilty as Hitler in the slaughter of six
million Jewish men, women and
children. And secondly, it is the Is
raelis who have been forced to pay,

with their//Ves, for the wrongs which
the Arabs have committed, not only
against the Jews, but also against
their own Arab brothers.
Suleiman conveniently starts tel
ling his own personal version of his
tory in 1922. But if you go back 40
years further to the 1880s, when the
story of modern-day Israel actually
begins, the picture is completely dif
ferent.
The land which was called Pales
tine was a small part of the vast Ot
toman Empire. It was inhabited
primarily by two groups of people; a
community of Jews called the Yishuv
who had remained in their holy land
since the destruction of the Second
Temple 2000 years before, and a
small community of Arabs, mainly
Bedouin nomads.
It is estimated that there were no
more than 150,000 Arabs in the entire
land of Palestine in the early 1880s,
which included all of present-day
Jordan as well as Israel, a total of
45,000 square miles (ref. Turkish cen
sus of 1875; Encyclopedia Britannica,
11th edition, 1910; Alexander Keith's
"The Land of Israel," Edinburgh,
1884).
Desert and swamp
The Palestine of 1880, therefore,
had a population less than half that of
the town of Bakersfield, in an area
the size of the state of Pennsylvania.
It was mostly desolate desert and
swamp. Palestine was considered
"merely a part of southern Syria"
(ref. "The Arab Awakening" by
George Antonius).
It was not until the Jewish pioneers
of the first and second Aliyahs (be
ginning in the early 1880s) purch
ased, reclaimed, and began to culti
vate the untilled lands, that there was
an influx of Arabs from neighboring
lands, lured by the improving condi
tions. Thus, it was the Jewish settle
ment of Palestine that brought about
the improved conditions and Arab
population increases between 1880
and 1920.
On Nov. 2,1917, Britain issued the
Balfour Declaration promising Pales
tine as a homeland for the Jews. On
April 25,1920, after the defeat of the
Ottoman Empire in World War I, the
League of Nations awarded Britain
the Mandate over Palestine.
In 1921, Britain requested of the
League of Nations that Article 25 be
inserted into the Mandate, which
provided that, contrary to the origi
nal Mandate, an area of 35,000 square
miles be severed from the originally

mandated area and designated as a
separate Palestinian Arab state. This
35,000 square miles is today's Jordan,
an independent Arab state encom
passing nearly 80 per cent of Pales
tine.
All Jewish-owned lands in this area
were expropriated without compen
sation, and all Jewish presence oblit
erated. In the scant remaining 10,000
square miles still promised them, the
Jewish settlers continued to reclaim
the swamps and the desert which
they had purchased. While Jewish
immigration was severely limited by
Britain, there were no quotas on
Arab immigration, and the Arab
population, attracted by green fields,
increased to 800,000 by 1929.
Great benefit
The economic and agricultural
progress wrought by the Jewish
settlers, as well as their democratic
ideals, were of great benefit to nearly
everyone — Jew and Arab alike. But
for that tiny group of Arab feudal
landowners, five or six clans in all,
who owned 80 per cent of all Arab
owned land in Palestine, the Zionists
were a threat to their control over the
poor Arab peasants.
Haj Amin el Husseini, who was ap
pointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in
1920 by Britain, was one such feudal
landlord. His overwhelming dream
was to be king of Palestine, and he
saw the Zionist influence on his Arab
"subjects" as a threat to his dream.
So, using his powerful religious posi
tion to manipulate the uneducated
fellahin, he set out to desfroy the
Zionists. It was he who instigated a
series of riots and pogroms against
the Jews in 1922, 1929 and 1933,
which resulted in horrible mas
sacres. He also ordered the assassi
nation of hundreds of Arabs who re
sisted his drive for power, and, ironi
cally, he ended up killing more Arabs
than Jews.
Haj Amin el Husseini was a per
sonal friend of Adolf Hitler — the
great majority of the Arab populace
supported the Nazis. In 1933 Hus
seini entered into secret agreement
with the Nazis,and in 1941 hewentto
Germany. Until 1940 Hitler's policy
regarding the Jews had been, at first,
forced expulsion and extortion; la
ter, ghettoization: upon his arrival in
1941, Husseini used all his influence
to agitate against ghettoization of the
Jews and for their extermination. His
efforts led to the Nazis' final solution
— the planned destruction of the
Jewish race (see Bartley Crum's "Be-

hind the Silken Curtain," pp. 108-
115).
No, the Arabs were not innocent
victims of Hitler's atrocities; rather,
they shared in his guilt.
Palestine Mandate
By the end of World War 11, British
policies in Palestine had caused such
dissent and unrest that, in 1947, Bri
tain handed the Palestine Mandate to
the United Nations for a solution.
The U.N. voted 33 to 13 that the re
maining 20 per cent of Palestine be
further partitioned into a second
Palestinian Arab state and a Jewish
state containing 6000 square miles
out of Palestine's original 45,000. The
Jews accepted the U.N. partition, but
the Arabs, who at that time had
3,487,180 square miles comprising 12
independent nations, refused to
allow the lews their tiny slice of ter
ritory hardly larger than Connec
ticut.
In 1948, the combined armies of
Syria, Egypt, Transjordan, Lebanon
and Iraq, invaded the newly
proclaimed, U.N. sanctioned State of
Israel, with the stated intent of driv
ing the Jews into the sea. It was this
Arab attack which caused many
Arabs to leave their homes. The Oc
tober 12, 1963 Cairo daily, Akhbar
el-Yom, recorded:
"15 May 1948 arrived ... on that
very day the Mufti of Jerusalem ap
pealed to the Arabs of Palestine to
leave the country . . . because the
Arab armies were about to enter and
fight in their stead against the Jews
and oust them from Palestine." The
Israelis made every effort to per
suade the Arabs to remain.
West bank
When the 1948 war ended, Jordan
had illegally occupied and later an
nexed the West Bank which was to
have been part of the Second Arab
Palestinian State. (This annexation
has never been recognized by any
country other than Britain and Pakis
tan.) Likewise, Egypt occupied the
Gaza Strip.
From 1948 until 1967, when these
territories were in Arab hands, no at
tempt was made to establish a Pales
tinian Arab state on the West Bank.
Instead, those Arabs who had left
their homes were herded into re
fugee camps and kept there — by
their fellow Arabs — in squalid con
ditions for 20 years, used as political
pawns in the war against Israel. In
contrast, 650,000 of the Jewish re
fugees who were driven, destitute,
from their homes in Arab lands after
1948, fled to Israel and were all as
similated and integrated into the tiny
struggling new state.
In the years 1948 to 1973 the Arabs
instigated four wars against Israel,
each time under the banner of Jihad,
or holy war, and with the stated pur
pose of annihilating the Jewish state.
Israel has never expanded its borders
one inch except when defending it
self against wars of extermination.
The Arabs cannot be merely seek
ing a return to the pre-1967 borders;
if that were the case they would
never have instigated the 1967 war.
They cannot be seeking a Palestinian
Arab State, for there already exists
one — Jordan — where Palestinian
Arabs have full citizenship rights.
They cannot even be seeking a sec
ond Palestinian state on the West
Bank; they never made a move to
establish one in 1948 when it was of
fered to them by the U.N., nor were
there are attempts made from 1948
until 1967, when the West Bank was
in Arab hands. They are seeking one
thing only — the complete destruc
tion of the State of Israel.

It is indeed sad that the Palestinian
Arab refugees were held prisoners in
the oil-rich Arab lands by their own
brothers — simply as pawns in the
game of Israel's extermination. The
Israelis have compassion for these
people and have always been willing
to talk with them and work with them
— as long as they can speak to a
group whose covenant does not in
clude the intent to destroy Israel. The
Israelis have been victims too many
times, and they cannot afford to
commit suicide to "right" the wrongs
which the Arabs committed against
their fellow Arabs, as well as the
Jews.
Suleiman claims that "next year in
Jerusalem" is now the slogan for the
Palestinian Arabs. For 2000 years,
Jews prayed that they could spend
"next year in Jerusalem." From 1948
to 1967, when Jerusalem was in Jor
danian hands, no Jew could enter the
Old City to visit his holy sites or his
family's graves. But since 1967,
Jerusalem is an open city for all

Suleiman claims that "next year in
Jerusalem" is now the slogan for the
Palestinian Arabs. For 2000 years,
Jews prayed that they could spend
"next year in Jerusalem." From 1948
to 1967, when Jerusalem was in Jor
danian hands, no Jew could enter the
Old City to visit his holy sites or his
family's graves. But since 1967,
Jerusalem is an open city for all
faiths. For the first time, Moslems,
Christians, and Jews can all spend
"this year in Jerusalem."

In his recent article (Daily, Oct.
13), Sami Suleiman claims that the
Palestinian Arabs are innocent vic
tims, paying for the atrocities in
flicted on the Jews by Hitler.
Suleiman has distorted history in two
essential ways.
First of all, a Palestinian Arab was as
guilty as Hitler in the slaughter of six
million Jewish men, women and
children. And secondly, it is the Is
raelis who have been forced to pay,

with their//Ves, for the wrongs which
the Arabs have committed, not only
against the Jews, but also against
their own Arab brothers.
Suleiman conveniently starts tel
ling his own personal version of his
tory in 1922. But if you go back 40
years further to the 1880s, when the
story of modern-day Israel actually
begins, the picture is completely dif
ferent.
The land which was called Pales
tine was a small part of the vast Ot
toman Empire. It was inhabited
primarily by two groups of people; a
community of Jews called the Yishuv
who had remained in their holy land
since the destruction of the Second
Temple 2000 years before, and a
small community of Arabs, mainly
Bedouin nomads.
It is estimated that there were no
more than 150,000 Arabs in the entire
land of Palestine in the early 1880s,
which included all of present-day
Jordan as well as Israel, a total of
45,000 square miles (ref. Turkish cen
sus of 1875; Encyclopedia Britannica,
11th edition, 1910; Alexander Keith's
"The Land of Israel," Edinburgh,
1884).
Desert and swamp
The Palestine of 1880, therefore,
had a population less than half that of
the town of Bakersfield, in an area
the size of the state of Pennsylvania.
It was mostly desolate desert and
swamp. Palestine was considered
"merely a part of southern Syria"
(ref. "The Arab Awakening" by
George Antonius).
It was not until the Jewish pioneers
of the first and second Aliyahs (be
ginning in the early 1880s) purch
ased, reclaimed, and began to culti
vate the untilled lands, that there was
an influx of Arabs from neighboring
lands, lured by the improving condi
tions. Thus, it was the Jewish settle
ment of Palestine that brought about
the improved conditions and Arab
population increases between 1880
and 1920.
On Nov. 2,1917, Britain issued the
Balfour Declaration promising Pales
tine as a homeland for the Jews. On
April 25,1920, after the defeat of the
Ottoman Empire in World War I, the
League of Nations awarded Britain
the Mandate over Palestine.
In 1921, Britain requested of the
League of Nations that Article 25 be
inserted into the Mandate, which
provided that, contrary to the origi
nal Mandate, an area of 35,000 square
miles be severed from the originally

mandated area and designated as a
separate Palestinian Arab state. This
35,000 square miles is today's Jordan,
an independent Arab state encom
passing nearly 80 per cent of Pales
tine.
All Jewish-owned lands in this area
were expropriated without compen
sation, and all Jewish presence oblit
erated. In the scant remaining 10,000
square miles still promised them, the
Jewish settlers continued to reclaim
the swamps and the desert which
they had purchased. While Jewish
immigration was severely limited by
Britain, there were no quotas on
Arab immigration, and the Arab
population, attracted by green fields,
increased to 800,000 by 1929.
Great benefit
The economic and agricultural
progress wrought by the Jewish
settlers, as well as their democratic
ideals, were of great benefit to nearly
everyone — Jew and Arab alike. But
for that tiny group of Arab feudal
landowners, five or six clans in all,
who owned 80 per cent of all Arab
owned land in Palestine, the Zionists
were a threat to their control over the
poor Arab peasants.
Haj Amin el Husseini, who was ap
pointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in
1920 by Britain, was one such feudal
landlord. His overwhelming dream
was to be king of Palestine, and he
saw the Zionist influence on his Arab
"subjects" as a threat to his dream.
So, using his powerful religious posi
tion to manipulate the uneducated
fellahin, he set out to desfroy the
Zionists. It was he who instigated a
series of riots and pogroms against
the Jews in 1922, 1929 and 1933,
which resulted in horrible mas
sacres. He also ordered the assassi
nation of hundreds of Arabs who re
sisted his drive for power, and, ironi
cally, he ended up killing more Arabs
than Jews.
Haj Amin el Husseini was a per
sonal friend of Adolf Hitler — the
great majority of the Arab populace
supported the Nazis. In 1933 Hus
seini entered into secret agreement
with the Nazis,and in 1941 hewentto
Germany. Until 1940 Hitler's policy
regarding the Jews had been, at first,
forced expulsion and extortion; la
ter, ghettoization: upon his arrival in
1941, Husseini used all his influence
to agitate against ghettoization of the
Jews and for their extermination. His
efforts led to the Nazis' final solution
— the planned destruction of the
Jewish race (see Bartley Crum's "Be-

hind the Silken Curtain," pp. 108-
115).
No, the Arabs were not innocent
victims of Hitler's atrocities; rather,
they shared in his guilt.
Palestine Mandate
By the end of World War 11, British
policies in Palestine had caused such
dissent and unrest that, in 1947, Bri
tain handed the Palestine Mandate to
the United Nations for a solution.
The U.N. voted 33 to 13 that the re
maining 20 per cent of Palestine be
further partitioned into a second
Palestinian Arab state and a Jewish
state containing 6000 square miles
out of Palestine's original 45,000. The
Jews accepted the U.N. partition, but
the Arabs, who at that time had
3,487,180 square miles comprising 12
independent nations, refused to
allow the lews their tiny slice of ter
ritory hardly larger than Connec
ticut.
In 1948, the combined armies of
Syria, Egypt, Transjordan, Lebanon
and Iraq, invaded the newly
proclaimed, U.N. sanctioned State of
Israel, with the stated intent of driv
ing the Jews into the sea. It was this
Arab attack which caused many
Arabs to leave their homes. The Oc
tober 12, 1963 Cairo daily, Akhbar
el-Yom, recorded:
"15 May 1948 arrived ... on that
very day the Mufti of Jerusalem ap
pealed to the Arabs of Palestine to
leave the country . . . because the
Arab armies were about to enter and
fight in their stead against the Jews
and oust them from Palestine." The
Israelis made every effort to per
suade the Arabs to remain.
West bank
When the 1948 war ended, Jordan
had illegally occupied and later an
nexed the West Bank which was to
have been part of the Second Arab
Palestinian State. (This annexation
has never been recognized by any
country other than Britain and Pakis
tan.) Likewise, Egypt occupied the
Gaza Strip.
From 1948 until 1967, when these
territories were in Arab hands, no at
tempt was made to establish a Pales
tinian Arab state on the West Bank.
Instead, those Arabs who had left
their homes were herded into re
fugee camps and kept there — by
their fellow Arabs — in squalid con
ditions for 20 years, used as political
pawns in the war against Israel. In
contrast, 650,000 of the Jewish re
fugees who were driven, destitute,
from their homes in Arab lands after
1948, fled to Israel and were all as
similated and integrated into the tiny
struggling new state.
In the years 1948 to 1973 the Arabs
instigated four wars against Israel,
each time under the banner of Jihad,
or holy war, and with the stated pur
pose of annihilating the Jewish state.
Israel has never expanded its borders
one inch except when defending it
self against wars of extermination.
The Arabs cannot be merely seek
ing a return to the pre-1967 borders;
if that were the case they would
never have instigated the 1967 war.
They cannot be seeking a Palestinian
Arab State, for there already exists
one — Jordan — where Palestinian
Arabs have full citizenship rights.
They cannot even be seeking a sec
ond Palestinian state on the West
Bank; they never made a move to
establish one in 1948 when it was of
fered to them by the U.N., nor were
there are attempts made from 1948
until 1967, when the West Bank was
in Arab hands. They are seeking one
thing only — the complete destruc
tion of the State of Israel.

It is indeed sad that the Palestinian
Arab refugees were held prisoners in
the oil-rich Arab lands by their own
brothers — simply as pawns in the
game of Israel's extermination. The
Israelis have compassion for these
people and have always been willing
to talk with them and work with them
— as long as they can speak to a
group whose covenant does not in
clude the intent to destroy Israel. The
Israelis have been victims too many
times, and they cannot afford to
commit suicide to "right" the wrongs
which the Arabs committed against
their fellow Arabs, as well as the
Jews.
Suleiman claims that "next year in
Jerusalem" is now the slogan for the
Palestinian Arabs. For 2000 years,
Jews prayed that they could spend

group whose covenant does not in
clude the intent to destroy Israel. The
Israelis have been victims too many
times, and they cannot afford to
commit suicide to "right" the wrongs
which the Arabs committed against
their fellow Arabs, as well as the
Jews.
Suleiman claims that "next year in
Jerusalem" is now the slogan for the
Palestinian Arabs. For 2000 years,
Jews prayed that they could spend
"next year in Jerusalem." From 1948
to 1967, when Jerusalem was in Jor
danian hands, no Jew could enter the
Old City to visit his holy sites or his
family's graves. But since 1967,
Jerusalem is an open city for all
faiths. For the first time, Moslems,
Christians, and Jews can all spend
"this year in Jerusalem."

In his recent article (Daily, Oct.
13), Sami Suleiman claims that the
Palestinian Arabs are innocent vic
tims, paying for the atrocities in
flicted on the Jews by Hitler.
Suleiman has distorted history in two
essential ways.
First of all, a Palestinian Arab was as
guilty as Hitler in the slaughter of six
million Jewish men, women and
children. And secondly, it is the Is
raelis who have been forced to pay,

with their//Ves, for the wrongs which
the Arabs have committed, not only
against the Jews, but also against
their own Arab brothers.
Suleiman conveniently starts tel
ling his own personal version of his
tory in 1922. But if you go back 40
years further to the 1880s, when the
story of modern-day Israel actually
begins, the picture is completely dif
ferent.
The land which was called Pales
tine was a small part of the vast Ot
toman Empire. It was inhabited
primarily by two groups of people; a
community of Jews called the Yishuv
who had remained in their holy land
since the destruction of the Second
Temple 2000 years before, and a
small community of Arabs, mainly
Bedouin nomads.
It is estimated that there were no
more than 150,000 Arabs in the entire
land of Palestine in the early 1880s,
which included all of present-day
Jordan as well as Israel, a total of
45,000 square miles (ref. Turkish cen
sus of 1875; Encyclopedia Britannica,
11th edition, 1910; Alexander Keith's
"The Land of Israel," Edinburgh,
1884).
Desert and swamp
The Palestine of 1880, therefore,
had a population less than half that of
the town of Bakersfield, in an area
the size of the state of Pennsylvania.
It was mostly desolate desert and
swamp. Palestine was considered
"merely a part of southern Syria"
(ref. "The Arab Awakening" by
George Antonius).
It was not until the Jewish pioneers
of the first and second Aliyahs (be
ginning in the early 1880s) purch
ased, reclaimed, and began to culti
vate the untilled lands, that there was
an influx of Arabs from neighboring
lands, lured by the improving condi
tions. Thus, it was the Jewish settle
ment of Palestine that brought about
the improved conditions and Arab
population increases between 1880
and 1920.
On Nov. 2,1917, Britain issued the
Balfour Declaration promising Pales
tine as a homeland for the Jews. On
April 25,1920, after the defeat of the
Ottoman Empire in World War I, the
League of Nations awarded Britain
the Mandate over Palestine.
In 1921, Britain requested of the
League of Nations that Article 25 be
inserted into the Mandate, which
provided that, contrary to the origi
nal Mandate, an area of 35,000 square
miles be severed from the originally

mandated area and designated as a
separate Palestinian Arab state. This
35,000 square miles is today's Jordan,
an independent Arab state encom
passing nearly 80 per cent of Pales
tine.
All Jewish-owned lands in this area
were expropriated without compen
sation, and all Jewish presence oblit
erated. In the scant remaining 10,000
square miles still promised them, the
Jewish settlers continued to reclaim
the swamps and the desert which
they had purchased. While Jewish
immigration was severely limited by
Britain, there were no quotas on
Arab immigration, and the Arab
population, attracted by green fields,
increased to 800,000 by 1929.
Great benefit
The economic and agricultural
progress wrought by the Jewish
settlers, as well as their democratic
ideals, were of great benefit to nearly
everyone — Jew and Arab alike. But
for that tiny group of Arab feudal
landowners, five or six clans in all,
who owned 80 per cent of all Arab
owned land in Palestine, the Zionists
were a threat to their control over the
poor Arab peasants.
Haj Amin el Husseini, who was ap
pointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in
1920 by Britain, was one such feudal
landlord. His overwhelming dream
was to be king of Palestine, and he
saw the Zionist influence on his Arab
"subjects" as a threat to his dream.
So, using his powerful religious posi
tion to manipulate the uneducated
fellahin, he set out to desfroy the
Zionists. It was he who instigated a
series of riots and pogroms against
the Jews in 1922, 1929 and 1933,
which resulted in horrible mas
sacres. He also ordered the assassi
nation of hundreds of Arabs who re
sisted his drive for power, and, ironi
cally, he ended up killing more Arabs
than Jews.
Haj Amin el Husseini was a per
sonal friend of Adolf Hitler — the
great majority of the Arab populace
supported the Nazis. In 1933 Hus
seini entered into secret agreement
with the Nazis,and in 1941 hewentto
Germany. Until 1940 Hitler's policy
regarding the Jews had been, at first,
forced expulsion and extortion; la
ter, ghettoization: upon his arrival in
1941, Husseini used all his influence
to agitate against ghettoization of the
Jews and for their extermination. His
efforts led to the Nazis' final solution
— the planned destruction of the
Jewish race (see Bartley Crum's "Be-

hind the Silken Curtain," pp. 108-
115).
No, the Arabs were not innocent
victims of Hitler's atrocities; rather,
they shared in his guilt.
Palestine Mandate
By the end of World War 11, British
policies in Palestine had caused such
dissent and unrest that, in 1947, Bri
tain handed the Palestine Mandate to
the United Nations for a solution.
The U.N. voted 33 to 13 that the re
maining 20 per cent of Palestine be
further partitioned into a second
Palestinian Arab state and a Jewish
state containing 6000 square miles
out of Palestine's original 45,000. The
Jews accepted the U.N. partition, but
the Arabs, who at that time had
3,487,180 square miles comprising 12
independent nations, refused to
allow the lews their tiny slice of ter
ritory hardly larger than Connec
ticut.
In 1948, the combined armies of
Syria, Egypt, Transjordan, Lebanon
and Iraq, invaded the newly
proclaimed, U.N. sanctioned State of
Israel, with the stated intent of driv
ing the Jews into the sea. It was this
Arab attack which caused many
Arabs to leave their homes. The Oc
tober 12, 1963 Cairo daily, Akhbar
el-Yom, recorded:
"15 May 1948 arrived ... on that
very day the Mufti of Jerusalem ap
pealed to the Arabs of Palestine to
leave the country . . . because the
Arab armies were about to enter and
fight in their stead against the Jews
and oust them from Palestine." The
Israelis made every effort to per
suade the Arabs to remain.
West bank
When the 1948 war ended, Jordan
had illegally occupied and later an
nexed the West Bank which was to
have been part of the Second Arab
Palestinian State. (This annexation
has never been recognized by any
country other than Britain and Pakis
tan.) Likewise, Egypt occupied the
Gaza Strip.
From 1948 until 1967, when these
territories were in Arab hands, no at
tempt was made to establish a Pales
tinian Arab state on the West Bank.
Instead, those Arabs who had left
their homes were herded into re
fugee camps and kept there — by
their fellow Arabs — in squalid con
ditions for 20 years, used as political
pawns in the war against Israel. In
contrast, 650,000 of the Jewish re
fugees who were driven, destitute,
from their homes in Arab lands after
1948, fled to Israel and were all as
similated and integrated into the tiny
struggling new state.
In the years 1948 to 1973 the Arabs
instigated four wars against Israel,
each time under the banner of Jihad,
or holy war, and with the stated pur
pose of annihilating the Jewish state.
Israel has never expanded its borders
one inch except when defending it
self against wars of extermination.
The Arabs cannot be merely seek
ing a return to the pre-1967 borders;
if that were the case they would
never have instigated the 1967 war.
They cannot be seeking a Palestinian
Arab State, for there already exists
one — Jordan — where Palestinian
Arabs have full citizenship rights.
They cannot even be seeking a sec
ond Palestinian state on the West
Bank; they never made a move to
establish one in 1948 when it was of
fered to them by the U.N., nor were
there are attempts made from 1948
until 1967, when the West Bank was
in Arab hands. They are seeking one
thing only — the complete destruc
tion of the State of Israel.

It is indeed sad that the Palestinian
Arab refugees were held prisoners in
the oil-rich Arab lands by their own
brothers — simply as pawns in the
game of Israel's extermination. The
Israelis have compassion for these
people and have always been willing
to talk with them and work with them
— as long as they can speak to a
group whose covenant does not in
clude the intent to destroy Israel. The
Israelis have been victims too many

Arab refugees were held prisoners in
the oil-rich Arab lands by their own
brothers — simply as pawns in the
game of Israel's extermination. The
Israelis have compassion for these
people and have always been willing
to talk with them and work with them
— as long as they can speak to a
group whose covenant does not in
clude the intent to destroy Israel. The
Israelis have been victims too many
times, and they cannot afford to
commit suicide to "right" the wrongs
which the Arabs committed against
their fellow Arabs, as well as the
Jews.
Suleiman claims that "next year in
Jerusalem" is now the slogan for the
Palestinian Arabs. For 2000 years,
Jews prayed that they could spend
"next year in Jerusalem." From 1948
to 1967, when Jerusalem was in Jor
danian hands, no Jew could enter the
Old City to visit his holy sites or his
family's graves. But since 1967,
Jerusalem is an open city for all
faiths. For the first time, Moslems,
Christians, and Jews can all spend
"this year in Jerusalem."

In his recent article (Daily, Oct.
13), Sami Suleiman claims that the
Palestinian Arabs are innocent vic
tims, paying for the atrocities in
flicted on the Jews by Hitler.
Suleiman has distorted history in two
essential ways.
First of all, a Palestinian Arab was as
guilty as Hitler in the slaughter of six
million Jewish men, women and
children. And secondly, it is the Is
raelis who have been forced to pay,

with their//Ves, for the wrongs which
the Arabs have committed, not only
against the Jews, but also against
their own Arab brothers.
Suleiman conveniently starts tel
ling his own personal version of his
tory in 1922. But if you go back 40
years further to the 1880s, when the
story of modern-day Israel actually
begins, the picture is completely dif
ferent.
The land which was called Pales
tine was a small part of the vast Ot
toman Empire. It was inhabited
primarily by two groups of people; a
community of Jews called the Yishuv
who had remained in their holy land
since the destruction of the Second
Temple 2000 years before, and a
small community of Arabs, mainly
Bedouin nomads.
It is estimated that there were no
more than 150,000 Arabs in the entire
land of Palestine in the early 1880s,
which included all of present-day
Jordan as well as Israel, a total of
45,000 square miles (ref. Turkish cen
sus of 1875; Encyclopedia Britannica,
11th edition, 1910; Alexander Keith's
"The Land of Israel," Edinburgh,
1884).
Desert and swamp
The Palestine of 1880, therefore,
had a population less than half that of
the town of Bakersfield, in an area
the size of the state of Pennsylvania.
It was mostly desolate desert and
swamp. Palestine was considered
"merely a part of southern Syria"
(ref. "The Arab Awakening" by
George Antonius).
It was not until the Jewish pioneers
of the first and second Aliyahs (be
ginning in the early 1880s) purch
ased, reclaimed, and began to culti
vate the untilled lands, that there was
an influx of Arabs from neighboring
lands, lured by the improving condi
tions. Thus, it was the Jewish settle
ment of Palestine that brought about
the improved conditions and Arab
population increases between 1880
and 1920.
On Nov. 2,1917, Britain issued the
Balfour Declaration promising Pales
tine as a homeland for the Jews. On
April 25,1920, after the defeat of the
Ottoman Empire in World War I, the
League of Nations awarded Britain
the Mandate over Palestine.
In 1921, Britain requested of the
League of Nations that Article 25 be
inserted into the Mandate, which
provided that, contrary to the origi
nal Mandate, an area of 35,000 square
miles be severed from the originally

mandated area and designated as a
separate Palestinian Arab state. This
35,000 square miles is today's Jordan,
an independent Arab state encom
passing nearly 80 per cent of Pales
tine.
All Jewish-owned lands in this area
were expropriated without compen
sation, and all Jewish presence oblit
erated. In the scant remaining 10,000
square miles still promised them, the
Jewish settlers continued to reclaim
the swamps and the desert which
they had purchased. While Jewish
immigration was severely limited by
Britain, there were no quotas on
Arab immigration, and the Arab
population, attracted by green fields,
increased to 800,000 by 1929.
Great benefit
The economic and agricultural
progress wrought by the Jewish
settlers, as well as their democratic
ideals, were of great benefit to nearly
everyone — Jew and Arab alike. But
for that tiny group of Arab feudal
landowners, five or six clans in all,
who owned 80 per cent of all Arab
owned land in Palestine, the Zionists
were a threat to their control over the
poor Arab peasants.
Haj Amin el Husseini, who was ap
pointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in
1920 by Britain, was one such feudal
landlord. His overwhelming dream
was to be king of Palestine, and he
saw the Zionist influence on his Arab
"subjects" as a threat to his dream.
So, using his powerful religious posi
tion to manipulate the uneducated
fellahin, he set out to desfroy the
Zionists. It was he who instigated a
series of riots and pogroms against
the Jews in 1922, 1929 and 1933,
which resulted in horrible mas
sacres. He also ordered the assassi
nation of hundreds of Arabs who re
sisted his drive for power, and, ironi
cally, he ended up killing more Arabs
than Jews.
Haj Amin el Husseini was a per
sonal friend of Adolf Hitler — the
great majority of the Arab populace
supported the Nazis. In 1933 Hus
seini entered into secret agreement
with the Nazis,and in 1941 hewentto
Germany. Until 1940 Hitler's policy
regarding the Jews had been, at first,
forced expulsion and extortion; la
ter, ghettoization: upon his arrival in
1941, Husseini used all his influence
to agitate against ghettoization of the
Jews and for their extermination. His
efforts led to the Nazis' final solution
— the planned destruction of the
Jewish race (see Bartley Crum's "Be-

hind the Silken Curtain," pp. 108-
115).
No, the Arabs were not innocent
victims of Hitler's atrocities; rather,
they shared in his guilt.
Palestine Mandate
By the end of World War 11, British
policies in Palestine had caused such
dissent and unrest that, in 1947, Bri
tain handed the Palestine Mandate to
the United Nations for a solution.
The U.N. voted 33 to 13 that the re
maining 20 per cent of Palestine be
further partitioned into a second
Palestinian Arab state and a Jewish
state containing 6000 square miles
out of Palestine's original 45,000. The
Jews accepted the U.N. partition, but
the Arabs, who at that time had
3,487,180 square miles comprising 12
independent nations, refused to
allow the lews their tiny slice of ter
ritory hardly larger than Connec
ticut.
In 1948, the combined armies of
Syria, Egypt, Transjordan, Lebanon
and Iraq, invaded the newly
proclaimed, U.N. sanctioned State of
Israel, with the stated intent of driv
ing the Jews into the sea. It was this
Arab attack which caused many
Arabs to leave their homes. The Oc
tober 12, 1963 Cairo daily, Akhbar
el-Yom, recorded:
"15 May 1948 arrived ... on that
very day the Mufti of Jerusalem ap
pealed to the Arabs of Palestine to
leave the country . . . because the
Arab armies were about to enter and
fight in their stead against the Jews
and oust them from Palestine." The
Israelis made every effort to per
suade the Arabs to remain.
West bank
When the 1948 war ended, Jordan
had illegally occupied and later an
nexed the West Bank which was to
have been part of the Second Arab
Palestinian State. (This annexation
has never been recognized by any
country other than Britain and Pakis
tan.) Likewise, Egypt occupied the
Gaza Strip.
From 1948 until 1967, when these
territories were in Arab hands, no at
tempt was made to establish a Pales
tinian Arab state on the West Bank.
Instead, those Arabs who had left
their homes were herded into re
fugee camps and kept there — by
their fellow Arabs — in squalid con
ditions for 20 years, used as political
pawns in the war against Israel. In
contrast, 650,000 of the Jewish re
fugees who were driven, destitute,
from their homes in Arab lands after
1948, fled to Israel and were all as
similated and integrated into the tiny
struggling new state.
In the years 1948 to 1973 the Arabs
instigated four wars against Israel,
each time under the banner of Jihad,
or holy war, and with the stated pur
pose of annihilating the Jewish state.
Israel has never expanded its borders
one inch except when defending it
self against wars of extermination.
The Arabs cannot be merely seek
ing a return to the pre-1967 borders;
if that were the case they would
never have instigated the 1967 war.
They cannot be seeking a Palestinian
Arab State, for there already exists
one — Jordan — where Palestinian
Arabs have full citizenship rights.
They cannot even be seeking a sec
ond Palestinian state on the West
Bank; they never made a move to
establish one in 1948 when it was of
fered to them by the U.N., nor were
there are attempts made from 1948
until 1967, when the West Bank was
in Arab hands. They are seeking one
thing only — the complete destruc
tion of the State of Israel.

It is indeed sad that the Palestinian
Arab refugees were held prisoners in
the oil-rich Arab lands by their own
brothers — simply as pawns in the
game of Israel's extermination. The
Israelis have compassion for these
people and have always been willing
to talk with them and work with them
