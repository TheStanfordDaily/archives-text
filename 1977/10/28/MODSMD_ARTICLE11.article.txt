# A 						deeper understanding?
## Taking another look at Kent State

Connie Replogle

Mike Shuman's article (Daily Oct.
19), calls the struggle at Kent State
(KSU) to move the gym a "nonissue."
He "regrets how much time, energy
and money the students wasted." In
stead, he suggests "more produc
tive" activities, such as "voting and
campaigning."
The hundreds of KSU and other
students who spent an entire spring
and summer (and now fall) fighting
the construction of the gym obvi
ously have a different opinion. Were
they all hoodwinked or running on
5-month-old spontaneous energy?
Or do they have an understanding
which runs deeper than Shuman's as
to just what is at stake with building a
gym on the site of the murders?
'Nonissue'
First, let's look at how the govern
ment and administration have dealt

with this "nonissue."
In 1968, they purchased a 17-acre
site expressly for the gym. They have
steadfastly refused since then to
build on this site, and instead last
year moved the site to the hill where
the murders took place.
In 1971, the KSU trustees attemp
ted to build a parking lot on the hill.
Massive outrage forced them to back
down.
It has already cost them more in
trying to subdue the struggle than it
would have to move the site of the
gym.
Ohio Gov. James Rhodes, the KSU
trustees, and the big business com
munity whom they represent, are
very clear on why they want the gym
on that site (contrary to Shuman, the
gym site is not at the "utmost
periphery" of the shootings, as the

entire hill will have to be dug up to
build the gym).
What they would like forgotten are
the attacks by the National Guard and
police which came at the pinnacle of
a wave of struggle against the war, in
particularagainstthe U.S. invasion of
Cambodia.
Jackson State
Shortly following Kent, police
broke up a demonstration at Jackson
State by firing into dorms. They killed
two black students. These murders
were intended to frighten people
and intimidate the movement. In
stead, students shut down 200 cam
puses across the nation in the only
nationwide student strike in U.S. his
tory.
It is the memory of this massive
movement and of the repression,
even outright murder, which they

used to try and halt that movement,
which the proponents of the gym
would like to bury in cement.
Better outlets?
Shuman suggests that organizing
students to vote against Rhodes or
pouring their energies into court
trials to prosecute the murderers
would be better outlets for KSU stu
dents. As to the first, getting Rhodes
out of office might be sweet revenge,
but voting him out will do virtually
nothing to alter the power structure
which supports him at every turn.
"In fact, the massive movement
which the KSU students have built
has done more to indict the murder
ers in the minds of the American
people than any election or even a
court trial could do.
