Supreme Court
Press reports suggest that the Sup
reme Court may seek to avoid the
constitutional questions in deciding
the case of Allan Bakke. Several jus
tires have already questioned the at
torneys in this regard. This is disturb
ing in view of the court's past asser
tion of constitutional authority in
such matters.
Through a series of landmark deci
sions, the court has shoved the
politicians aside, taken the driver's
seat and sent the vehicle of govern
ment off on a new course. But al
though the court has invalidated the
old boundaries, it has not yet defined
the new ones. This must be done
soon if misunderstanding and seri
ous harm are to be prevented. We
are traveling on a rough road; he

ERA and Wife Support
Feminists try repeatedly to convey
the notion that the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) would have no ef
fect on a woman's right to be sup
ported by her husband.
This is a tricky subject, for support
laws do continue to exist in the con
text of legal equality — as is the case
with California's newly-revised fam
ily laws. Contrary to previous sta
tutes, however, wives have no grea
ter right to be supported by hus
bands than vice versa.
Noncompliance
According to California courts,
exercising their implied legal right to

define "the interests of the child, a
spouse not exercising her/his
maximum earning capacity, or not
preparing to do so, and not required
by a child under school age to be at
home, is not complying with the new
law, irrespective of the other
spouse's income.
Tl.e state can lower to infancy the
age determining noncompliance
and, With continuing proliferation of
public child-care programs, might do
so. Thus, under "equal rights," the
homemaker has no legislated protec
tion whatever.
Unbalanced responsibilities
Extensive studies reveal that in
most families in which wives are
gainfully employed full time, their
total family responsibilities are far
greater than those of their husbands.
"Consciousness raising" will not
significantly change this situation,
for it stems from innate differences
between the sexes.
"Equality of rights under the law"
requires revision of the laws which
have constituted a solid means of
balancing the picture — at least for
the wife who would be content with
the standard of living afforded by her
husband's employment. (If the
economy is such that his conscienti
ous efforts afford but inadequate
subsistence by any standard, the ap

propriate area for reform is the
economy.)
Feminists address the problem by
proposing that government assume
the rights and responsibilities of pa
rents (and have made substantial
gains in this direction). Thus, mother
and father would be free to carry out
their reciprocal support obligations,
serving in parental roles merely as
suppliers of "human resources" for
the one-world economy. The "hu
man resources" — their children —
would be shaped to the mold pre
scribed by those in power and re
flecting the secular humanist prop
aganda with which the world has
been barraged since the early 19605.
In future generations, relinquish
ment of parental rights and respon
sibilities would not matter to the
citizenry. Virtually everyone would
have been indoctrinated to believe
that the state — the supreme, surro
gate parent — is the all-knowing,
all-wise and all-powerful, generous
dispenser of "human rights" — in
short, a god. A state intolerable to
the one God.
Can whatever benefits in which
the ERA might result outweigh the
blind slavery to which it would sub
ject our progeny?

Tl.e state can lower to infancy the
age determining noncompliance
and, With continuing proliferation of
public child-care programs, might do
so. Thus, under "equal rights," the

Unbalanced responsibilities
Extensive studies reveal that in
most families in which wives are
gainfully employed full time, their
total family responsibilities are far
greater than those of their husbands.
"Consciousness raising" will not
significantly change this situation,
for it stems from innate differences
between the sexes.
"Equality of rights under the law"
requires revision of the laws which
have constituted a solid means of
balancing the picture — at least for
the wife who would be content with
the standard of living afforded by her
husband's employment. (If the
economy is such that his conscienti
ous efforts afford but inadequate
subsistence by any standard, the ap

propriate area for reform is the
economy.)
Feminists address the problem by
proposing that government assume
the rights and responsibilities of pa
rents (and have made substantial
gains in this direction). Thus, mother
and father would be free to carry out
their reciprocal support obligations,
serving in parental roles merely as
suppliers of "human resources" for
the one-world economy. The "hu
man resources" — their children —
would be shaped to the mold pre
scribed by those in power and re
flecting the secular humanist prop
aganda with which the world has
been barraged since the early 19605.
In future generations, relinquish
ment of parental rights and respon
sibilities would not matter to the
citizenry. Virtually everyone would
have been indoctrinated to believe
that the state — the supreme, surro
gate parent — is the all-knowing,
all-wise and all-powerful, generous
dispenser of "human rights" — in
short, a god. A state intolerable to
the one God.
Can whatever benefits in which
the ERA might result outweigh the
blind slavery to which it would sub

ERA and Wife Support
Feminists try repeatedly to convey
the notion that the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) would have no ef
fect on a woman's right to be sup
ported by her husband.
This is a tricky subject, for support
laws do continue to exist in the con
text of legal equality — as is the case
with California's newly-revised fam
ily laws. Contrary to previous sta
tutes, however, wives have no grea
ter right to be supported by hus
bands than vice versa.
Noncompliance
According to California courts,
exercising their implied legal right to

define "the interests of the child, a
spouse not exercising her/his
maximum earning capacity, or not
preparing to do so, and not required
by a child under school age to be at
home, is not complying with the new
law, irrespective of the other
spouse's income.
Tl.e state can lower to infancy the
age determining noncompliance
and, With continuing proliferation of
public child-care programs, might do
so. Thus, under "equal rights," the
