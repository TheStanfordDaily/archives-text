# Russians list top 10 songs

Moscow (AP) â€” In a new concession to the
growing Russian ranks of pop music fans, a
Soviet newspaper has begun publishing a hit
parade of the "top 10" Soviet and foreign tunes.
The feature, called "Musical Parade," in
cludes lists of Soviet and foreign songs most
popular in the Soviet Union. The monthly lists
began appearing Saturday in Moskovsky Kom
somolets, the newspaper of the Moscow Young
Communist League. The paper is already popu
lar among young people for another column,
"Sound Track," which carries details of the
Soviet and foreign music scene.
The first chart lists the top foreign song as
"Indian Summer" by French singer Joe Dassin.
Others are "Souvenirs" by Greek singer Demis
Russos; "Money, Money, Money" and "5.0.5."
by the Swedish group Abba; "I Am Alone" by
the Dutch group Teach-in; various reditions of
the Spanish song "El Bimbo"; British singer
Elton John's "Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road";
"July Morning" by the British group Uriah
Heep; "Sunny" by the British group Beni M.;
and "Ciao Bambino Sorry" by French songstress
Mireille Mathieu.
The Soviet hit parade was topped by "My

Homeland" sung by Sofia Rotaru.
Unlike Western rankings, usually based on
record sales, the Russian list is compiled from
questionnaires distributed in record stores.
In an interview, Moskovsky Komsomolets re
cord editor Yuri Silinov said the list was started
because "a lot of young composers are coming
out in the Soviet Union and a lot is happening in
foreign music. We thought about it, and de
cided a parade like this could help systematize
things."
He said eligibility for the list would be limited
to songs sold in the Soviet Union or played on
Soviet radio. But since few foreign rock records
are available in record stores here, Soviet fans
may not be able to get their hands on some of
the top 10 recordings.
Songs beamed into the Soviet Union by
foreign radio stations, which have a massive lis
tening audience here, are ineligible for the list.
The status of pop music, particularly rock, has
been climbing steadily in the Soviet Union.
While conservative politicians here have often
condemned rock music as a sign of "bourgeois
decadence," the government has little objec
tion to its most moderate forms.
