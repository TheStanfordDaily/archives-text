# Waterbeds: a personal view
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Inventing
the waterbed didn't make
Charlie Hall rich or famous, but
it did leave him with some in
teresting memories involving
Jello.
Now 34, Hall was a design
student living in San Francis
co's Haight-Ashbury district
when he came up with the
fore-runner of the waterbed 10
years ago. His invention, actu
ally a vinyl bag filled with 300
pounds of Jello and styrene
pellets, "was interesting but
not successful, because you
needed a forklift to move it."
There were other problems.
The bag developed a leak and
Jello began oozing into the
downstairs apartment. Hall de
cided it had to go.
"There was all this goo
mixed with styrene beads," he
recalls, "I was afraid it would
clog the toilet and I couldn't
just throw it out. So I ended up
taking it out at night in little
bags and putting them in gar
bage cans at the beach.
Hall persevered, substitut
ing water for Jello and adding a
frame and heater. An art gallery
invited him to show his inven
tion and he came up with an
eight-foot square waterbed
covered in red velvet and dub
bed "The Pleasure Pit."
"It was a big hit," he said, "I
thought the merits of the
waterbed would be seen im
mediately."
It didn't work out that way.
Waterbeds, says Hall, were
viewed as part of the
"Hashbury" hippie culture,
another example of California

craziness.
"People saw these undula
tions and there were all these
hippie and sex connotations,"
he said. "Actually, although I
hate to say anything negative
about waterbeds, as far as sex
goes, well, that's not the best
part. Waterbeds are for sleep
ing."
Hall and members of what is
now a $135-million-a-year in
dustry are fighting "waterbed
misconceptions" through a
public relations campaign
which the American Waterbed
Council (AWC) says "is de
signed to achieve the AWC's
goal of obtaining consumer
waterbed acceptance by skill
ful use of the media." The
campaign, launched here this
week, will also "counter nega
tive publicity," the AWC says.
Hall, whose own waterbed
company went bankrupt,
never made much money from
his patent. He has since re
turned to inventing and has
marketed several other pro
ducts. But he also leaves his
Bay Area home for frequent
waterbed promotions, which
he describes as "a bit of a diffe
rent thing."
Waterbeds account for
about four per cent of national
bed sales today, the AWC says,
with 15 per cent of California's
20 million residents sup
posedly floting on them each
night. Heavier vinyl and im
proved construction methods
have eliminated leakage prob
lems and today an "average"
waterbed and accessories
costs between $500 and $800.
Water is not included.

Jello began oozing into the
downstairs apartment. Hall de
cided it had to go.
"There was all this goo
mixed with styrene beads," he
recalls, "I was afraid it would
clog the toilet and I couldn't
just throw it out. So I ended up
taking it out at night in little
bags and putting them in gar
bage cans at the beach.
Hall persevered, substitut
ing water for Jello and adding a
frame and heater. An art gallery
invited him to show his inven
tion and he came up with an
eight-foot square waterbed
covered in red velvet and dub
bed "The Pleasure Pit."
"It was a big hit," he said, "I
thought the merits of the
waterbed would be seen im
mediately."
It didn't work out that way.
Waterbeds, says Hall, were
viewed as part of the
"Hashbury" hippie culture,
another example of California

craziness.
"People saw these undula
tions and there were all these
hippie and sex connotations,"
he said. "Actually, although I
hate to say anything negative
about waterbeds, as far as sex
goes, well, that's not the best
part. Waterbeds are for sleep
ing."
Hall and members of what is
now a $135-million-a-year in
dustry are fighting "waterbed
misconceptions" through a
public relations campaign
which the American Waterbed
Council (AWC) says "is de
signed to achieve the AWC's
goal of obtaining consumer
waterbed acceptance by skill
ful use of the media." The
campaign, launched here this
week, will also "counter nega
tive publicity," the AWC says.
Hall, whose own waterbed
company went bankrupt,
never made much money from
his patent. He has since re
turned to inventing and has
marketed several other pro
ducts. But he also leaves his
Bay Area home for frequent
waterbed promotions, which
he describes as "a bit of a diffe
rent thing."
Waterbeds account for
about four per cent of national
bed sales today, the AWC says,
with 15 per cent of California's
20 million residents sup
posedly floting on them each
night. Heavier vinyl and im
proved construction methods
have eliminated leakage prob
lems and today an "average"
waterbed and accessories
costs between $500 and $800.
Water is not included.
Los Angeles (AP) — Inventing
the waterbed didn't make
Charlie Hall rich or famous, but
it did leave him with some in
teresting memories involving
Jello.
Now 34, Hall was a design
student living in San Francis
co's Haight-Ashbury district
when he came up with the
fore-runner of the waterbed 10
years ago. His invention, actu
ally a vinyl bag filled with 300
pounds of Jello and styrene
pellets, "was interesting but
not successful, because you
needed a forklift to move it."
There were other problems.
The bag developed a leak and
Jello began oozing into the
downstairs apartment. Hall de
cided it had to go.
