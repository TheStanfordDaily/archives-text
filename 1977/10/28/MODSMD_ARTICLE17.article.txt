# 'Radicals decree' defended
## 
### Jon Levitow 
An official of the largest West
German state's ministry of
education asserted Tuesday
that legislation barring
"enemies of the constitution"
from public posts in Germany
is "essential."
Arno Kaiser, from the minis
try of education in North Rhine
Westphalia, West Germany,
was responding in part to a
pamphlet printed by the Free
University, Berlin, that calls for
international scrutiny regard
ing a series of laws passed in
1972, known in Germany as the
'radical decree.'
Kaiser was interviewed by
the Daily when he stopped
here as part of his American
tour.
"I would ask you whether
you know . . . after you have
made an application (for
teacher or civil service post),
that you are screened by the
FBI and the Department of jus
tice," said Kaiser.
"It is quite an automatic
thing they do," he said. "The
authorities feel that the person
they are selecting for the post
should be reliable in a certain
sense, that is, regarding his
loyalty to the constitution."
Derogatory term
Throughout Western Europe
the derogatory term Be
rufsverbot, meaning literally a
prohibition trom one's proper

office, has been applied to the
decree, much to the embar
rassment of West German offi
cials.
The radical's decree reads in
part, "An applicant who en
gages in activities hostile to the
constitution will not be
employed in the public ser
vice." These laws have resulted
in "loyalty checks" on nearly
one million German citizens
since 1972, according to the
pamphlet.
The West German state
funds and staffs all schools and
universities in the country.
West German civil service ac
counts for 14 per cent of all
jobs, including all teaching
positions.
The process of screening for
"hostility to the constitution"
has been likened by many lib
eral European democratic par
ties to McCarthyism. Proof of
innocence in such cases must
be supplied by the accused.
'Disloyalty'
The criteria for "disloyalty"
range from simple member
ship or association in the
sanctioned Communist party
to personal contact with those
suspected of disloyalty and
participation in anti
government demonstrations
or movements.
Kaiser, in defense of the rad
icals decree, said that in Ger
many, "it is essential" that

when someone enters the civil
service he is "ready to work ac
tively if the constitution is in
danger. ... In our country we
doubt" the sincerity of Com
munists to that commitment.
"It is a written goal in their
(the Communists') constitu
tion" to work for the over
throw of the democratic in
stitutions of West Germany,
Kaiser said. "We have decided
that communism is against our
constitution."
Kaiser denied that German
Berufsverbot had produced a
national momentum similar to
America during former Senator
Joseph McCarthy's communist
hunts. He said McCarthyism in
the United States "was a social
disease and I don't feel that we
have similar public move
ments" in West Germany.
Same treatment
Kaiser said he felt German
right-wing extremists, includ
ing former Nazis, receive the
same treatment as leftists. He
said, "They are not employed
or they shouldn't be. If it is
proved that they are against
our constitution then they
should be handled in the same
manner (as leftists)."
Arguing that fascist and
right-wing groups in West
Germany were nearly non
existent, he said that the "ac
tual danger is not from the
right."

Although the Communists
received less than one per cent
of the vote in West Germany's
last election, Kaiser explained
that he saw communism and
the left as a threat. In addition
to recent terrorism, he said,
German Communists were
"steered" by the East Ger
mans.
He said that if Communists
"don't intend to get a position
in civil service, I don't see any
risk for them. We have a saying
in Germany that these people
try to get tenure, and with this
tenure, can make revolution."
Civil servants in Germany
cannot be fired and are paid
well by German standards,
Kaiser said.
Speaking on the ability of lef
tists to air their views, particu
larly in an academic setting, he
said, "They do. You can read
the strongest leftist positions
in our universities. I don't see
these kind of papers here.
"There is a danger of sup
pression of freedom ... in our
universities," but he said he
felt it came from leftist violence
and terrorism.
He said that the radicals de
cree had not produced an at
mosphere of political fear in
Germany. He stressed again
the fear of the German people
and government toward
further terrorism. "People
have onlyfearof terrorism," he
said.
