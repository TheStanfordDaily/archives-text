# Aid officers table 'filer report' idea
## 
### Rob Lempert 
A proposal giving high
school seniors the right to re
ceive an estimate of the
amount they must pay for their
college education was tabled
by the College Scholarship
Service (CSS), which met in
San Francisco this week.
Called the "Report-to-filer,"
the proposal would require the
CSS to inform those applying
for financial aid how much the
student is expected to contri
bute as soon as the parental
confidential statement is pro
cessed. The report would be
sent before financial aid offic
ers at individual colleges have
had a chance to make adjust
ments.
Presently, parents and stu
dents do not have this informa
tion and can not tell how the
colleges have altered the basic
cost.
Stanford financial aid direc
tor Robert Huff, attending the
annual meeting of the CSS, a
subsidiary of the College Entr
ance Examination Board
(CEEB), said the Report-to-filer
proposal was tabled. The issue
will be discussed at the CEEB's
regional meetings later this
year.
Next March, the regional re
ports will be considered by the
CEEB board of trustees, who

will make the final decision.
Huff said the issue was ta
bled because attendence at the
national meetings is not suffi
cient to represent everyone's
views. He also said there is
some opposition to the mea
sure from private colleges and
universities who feel such a
proposal would frighten pros
pective students.
Most schools are able to ar
range loans and take into ac
count special circumstances
when sending out aid packages
to accepted students. These of
fers are often substantially
higher than the original esti
mate made from the parental
confidential statement. The
raw figure provided by the
Report-to-filer proposal might
scare away students who might
otherwise be able to afford the
school in question, according
to Huff.
Peter Coye, a student at the
University of Wisconsin and
the chairman of the CSS stu
dent advisory committee, said
he was glad to see the measure
was not vetoed, but that he
wants to see it passed in its pre
sent form. Coye said the
amount a student receives
should be the same in theory
no matter what school he goes
to, but in practice, financial aid
officers make large changes.
