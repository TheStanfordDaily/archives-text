# Cards face tough OSU defense
## Stanford travels Oregon Trail 
### David Georgette 
Guiding a college football
program back to respectability
is not an easy task, but Oregon
State's second-year head
coach Craig Fertig has his
Beavers headed in the right di
rection.
That's why the Stanford Car
dinals (5-2, 3-1 in conference),
will have to do more than go
through the motions tomor
row afternoon in Corvallis
(1:30 p.m. KZSU FM 90.1,
KSFO AM 560) if they expect to
remain a contender in the
Pacific-8 race.
Most coaches say the quic
kest way to build a good foot
ball team is to develop a de
fense that can stop the other
guys. And Fertig has got him
self a defense that can stop the
other guys — at least on the
artificial turf in the Beaver's
Parker Stadium.
The Beavers are 2-5 this sea
son (0-3 in conference play),
and their two wins came in
Corvallis — 24-12 over Syra
cuse and 24-19 over BYU. They
held USC to a 17-10 win in Ore
gon and last week contained
Washington in Seattle before
the Huskies won 14-6.
Strong defense
"They've got a very strong
defense," said Stanford coach
Bill Walsh. "Defensively, Ore

gon State has good size and ta
lent."
The Beavers' aggressive
front four is led by tackle Greg
Marshall, the man who's been
in on 56 tackles, second on the
club to strong safety Tom Ste
vens' 62.
"If there is a real strong point
on our team it would be our
secondary because we have
four seasoned veterans," said
Fertig. Helping out Stevens are
cornerbacks Kerry Justin and
Lenny Holmes, second in the
Pac-8 in interceptions with
three.
The key man-in-the-middle
for the Beavers' defense is
junior Kent Peyton, the third
leading tackier on the team.
The Beavers are last in the
Pac-8 in pass defense, but were
able to slow down BYU's Gif
ford Nielsen, the country's
leading passer at the time, re
turning two interceptions for
touchdowns in the game.
The Beavers play an aggres
sive style of defense and "blitz
constantly," according to
Walsh. "When you do that,"
he added, "you're vulnerable
to big plays."
Big play man
If the Cards are looking for
the big play, they'll probably
look for receiver James Lofton,
the fourth-leading receiver in

the country and the top pass
receiver in the conference with
38 catches for 649 yards and
nine touchdowns.
Card halfback Darrin Nelson
is second in the Pac-8 in with 34
catches; and with 660 yards
rushing, he needs only 85 more
to break the Pac-8 freshman
rushing record of 744 yards set
by USC's Charles White last
season.
The man who directs the of
fense on the field — quarter
back Guy Benjamin — is the
country's top passer this sea
son with 23.3 completions per
game for 1702 yards.
"It is getting to sound like a
broken record, but these guys,
I think, have more weapons
than anyone we have played
this year," said Fertig. "We feel
in order to win the football
game we have to keep Stanford
on the long end of the field."
Backing the Cards up might
be difficult for OSU because
the Beavers are having punting
problems. Their two punters
have a combined average of
only 33.9 yards a kick.
The Beavers' punting prob
lems, however, are matched by
the troubles the Cardinal de
fense has been having. Card
opponents have ripped off big
gainers that have quickly
changed the complexion of

several games this year.
"We all need a turnaround
on defense," said Walsh.
Optimism
Optimism for better defense
is justified, though, especially
with the improvement in mid
dle linebacker Cordy Cere
sino's sore knee which has se
verely limited his movement in
the past two games.
Walsh expects to go with the
same defensive backfield that
started against Washington
State, with freshman Robby
Chapman at free safety and
sophomore Rick Parker at right
cornerback, but Walsh added
that reserve Savann Thompson
should see more action this
week.
The Beavers use a tailback
oriented offense similar to
Colorado and Washington.
The Beavers' starting tailback
until last week's game had
been junior James Fields, who
has 457 yards rushing. Fields
did not play against the Hus
kies, however, as a result of
disciplinary action. He will be
back tomorrow, but freshman
Willie Johnson may again start
at tailback.
Teamed in the backfield
with either Fields or Johnson
will be fullback Byron Kellar,
averaging 4.1 yards a carry.
Last in stats
Statistically the Beaver of
fense is last in the conference,
but nevertheless the unit is im
proved over last year when the
Beavers were decimated by in
juries, including the loss of
their top four quarterbacks.
"This year, the thing that has
helped has been having one
quarterback," said Rob
Adolph, the Beaver quarter
back coach.
The Beaver quarterback is
junior John Norman, but the
stability he gives the Beaver of
fense is not reflected in the
statistics — he is the eighth
rated passer among the con
ference's starting quarter
backs.
What passing attack OSU has
will be hampered by the hobbl
ing of Steve Coury, the team's
top receiver with 22 recep
tions, with a hip pointer.
The Beavers' best offensive
weapon may be kicker Kieron
Walford, who has hit on eight
of 10 field goal attempts inside
the 50-yard line.
But even with a minimal of
fense, the Beavers' tough
home defense could give the
Cards a rough time. "Every
time we play at home we play
pretty good football," said
Adolph. "We want to make
people hate to come in here
and play us."
Guiding a college football

Guiding a college football
program back to respectability
is not an easy task, but Oregon
State's second-year head
coach Craig Fertig has his
Beavers headed in the right di
rection.
That's why the Stanford Car
dinals (5-2, 3-1 in conference),
will have to do more than go
through the motions tomor
row afternoon in Corvallis
(1:30 p.m. KZSU FM 90.1,
KSFO AM 560) if they expect to
remain a contender in the
Pacific-8 race.
Most coaches say the quic
kest way to build a good foot
ball team is to develop a de
fense that can stop the other
guys. And Fertig has got him
self a defense that can stop the
other guys — at least on the
artificial turf in the Beaver's
Parker Stadium.
The Beavers are 2-5 this sea
son (0-3 in conference play),
and their two wins came in
Corvallis — 24-12 over Syra
cuse and 24-19 over BYU. They
held USC to a 17-10 win in Ore
gon and last week contained
Washington in Seattle before
the Huskies won 14-6.
Strong defense
"They've got a very strong
defense," said Stanford coach
Bill Walsh. "Defensively, Ore

gon State has good size and ta
lent."
The Beavers' aggressive
front four is led by tackle Greg
Marshall, the man who's been
in on 56 tackles, second on the
club to strong safety Tom Ste
vens' 62.
"If there is a real strong point
on our team it would be our
secondary because we have
four seasoned veterans," said
Fertig. Helping out Stevens are
cornerbacks Kerry Justin and
Lenny Holmes, second in the
Pac-8 in interceptions with
three.
The key man-in-the-middle
for the Beavers' defense is
junior Kent Peyton, the third
leading tackier on the team.
The Beavers are last in the
Pac-8 in pass defense, but were
able to slow down BYU's Gif
ford Nielsen, the country's
leading passer at the time, re
turning two interceptions for
touchdowns in the game.
The Beavers play an aggres
sive style of defense and "blitz
constantly," according to
Walsh. "When you do that,"
he added, "you're vulnerable
to big plays."
Big play man
If the Cards are looking for
the big play, they'll probably
look for receiver James Lofton,
the fourth-leading receiver in

the country and the top pass
receiver in the conference with
38 catches for 649 yards and
nine touchdowns.
Card halfback Darrin Nelson
is second in the Pac-8 in with 34
catches; and with 660 yards
rushing, he needs only 85 more
to break the Pac-8 freshman
rushing record of 744 yards set
by USC's Charles White last
season.
The man who directs the of
fense on the field — quarter
back Guy Benjamin — is the
country's top passer this sea
son with 23.3 completions per
game for 1702 yards.
"It is getting to sound like a
broken record, but these guys,
I think, have more weapons
than anyone we have played
this year," said Fertig. "We feel
in order to win the football
game we have to keep Stanford
on the long end of the field."
Backing the Cards up might
be difficult for OSU because
the Beavers are having punting
problems. Their two punters
have a combined average of
only 33.9 yards a kick.
The Beavers' punting prob
lems, however, are matched by
the troubles the Cardinal de
fense has been having. Card
opponents have ripped off big
gainers that have quickly
changed the complexion of

several games this year.
"We all need a turnaround
on defense," said Walsh.
Optimism
Optimism for better defense
is justified, though, especially
with the improvement in mid
dle linebacker Cordy Cere
sino's sore knee which has se
verely limited his movement in
the past two games.
Walsh expects to go with the
same defensive backfield that
started against Washington
State, with freshman Robby
Chapman at free safety and
sophomore Rick Parker at right
cornerback, but Walsh added
that reserve Savann Thompson
should see more action this
week.
The Beavers use a tailback
oriented offense similar to
Colorado and Washington.
The Beavers' starting tailback
until last week's game had
been junior James Fields, who
has 457 yards rushing. Fields
did not play against the Hus
kies, however, as a result of
disciplinary action. He will be
back tomorrow, but freshman
Willie Johnson may again start
at tailback.
Teamed in the backfield
with either Fields or Johnson
will be fullback Byron Kellar,
averaging 4.1 yards a carry.
Last in stats
Statistically the Beaver of
fense is last in the conference,
but nevertheless the unit is im
proved over last year when the
Beavers were decimated by in
juries, including the loss of
their top four quarterbacks.
"This year, the thing that has
helped has been having one
quarterback," said Rob
Adolph, the Beaver quarter
back coach.
The Beaver quarterback is
junior John Norman, but the
stability he gives the Beaver of
fense is not reflected in the
statistics — he is the eighth
rated passer among the con
ference's starting quarter
backs.
What passing attack OSU has
will be hampered by the hobbl
ing of Steve Coury, the team's
top receiver with 22 recep
tions, with a hip pointer.
The Beavers' best offensive
weapon may be kicker Kieron
Walford, who has hit on eight
of 10 field goal attempts inside
the 50-yard line.
But even with a minimal of
fense, the Beavers' tough
home defense could give the
Cards a rough time. "Every
time we play at home we play
pretty good football," said
Adolph. "We want to make
people hate to come in here
and play us."

program back to respectability
is not an easy task, but Oregon
State's second-year head
coach Craig Fertig has his
Beavers headed in the right di
rection.
That's why the Stanford Car
dinals (5-2, 3-1 in conference),
will have to do more than go
through the motions tomor
row afternoon in Corvallis
(1:30 p.m. KZSU FM 90.1,
KSFO AM 560) if they expect to
remain a contender in the
Pacific-8 race.
Most coaches say the quic
kest way to build a good foot
ball team is to develop a de
fense that can stop the other
guys. And Fertig has got him
self a defense that can stop the
other guys — at least on the
artificial turf in the Beaver's
Parker Stadium.
The Beavers are 2-5 this sea
son (0-3 in conference play),
and their two wins came in
Corvallis — 24-12 over Syra
cuse and 24-19 over BYU. They
held USC to a 17-10 win in Ore
gon and last week contained
Washington in Seattle before
the Huskies won 14-6.
Strong defense
"They've got a very strong
defense," said Stanford coach
Bill Walsh. "Defensively, Ore

gon State has good size and ta
lent."
The Beavers' aggressive
front four is led by tackle Greg
Marshall, the man who's been
in on 56 tackles, second on the
club to strong safety Tom Ste
vens' 62.
"If there is a real strong point
on our team it would be our
secondary because we have
four seasoned veterans," said
Fertig. Helping out Stevens are
cornerbacks Kerry Justin and
Lenny Holmes, second in the
Pac-8 in interceptions with
three.
The key man-in-the-middle
for the Beavers' defense is
junior Kent Peyton, the third
leading tackier on the team.
The Beavers are last in the
Pac-8 in pass defense, but were
able to slow down BYU's Gif
ford Nielsen, the country's
leading passer at the time, re
turning two interceptions for
touchdowns in the game.
The Beavers play an aggres
sive style of defense and "blitz
constantly," according to
Walsh. "When you do that,"
he added, "you're vulnerable
to big plays."
Big play man
If the Cards are looking for
the big play, they'll probably
look for receiver James Lofton,
the fourth-leading receiver in

the country and the top pass
receiver in the conference with
38 catches for 649 yards and
nine touchdowns.
Card halfback Darrin Nelson
is second in the Pac-8 in with 34
catches; and with 660 yards
rushing, he needs only 85 more
to break the Pac-8 freshman
rushing record of 744 yards set
by USC's Charles White last
season.
The man who directs the of
fense on the field — quarter
back Guy Benjamin — is the
country's top passer this sea
son with 23.3 completions per
game for 1702 yards.
"It is getting to sound like a
broken record, but these guys,
I think, have more weapons
than anyone we have played
this year," said Fertig. "We feel
in order to win the football
game we have to keep Stanford
on the long end of the field."
Backing the Cards up might
be difficult for OSU because
the Beavers are having punting
problems. Their two punters
have a combined average of
only 33.9 yards a kick.
The Beavers' punting prob
lems, however, are matched by
the troubles the Cardinal de
fense has been having. Card
opponents have ripped off big
gainers that have quickly
changed the complexion of

several games this year.
"We all need a turnaround
on defense," said Walsh.
Optimism
Optimism for better defense
is justified, though, especially
with the improvement in mid
dle linebacker Cordy Cere
sino's sore knee which has se
verely limited his movement in
the past two games.
Walsh expects to go with the
same defensive backfield that
started against Washington
State, with freshman Robby
Chapman at free safety and
sophomore Rick Parker at right
cornerback, but Walsh added
that reserve Savann Thompson
should see more action this
week.
The Beavers use a tailback
oriented offense similar to
Colorado and Washington.
The Beavers' starting tailback
until last week's game had
been junior James Fields, who
has 457 yards rushing. Fields
did not play against the Hus
kies, however, as a result of
disciplinary action. He will be
back tomorrow, but freshman
Willie Johnson may again start
at tailback.
Teamed in the backfield
with either Fields or Johnson
will be fullback Byron Kellar,
averaging 4.1 yards a carry.
Last in stats
Statistically the Beaver of
fense is last in the conference,
but nevertheless the unit is im
proved over last year when the
Beavers were decimated by in
juries, including the loss of
their top four quarterbacks.
"This year, the thing that has
helped has been having one
quarterback," said Rob
Adolph, the Beaver quarter
back coach.
The Beaver quarterback is
junior John Norman, but the
stability he gives the Beaver of
fense is not reflected in the
statistics — he is the eighth
rated passer among the con
ference's starting quarter
backs.
What passing attack OSU has
will be hampered by the hobbl
ing of Steve Coury, the team's
top receiver with 22 recep
tions, with a hip pointer.
The Beavers' best offensive
weapon may be kicker Kieron
Walford, who has hit on eight
of 10 field goal attempts inside
the 50-yard line.
But even with a minimal of
fense, the Beavers' tough
home defense could give the
Cards a rough time. "Every
time we play at home we play
pretty good football," said
Adolph. "We want to make
people hate to come in here
and play us."
Guiding a college football
