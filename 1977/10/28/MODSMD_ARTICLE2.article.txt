# Center institutes campus energy saving plan

When Karl Johnson leaves his office for five mi
nutes to get a cup of coffee, he turns off the light.
Johnson, coordinator of the Stanford Energy
Conservation Center, says he believes that this
kind of individual effort can have an impact on
total energy expenditures, and he has the figures
to prove it.
As a result of energy conservation pilot prog
rams, which officially began last February, both
Lagunita Court and Florence Moore Hall regis
tered a 30 per cent decrease in electricity use com
pared to during the same five-month period the
previous year, Johnson said.
This decrease represents a savings of about
150,000 kilowatts, or enough electricity to provide
all the electrical needs of an average California
family for 22 years, said Johnson.
In monetary terms, it means $5000 saved, he
said.
Pilot programs
Johnson has been trying to interest students in
conservation measures since the conservation
center was established last November. The pilot
programs were initiated when students in Flor
ence Moore and Lagunita became interested in
suggestions made by Johnson in lectures pre

sented to the dorms.
Students in these two halls agreed to make a
concentrated effort to reduce their use of electric
ity. Charts were maintained, recording the weekly
electricity expenditure. Residents could see the
immediate result of their efforts.
"It's not just reading your chart," said Johnson.
"The whole purpose is to give a feedback system
to the residents."
Surprising decrease
The system was effective.
"We thought the meters were broken," said
Johnson, explaining his surprise with the rapid
decrease in consumption.
Measures taken to decrease use of electricity
included replacing 200 watt bulbs with 150 watt
bulbs, and turning off half the hall lights rather
than leaving them burning 24 hours daily.
While most of these actions are simple, resi
dents are not always willing to bother, said
Johnson.
"It really takes the consensus of the people. Vou
need people to take the effort — to take the mi
nute or two to turn the lights off."
Like weight loss
Once the decision has been made to be energy
conscious, it is easy to develop good habits, said

Johnson. "It's a behavior change, like losing
weight."
Johnson is trying to help people develop these
habits. He has lectured at all the student resi
dences on campus to encourage students to be
energy conscious.
Pamphlets distributed by the center include in
formation on water use, how to get the most from
a light bulb, and how to handle room heaters.
Because most Stanford buildings do not have
meters for monitoring gas and water consump
tion, Johnson's efforts have focused on electricity,
where changes in usage can be recorded.
Expanded project
"If we could sustain last year's efforts and
spread them to other areas, we could save energy
campus-wide by 25 per cent," he said.
Projects similar to those at Lagunita and Flor
ence Moore have been instituted in other resi
dence halls, and a series of workshops, titled
"New Ways Holidays," is scheduled for Nov.
29-30.
The purpose of these workshops is to remind
people that a holiday can be celebrated without
great expenditures of energy and money, Johnson
said. "You can get back to a celebration that's
geared for people, not geared for objects."

Because most Stanford buildings do not have
meters for monitoring gas and water consump
tion, Johnson's efforts have focused on electricity,
where changes in usage can be recorded.
Expanded project
"If we could sustain last year's efforts and
spread them to other areas, we could save energy
campus-wide by 25 per cent," he said.
Projects similar to those at Lagunita and Flor
ence Moore have been instituted in other resi
dence halls, and a series of workshops, titled
"New Ways Holidays," is scheduled for Nov.
29-30.
The purpose of these workshops is to remind
people that a holiday can be celebrated without
great expenditures of energy and money, Johnson
said. "You can get back to a celebration that's
geared for people, not geared for objects."
When Karl Johnson leaves his office for five mi
nutes to get a cup of coffee, he turns off the light.
Johnson, coordinator of the Stanford Energy
Conservation Center, says he believes that this
kind of individual effort can have an impact on
total energy expenditures, and he has the figures
to prove it.
As a result of energy conservation pilot prog
rams, which officially began last February, both
Lagunita Court and Florence Moore Hall regis
tered a 30 per cent decrease in electricity use com
pared to during the same five-month period the
previous year, Johnson said.
This decrease represents a savings of about
150,000 kilowatts, or enough electricity to provide
all the electrical needs of an average California
family for 22 years, said Johnson.
In monetary terms, it means $5000 saved, he
said.
Pilot programs
Johnson has been trying to interest students in
conservation measures since the conservation
center was established last November. The pilot
programs were initiated when students in Flor
ence Moore and Lagunita became interested in
suggestions made by Johnson in lectures pre

sented to the dorms.
Students in these two halls agreed to make a
concentrated effort to reduce their use of electric
ity. Charts were maintained, recording the weekly
electricity expenditure. Residents could see the
immediate result of their efforts.
"It's not just reading your chart," said Johnson.
"The whole purpose is to give a feedback system
to the residents."
Surprising decrease
The system was effective.
"We thought the meters were broken," said
Johnson, explaining his surprise with the rapid
decrease in consumption.
Measures taken to decrease use of electricity
included replacing 200 watt bulbs with 150 watt
bulbs, and turning off half the hall lights rather
than leaving them burning 24 hours daily.
While most of these actions are simple, resi
dents are not always willing to bother, said
Johnson.
"It really takes the consensus of the people. Vou
need people to take the effort — to take the mi
nute or two to turn the lights off."
Like weight loss
Once the decision has been made to be energy
conscious, it is easy to develop good habits, said

Johnson. "It's a behavior change, like losing
weight."
Johnson is trying to help people develop these
habits. He has lectured at all the student resi
dences on campus to encourage students to be
energy conscious.
Pamphlets distributed by the center include in
formation on water use, how to get the most from
a light bulb, and how to handle room heaters.
