# Jumping Jim Jett joins staffers
## 
### 
The Daily sports staff, still
shocked over Dan Devine's
pre-Halloween costuming
of the Fighting Irish last
Saturday at (JSC, will re
taliate with an equally
ghoulish move. The fearless
football forecasters have
asked the master of mas
querade, the clown prince
of musical shenanigans,
LSJUMB Drum Major Jim
Jett to direct our less than
harmonious efforts at
crystal-ball gazing.
"Stanford at OSU: OH
MEAT, WHAT A TREAT for
Stanford's offense. Our
gang should fatten their
stats against a defense that
has as many ringers as the
Band does. Trees come out
on top, 69-0.
"Washington at UCLA: As
usual, we need help from
somebody else to reach the
climax of the year, the Rose

Bowl. UCLA is pretty much
out of the Run for the Roses
but is still very much alive in
the Trot for the Tidy Bowl in
Bakersfield June 16. UCLA
35, Washington 17.
"Cal at USC: Humiliation
is a word unheard of at USC,
because nobody there can
spell it. Coach Robinson's
well-muscled goons are
frenzied after a week-long
diet of DRUGS, SEX and
VIOLENCE and should have
little trouble. If both teams
follow their 'We Waste
Nerds' philosophies, no
body will be left standing
after the game. USC 22, Cal
20.
"Oregon at Washington
State: Despite a stunning
loss to Paly High, the Raid
ers are tough and should
roll one more (but of
course) victory up over the
Fighting Irish. WSU 00,
Oregon 00."
