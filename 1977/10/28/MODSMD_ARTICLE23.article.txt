## 
### Marcia Hadeler 
The IM football season will
enter its final week of play this
Monday. Many of these games,
and those played during the
make-up week, will decide
league champions.
"It's strange how many of
the best teams in each league
are ending up playing each
other in the last week," said
David Plager, I.M. Football
coordinator.
Monday's highlight game is
Trancos vs. The Leftovers, at 3
p.m., field No. 6. Both coed
teams are 3-0 in league play.
Next Sunday, six league
championship deciding games
are scheduled. (Because of the
Stanford-USC game, some may
be rescheduled, however.)
FTLS and Eucalypto, the only
women's teams still unde
feated match up at 1 p.m. on
field No. 7.
Also on field No. 7 at 2 p.m. is
a coed game between Cedro II
and Rinconada, both unde
feated.
At 1 p.m. the Zetes take on
Biz I in a deciding A league
game (field No. 1).
Showing up on field No. 1 for
a 2 p.m. game will be Faison
and Donner Party II in a B
league game.
Cedro I will encounter the
Alpha Delts on field No. 5 at 2
p.m. in another B league match

up.
In another B league game,
the Woosies are scheduled to
play Juniperoon field No. 9 at 3
p.m.
Last week's action included
several outstanding games:
Organized Grime took the
game from Off the Wall Gang
by half time. Grime got the ball
first, driving it the length of the
field with Pepe Hinojosa scor
ing the first touchdown. Safety
Paul Naver later intercepted
Wall quarterback Mike Glaf
kides' pass, allowing Grime's
quarterback, Triggs to lead his
team to another score.
Another interception,
another touchdown and by
half time the score was 20-0.
Mark Chin and Peter Davison
put a lot of pressure on Glaf
kidas, sacking him twice. Off
the Wall finally scored with two
minutes remaining, ending the
game with the score 27-6.
Law III defeated a talented
Theta Delt B team 14-0. Law Ill's
Bob Eshelman, Bob Flick,
Charles Cunningham and Tom
Bothe controlled both the of
fensive and defensive lines of

scrimmage. The first score
came on a delay pass to center
Eshelman, with a successful
conversion pass to end )oe
Mais.
A second touchdown late in
the second half came on a
bomb to Steve "Jamaal" Wil
liams, who pulled in the foot
ball after it had been deflected
and bobbled by a Theta Delt
defender.
The ATO football team upset
the Bootables 12-7 Wednes
day. "The victory can be attri
buted to many factors: a high
team spirit; marginally
talented athletes; and an im
mense amount of luck," said
coach Dan Carton.
The team gained an early 12
point lead in the game. Jim
"Broadway" Steyer caught the
Bootable defense off-guard
with his long touchdown pas
ses to Hector Gonyaley and
John "Monty" Montgomery.
From that point on the de
fense, led by Jim Esserman and
Brian La Buff, stiffened and held
the Bootables until late in the
game when the Bootables
scored a touchdown.
