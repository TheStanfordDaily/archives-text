# Killefer views women's athletics
## 
### Jill Lieber 
There's an old saying that
women don't get older — they
just get better.
Granted, at age 22, Onnie
Killefer is in no way over the
hill, but after four years of ath
letics at Stanford, she is older
and wiser.
"My worry for women's
sports in general is that I hope
they will be able to keep them
selves separate from exploiting
individuals in order to promote
sports.
"Sports such as women's
golf and tennis have gone the
route of trying to be sexually
appealing in order to get spec
tators. If you got a group of
people together to go out and
play sports you wouldn't wear
some of the things people are

getting away with today on the
women's golf circuit. And why
wear halter tops to play tennis?
"If women's sports are going
to make it, they might have to
become more commer
cialized. But they don't have to
do so by exploiting individuals.
Look at Nadia Comenici.
Romania — the government
and the people — are making
money off of her. She's not."
Killefer is just as warm, viv
acious and free spirited as she
was when she entered Stan
ford as a hot-shot freshman
field hockey player. She still
laughs at the stereotypes that
women athletes are lesbians or
more masculine than
feminine.
"There is an attitude that
women are complacent and

happy to be in less dominating
roles. Men are happy to see
them in those roles and don't
make an effort to see them in
other roles.
"Sports are starting to be
looked at as something that
develops the whole person.
Athletes are becoming more
aware of their bodies. Hope
fully the stigma of a woman
athlete as some sort of a jock
will soon disappear."
With the temperature hover
ing around the mid 50s, Killefer
sat curled up in a tight ball on a
cold cement bench in the
Roble Gym courtyard. The
briskness of the fall weather
appealed to her. She was dres
sed for it in a heavy maroon
sweater and toasty warm argile
socks — a dead giveaway to her
East Coast roots.
She tossed her head, send
ing her auburn locks flying.
Her blue eyes sparkled as she
talked about the emotional and
physical enjoyment sports
have given her.
All sports. Not just field hoc
key. Killefer has flirted around
with many sports — tennis,
basketball, volleyball — and
has performed them all well.
A three-year field hockey let
ter winner, Killefer said she
wishes that she could go on
playing sports forever.
To Onnie, good things never
come to an end.
"There is no such thing as
reaching a peak by a certain
age," Killefer said. "People can
reach high levels of perfor
mance at later ages.
"Just because I'm 22, I'm not
all washed up. Soccer players
in Europe play until their late
305."
Killefer said the reason most
women "fizzle out" after they
graduate from college is the
level of competition for
women athletes is still poor.
Without top notch teams to
compete against, women can

never reach their potential —
and lose interest.
"The biggest problem with
field hockey here is the lack of
competition in this area," Kil
lefer said. "There is a policy at
Stanford that we can't go out of
state to compete but we've got
to now-a-days just to be able to
do well against schools in
northern California.
"This year the University is
paying for our one trip down
south, but last season we had
to raise the money ourselves.
We put on a clinic and taught
field hockey to high school
teams.
"That paid for the trip, but
even still we stayed at a Motel 6
with four people to a room —
two to a bed."
Killefer said Stanford is try
ing to meet Title IX require
ments, but that she didn't ex
pect women's teams to ever be
given as much money or pub
licity as men's teams because
women's sports don't "bring in
the bucks."
"The question is first of all,
what is Title IX? It's not so
much as law. The department
thinks it has complied to Title
IX — not because it had to but
because it wanted to.
"There is no way the Univer
sity is going to spend equal
amounts of money on both
men's and women's sports. It
takes only six women to make
up a volleyball team, but 22
men to make up a football
team.
"Title IX is the equal oppor
tunity, top instruction and
programs and good facilities
for women — and that doesn't
necessarily mean equal spend
ing."
Killefer spent the summer
living in Berkeley and training
for national field hockey
camps. The second night of
housesitting was quite a scare
for her when at 1:30 in the

morning a knock came at the
window. She waited for some
one to call out to her, but there
was just silence. Intuition told
her to call the police.
As she was telling them
where to send a squad car, the
front door opened with a bang.
Luckily a small chain-lock kept
out the would-be burglar who
was armed with a crowbar.
From that night on — for six
weeks — Killefer took the
proper precautions in case of
further breakins. She slept
with her running shoes at the
foot of her bed — and her hoc
key stick at her side.
Ah, that trusty stick.
"As I look back at my Stan
ford years, I sometimes say to
myself, 'If I could only have
gone to school at San )ose State
and just played sports and not
have had to worry about school
work,' " Killefer said. "I almost
transferred after my freshman
year to go to the Philadelphia
area and totally pursue field
hockey.
"But my technique had de
teriorated so much by that time
because of lack of competition
here that I couldn't have even
made the JV team at most
places back East.
"And I have found out that
education is primary. At Stan
ford I got an education in the
broadest sense — learning not
just academic subjects but how
to live and react in certain situ
ations. The wellroundedness
was well worth it."

at a ball in a recent game at Ruble Field. Killefer, the captain of this
year's field hockey team, is an outstanding competitor in several
sports but now concentrates most of her athletic efforts into field
hockey.
