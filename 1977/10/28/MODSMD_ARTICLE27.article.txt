### Julie Fiedler 
The Stanford varsity field
hockey team scored its largest
margin of victory Wednesday
in defeating University of the
Paficic 11-0. The Tigers, winless
this season, were defenseless
as the strong Card team
pushed repeatedly towards the
goal.
The one-sided rout evi
denced in the style of play was
also substantiated through
statistics like penetration time:
15 minutes 32 seconds vs. 1 mi
nute 50 seconds, shots at goal:
26 vs 1, and of course the
score: 11-0.
Starting forward Alison King
displayed her expertise near
the goal taking advantage of
passes from teammate Kelly
Westerwick to become high
scorer with four goals. Wes
terwick, Onnie Killefer and
Mandy Read each scored twice

and Julia Johnson made a quick
flick shot early in the game to
add one to her record.
Although the competition
may have proven easy Wed
nesday, the Cards face a tough
on the road schedule over the
next two days. Stanford faces
undefeated Cal Poly-Pomona
today. Tomorrow the Cards
face Long Beach State and San
Diego State, two strong field
hockey schools.
Card coach Barbara
Longstreth said, "this weekend
is really going to tell us how
good we are. The competition
will be very difficult."
Stanford varsity and junior
varsity teams continue play
throughout November but
have concluded their at-home
season.
Stanford's JV squad drop
peda a 5-0 decision to San Jose
State on Wednesday.
