JV football
Stanford's junior varsity
football team makes its first
and only home appearance
today as the Cardinals host the
UC-Davis Aggies at 2 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium.
The JVs lost their opening
game to Taft Junior College
two weeks ago, 21-16. Davis,
on the other hand, brings a 3-0
record into the game.
Stanford's offensive hopes
ride on the arm of freshman
quarterback Grayson Rogers,
who completed 19 of 37 passes
for 282 yards and two
touchdowns against Taft.
Cross country
The men's cross country
team runs in the Pacific-8
Southern Division Champion
ships at 10 a.m. at UCLA. "If we
run to our potential we should
have a good shot at winning
the Southern Division Champ
ionships," said Stanford cross

country coach Marshall Clark.
Conference rivals California
and UCLA run against the Stan
ford harriers tomorrow. Non
conference teams from
Arizona and Arizona State may
also run.
Stanford is well-rested as
Clark held the Cardinals' top
seven runners out of last
week's race in Pleasant Hills.
Ice Hockey
There will be an Ice Hockey
Club organizational meeting at
the DU house on Sunday at 9
p.m.
Big Game containers
There will be no large con
tainers such as coolers, picnic
baskets and ice boxes allowed
into the Big Game Nov. 19 in
Stanford Stadium, the Athletic

Department announced this
week.
Officials in the Athletic De
partment said that individual
cans and quart-sized ther
moses will be allowed in the
stadium, however.
The container measures
have been taken to keep the
aisles and rows as clear as pos
sible for the convenience of
spectators trying to get to re
stroom and other facilities. It
will also prevent a fire and
safety trap. Security people
at the game will be instructed
not to allow anyone in the
stadium with large containers
and there will be no collection
area for containers, so people
are advised to leave any over
sized receptacles in their dor
mitories or cars.
