# No.1 polo ranking on line

### Brad Brockbank 
The Stanford water polo
team plays USC today at 4 p.m.
at deGuerre in a game that will
break up a three-way tie for
first place in the Pacific-8 bet
ween the Cardinals, the Tro
jans and California. Each team
has lost one conference game.
The Trojans, who lost to
UCLA, recently beat California
by one goal in a game at the
USC pool.
"If we beat USC," said Car
dinal coach Dante Dettamanti,
"we're almost assured to make
the nationals (NCAA champ
ionships)."
USC must play Cal on Satur
day in Berkeley and Dettamanti
said he believes that Cal will
prevail in their home pool. If
so, the Trojans would have
three losses, virtually eliminat
ing them from the Pac-8 title
race.
For Stanford to remain in the
conference race, today's game
is a "must win," according to
Dettamanti.
"USC is a quick, fast driving
team. They play a very intense
game," Dettamanti said.
"They're all psych," said
freshman goalie John Cansel.
"They play frantic, panicky
ball. They flail their arms a lot
and can be brutal on drives.
They can be four goals ahead

and still play panicky."
Junior Robby Arnold agreed
with his teammate about the
Trojans' mental attitude.
"USC will come in walking
five feet off the ground," he
said, "but if we score two goals
right away, the game will be
over.
"They're an inexperienced
team," Arnold added. "They
have four freshmen on the
starting team. If we take advan
tage of our experience, we
should win."
Whether or not the poloists
win, they will return to de-
Guerre tomorrow at 11 a.m. to
play a non-conference game
against UC-lrvine, which
earned them No. 1 national
ranking after beating Cal. Last
week Irvine beat the Cards 9-7
at Irvine.
Though the outcome of the
game will not affect Stanford's
Pac-8 standing, the Cards are
looking for revenge.
"We're going to employ the
same strategy as last week,"
Dettamanti said, "but we're
going to have to execute it bet
ter. We have to stop (Irvine's)
Ed Figueroa. He's the best
water polo player in the coun
try. Irvine is an explosive team
so we can't afford to relax, par

ticularly on defense.
"We'd like to beat Irvine to
get the No. 1 seeding for the
nationals. We've made it dif
ficult for ourselves by getting
into a 'must win' situation.
We're going to have to do it the
hard way, now."
If Stanford beats UC Irvine
and then goes on to take the
Pac-8 crown, the No. 1 seeding
could make a difference. The
way nationals are structured,
the No. 1 team usually playsthe
No. 4 seed, while the No. 2 and
No. 3 seeds play each other.
Ideally, said Dettamanti,
Stanford's No. 1 rankingwould
then pit them against a rela
tively weaker team, while Ber
keley and Irvine would play,
eliminating one of them right
off.
For this situation to occur,
however, Stanford's play will
have to be its best in the next
few weeks. Dettamanti's re
cent practices have reflected
this fact.
"We're working a lot harder
in practice," he said. "We're
working toward a goal of being
able to play with more inten
sity, especially when the team
is tired."
If so, this weekend should
be a good test.
