# U.N. reaction to crackdown
## U.S., Western nations set South African arms ban 
### 
United Nations, N.Y. (AP) — The
United States and its Western
partners agreed yesterday to request
a six-month renewable arms em
bargo against South Africa. The
proposal does not include stiff
economic sanctions demanded by
several black-ruled African states.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young
and other Western diplomats met
with several key African delegates to
present the plan. The 49-nation Afri
can Group is to meet today to decide
whether to back it.
Western sources here also said the
plan calls on U.N. members to "re
view" their economic relations with
South Africa.
Sanctions called
The African group called for strong
sanctions against South Africa be
cause of the white-minority govern
ment's crackdown last week on black
dissidents and other opponents of
the national policy of apartheid, or
racial separation.
African sources immediately voi
ced misgivings about the Western
proposal, citing its time limit and the
lack of binding economic sanctions
aimed at crippling the white-minority
Pretoria government.
Black African states have been
pushing for resolutions calling on
governments to halt new investment
in South Africa and measures to im
pose an oil embargo against the
country.
U.N. embargo
President Jimmy Carter said at a
news conference earlier yesterday
the United States would support a
mandatory U.N. embargoon military
sales to South Africa. He said no de
cision had been made on economic
sanctions.
Two years ago, the United States,
Britain and France used their veto
power as permanent members of the
council to kill a similar arms embargo
proposal.

Negotiations this week among the
United States, Britain, France, West
Germany and Canada overcame ini
tial differences and the nations were
able to reach agreement on a prop
osed resolution.
Immediate
Western sources said the plan
would impose an immediate man
datory arms embargo against South
Africa. The Security Council would
review the situation in six months to
decide whether to continue it.
The Security Council could extend
the embargo to any nation violating
the restrictions against South Africa.
The proposal would condemn
South Africa's crackdown on black
organizations, newspapers and dis
sidents and call on the Pretoria gov

ernment to rescind the restrictive
measures imposed last week.
The draft resolution also calls for a
full and open judicial inquiry into the
deaths of blacks who were being
held in police detention. The mys
terious death of black activist Steve
Biko in a police cell last month
caused an international protest.
Medical sources say an autopsy
report showed Biko died of extensive
brain injury. The South African gov
ernment has ordered an inquest.
The Western proposal calls on
governments to establish codes of
conduct for foreign companies
operating in South Africa, the

U.N. embargo
President Jimmy Carter said at a
news conference earlier yesterday
the United States would support a
mandatory U.N. embargoon military
sales to South Africa. He said no de
cision had been made on economic
sanctions.
Two years ago, the United States,
Britain and France used their veto
power as permanent members of the
council to kill a similar arms embargo
proposal.

Negotiations this week among the
United States, Britain, France, West
Germany and Canada overcame ini
tial differences and the nations were
able to reach agreement on a prop
osed resolution.
Immediate
Western sources said the plan
would impose an immediate man
datory arms embargo against South
Africa. The Security Council would
review the situation in six months to
decide whether to continue it.
The Security Council could extend
the embargo to any nation violating
the restrictions against South Africa.
The proposal would condemn
South Africa's crackdown on black
organizations, newspapers and dis
sidents and call on the Pretoria gov

ernment to rescind the restrictive
measures imposed last week.
The draft resolution also calls for a
full and open judicial inquiry into the
deaths of blacks who were being
held in police detention. The mys
terious death of black activist Steve
Biko in a police cell last month
caused an international protest.
Medical sources say an autopsy
report showed Biko died of extensive
brain injury. The South African gov
ernment has ordered an inquest.
The Western proposal calls on
governments to establish codes of
conduct for foreign companies
operating in South Africa, the
sources said, in an apparent gesture
to African calls for economic sanc
tions.
United Nations, N.Y. (AP) — The
United States and its Western
partners agreed yesterday to request
a six-month renewable arms em
bargo against South Africa. The
proposal does not include stiff
economic sanctions demanded by
several black-ruled African states.
U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young
and other Western diplomats met
with several key African delegates to
present the plan. The 49-nation Afri
can Group is to meet today to decide
whether to back it.
Western sources here also said the
plan calls on U.N. members to "re
view" their economic relations with
South Africa.
Sanctions called

sanctions against South Africa be
cause of the white-minority govern
ment's crackdown last week on black
dissidents and other opponents of
the national policy of apartheid, or
racial separation.
