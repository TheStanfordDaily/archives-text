# Rolling Thunder
## Medicine man praises natural lifestyle 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Rolling Thunder, the pub
licized Cherokee medicine
man, came to Stanford two
weekends ago. He was half an
hour late for his morning lec
ture. The hostess said he told
her they were on "Indian
time."
The audience, numbering
some 150 persons, had paid 15
dollars a head to come to
Memorial Auditorium to hear
Rolling Thunder speak for an
hour and a half in the morning
and for some hours in the af
ternoon.
Persons who had stood in
line since eight in the morning
had various reasons for coming
to the event sponsored by the
Center of Creative Conscious

ness of Palo Alto.
A middle-aged couple said
their instructor, a Chippewa
Indian at DeAnza College, told
them to come hear Rolling
Thunder. Two young women
had heard of him when he had
been traveling with Bob Dylan
and Joan Baez in the "Rolling
Thunder Review" a few years
ago. A middle aged woman had
read Doug Boyd's book, "Rol
ling Thunder" and was "curi
ous to see this man Rolling
Thunder."
Healing
In Boyd's book, some tir
ring paragraphs describe how
Rolling Thunder healed a
man's leg injury at Council
Crove, Kansas in 1971 before a
psychology of consciousness

conference.
Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design
on the back. Black eagle feath
ers stuck out of his white
Panama hat.
His voice had a twang like
that of the narrator of Walt
Disney wildlife movies. He
brought with him about a
dozen men and women who
sat behind his podium. They
would beat a drum and sing
when Rolling Thunder felt it
would be appropriate.
"There are many levels of
consciousness, you know. And
if you don't know, I'm telling
you," Rolling Thunder began.
"People here (in the Bay
Area) are not all dead yet. I've
seen it in Los Angeles. People
