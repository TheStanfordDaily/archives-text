# Rolling Thunder
## Medicine man praises natural lifestyle 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Rolling Thunder, the pub
licized Cherokee medicine
man, came to Stanford two
weekends ago. He was half an
hour late for his morning lec
ture. The hostess said he told
her they were on "Indian
time."
The audience, numbering
some 150 persons, had paid 15
dollars a head to come to
Memorial Auditorium to hear
Rolling Thunder speak for an
hour and a half in the morning
and for some hours in the af
ternoon.
Persons who had stood in
line since eight in the morning
had various reasons for coming
to the event sponsored by the
Center of Creative Conscious

ness of Palo Alto.
A middle-aged couple said
their instructor, a Chippewa
Indian at DeAnza College, told
them to come hear Rolling
Thunder. Two young women
had heard of him when he had
been traveling with Bob Dylan
and Joan Baez in the "Rolling
Thunder Review" a few years
ago. A middle aged woman had
read Doug Boyd's book, "Rol
ling Thunder" and was "curi
ous to see this man Rolling
Thunder."
Healing
In Boyd's book, some tir
ring paragraphs describe how
Rolling Thunder healed a
man's leg injury at Council
Crove, Kansas in 1971 before a
psychology of consciousness

conference.
Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design
on the back. Black eagle feath
ers stuck out of his white
Panama hat.
His voice had a twang like
that of the narrator of Walt
Disney wildlife movies. He
brought with him about a
dozen men and women who
sat behind his podium. They
would beat a drum and sing
when Rolling Thunder felt it
would be appropriate.
"There are many levels of
consciousness, you know. And
if you don't know, I'm telling
you," Rolling Thunder began.
"People here (in the Bay
Area) are not all dead yet. I've
seen it in Los Angeles. People

had become so depressed in
the middle of the city, you
couldn't get them to smile," he
observed.
Devil
The white man brought the
devil to this country, said Rol
ling Thunder. "They needed it
to control their people through
fear and evil.
"With fear, people become
so apathetic. They don't even
help each other."
He glared at the audience.
"You don't even know who
your neighbor is."
"There are some of the white
race and others who have good
hearts and are sincere, who
don't just sit and meditate. Our
(Indian) religion is an activist
religion. Every thought, 24
hours a day, is a prayer," he
said.
Meta Tantay
The day long program was a
benefit for Meta Tantay, Rol
ling Thunder's communal
camp near Carlin, Nevada lo
cated 250 miles east of Reno
where he teaches the ways of
traditionalist Indians.
Only those accepted by Rol
ling Thunderand his Shoshone

wife and others at the camp
may stay.
"Sure we take a lot of whites.
We clean them up and make
men and young women out of
them. And sometimes we send
them home to you.
"I can teach them to be high
all the time without alcohol or
drugs. You can be thankful that
we take one of yours," he told
the primarily white audience.
"Your ancestors came here
thinking they knew all the
answers to everything and they
thought we were savage be
cause we didn't have devils and
hell fires," Rolling Thunder
continued.
Rain
Rolling Thunder explained
that when he becomes angry, it
mysteriously starts to rain
sometimes.
Rolling Thunder said once,
officials in Marin County asked
him to make it rain there.
"It's not that simple. I can't
do something just because I
want it or we want it. It's what
the Great Spirit wants, what's
deserved or qualified that is
done."
After his morning speech,
Rolling Thunder said he was

not "political."
"We're not racist or anti
anything. We're not a political
party. Abuses in political
power happen in Washington
D.C. Where abuse exists, we
bring it out into the open. But
we're not political," he said.
Sharing the ways of the
traditionalist Indian with non-
Indians does not seem to
bother Rolling Thunder.
"It's a sorting out process.
There are good people and bad
people. What a person is, what
they're doing, what's in their
heart and in mine, that's what's
important," he said.
For sale
Before the group broke for
lunch, Rolling Thunder re
minded the audience not to
forget to pick up some litera
ture on Meta Tantay (for a small
contribution) and that there
were Rolling Thunder posters
and Meta Tantay T-shirts on
sale, too.
A tribesman of Rolling
Thunder also was selling "au
thentic Indian jewelry" in
Mem Aud lobby, he said.
Reactionsto Rolling Thunder
among Stanford's Native
American community were

mixed.
"The name Rolling Thunder
can be translated as 'a lot of
noise but nothing else.' And
that's sort of the opinion of
many Indians in thatarea," said
Sharon Malotte, a Shoshone
from the South Fork Indian Re
servation in Nevada.
And the Meta Tantay camp is
"an eyesore, a tourist trap for
the rich," she added.
"The people who go there
(Meta Tantay) are not so much
Indians than the type of people
who would go to such a place,"
said Didi Almeida, a
Shawnee-Delaware.
Almeida said that during the
afternoon when Rolling Thun
der had taken the audience
outdoors to do some Indian
dancing, he had quipped,
"You dance like a bunch of
Navajos."
"That is very insulting," said
Almeida.
Approach
What seemed to upset some
Native American students was
Rolling Thunder's approach to
being a medicine man.
"There is a blanket secret
policy on everything that goes
on in medicine. The elders of a
tribe teach the secrets to
youngsters who show the in
clination toward and who live
up to the commitments of be
coming medicine men.
"It's not hanging out your
shingle saying 'Medicine Man
Here,' " said Malotte.
Malotte said those seeking
help from medicine men found
out about them by word
of mouth. The specific where
abouts of medicine men are
not known, she said.
"Most of the people he tells
he's a medicine man don't un
derstand what being a
medicine man is all about,"
said David Eisenberg, a Taos
Pueblo.
"RT"
"I was disgusted with the
whole thing," said Gail
Anagick, an Alaskan Eskimo
who heard Rolling Thunder
speak.
"It was one big advertise
ment of his ranch and how well
it's doing. I tried to look at him

.. .figuring he could be really
telling something important,
but I just could not see him as
valid."
"How many men would call
their medicine man RT?" said
Eisenberg. Many of Rolling
Thunder's group called him
RT.
"I don't think any true
medicine man would go out
and make money on his relig
ion. You don't capitalize on
something sacred," said
Anagick.
The students agreed with
Rolling Thunder, however, on
how Native Americans tend
to think of themselves in terms
of American society.
"We refer to ourselves as
human beings. Evervoneelse is
American and we're Indians,"
said Eisenberg. "You can be
walking down the street and
you can spot them (an Indian).
You go up to them and ask,
'What tribe are you from' and
not 'Are you Indian?'
"We respect nature, the
things we actually see like wa
ter, sun, the land. We believe
in and worship them," Eisen
berg said.

Rolling Thunder, the pub
licized Cherokee medicine
man, came to Stanford two
weekends ago. He was half an
hour late for his morning lec
ture. The hostess said he told
her they were on "Indian
time."
The audience, numbering
some 150 persons, had paid 15
dollars a head to come to
Memorial Auditorium to hear
Rolling Thunder speak for an
hour and a half in the morning
and for some hours in the af
ternoon.
Persons who had stood in
line since eight in the morning
had various reasons for coming
to the event sponsored by the
Center of Creative Conscious

ness of Palo Alto.
A middle-aged couple said
their instructor, a Chippewa
Indian at DeAnza College, told
them to come hear Rolling
Thunder. Two young women
had heard of him when he had
been traveling with Bob Dylan
and Joan Baez in the "Rolling
Thunder Review" a few years
ago. A middle aged woman had
read Doug Boyd's book, "Rol
ling Thunder" and was "curi
ous to see this man Rolling
Thunder."
Healing
In Boyd's book, some tir
ring paragraphs describe how
Rolling Thunder healed a
man's leg injury at Council
Crove, Kansas in 1971 before a
psychology of consciousness

conference.
Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design

had become so depressed in
the middle of the city, you
couldn't get them to smile," he
observed.
Devil
The white man brought the
devil to this country, said Rol
ling Thunder. "They needed it
to control their people through
fear and evil.
"With fear, people become
so apathetic. They don't even
help each other."
He glared at the audience.
"You don't even know who
your neighbor is."
"There are some of the white
race and others who have good
hearts and are sincere, who
don't just sit and meditate. Our
(Indian) religion is an activist
religion. Every thought, 24
hours a day, is a prayer," he
said.
Meta Tantay
The day long program was a
benefit for Meta Tantay, Rol
ling Thunder's communal
camp near Carlin, Nevada lo
cated 250 miles east of Reno
where he teaches the ways of
traditionalist Indians.
Only those accepted by Rol
ling Thunderand his Shoshone

wife and others at the camp
may stay.
"Sure we take a lot of whites.
We clean them up and make
men and young women out of
them. And sometimes we send
them home to you.
"I can teach them to be high
all the time without alcohol or
drugs. You can be thankful that
we take one of yours," he told
the primarily white audience.
"Your ancestors came here
thinking they knew all the
answers to everything and they
thought we were savage be
cause we didn't have devils and
hell fires," Rolling Thunder
continued.
Rain
Rolling Thunder explained
that when he becomes angry, it
mysteriously starts to rain
sometimes.
Rolling Thunder said once,
officials in Marin County asked
him to make it rain there.
"It's not that simple. I can't
do something just because I
want it or we want it. It's what
the Great Spirit wants, what's
deserved or qualified that is
done."
After his morning speech,
Rolling Thunder said he was

not "political."
"We're not racist or anti
anything. We're not a political
party. Abuses in political
power happen in Washington
D.C. Where abuse exists, we
bring it out into the open. But
we're not political," he said.
Sharing the ways of the
traditionalist Indian with non-
Indians does not seem to
bother Rolling Thunder.
"It's a sorting out process.
There are good people and bad
people. What a person is, what
they're doing, what's in their
heart and in mine, that's what's
important," he said.
For sale
Before the group broke for
lunch, Rolling Thunder re
minded the audience not to
forget to pick up some litera
ture on Meta Tantay (for a small
contribution) and that there
were Rolling Thunder posters
and Meta Tantay T-shirts on
sale, too.
A tribesman of Rolling
Thunder also was selling "au
thentic Indian jewelry" in
Mem Aud lobby, he said.
Reactionsto Rolling Thunder
among Stanford's Native
American community were

mixed.
"The name Rolling Thunder
can be translated as 'a lot of
noise but nothing else.' And
that's sort of the opinion of
many Indians in thatarea," said
Sharon Malotte, a Shoshone
from the South Fork Indian Re
servation in Nevada.
And the Meta Tantay camp is
"an eyesore, a tourist trap for
the rich," she added.
"The people who go there
(Meta Tantay) are not so much
Indians than the type of people
who would go to such a place,"
said Didi Almeida, a
Shawnee-Delaware.
Almeida said that during the
afternoon when Rolling Thun
der had taken the audience
outdoors to do some Indian
dancing, he had quipped,
"You dance like a bunch of
Navajos."
"That is very insulting," said
Almeida.
Approach
What seemed to upset some
Native American students was
Rolling Thunder's approach to
being a medicine man.
"There is a blanket secret
policy on everything that goes
on in medicine. The elders of a
tribe teach the secrets to
youngsters who show the in
clination toward and who live
up to the commitments of be
coming medicine men.
"It's not hanging out your
shingle saying 'Medicine Man
Here,' " said Malotte.
Malotte said those seeking
help from medicine men found
out about them by word
of mouth. The specific where
abouts of medicine men are
not known, she said.
"Most of the people he tells
he's a medicine man don't un
derstand what being a
medicine man is all about,"
said David Eisenberg, a Taos
Pueblo.
"RT"
"I was disgusted with the
whole thing," said Gail
Anagick, an Alaskan Eskimo
who heard Rolling Thunder
speak.
"It was one big advertise
ment of his ranch and how well
it's doing. I tried to look at him

.. .figuring he could be really
telling something important,
but I just could not see him as
valid."
"How many men would call
their medicine man RT?" said
Eisenberg. Many of Rolling
Thunder's group called him
RT.
"I don't think any true
medicine man would go out
and make money on his relig
ion. You don't capitalize on
something sacred," said
Anagick.
The students agreed with
Rolling Thunder, however, on
how Native Americans tend
to think of themselves in terms
of American society.
"We refer to ourselves as
human beings. Evervoneelse is
American and we're Indians,"
said Eisenberg. "You can be
walking down the street and
you can spot them (an Indian).
You go up to them and ask,
'What tribe are you from' and
not 'Are you Indian?'
"We respect nature, the
things we actually see like wa
ter, sun, the land. We believe
in and worship them," Eisen
berg said.

Sharon Malotte
Rolling Thunder, the pub
licized Cherokee medicine
man, came to Stanford two
weekends ago. He was half an
hour late for his morning lec
ture. The hostess said he told
her they were on "Indian
time."
The audience, numbering
some 150 persons, had paid 15
dollars a head to come to
Memorial Auditorium to hear
Rolling Thunder speak for an
hour and a half in the morning
and for some hours in the af
ternoon.
Persons who had stood in
line since eight in the morning
had various reasons for coming
to the event sponsored by the
Center of Creative Conscious

ness of Palo Alto.
A middle-aged couple said
their instructor, a Chippewa
Indian at DeAnza College, told
them to come hear Rolling
Thunder. Two young women
had heard of him when he had
been traveling with Bob Dylan
and Joan Baez in the "Rolling
Thunder Review" a few years
ago. A middle aged woman had
read Doug Boyd's book, "Rol
ling Thunder" and was "curi
ous to see this man Rolling
Thunder."
Healing
In Boyd's book, some tir
ring paragraphs describe how
Rolling Thunder healed a
man's leg injury at Council
Crove, Kansas in 1971 before a
psychology of consciousness

conference.
Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design
on the back. Black eagle feath
ers stuck out of his white
Panama hat.
His voice had a twang like
that of the narrator of Walt
Disney wildlife movies. He
brought with him about a

Rolling Thunder said he was

not "political."
"We're not racist or anti
anything. We're not a political
party. Abuses in political
power happen in Washington
D.C. Where abuse exists, we
bring it out into the open. But
we're not political," he said.
Sharing the ways of the
traditionalist Indian with non-
Indians does not seem to
bother Rolling Thunder.
"It's a sorting out process.
There are good people and bad
people. What a person is, what
they're doing, what's in their
heart and in mine, that's what's
important," he said.
For sale
Before the group broke for
lunch, Rolling Thunder re
minded the audience not to
forget to pick up some litera
ture on Meta Tantay (for a small
contribution) and that there
were Rolling Thunder posters
and Meta Tantay T-shirts on
sale, too.
A tribesman of Rolling
Thunder also was selling "au
thentic Indian jewelry" in
Mem Aud lobby, he said.
Reactionsto Rolling Thunder
among Stanford's Native
American community were

mixed.
"The name Rolling Thunder
can be translated as 'a lot of
noise but nothing else.' And
that's sort of the opinion of
many Indians in thatarea," said
Sharon Malotte, a Shoshone
from the South Fork Indian Re
servation in Nevada.
And the Meta Tantay camp is
"an eyesore, a tourist trap for
the rich," she added.
"The people who go there
(Meta Tantay) are not so much
Indians than the type of people
who would go to such a place,"
said Didi Almeida, a
Shawnee-Delaware.
Almeida said that during the
afternoon when Rolling Thun
der had taken the audience
outdoors to do some Indian
dancing, he had quipped,
"You dance like a bunch of
Navajos."
"That is very insulting," said
Almeida.
Approach
What seemed to upset some
Native American students was
Rolling Thunder's approach to
being a medicine man.
"There is a blanket secret
policy on everything that goes
on in medicine. The elders of a
tribe teach the secrets to
youngsters who show the in
clination toward and who live
up to the commitments of be
coming medicine men.
"It's not hanging out your
shingle saying 'Medicine Man
Here,' " said Malotte.
Malotte said those seeking
help from medicine men found
out about them by word
of mouth. The specific where
abouts of medicine men are
not known, she said.
"Most of the people he tells
he's a medicine man don't un
derstand what being a
medicine man is all about,"
said David Eisenberg, a Taos
Pueblo.
"RT"
"I was disgusted with the
whole thing," said Gail
Anagick, an Alaskan Eskimo
who heard Rolling Thunder
speak.
"It was one big advertise
ment of his ranch and how well
it's doing. I tried to look at him

.. .figuring he could be really
telling something important,
but I just could not see him as
valid."
"How many men would call
their medicine man RT?" said
Eisenberg. Many of Rolling
Thunder's group called him
RT.
"I don't think any true
medicine man would go out
and make money on his relig
ion. You don't capitalize on
something sacred," said
Anagick.
The students agreed with
Rolling Thunder, however, on
how Native Americans tend
to think of themselves in terms
of American society.
"We refer to ourselves as
human beings. Evervoneelse is
American and we're Indians,"
said Eisenberg. "You can be
walking down the street and
you can spot them (an Indian).
You go up to them and ask,
'What tribe are you from' and
not 'Are you Indian?'
"We respect nature, the
things we actually see like wa
ter, sun, the land. We believe
in and worship them," Eisen
berg said.

Sharon Malotte
Rolling Thunder, the pub
licized Cherokee medicine
man, came to Stanford two
weekends ago. He was half an
hour late for his morning lec
ture. The hostess said he told
her they were on "Indian
time."
The audience, numbering
some 150 persons, had paid 15
dollars a head to come to
Memorial Auditorium to hear
Rolling Thunder speak for an
hour and a half in the morning
and for some hours in the af
ternoon.
Persons who had stood in
line since eight in the morning
had various reasons for coming
to the event sponsored by the
Center of Creative Conscious

ness of Palo Alto.
A middle-aged couple said
their instructor, a Chippewa
Indian at DeAnza College, told
them to come hear Rolling
Thunder. Two young women
had heard of him when he had
been traveling with Bob Dylan
and Joan Baez in the "Rolling
Thunder Review" a few years
ago. A middle aged woman had
read Doug Boyd's book, "Rol
ling Thunder" and was "curi
ous to see this man Rolling
Thunder."
Healing
In Boyd's book, some tir
ring paragraphs describe how
Rolling Thunder healed a
man's leg injury at Council
Crove, Kansas in 1971 before a
psychology of consciousness

conference.
Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design
on the back. Black eagle feath
ers stuck out of his white
Panama hat.
His voice had a twang like
that of the narrator of Walt
Disney wildlife movies. He
brought with him about a
dozen men and women who
sat behind his podium. They
would beat a drum and sing
when Rolling Thunder felt it
would be appropriate.
"There are many levels of
consciousness, you know. And
if you don't know, I'm telling
you," Rolling Thunder began.
"People here (in the Bay
Area) are not all dead yet. I've
seen it in Los Angeles. People

had become so depressed in
the middle of the city, you
couldn't get them to smile," he
observed.
Devil
The white man brought the
devil to this country, said Rol
ling Thunder. "They needed it
to control their people through
fear and evil.
"With fear, people become
so apathetic. They don't even
help each other."
He glared at the audience.
"You don't even know who
your neighbor is."
"There are some of the white
race and others who have good
hearts and are sincere, who
don't just sit and meditate. Our
(Indian) religion is an activist
religion. Every thought, 24
hours a day, is a prayer," he
said.
Meta Tantay
The day long program was a
benefit for Meta Tantay, Rol
ling Thunder's communal
camp near Carlin, Nevada lo
cated 250 miles east of Reno
where he teaches the ways of
traditionalist Indians.
Only those accepted by Rol
ling Thunderand his Shoshone

wife and others at the camp
may stay.
"Sure we take a lot of whites.
We clean them up and make
men and young women out of
them. And sometimes we send
them home to you.
"I can teach them to be high
all the time without alcohol or
drugs. You can be thankful that
we take one of yours," he told
the primarily white audience.
"Your ancestors came here
thinking they knew all the
answers to everything and they
thought we were savage be
cause we didn't have devils and
hell fires," Rolling Thunder
continued.
Rain
Rolling Thunder explained
that when he becomes angry, it
mysteriously starts to rain
sometimes.
Rolling Thunder said once,
officials in Marin County asked
him to make it rain there.
"It's not that simple. I can't
do something just because I
want it or we want it. It's what
the Great Spirit wants, what's
deserved or qualified that is
done."
After his morning speech,
Rolling Thunder said he was

not "political."
"We're not racist or anti
anything. We're not a political
party. Abuses in political
power happen in Washington
D.C. Where abuse exists, we
bring it out into the open. But

Pueblo.
"RT"
"I was disgusted with the
whole thing," said Gail
Anagick, an Alaskan Eskimo
who heard Rolling Thunder
speak.
"It was one big advertise
ment of his ranch and how well
it's doing. I tried to look at him

.. .figuring he could be really
telling something important,
but I just could not see him as
valid."
"How many men would call
their medicine man RT?" said
Eisenberg. Many of Rolling
Thunder's group called him
RT.
"I don't think any true
medicine man would go out
and make money on his relig
ion. You don't capitalize on
something sacred," said
Anagick.
The students agreed with
Rolling Thunder, however, on
how Native Americans tend
to think of themselves in terms
of American society.
"We refer to ourselves as
human beings. Evervoneelse is
American and we're Indians,"
said Eisenberg. "You can be
walking down the street and
you can spot them (an Indian).
You go up to them and ask,
'What tribe are you from' and
not 'Are you Indian?'
"We respect nature, the
things we actually see like wa
ter, sun, the land. We believe
in and worship them," Eisen
berg said.

Rolling Thunder, the pub
licized Cherokee medicine
man, came to Stanford two
weekends ago. He was half an
hour late for his morning lec
ture. The hostess said he told
her they were on "Indian
time."
The audience, numbering
some 150 persons, had paid 15
dollars a head to come to
Memorial Auditorium to hear
Rolling Thunder speak for an
hour and a half in the morning
and for some hours in the af
ternoon.
Persons who had stood in
line since eight in the morning
had various reasons for coming
to the event sponsored by the
Center of Creative Conscious

ness of Palo Alto.
A middle-aged couple said
their instructor, a Chippewa
Indian at DeAnza College, told
them to come hear Rolling
Thunder. Two young women
had heard of him when he had
been traveling with Bob Dylan
and Joan Baez in the "Rolling
Thunder Review" a few years
ago. A middle aged woman had
read Doug Boyd's book, "Rol
ling Thunder" and was "curi
ous to see this man Rolling
Thunder."
Healing
In Boyd's book, some tir
ring paragraphs describe how
Rolling Thunder healed a
man's leg injury at Council
Crove, Kansas in 1971 before a
psychology of consciousness

conference.
Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design
on the back. Black eagle feath
ers stuck out of his white
Panama hat.
His voice had a twang like
that of the narrator of Walt
Disney wildlife movies. He
brought with him about a
dozen men and women who
sat behind his podium. They
would beat a drum and sing
when Rolling Thunder felt it
would be appropriate.
"There are many levels of
consciousness, you know. And
if you don't know, I'm telling
you," Rolling Thunder began.
"People here (in the Bay
Area) are not all dead yet. I've
seen it in Los Angeles. People

had become so depressed in
the middle of the city, you
couldn't get them to smile," he
observed.
Devil
The white man brought the
devil to this country, said Rol
ling Thunder. "They needed it
to control their people through
fear and evil.
"With fear, people become
so apathetic. They don't even
help each other."
He glared at the audience.
"You don't even know who
your neighbor is."
"There are some of the white
race and others who have good
hearts and are sincere, who
don't just sit and meditate. Our
(Indian) religion is an activist
religion. Every thought, 24
hours a day, is a prayer," he
said.
Meta Tantay
The day long program was a
benefit for Meta Tantay, Rol
ling Thunder's communal
camp near Carlin, Nevada lo
cated 250 miles east of Reno
where he teaches the ways of
traditionalist Indians.
Only those accepted by Rol
ling Thunderand his Shoshone

wife and others at the camp
may stay.
"Sure we take a lot of whites.
We clean them up and make
men and young women out of
them. And sometimes we send
them home to you.
"I can teach them to be high
all the time without alcohol or
drugs. You can be thankful that
we take one of yours," he told
the primarily white audience.
"Your ancestors came here
thinking they knew all the
answers to everything and they
thought we were savage be
cause we didn't have devils and
hell fires," Rolling Thunder
continued.
Rain
Rolling Thunder explained
that when he becomes angry, it
mysteriously starts to rain
sometimes.
Rolling Thunder said once,
officials in Marin County asked
him to make it rain there.
"It's not that simple. I can't
do something just because I
want it or we want it. It's what
the Great Spirit wants, what's
deserved or qualified that is
done."
After his morning speech,
Rolling Thunder said he was

not "political."
"We're not racist or anti
anything. We're not a political
party. Abuses in political
power happen in Washington
D.C. Where abuse exists, we
bring it out into the open. But
we're not political," he said.
Sharing the ways of the
traditionalist Indian with non-
Indians does not seem to
bother Rolling Thunder.
"It's a sorting out process.
There are good people and bad
people. What a person is, what
they're doing, what's in their
heart and in mine, that's what's
important," he said.
For sale
Before the group broke for
lunch, Rolling Thunder re
minded the audience not to
forget to pick up some litera
ture on Meta Tantay (for a small
contribution) and that there
were Rolling Thunder posters
and Meta Tantay T-shirts on
sale, too.
A tribesman of Rolling
Thunder also was selling "au
thentic Indian jewelry" in
Mem Aud lobby, he said.
Reactionsto Rolling Thunder
among Stanford's Native
American community were

mixed.
"The name Rolling Thunder
can be translated as 'a lot of
noise but nothing else.' And
that's sort of the opinion of
many Indians in thatarea," said
Sharon Malotte, a Shoshone
from the South Fork Indian Re
servation in Nevada.
And the Meta Tantay camp is
"an eyesore, a tourist trap for
the rich," she added.
"The people who go there
(Meta Tantay) are not so much
Indians than the type of people
who would go to such a place,"
said Didi Almeida, a
Shawnee-Delaware.
Almeida said that during the
afternoon when Rolling Thun
der had taken the audience
outdoors to do some Indian
dancing, he had quipped,
"You dance like a bunch of
Navajos."
"That is very insulting," said
Almeida.
Approach
What seemed to upset some
Native American students was
Rolling Thunder's approach to
being a medicine man.
"There is a blanket secret
policy on everything that goes
on in medicine. The elders of a
tribe teach the secrets to
youngsters who show the in
clination toward and who live
up to the commitments of be
coming medicine men.
"It's not hanging out your
shingle saying 'Medicine Man
Here,' " said Malotte.
Malotte said those seeking
help from medicine men found
out about them by word
of mouth. The specific where
abouts of medicine men are
not known, she said.
"Most of the people he tells
he's a medicine man don't un
derstand what being a
medicine man is all about,"
said David Eisenberg, a Taos
Pueblo.
"RT"
"I was disgusted with the

Rolling Thunder used a black
feather during the ritual. He
also sucked the men's injury,
all the while making "sniffing,
howling and wailing sounds
unlike any of the ordinary
sounds made by man," accord
ing to Boyd.
Boyd also recounts how Rol
ling Thunder seemed to know
when to expect thunder or
rain.
"l ightning rain or thunder —
the intended phenomenon
had always appeared at the in
tended time and place," writes
Boyd.
Those in the Stanford audi
ence who might have wished
to hear great truths or a deep
philosophical discussion from

Rolling Thunder that day
should have read Boyd's book
where he quotes Rolling
Thunder saying, "The teach
ings don't come like some
people think.
"You can't just sit down and
talk about the truth. It doesn't
work that way. You have to live
it and be part of it and you
might get to know it. I say you
might."
Obviously, Mem Aud was
just not the right place or time.
But Rolling Thunder, hold
ing a cone of black eagle feath
ers and wearing white khaki
pants tucked into black calf
high boots, did touch lightly on
many topics.
Rolling Thunder is about 61
years old but looks 45. His

white shirt had colorful cuffs
and a black Indian bird design
on the back. Black eagle feath
ers stuck out of his white
Panama hat.
His voice had a twang like
that of the narrator of Walt
Disney wildlife movies. He
brought with him about a
dozen men and women who
sat behind his podium. They
would beat a drum and sing
when Rolling Thunder felt it
would be appropriate.
"There are many levels of
consciousness, you know. And
if you don't know, I'm telling
you," Rolling Thunder began.
"People here (in the Bay
Area) are not all dead yet. I've
seen it in Los Angeles. People

had become so depressed in
the middle of the city, you
couldn't get them to smile," he
observed.
Devil
The white man brought the
devil to this country, said Rol
ling Thunder. "They needed it
to control their people through
fear and evil.
"With fear, people become
so apathetic. They don't even
help each other."
He glared at the audience.
"You don't even know who
your neighbor is."
"There are some of the white
race and others who have good
hearts and are sincere, who
don't just sit and meditate. Our
(Indian) religion is an activist
religion. Every thought, 24
hours a day, is a prayer," he
said.
Meta Tantay
The day long program was a
benefit for Meta Tantay, Rol
ling Thunder's communal
camp near Carlin, Nevada lo
cated 250 miles east of Reno
where he teaches the ways of
traditionalist Indians.
Only those accepted by Rol
ling Thunderand his Shoshone

wife and others at the camp
may stay.
"Sure we take a lot of whites.
We clean them up and make
men and young women out of
them. And sometimes we send
them home to you.
"I can teach them to be high
all the time without alcohol or
drugs. You can be thankful that
we take one of yours," he told
the primarily white audience.
"Your ancestors came here
thinking they knew all the
answers to everything and they
thought we were savage be
cause we didn't have devils and
hell fires," Rolling Thunder
continued.
Rain
Rolling Thunder explained
that when he becomes angry, it
mysteriously starts to rain
sometimes.
Rolling Thunder said once,
officials in Marin County asked
him to make it rain there.
"It's not that simple. I can't
do something just because I
want it or we want it. It's what
the Great Spirit wants, what's
deserved or qualified that is
done."
After his morning speech,
Rolling Thunder said he was

not "political."
"We're not racist or anti
anything. We're not a political
party. Abuses in political
power happen in Washington
D.C. Where abuse exists, we
bring it out into the open. But
we're not political," he said.
Sharing the ways of the
traditionalist Indian with non-
Indians does not seem to
bother Rolling Thunder.
"It's a sorting out process.
There are good people and bad
people. What a person is, what
they're doing, what's in their
heart and in mine, that's what's
important," he said.
For sale
Before the group broke for
lunch, Rolling Thunder re
minded the audience not to
forget to pick up some litera
ture on Meta Tantay (for a small
contribution) and that there
were Rolling Thunder posters
and Meta Tantay T-shirts on
sale, too.
A tribesman of Rolling
Thunder also was selling "au
thentic Indian jewelry" in
Mem Aud lobby, he said.
Reactionsto Rolling Thunder
among Stanford's Native
American community were

mixed.
"The name Rolling Thunder
can be translated as 'a lot of
noise but nothing else.' And
that's sort of the opinion of
many Indians in thatarea," said
Sharon Malotte, a Shoshone
from the South Fork Indian Re
servation in Nevada.
And the Meta Tantay camp is
"an eyesore, a tourist trap for
the rich," she added.
"The people who go there
(Meta Tantay) are not so much
Indians than the type of people
who would go to such a place,"
said Didi Almeida, a
Shawnee-Delaware.
Almeida said that during the
afternoon when Rolling Thun
der had taken the audience
outdoors to do some Indian
dancing, he had quipped,
"You dance like a bunch of
Navajos."
"That is very insulting," said
Almeida.
Approach
What seemed to upset some
Native American students was
Rolling Thunder's approach to
being a medicine man.
"There is a blanket secret
policy on everything that goes
on in medicine. The elders of a
tribe teach the secrets to
youngsters who show the in
clination toward and who live
up to the commitments of be
coming medicine men.
"It's not hanging out your
shingle saying 'Medicine Man
Here,' " said Malotte.
Malotte said those seeking
help from medicine men found
out about them by word
of mouth. The specific where
abouts of medicine men are
not known, she said.
"Most of the people he tells
he's a medicine man don't un
derstand what being a
medicine man is all about,"
said David Eisenberg, a Taos
Pueblo.
"RT"
"I was disgusted with the
whole thing," said Gail
Anagick, an Alaskan Eskimo
who heard Rolling Thunder
speak.
"It was one big advertise
ment of his ranch and how well
it's doing. I tried to look at him

.. .figuring he could be really
telling something important,
but I just could not see him as
valid."
"How many men would call
their medicine man RT?" said
Eisenberg. Many of Rolling
Thunder's group called him
RT.
"I don't think any true
medicine man would go out
and make money on his relig
ion. You don't capitalize on
something sacred," said
Anagick.
The students agreed with
Rolling Thunder, however, on
how Native Americans tend
to think of themselves in terms
of American society.
"We refer to ourselves as
human beings. Evervoneelse is
American and we're Indians,"
said Eisenberg. "You can be
walking down the street and
you can spot them (an Indian).
You go up to them and ask,
'What tribe are you from' and
not 'Are you Indian?'
"We respect nature, the
things we actually see like wa
ter, sun, the land. We believe
in and worship them," Eisen
berg said.
