Please help me win a bet! Which university has
the highest tuition in the nation? How do Stan
ford and USC rank? And what is the ranking of
business and law school for Stanford and USC?
-TA
A booklet called "Student Expenses at Post
secondary Institutions, 1977-78" published by
the College Entrance Examination Board, lists
tuition rates for all member colleges and univer
sities which responded to a questionaire sent
out in the spring. Certain schools, including a
certain prestigious eastern institution, did not
have the tuition figures available, and so were
not included. However, of the remaining in
stitutions, Stanford University at $4695, was
among the top ten schools with the highest tui
tion rates. The highest tuition for an under
graduate institution which I could find, was
Bennington at $5500. Of course, graduate
schools charge higher fees. The Georgetown

Medical School < harges $12,500. USC, at $3850,
was exceeded by many other schools.
As for the business and law schools, The Car
ter Report, published in January 1977, ranked
business, law and education schools across the
country. The Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness was ranked first in the nation. The Stanford
Law School placed third, behind Harvard and
Yale. The same study had the Stanford School of
Education ranked lirst. USC did not fall among
the top ten in any of the three categories.
What is all the scaffolding around the new Law
School?
-SWJ
Well, first of all, the scaffolding has already
been taken down. Rut Roger Cairns at Facilities
Planning tells me that they were used to aid
workmen who were replacing old rain gutters
with new copper ones.
