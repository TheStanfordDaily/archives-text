La Tour Eiffel
2030 Broadway at Main St.
Redwood City
Dining last Friday at one of
my favorite mid-peninsula re
staurants, La Tour Eiffel, rein
forces my high opinion of this
small, family-run restaurant.
Open less than 11 months,
its popularity regularly causes
patrons to queue up at the en
trance on Friday and Saturday
nights.

Hostess Josette Peurelle,
wife of proprietor-chef Robert
and mother of waiters Jean-
Michel and Jean-Pierre, is re
luctant to take reservations be
cause of the problems arising
frolVi holding one or more ta
bles for late arriving parties in a
restaurant of enormous popu
larity but a limited, 22 table,
capacity.
No stranger to the restaurant
business, chef Robert Peuv

relle of Lille, France, owned La
Chaumiere in Belmont before
opening La Tour Eiffel and
prior to that was chef at Marcel
in Dallas. His secret at La Tour
Eiffel, and key to its popularity,
is good food at reasonable
prices.
Wide selection
Open Tuesday through Fri
day for lunch and dinner and
Saturday for dinner only, La
Tour Eiffel's dinner menu of
fers a choice of a daily special
five-course dinner or an a la
carte selection from 18 entrees
which includes French bread
and butter, soup and salad.
Selections from four appetiz
ers, two soups, two salads and
three desserts weekdays, four
on Saturday can be ordered to
augment dinner.
The Tuesday and Wednes
day special dinners are $5.50
with roast pork with fine herbs
on Tuesday and calves' sweet
breads with mushrooms on
Wednesday. These include, as
do all special daily dinners,
French bread and butter and a
first course of fresh pate gar
nished with red cabbage, car
rots, tomatoes and parsley.
Soup follows as the second
course: ours Friday was a de
licious fish soup with mus
hrooms and pepper. A green
salad with a delicate, creamy,
French herb dressing that is un
ique to La Tour Eiffel and defi
nitely not a culinary cliche is
served as the third course.
The fourth is the entree of
the day. The price of the daily
special dinner rises to $6.95
after Wednesday with Thurs
day's entree being a standout
filet mignon with bearnaise
sauce, Friday's being roast beef
and Saturday's being filet of
beef — Duke of Wellington.
Generous bar
Friday's roast beef came gar
nished with dauphine
potatoes, a broiled tomatoe
with garlic seasoning and scall
ions, fresh mixed steamed and
buttered carrots, zucchini, red
pepper, onions and parsley
and pureed spinach.

A dessert decision between
creme caramel, chocolate
mousse or ice cream, with an
additional option of Napoleon
pastry on Saturday, brings the
special daily dinner to its con
clusion.
The a la carte menu proposes
a more self-indulgent and cor
respondingly costly dining ap
proach. Of the four a la carte
appetizers, the outstanding
fresh escargots de bourgogne
at $2.95, the crab meat a La
Tour Eiffel at $2.50, or oysters at
$2.75 present an interesting
departure to the pate offered
on both a la carte and daily spe
cial dinner selections.
A la carte entrees range from
$4.50 to $9.95 and out of 18 en
trees offered, only two are over
$6.95. The veal cordon bleu is
delicious and the rabbit with
madera sauce and prunes is the
worthy result of chef Robert's
recipe.
Dessert choices are identical
to those on the special daily
dinner and run 80 cents a la
carte. Coffee and tea are 40
cents. Domestic and imported
beer are available as well as 15
aperitifs at 55 cents or 95 cents;
no hard liquor is served.
The wine list includes a
selection of 18 French wines,
with prices beginning at $5.50
for a highly commendable red
or white burgundy Reserve La
Tour Eiffel. Eleven California
wines are included starting
with house wine at $3.50 per
carafe and estate bottle wines
from $5.50 to $7.50.
The 13 luncheon alternatives
on the menu includes house
salad and bread and butter.
Last Friday's special was stuffed
tomatoes at $2.95. Soup or pate
or ham sandwiches are availa
ble at $1.50. For $2.50, one may
choose from three omelets.
Three crepes are available at
$2.95 — seafood, poultry and
bourguignone. Poulet basque
and veal cordon blue milanais
are available at $3.50 while sir
loin steak and filet mignon are
at $3.95 for the restaurant's
most expensive lunch.

Who could ask for more? Between Stanford
Shopping Center's stylish McDonald's, and
El Camino's Frankie, Johnny and Luigi Too's
(which is something less than stylish),
there's no better place for fast food fana-

tics. The McDonald's (above) looks more
like a space age I. Magnin's. And Frankie,
Johnny and Luigi's is just long lines and the
juiciest, richest and thickest pizza in town,

Who could ask for more? Between Stanford
Shopping Center's stylish McDonald's, and
El Camino's Frankie, Johnny and Luigi Too's
(which is something less than stylish),
there's no better place for fast food fana-

tics. The McDonald's (above) looks more
like a space age I. Magnin's. And Frankie,
Johnny and Luigi's is just long lines and the
juiciest, richest and thickest pizza in town,

La Tour Eiffel
2030 Broadway at Main St.
Redwood City
Dining last Friday at one of
my favorite mid-peninsula re
staurants, La Tour Eiffel, rein
forces my high opinion of this
small, family-run restaurant.
Open less than 11 months,
its popularity regularly causes
patrons to queue up at the en
trance on Friday and Saturday
nights.

Hostess Josette Peurelle,
wife of proprietor-chef Robert
and mother of waiters Jean-
Michel and Jean-Pierre, is re
luctant to take reservations be
cause of the problems arising
frolVi holding one or more ta
bles for late arriving parties in a
restaurant of enormous popu
larity but a limited, 22 table,
capacity.
No stranger to the restaurant
business, chef Robert Peuv

relle of Lille, France, owned La
Chaumiere in Belmont before
opening La Tour Eiffel and
prior to that was chef at Marcel
in Dallas. His secret at La Tour
Eiffel, and key to its popularity,
is good food at reasonable
prices.
Wide selection
Open Tuesday through Fri
day for lunch and dinner and
Saturday for dinner only, La
Tour Eiffel's dinner menu of
fers a choice of a daily special
five-course dinner or an a la
carte selection from 18 entrees
which includes French bread
and butter, soup and salad.
Selections from four appetiz
ers, two soups, two salads and
three desserts weekdays, four
on Saturday can be ordered to
augment dinner.
The Tuesday and Wednes
day special dinners are $5.50
with roast pork with fine herbs
on Tuesday and calves' sweet
breads with mushrooms on
Wednesday. These include, as
do all special daily dinners,
French bread and butter and a
first course of fresh pate gar
nished with red cabbage, car
rots, tomatoes and parsley.
Soup follows as the second
course: ours Friday was a de
licious fish soup with mus
hrooms and pepper. A green
salad with a delicate, creamy,
French herb dressing that is un
ique to La Tour Eiffel and defi
nitely not a culinary cliche is
served as the third course.
The fourth is the entree of
the day. The price of the daily
special dinner rises to $6.95
after Wednesday with Thurs
day's entree being a standout
filet mignon with bearnaise
sauce, Friday's being roast beef
and Saturday's being filet of
beef — Duke of Wellington.
Generous bar
Friday's roast beef came gar
nished with dauphine
potatoes, a broiled tomatoe
with garlic seasoning and scall
ions, fresh mixed steamed and
buttered carrots, zucchini, red
pepper, onions and parsley
and pureed spinach.

A dessert decision between
creme caramel, chocolate
mousse or ice cream, with an
additional option of Napoleon
pastry on Saturday, brings the
special daily dinner to its con
clusion.
The a la carte menu proposes
a more self-indulgent and cor
respondingly costly dining ap
proach. Of the four a la carte
appetizers, the outstanding
fresh escargots de bourgogne
at $2.95, the crab meat a La
Tour Eiffel at $2.50, or oysters at
$2.75 present an interesting
departure to the pate offered
on both a la carte and daily spe
cial dinner selections.
A la carte entrees range from
$4.50 to $9.95 and out of 18 en
trees offered, only two are over
$6.95. The veal cordon bleu is
delicious and the rabbit with
madera sauce and prunes is the
worthy result of chef Robert's
recipe.
Dessert choices are identical
to those on the special daily
dinner and run 80 cents a la
carte. Coffee and tea are 40
cents. Domestic and imported
beer are available as well as 15
aperitifs at 55 cents or 95 cents;
no hard liquor is served.
The wine list includes a
selection of 18 French wines,
with prices beginning at $5.50
for a highly commendable red
or white burgundy Reserve La
Tour Eiffel. Eleven California
wines are included starting
with house wine at $3.50 per
carafe and estate bottle wines
from $5.50 to $7.50.
The 13 luncheon alternatives
on the menu includes house
salad and bread and butter.
Last Friday's special was stuffed
tomatoes at $2.95. Soup or pate
or ham sandwiches are availa
ble at $1.50. For $2.50, one may
choose from three omelets.
Three crepes are available at
$2.95 — seafood, poultry and

Who could ask for more? Between Stanford
Shopping Center's stylish McDonald's, and
El Camino's Frankie, Johnny and Luigi Too's
(which is something less than stylish),
there's no better place for fast food fana-

tics. The McDonald's (above) looks more
like a space age I. Magnin's. And Frankie,
Johnny and Luigi's is just long lines and the
juiciest, richest and thickest pizza in town,
(right).
La Tour Eiffel
2030 Broadway at Main St.
Redwood City
Dining last Friday at one of
my favorite mid-peninsula re
staurants, La Tour Eiffel, rein
forces my high opinion of this
small, family-run restaurant.
Open less than 11 months,
its popularity regularly causes
patrons to queue up at the en
trance on Friday and Saturday
nights.

Hostess Josette Peurelle,
wife of proprietor-chef Robert
and mother of waiters Jean-
Michel and Jean-Pierre, is re
luctant to take reservations be
cause of the problems arising
frolVi holding one or more ta
bles for late arriving parties in a
restaurant of enormous popu
larity but a limited, 22 table,
capacity.
No stranger to the restaurant
business, chef Robert Peuv

relle of Lille, France, owned La
Chaumiere in Belmont before
opening La Tour Eiffel and
prior to that was chef at Marcel
in Dallas. His secret at La Tour
Eiffel, and key to its popularity,
is good food at reasonable
prices.
Wide selection
Open Tuesday through Fri
day for lunch and dinner and
Saturday for dinner only, La
Tour Eiffel's dinner menu of
fers a choice of a daily special
five-course dinner or an a la
carte selection from 18 entrees
which includes French bread
and butter, soup and salad.
Selections from four appetiz
ers, two soups, two salads and
three desserts weekdays, four
on Saturday can be ordered to
augment dinner.
The Tuesday and Wednes
day special dinners are $5.50
with roast pork with fine herbs
on Tuesday and calves' sweet
breads with mushrooms on
Wednesday. These include, as
do all special daily dinners,
French bread and butter and a
first course of fresh pate gar
nished with red cabbage, car
rots, tomatoes and parsley.
Soup follows as the second
course: ours Friday was a de
licious fish soup with mus
hrooms and pepper. A green
salad with a delicate, creamy,
French herb dressing that is un
ique to La Tour Eiffel and defi
nitely not a culinary cliche is
served as the third course.
The fourth is the entree of
the day. The price of the daily
special dinner rises to $6.95
after Wednesday with Thurs
day's entree being a standout
filet mignon with bearnaise
sauce, Friday's being roast beef
and Saturday's being filet of
beef — Duke of Wellington.
Generous bar
Friday's roast beef came gar
nished with dauphine
potatoes, a broiled tomatoe
with garlic seasoning and scall
ions, fresh mixed steamed and
buttered carrots, zucchini, red
pepper, onions and parsley
and pureed spinach.

A dessert decision between
creme caramel, chocolate
mousse or ice cream, with an
additional option of Napoleon
pastry on Saturday, brings the
special daily dinner to its con
clusion.
The a la carte menu proposes
a more self-indulgent and cor
respondingly costly dining ap
proach. Of the four a la carte
appetizers, the outstanding
fresh escargots de bourgogne
at $2.95, the crab meat a La
Tour Eiffel at $2.50, or oysters at
$2.75 present an interesting
departure to the pate offered
on both a la carte and daily spe
cial dinner selections.
A la carte entrees range from
$4.50 to $9.95 and out of 18 en
trees offered, only two are over
$6.95. The veal cordon bleu is
delicious and the rabbit with
madera sauce and prunes is the
worthy result of chef Robert's
recipe.
Dessert choices are identical
to those on the special daily
dinner and run 80 cents a la
carte. Coffee and tea are 40
cents. Domestic and imported
beer are available as well as 15
aperitifs at 55 cents or 95 cents;
no hard liquor is served.
