Henry's
Palo Alto
482 University Avenue
Endure a 20-foot walk past
the bar in front, and Henry's in
Palo Alto offers a delightfully
cozy backroom restaurant.
For about $5 per person, pat
rons can choose between
primarily seafood and beef en
trees. These are served with
rice, vegetables and either
soup or salad.
The dining area seats no
more than 40, and candlelight,
potted plants and a profusion
of period photographs on the
walls make it hard to believe
that University Avenue is just a
few feet away.
Service is prompt and
courteous, although two items
on the menu were not available
earlier this week.
The cream of broccoli soup
is well-prepared and the
salad's Rocquefort dressing is
tangy without being overpow
ering. Also praiseworthy is the
pleasantly sweet whole grain
bread.
The broiled red snapper, at
$4.75, is a bit on the bland side,
and the beef brochette, for 20

cents more is a far better buy.
Ample pieces of tender beef
are cooked on a skewer with
onions, tomatoes and other
vegetables.
The rice is moist and fluffy
and the zucchini is fairly good,
although overcooked.
For dessert, the carrot cake is
a standout, and the mocha
cheesecake is quite good,
though the mocha flavor is a bit
more subtle than some would
have it.
The food alone would make
Henry's a choice restaurant.
But it is the ambience which
really stands out.
The entire dining room ap
pears lit by candles atop the
floral print tablecloth. Only
after scrutiny does one notice
the subdued room lights.
The photographs of persons
in styles last seen decades ago,
and the red padded benches
combine to create what is bil
led as the "New York pub" at
mosphere.
But given the condition of
New York City today, it would
seem more appropriate for
pubs in that town to strive for a
"Henry's atmosphere."
