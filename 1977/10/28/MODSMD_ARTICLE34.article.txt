# China Lion
## A 						special Chinese restaurant 
### 
The China Lion
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
For a restaurant that is only a
bit over one yearold, the China
Lion is enjoying great success
and gaining a reputation as one
of the best authentic Chinese
restaurants in the mid
peninsula area.
Located at 3345 El Camino
Real (just south of Page Mill
Road), the small restaurant
provides a comfortable atmos
phere, accommodating cus
tomers with both an indoor di
ning area and an outdoor,
candle-lit, garden patio.
But don't let the size of the
China Lion fool you: the menu
is extensive, offering a selec
tion of over 50 dishes, ranging

from Three Delight Sizzling
Rice Soup to Szechwan Duck.
For the more discerning ap
petite there is a separate menu
of exotic courses printed en
tirely in Chinese.
But, for the epicurean
layman who's not quite ready
for eggplant and squid, there
are two pre-coordinated full
meals. The "Gourmet Dinner"
(at $4.50 per person) is a meal
selected for someone who has
not had much exposure to
Chinese cuisine. This combi
nation of American favorites
includes wonton soup, egg
rolls, barbecued pork, sweet
and sour pork, cashew chic
ken, steamed rice and, of
course, tea and fortune
cookies.
For the intermediate taste,

the "Northern China Style
Dinner" (at $5.25 per person)
offers a slightly more exotic
meal, including Crab Wonton
and Kung Pao Chicken.
As with most Chinese re
staurants, it is wise to have a
large group (four people or
more) so that you can order
many of the dishes. Each dish
runs $2-$4 and the dishes are,
for the most part, plentiful. The
sweet and sour dishes are
especially good. The home
made sauce is light and spicy.
The sweet and sour pork is
boneless and there is a lot of
meat in it.
The spring rolls are crispy
and served with the traditional
Chinese vinegar and hot pep
per. Only the wonton soup is
not up to the standards of the
rest of the courses.
The China Lion is one of the
few restaurants to serve Peking
Duck with only a 45 minute or
dering time — most restaur
ants require a one-day notice.
Because nothing is prepared in
advance, some dishes require
a longer wait than others, but
are subsequently fresh and the
vegetables remain crisp.
The China Lion is not eleg
ant, but aside from an occa
sional truck swishing by on El
Camino, the atmosphere is
quiet, relaxed, and very pleas
ant. There is a private room (for
small banquets or family
gatherings) which seats 14.
Business hours are 11:30 a.m.
to 9:30 p.m. daily.

A daily combination lunch
platter (at $2.25) is coordinated
with the food deliveries to as
sure freshness. The service is
good, and judging from the
number of Chinese-speaking
customers, the more exotic
courses must be authentic and
well-prepared.
There is a wide selection of
American and European wines
costing about $5 per bottle.
There is also Mondavi house
wine at $2 per half-liter.
So, if you're tired of greasy
chop sticks, and want an au
thentic meal at a reasonable
price in a pleasant atmosphere,
check out the China Lion.

The China Lion
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
For a restaurant that is only a
bit over one yearold, the China
Lion is enjoying great success
and gaining a reputation as one
of the best authentic Chinese
restaurants in the mid
peninsula area.
Located at 3345 El Camino
Real (just south of Page Mill
Road), the small restaurant
provides a comfortable atmos
phere, accommodating cus
tomers with both an indoor di
ning area and an outdoor,
candle-lit, garden patio.
But don't let the size of the
China Lion fool you: the menu
is extensive, offering a selec
tion of over 50 dishes, ranging

from Three Delight Sizzling
Rice Soup to Szechwan Duck.
For the more discerning ap
petite there is a separate menu
of exotic courses printed en
tirely in Chinese.
But, for the epicurean
layman who's not quite ready
for eggplant and squid, there
are two pre-coordinated full
meals. The "Gourmet Dinner"
(at $4.50 per person) is a meal
selected for someone who has
not had much exposure to
Chinese cuisine. This combi
nation of American favorites
includes wonton soup, egg
rolls, barbecued pork, sweet
and sour pork, cashew chic
ken, steamed rice and, of
course, tea and fortune
cookies.
For the intermediate taste,

the "Northern China Style
Dinner" (at $5.25 per person)
offers a slightly more exotic
meal, including Crab Wonton
and Kung Pao Chicken.
As with most Chinese re
staurants, it is wise to have a
large group (four people or
more) so that you can order
many of the dishes. Each dish
runs $2-$4 and the dishes are,
for the most part, plentiful. The
sweet and sour dishes are
especially good. The home
made sauce is light and spicy.
The sweet and sour pork is
boneless and there is a lot of
meat in it.
The spring rolls are crispy
and served with the traditional
Chinese vinegar and hot pep
per. Only the wonton soup is
not up to the standards of the
rest of the courses.
The China Lion is one of the
few restaurants to serve Peking
Duck with only a 45 minute or
dering time — most restaur
ants require a one-day notice.
Because nothing is prepared in
advance, some dishes require
a longer wait than others, but
are subsequently fresh and the
vegetables remain crisp.
The China Lion is not eleg
ant, but aside from an occa
sional truck swishing by on El
Camino, the atmosphere is
quiet, relaxed, and very pleas
ant. There is a private room (for
small banquets or family
gatherings) which seats 14.
Business hours are 11:30 a.m.
to 9:30 p.m. daily.

A daily combination lunch
platter (at $2.25) is coordinated
with the food deliveries to as
sure freshness. The service is
good, and judging from the
number of Chinese-speaking
customers, the more exotic
courses must be authentic and
well-prepared.
There is a wide selection of
American and European wines
costing about $5 per bottle.
There is also Mondavi house
wine at $2 per half-liter.
So, if you're tired of greasy
chop sticks, and want an au
thentic meal at a reasonable
price in a pleasant atmosphere,
check out the China Lion.
