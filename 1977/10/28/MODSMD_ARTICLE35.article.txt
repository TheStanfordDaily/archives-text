The worst thing about the
pizza at La Casa Italiana's La
Pizzeria is finding a graceful
way to eat. I don't think it is
possible, but I will leave that to
more deft fingers than mine.
For the rest of us semi-skilled
eaters, it is best to simply attack
the problem with aplomb and
to hell with the cheese that
dribbles in hot globs down
your arm.
It will be worth it whatever
you do.
The crust, for example, is
superior to most American
crusts that are rarely recog
nized as anything but packag

ing.
The sauce is sparse, adding
just an undertone of strength
to the whole.
I had la pizza alia capricciosa
— con un uovo, carciofi e
prosciutto ("with an egg, ar
tichokes and ham").
If your tastes are less
esoteric, you have a choice of
olives, salami or mushrooms as
well.
La Pizzeria is no bargain but
prices are reasonable, from
$1.60 to $2.40 for a nine-inch
round per person.
