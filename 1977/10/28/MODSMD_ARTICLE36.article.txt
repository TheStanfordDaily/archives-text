## Indonesian flavor for an eating adventure 
### 
The Orient
Rancho Center
El Camino
What the great number of
this area's eating places have
forgotten in the scramble for
profit is honest courtesy,
warmth, cheerfulness (at
something more than bursting
cash registers), and hospitality.
Dolorous as the trend may be,
it isn't yet irreversible, or at
least so I've concluded on the
basis of a pleasant visit to a
new, independent venture
whose proprietor is supported
by his wife and son in his belief
that food can be graciously
served.
The Orient, which since last
August has occupied a small
niche in the miscellany of El
Camino, is building up a fol
lowing as well as initiating
those of us who are less know
ledgeable than others in the
pleasures of Indonesian
cuisine.
The name of the place not
withstanding, the oriental
motif is limited to a few unob
trusive posters, bamboo blinds
covering the wall of windows at
the front, and a small oriental
vase of fresh flowers on every
table.
Indonesian music plays in
the background. The room it
self is large, but guests feel un
noticed by everyone except

the owner Bie Tan and his
young, poised son Alan. An
important part of the family
undertaking, Mrs. Tan does
the cooking at the restaurant.
As Mr. Tan instructed my
party, an essential feature of
Indonesian cooking is the
rijsttafel (rice table), which the
Dutch have incorporated into
their cooking in their three
hundred-year connection with
Southeast Asia.
Mr. Tan's version of the meal
($13.50 for two) provides soup,
followed by rice to which is
added an assortment of meats,
vegetables, and sauces. Sate
(barbecued, marinated beef on
small skewers) and ayam be
sengeh (broiled chicken
cooked in cocoanut sauce)
were our favorite meats in the
rijsttafel, along with the hors
d'oeuvre-like snrimp chips and
fried grated cocoanut with
peanuts.
We were not quite as taken
with the peanut sauce which
topped the Indonesian salad, a
mixture of sliced boiled eggs,
green beans, lettuce, and
potatoes. One of our party dis
covered that with the addition
of hot relish, the first dish Mr.
Tan placed on our table, the
salad tasted less bland, cer
tainly less peanutty .. .and very
much hotter!
Sambel bajak, or relish, is
made of those same chili

peppers we all know and some
of us love on pizzas, and Mr.
Tan noted that in Indonesia the
relish accompanies every dish
in the meal, except dessert.
A friend ordered safe babi,
barbecued pork, and tabu
telor, an omelet with bean spr
outs and soy sauce, which he
declared was his favorite of all
the dishes. Without doubt, the
best drink with any Indonesian
dish is Dutch beer, and Mr. Tan
provides Heinekens, all the
more refreshing in chilled glas
ses.
The Orient's menu also in
cludes cendol, an icy cocoanut
drink, and the more traditional
jasmine tea. For dessert we
shared pisang goreng, bananas
dipped in batter and deep
fried, and kuwih semprong,
cocoanut-flavored rolled
cookies, and two of us had
mango ice cream, an especially
nice finish to our meal.
The Orient serves lunch
from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. on
Tuesday through Friday and
dinner from sp.m. until 9 p.m.
on Tuesday through Sunday.
Lunch entrees include avam
besengeh, broiled chicken,
accompanied by rice and veg
etables (priced at $2.25) and an
omelet with bean sprouts and
rice ($1.95). Reservations may
be made by telephoning (408)
985-0363.
