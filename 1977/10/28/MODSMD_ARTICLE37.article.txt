Fargo's Pizza and Spaghetti Com
pany is a cross between the average
franchise pizzeria and the local dis
cotheque. Fifteen minutes from Stan
ford by car, Fargo's can be a positive or
negative experience, depending on
what you're looking for.
If you feel like goingoutwith friends
for food and entertainment, this is the
place for you. Attractively designed,
Fargo's features a large dance floor
and live disco band.
But if you're looking for good pizza,

you'd better look elsewhere.
The extra-large Fargo jack's Special,
which four of us shared, turned out to
be anything but extra-large and far
from special. Topped with canned
mushrooms, soggy green peppers and
a questionable array of meats and
sausages, this 16-inch combination
pizza is a disappointment.
The crust is thin, the sauce and
cheese minimal, and the seasoning
ordinary. Jeno or Mama Celeste's fro
zen pizza would have little trouble
matching the skill of Fargo's chef.
Other items on the menu include
spaghetti ($1.75-$3), ham, roast beef
and pastrami French roll sandwiches

($1.50), hamburgers ($1.15-$1.65),
beer and soft drinks (30 cents).
Prices are reasonable in view of the
live entertainment but I would advise
going after the regular dinner hour;
we arrived at 5:45 p.m. and were
treated to a rendition of "the band set
ting up."
Our conversation was frequently in
terrupted by "testing, one, two,
three. . ." However, in retrospect, our
visit was by no means unpleasant and
with the right people and the right
"disco" mood, Fargo's could be the
welcome change you're looking for.
