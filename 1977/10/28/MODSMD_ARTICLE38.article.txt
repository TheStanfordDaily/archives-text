Soviets test anti-satellite weapon
Washington — Russia has scored an apparent second
straight success in testing a new satellite-destroying
weapon that worries U.S. officials, the Pentagon said
yesterday.
The development suggests the Soviet Union may be
extending its lead over the United States in such poten
tially critical weaponry.
The United States is working on anti-satellite technol
ogy, but has not tested any system and may need
another five years to bring an anti-satellite into opera
tion.
The Soviet intercept test Wednesday also indicates the
Russians are continuing to ignore President Jimmy Car
ter's public appeal last March for a ban on such
satellite-destroying weapons. The Russians have staged
three tests since Carter voiced his appeal, one rated a
failure and the two most recent as apparent successes.
In a terse announcement giving no details, the Penta
gon said:
"We have preliminary indications that the Soviets
launched an anti-satellite interceptor on Wednesday
against a target satellite. Presumably, a successful inter
cept occurred."
Defense officials said the hunter-killer satellite passed
within lethal range of the target, which had been
launched from central Russia five days earlier into a low
orbit.
Carter delays tax recommendations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday that he'll wait until next year to unveil his long
awaited tax revision proposals and that tax cuts to boost
the economy will be a part of his recommendations.
"By the end of the year," he told a nationally broadcast
news conference, "we will have more information . . .
on the state of the economy, to know how much of our
tax reform proposals should be devoted to stimulating
the economy."
Asked about tax cuts, he said, "I would say that the
rate of tax reduction and stimulation from the tax reform
measures could only be assessed at the end of this year."
The President opened the 32-minute session by appe
aling anew for congressional action on his energy pac
kage, saying all public officials will be judged by "the
courage which we are able to muster" in facing up to the
energy problem.
As the President spoke, Senate-House conferees
worked to compromise differences between a House
passed energy bill that is much to Carter's liking, and a
far different measure awaiting Senate action.
Deficit totals less than projected
Washington—The federal government ended the 1977
fiscal year with a budget deficit of $45 billion, $23 billion
less than was projected earlier in the year, it was an
nounced yesterday.
Officials attributed the lower deficit in part to "a gen
eral tendency to overestimate the amount of funds that
can be spent."
Expenditures during the year totaled $401.9 billion, up
from $369.2 billion in 1976; and receipts were $356.9
billion, up from $308.6 billion in 1976. Fiscal 1977 ended
Sept. 30.
The budget deficit was $23 billion less than was esti
mated in February and $3 billion less than estimated in
July, the Treasury Department and Office of Manage
ment and Budget said in a joint report.
Budget experts have been unable to fully explain why

the government underspent its budget by such a large
amount, leading to speculation by some economists that
the spending lag contributed to the slowdown in the
economy at mid-year.
Senate approves energy proposal
Washington — The Senate handed President Jimmy
Carter his first energy victory in weeks yesterday by
agreeing to tax industrial use of oil and natural gas in
hopes of forcing a shift to more abundant coal.
It then turned aside by a 56-to-38 vote an attempt by
liberals to kill guarantees that the national energy plan
will include profit incentives for oil and gas companies
to find new energy reserves.
The Senate also rejected 62 to 16 an attempt to elimi
nate tax credits for homeowners who weatherize their
homes with insulation or other materials.
Homeowners would be permitted a credit of $400 on a
maximum $2000 spent on weatherization after last April
20.
The Senate adjourned after a full day's consideration
of $40 billion in miscellaneous energy tax credits, post
poning until today a floor fight over whether to kill the
bill entirely by sending it back to the Senate Finance
Committee.
Police seek Newton bodyguard
Richmond — A bodyguard for Black Panther leader
Huey Newton was being sought by police yesterday for
questioning about the apparent attempt on the life of a
key witness in Newton's pending murder trial.
A no-bail warrant charges 25-year-old Flores Forbes
with the murder Sunday of fellow Panther Louis Johnson
and the attempted murder and burglary of Richmond
apartment house tenant Mary Matthew.
Forbes was still at large. A search yesterday of an
Oakland house, thought to be his residence, turned up
nothing.
Police believe the Sunday morning assault on Matth
ew's apartment by at least three men was an unsuccess
ful attempt to kill prostitute Raphaelle Gary, a key wit
ness against Newton on a murder charge he is facing.
Gary, who lives next door to Matthew, testified Tues
day at a pre-trial hearing that she saw Newton laughing
over the dead body of fellow streetwalker Kathleen
Smith. Newton is charged with murderingSmithon Aug.
6, 1974.
Panther Johnson was killed Sunday during the shoot
out that came after Matthew thought she heard prow
lers.
Forbes became the subject of an intense police search
Sunday after investigators found a bloody glove at the
scene, then learned that Forbes had gone to an Oakland
hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the hand.
Mourners protest at German burial
Stuttgart, West Germany — Hundreds of de
monstrators turned out yesterday for the burial of three
notorious West German anarchists and vowed to avenge
their prison deaths, which authorities called suicides.
An equally large police contingent of nearly 1000 sur
rounded the city cemetery and arrested several mour
ners in a scuffle after the burial of Andreas Baader, 34,
Gudrun Ensslin, 37, and Jan-Carl Raspe, 33.
Baader and Raspe were buried together in a common
grave next to Ensslin's. Youthful mourners, claiming the
three were murdered, pledged in extemporaneous
eulogies to continue the anarchists' battle against West
German society.

Baader, Raspe and Ensslin, serving life terms for a
series of bombings and killings in the early 19705, were
found dead or mortally wounded in their maximum sec
urity cells here Oct. 18, hours after West German com
mandos foiled an air hijacking staged to force their re
lease.
An autopsy and subsequent inquiry by state officials
claimed the three committed suicide and tried to make
their deaths look like murder. Extremists, claiming they
were killed, demonstrated across Europe last week.
House supports Social Security tax
Washington — The House voted yesterday to increase
Social Security taxes for 104 million Americans as part of
a plan to keep the huge national pension system from
going broke.
The biggest new burden would fall on upper-income
workers, some of whom would find their Social Security
taxes more than tripled in 10 years. But taxes would go

up for lower-paid workers, as well.
Older Americans got a break at the last minute when
House members voted for an amendment phasing out
the current income limit on recipients. Younger workers
would find the Social Security tax bite increasing steadily
over the next several years.
The maximum tax, now $965 per year for a worker
earning $16,500 or more, would go to $3025 in a decade.
This maximum tax in 1987 would apply only to those
earning more than $42,600.
The bill was passed 275 to 146 and sent to the Senate,
which already is considering similar legislation.

Russians are continuing to ignore President Jimmy Car

satellite-destroying weapons. The Russians have staged
three tests since Carter voiced his appeal, one rated a

In a terse announcement giving no details, the Penta

"We have preliminary indications that the Soviets
launched an anti-satellite interceptor on Wednesday
against a target satellite. Presumably, a successful inter

Defense officials said the hunter-killer satellite passed
within lethal range of the target, which had been
launched from central Russia five days earlier into a low
orbit.
Carter delays tax recommendations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday that he'll wait until next year to unveil his long
awaited tax revision proposals and that tax cuts to boost
the economy will be a part of his recommendations.
"By the end of the year," he told a nationally broadcast
news conference, "we will have more information . . .
on the state of the economy, to know how much of our
tax reform proposals should be devoted to stimulating
the economy."
Asked about tax cuts, he said, "I would say that the
rate of tax reduction and stimulation from the tax reform
measures could only be assessed at the end of this year."
The President opened the 32-minute session by appe
aling anew for congressional action on his energy pac
kage, saying all public officials will be judged by "the
courage which we are able to muster" in facing up to the
energy problem.
As the President spoke, Senate-House conferees
worked to compromise differences between a House
passed energy bill that is much to Carter's liking, and a
far different measure awaiting Senate action.
Deficit totals less than projected
Washington—The federal government ended the 1977
fiscal year with a budget deficit of $45 billion, $23 billion
less than was projected earlier in the year, it was an
nounced yesterday.
Officials attributed the lower deficit in part to "a gen
eral tendency to overestimate the amount of funds that
can be spent."
Expenditures during the year totaled $401.9 billion, up
from $369.2 billion in 1976; and receipts were $356.9
billion, up from $308.6 billion in 1976. Fiscal 1977 ended
Sept. 30.
The budget deficit was $23 billion less than was esti
mated in February and $3 billion less than estimated in
July, the Treasury Department and Office of Manage
ment and Budget said in a joint report.
Budget experts have been unable to fully explain why

the government underspent its budget by such a large
amount, leading to speculation by some economists that
the spending lag contributed to the slowdown in the
economy at mid-year.
Senate approves energy proposal
Washington — The Senate handed President Jimmy
Carter his first energy victory in weeks yesterday by
agreeing to tax industrial use of oil and natural gas in
hopes of forcing a shift to more abundant coal.
It then turned aside by a 56-to-38 vote an attempt by
liberals to kill guarantees that the national energy plan
will include profit incentives for oil and gas companies
to find new energy reserves.
The Senate also rejected 62 to 16 an attempt to elimi
nate tax credits for homeowners who weatherize their
homes with insulation or other materials.
Homeowners would be permitted a credit of $400 on a
maximum $2000 spent on weatherization after last April
20.
The Senate adjourned after a full day's consideration
of $40 billion in miscellaneous energy tax credits, post
poning until today a floor fight over whether to kill the
bill entirely by sending it back to the Senate Finance
Committee.
Police seek Newton bodyguard
Richmond — A bodyguard for Black Panther leader
Huey Newton was being sought by police yesterday for
questioning about the apparent attempt on the life of a
key witness in Newton's pending murder trial.
A no-bail warrant charges 25-year-old Flores Forbes
with the murder Sunday of fellow Panther Louis Johnson
and the attempted murder and burglary of Richmond
apartment house tenant Mary Matthew.
Forbes was still at large. A search yesterday of an
Oakland house, thought to be his residence, turned up
nothing.
Police believe the Sunday morning assault on Matth
ew's apartment by at least three men was an unsuccess
ful attempt to kill prostitute Raphaelle Gary, a key wit
ness against Newton on a murder charge he is facing.
Gary, who lives next door to Matthew, testified Tues
day at a pre-trial hearing that she saw Newton laughing
over the dead body of fellow streetwalker Kathleen
Smith. Newton is charged with murderingSmithon Aug.
6, 1974.
Panther Johnson was killed Sunday during the shoot
out that came after Matthew thought she heard prow
lers.
Forbes became the subject of an intense police search
Sunday after investigators found a bloody glove at the
scene, then learned that Forbes had gone to an Oakland
hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the hand.
Mourners protest at German burial
Stuttgart, West Germany — Hundreds of de
monstrators turned out yesterday for the burial of three
notorious West German anarchists and vowed to avenge
their prison deaths, which authorities called suicides.
An equally large police contingent of nearly 1000 sur
rounded the city cemetery and arrested several mour
ners in a scuffle after the burial of Andreas Baader, 34,
Gudrun Ensslin, 37, and Jan-Carl Raspe, 33.
Baader and Raspe were buried together in a common
grave next to Ensslin's. Youthful mourners, claiming the
three were murdered, pledged in extemporaneous
eulogies to continue the anarchists' battle against West
German society.

Baader, Raspe and Ensslin, serving life terms for a
series of bombings and killings in the early 19705, were
found dead or mortally wounded in their maximum sec
urity cells here Oct. 18, hours after West German com
mandos foiled an air hijacking staged to force their re
lease.
An autopsy and subsequent inquiry by state officials
claimed the three committed suicide and tried to make
their deaths look like murder. Extremists, claiming they
were killed, demonstrated across Europe last week.
House supports Social Security tax
Washington — The House voted yesterday to increase
Social Security taxes for 104 million Americans as part of
a plan to keep the huge national pension system from
going broke.
The biggest new burden would fall on upper-income
workers, some of whom would find their Social Security
taxes more than tripled in 10 years. But taxes would go

up for lower-paid workers, as well.
Older Americans got a break at the last minute when
House members voted for an amendment phasing out
the current income limit on recipients. Younger workers
would find the Social Security tax bite increasing steadily
over the next several years.
The maximum tax, now $965 per year for a worker
earning $16,500 or more, would go to $3025 in a decade.
This maximum tax in 1987 would apply only to those
earning more than $42,600.
The bill was passed 275 to 146 and sent to the Senate,
which already is considering similar legislation.

Soviets test anti-satellite weapon
Washington — Russia has scored an apparent second

weapon that worries U.S. officials, the Pentagon said
yesterday.
The development suggests the Soviet Union may be

The United States is working on anti-satellite technol

another five years to bring an anti-satellite into opera

Carter delays tax recommendations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday that he'll wait until next year to unveil his long
awaited tax revision proposals and that tax cuts to boost
the economy will be a part of his recommendations.
"By the end of the year," he told a nationally broadcast
news conference, "we will have more information . . .
on the state of the economy, to know how much of our
tax reform proposals should be devoted to stimulating
the economy."
Asked about tax cuts, he said, "I would say that the
rate of tax reduction and stimulation from the tax reform
measures could only be assessed at the end of this year."
The President opened the 32-minute session by appe
aling anew for congressional action on his energy pac
kage, saying all public officials will be judged by "the
courage which we are able to muster" in facing up to the
energy problem.
As the President spoke, Senate-House conferees
worked to compromise differences between a House
passed energy bill that is much to Carter's liking, and a
far different measure awaiting Senate action.
Deficit totals less than projected
Washington—The federal government ended the 1977
fiscal year with a budget deficit of $45 billion, $23 billion
less than was projected earlier in the year, it was an
nounced yesterday.
Officials attributed the lower deficit in part to "a gen
eral tendency to overestimate the amount of funds that
can be spent."
Expenditures during the year totaled $401.9 billion, up
from $369.2 billion in 1976; and receipts were $356.9
billion, up from $308.6 billion in 1976. Fiscal 1977 ended
Sept. 30.
The budget deficit was $23 billion less than was esti
mated in February and $3 billion less than estimated in
July, the Treasury Department and Office of Manage
ment and Budget said in a joint report.
Budget experts have been unable to fully explain why

the government underspent its budget by such a large
amount, leading to speculation by some economists that
the spending lag contributed to the slowdown in the
economy at mid-year.
Senate approves energy proposal
Washington — The Senate handed President Jimmy
Carter his first energy victory in weeks yesterday by
agreeing to tax industrial use of oil and natural gas in
hopes of forcing a shift to more abundant coal.
It then turned aside by a 56-to-38 vote an attempt by
liberals to kill guarantees that the national energy plan
will include profit incentives for oil and gas companies
to find new energy reserves.
The Senate also rejected 62 to 16 an attempt to elimi
nate tax credits for homeowners who weatherize their
homes with insulation or other materials.
Homeowners would be permitted a credit of $400 on a
maximum $2000 spent on weatherization after last April
20.
The Senate adjourned after a full day's consideration
of $40 billion in miscellaneous energy tax credits, post
poning until today a floor fight over whether to kill the
bill entirely by sending it back to the Senate Finance
Committee.
Police seek Newton bodyguard
Richmond — A bodyguard for Black Panther leader
Huey Newton was being sought by police yesterday for
questioning about the apparent attempt on the life of a
key witness in Newton's pending murder trial.
A no-bail warrant charges 25-year-old Flores Forbes
with the murder Sunday of fellow Panther Louis Johnson
and the attempted murder and burglary of Richmond
apartment house tenant Mary Matthew.
Forbes was still at large. A search yesterday of an
Oakland house, thought to be his residence, turned up
nothing.
Police believe the Sunday morning assault on Matth
ew's apartment by at least three men was an unsuccess
ful attempt to kill prostitute Raphaelle Gary, a key wit
ness against Newton on a murder charge he is facing.
Gary, who lives next door to Matthew, testified Tues
day at a pre-trial hearing that she saw Newton laughing
over the dead body of fellow streetwalker Kathleen
Smith. Newton is charged with murderingSmithon Aug.
6, 1974.
Panther Johnson was killed Sunday during the shoot
out that came after Matthew thought she heard prow
lers.
Forbes became the subject of an intense police search
Sunday after investigators found a bloody glove at the
scene, then learned that Forbes had gone to an Oakland
hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the hand.
Mourners protest at German burial
Stuttgart, West Germany — Hundreds of de
monstrators turned out yesterday for the burial of three
notorious West German anarchists and vowed to avenge
their prison deaths, which authorities called suicides.
An equally large police contingent of nearly 1000 sur
rounded the city cemetery and arrested several mour
ners in a scuffle after the burial of Andreas Baader, 34,
Gudrun Ensslin, 37, and Jan-Carl Raspe, 33.
Baader and Raspe were buried together in a common
grave next to Ensslin's. Youthful mourners, claiming the
three were murdered, pledged in extemporaneous
eulogies to continue the anarchists' battle against West
German society.

Baader, Raspe and Ensslin, serving life terms for a
series of bombings and killings in the early 19705, were
found dead or mortally wounded in their maximum sec
urity cells here Oct. 18, hours after West German com
mandos foiled an air hijacking staged to force their re
lease.
An autopsy and subsequent inquiry by state officials
claimed the three committed suicide and tried to make
their deaths look like murder. Extremists, claiming they
were killed, demonstrated across Europe last week.
House supports Social Security tax
Washington — The House voted yesterday to increase
Social Security taxes for 104 million Americans as part of
a plan to keep the huge national pension system from
going broke.
The biggest new burden would fall on upper-income
workers, some of whom would find their Social Security
taxes more than tripled in 10 years. But taxes would go

up for lower-paid workers, as well.
Older Americans got a break at the last minute when
House members voted for an amendment phasing out
the current income limit on recipients. Younger workers
would find the Social Security tax bite increasing steadily
over the next several years.
The maximum tax, now $965 per year for a worker
earning $16,500 or more, would go to $3025 in a decade.
This maximum tax in 1987 would apply only to those
earning more than $42,600.
The bill was passed 275 to 146 and sent to the Senate,
which already is considering similar legislation.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy today with rain likely by this afternoon
or evening and continuing tonight. Partial clearing to

Chance of rain 60 per cent today and 70 per cent tonight.
Soviets test anti-satellite weapon
Washington — Russia has scored an apparent second
straight success in testing a new satellite-destroying
weapon that worries U.S. officials, the Pentagon said
yesterday.
The development suggests the Soviet Union may be
extending its lead over the United States in such poten
tially critical weaponry.
The United States is working on anti-satellite technol
ogy, but has not tested any system and may need
another five years to bring an anti-satellite into opera
tion.
The Soviet intercept test Wednesday also indicates the
Russians are continuing to ignore President Jimmy Car
ter's public appeal last March for a ban on such
satellite-destroying weapons. The Russians have staged
three tests since Carter voiced his appeal, one rated a
failure and the two most recent as apparent successes.
In a terse announcement giving no details, the Penta
gon said:
"We have preliminary indications that the Soviets
launched an anti-satellite interceptor on Wednesday
against a target satellite. Presumably, a successful inter
cept occurred."
Defense officials said the hunter-killer satellite passed
within lethal range of the target, which had been
launched from central Russia five days earlier into a low
orbit.

tax reform proposals should be devoted to stimulating
the economy."
Asked about tax cuts, he said, "I would say that the
rate of tax reduction and stimulation from the tax reform
measures could only be assessed at the end of this year."
The President opened the 32-minute session by appe
aling anew for congressional action on his energy pac
kage, saying all public officials will be judged by "the
courage which we are able to muster" in facing up to the
energy problem.
As the President spoke, Senate-House conferees
worked to compromise differences between a House
passed energy bill that is much to Carter's liking, and a
far different measure awaiting Senate action.
Deficit totals less than projected
Washington—The federal government ended the 1977
fiscal year with a budget deficit of $45 billion, $23 billion
less than was projected earlier in the year, it was an
nounced yesterday.
Officials attributed the lower deficit in part to "a gen
eral tendency to overestimate the amount of funds that
can be spent."
Expenditures during the year totaled $401.9 billion, up
from $369.2 billion in 1976; and receipts were $356.9
billion, up from $308.6 billion in 1976. Fiscal 1977 ended
Sept. 30.
The budget deficit was $23 billion less than was esti
mated in February and $3 billion less than estimated in
July, the Treasury Department and Office of Manage
ment and Budget said in a joint report.
Budget experts have been unable to fully explain why

the government underspent its budget by such a large
amount, leading to speculation by some economists that
the spending lag contributed to the slowdown in the
economy at mid-year.
Senate approves energy proposal
Washington — The Senate handed President Jimmy
Carter his first energy victory in weeks yesterday by
agreeing to tax industrial use of oil and natural gas in
hopes of forcing a shift to more abundant coal.
It then turned aside by a 56-to-38 vote an attempt by
liberals to kill guarantees that the national energy plan
will include profit incentives for oil and gas companies
to find new energy reserves.
The Senate also rejected 62 to 16 an attempt to elimi
nate tax credits for homeowners who weatherize their
homes with insulation or other materials.
Homeowners would be permitted a credit of $400 on a
maximum $2000 spent on weatherization after last April
20.
The Senate adjourned after a full day's consideration
of $40 billion in miscellaneous energy tax credits, post
poning until today a floor fight over whether to kill the
bill entirely by sending it back to the Senate Finance
Committee.
Police seek Newton bodyguard
Richmond — A bodyguard for Black Panther leader
Huey Newton was being sought by police yesterday for
questioning about the apparent attempt on the life of a
key witness in Newton's pending murder trial.
A no-bail warrant charges 25-year-old Flores Forbes
with the murder Sunday of fellow Panther Louis Johnson
and the attempted murder and burglary of Richmond
apartment house tenant Mary Matthew.
Forbes was still at large. A search yesterday of an
Oakland house, thought to be his residence, turned up
nothing.
Police believe the Sunday morning assault on Matth
ew's apartment by at least three men was an unsuccess
ful attempt to kill prostitute Raphaelle Gary, a key wit
ness against Newton on a murder charge he is facing.
Gary, who lives next door to Matthew, testified Tues
day at a pre-trial hearing that she saw Newton laughing
over the dead body of fellow streetwalker Kathleen
Smith. Newton is charged with murderingSmithon Aug.
6, 1974.
Panther Johnson was killed Sunday during the shoot
out that came after Matthew thought she heard prow
lers.
Forbes became the subject of an intense police search
Sunday after investigators found a bloody glove at the
scene, then learned that Forbes had gone to an Oakland
hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the hand.
Mourners protest at German burial
Stuttgart, West Germany — Hundreds of de
monstrators turned out yesterday for the burial of three
notorious West German anarchists and vowed to avenge
their prison deaths, which authorities called suicides.
An equally large police contingent of nearly 1000 sur
rounded the city cemetery and arrested several mour
ners in a scuffle after the burial of Andreas Baader, 34,
Gudrun Ensslin, 37, and Jan-Carl Raspe, 33.
Baader and Raspe were buried together in a common
grave next to Ensslin's. Youthful mourners, claiming the
three were murdered, pledged in extemporaneous
eulogies to continue the anarchists' battle against West
German society.

Baader, Raspe and Ensslin, serving life terms for a
series of bombings and killings in the early 19705, were
found dead or mortally wounded in their maximum sec
urity cells here Oct. 18, hours after West German com
mandos foiled an air hijacking staged to force their re
lease.
An autopsy and subsequent inquiry by state officials
claimed the three committed suicide and tried to make
their deaths look like murder. Extremists, claiming they
were killed, demonstrated across Europe last week.
House supports Social Security tax
Washington — The House voted yesterday to increase
Social Security taxes for 104 million Americans as part of
a plan to keep the huge national pension system from
going broke.
The biggest new burden would fall on upper-income
workers, some of whom would find their Social Security
taxes more than tripled in 10 years. But taxes would go

up for lower-paid workers, as well.
Older Americans got a break at the last minute when
House members voted for an amendment phasing out
the current income limit on recipients. Younger workers
would find the Social Security tax bite increasing steadily
over the next several years.
The maximum tax, now $965 per year for a worker
earning $16,500 or more, would go to $3025 in a decade.
This maximum tax in 1987 would apply only to those
earning more than $42,600.
The bill was passed 275 to 146 and sent to the Senate,
which already is considering similar legislation.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy today with rain likely by this afternoon
or evening and continuing tonight. Partial clearing to
morrow with occasional showers. Little change in temp
eratures. Lows in the low 50s. Highs both days in the 60s.
Chance of rain 60 per cent today and 70 per cent tonight.
Soviets test anti-satellite weapon
Washington — Russia has scored an apparent second
straight success in testing a new satellite-destroying
weapon that worries U.S. officials, the Pentagon said
yesterday.
The development suggests the Soviet Union may be
extending its lead over the United States in such poten
tially critical weaponry.
The United States is working on anti-satellite technol
ogy, but has not tested any system and may need
another five years to bring an anti-satellite into opera
tion.
The Soviet intercept test Wednesday also indicates the
Russians are continuing to ignore President Jimmy Car
ter's public appeal last March for a ban on such
satellite-destroying weapons. The Russians have staged
three tests since Carter voiced his appeal, one rated a
failure and the two most recent as apparent successes.
In a terse announcement giving no details, the Penta
gon said:
"We have preliminary indications that the Soviets
launched an anti-satellite interceptor on Wednesday
against a target satellite. Presumably, a successful inter
cept occurred."
Defense officials said the hunter-killer satellite passed
within lethal range of the target, which had been
launched from central Russia five days earlier into a low
orbit.
Carter delays tax recommendations
Washington — President Jimmy Carter announced yes
terday that he'll wait until next year to unveil his long
awaited tax revision proposals and that tax cuts to boost
the economy will be a part of his recommendations.
"By the end of the year," he told a nationally broadcast
news conference, "we will have more information . . .
on the state of the economy, to know how much of our
tax reform proposals should be devoted to stimulating
the economy."
Asked about tax cuts, he said, "I would say that the
rate of tax reduction and stimulation from the tax reform
