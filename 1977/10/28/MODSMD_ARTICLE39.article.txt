The Electrical Workers Organizing
Committee (EWOC) is launching a
campaign to unionize some 70,000
unorganized electronics workers in
the Santa Clara Valley, according to
Dolly Foung, an outside organizer
for EWOC.
"No large union will sponsor us
because it would cost them more to
organize everything than they would
get out of us in dues. They have an
attitude almost like the companys',"
said Foung.
The desire for a union stems from
complaints of discrimination, lack of
respect, harassment, faulty safety
measures and low pay by production
workers employed at Fairchild Cam
era and Instrument Corporation and
National Semiconductor, among
others.
'No standard'
There is "no real standard wage.
Someone who's worked for three
months could be making more than
someone who's worked for five
years," Foung said. "People can't live
on the kind of pay they get. I've seen
people's paychecks . . . $80 a week
for full-time work," she continued.
In 1975, Fairchild was cited by the
Occupational Safety and Health Ad
ministration (OSHA) for nine sepa
rate safety violations, including fai
lure to provide suitable facilities for
quick eye flushing and failure to
identify disconnecting switches.
High in safety
This year however, Fairchild was
"cited as No. 1 in Equal Opportun

ity Employment and No. 2 in safety
conditions," according to )ohn
Salazar, of Fairchild Labor Relations.
The Dreyfus Fund, a firm which re
searches stock investment recom
mendations for shareholders, com
pared Fairchild to 21 other com
panies, "one-third of which are in
this immediate area and the rest are
scattered around the country,"
Salazar said.
Fairchild has a "very comprehen
sive safety program," according to
Salazar. "There are 50 engineers
working on protection of property
and of the environment," he con
tinued. Safety committees com
posed of the work force and man
agement meet regularly and safety
conditions are monitored on a
routine basis.
Salazar said he thought that Fair
child was "superior to the other
companies in this area" in safety pre

cautions.
EWOC workers have complained
of Fairchild's taking pictures of them
while they were protesting the re
moval of a fellow worker from her
job. There is a "conscious effort to
weed out people who are outspo
ken, to stop the union before it gets
started," Foung said.
John True, an attorney for the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
in Oakland said "Companies are not
allowed to conduct surveillance on
employe's union activities."
The NLRB investigated the incident
and suggested that a compromise
between workers and management
was in order.
"If anybody was intimidated, that
was not our intention. It is our view
that taking pictures in that kind of a
situation is perfectly necessary in
order to prevent an illegal strike,"
Salazar stated.
