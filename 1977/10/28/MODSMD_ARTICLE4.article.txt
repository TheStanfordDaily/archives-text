# Lecturer's relatives jailed in Argentina

Amnesty International is lobbying
for the release of two Paraguayans
who are the father and brother of a
lecturer in the Spanish and Por
tugese department here.
Epifanio Fleitas and Epifanio Men
dez were arrested in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, Oct. 7 without any
charges being filed, according to
Teresa Faith, the lecturer.
No one has been able to contact
either her father or her brother since
their arrest, Faith said.
Friends of the pair who later made
an appeal of "habeas corpus" were
told that the two men were accused
of being members of leftist extremist
Ejercito Revolucionario del Pueblo
(ERP).
Fleitas has been active in exile as
one of the principal opponents to the
Stroessner regime in Paraguay since

he fled the country after Stroessner
took power in 1956.
Mendez, a photographer, is not
very active politically, Faith said.
Probably the only reason he was ar
rested is because of their father's ac
tivism, she said.
Amnesty International has
launched an "urgent action" cam
paign asking members and suppor
ters to send appeals to the Argenti
nian government asking for the re
lease of the two men.
Hundreds of people have signed a
petition calling for the release of the
two men, Faith said.
An Amnesty International spokes
woman said similar cases have some
times ended with prisoners found
dead, or with the Argentine govern
ment claiming vigilante groups kid
napped the prisoners from a police
station.
Faith says she fears a claim of "vig
ilante kidnapping" from the Argen
tine government, as the two men
have been transferred to Chaco, very
near the Paraguayan border.
"I believe it is clear that the arrests
of my father and brother in law are at
worst just another reprisal on the
part of the Paraguayan government
and at best the acceptance by some
Argentinian official of the lies the
Stroessner regime spreads," said
Faith's husband Ray, assistant pro
fessor of statistics.
Both men are being held under or
ders of arrest issued by the police of
Salta, Argentina, Faith said.
Mendez has never been to Salta,
and Fleitas has not been there in 15
years, he said.
In July 1976, Fleitas was arrested in
Buenos Aires and placed in solitary
confinement on false charges, appa
rently the result of a bribe by the
Paraguayan government, he said.
The fact that the charges were
dropped and Fleitas was released a
week later without any mention of
the arrest order from Saltas suggests
that the order didn't exist at that
time, he said.
