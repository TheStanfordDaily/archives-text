# New music copyright laws may force diminuendo
## 
### Lane Webster 
Increased royalty costs may force cutbacks in the
number of musical performances put on by campus
organizations, due to a new federal copyright law
effective Jan. 1.
The law raises the fees the three licensing socieites
— ASCAP, BMI and SESAC — can charge for the use of
music written by member composers, according to
Vicki Holt, director of public events.
A licensing fee, she said, is a general license that
allows schools to present a year of programming.
"To get a license just for the Lively Arts," she said,
"the bill would be $5000 annually."
"No programming unit can pay those kinds of fees.
It's ridiculous," Holt said.
With such large sums involved, colleges are mak
ing legal moves, seeking at least a moratorium on
licensing fees, Holt said. A "national consortium" of
collegiate organizations has retained a New York law
firm "to negotiate for all college campuses," she said.
"ASCAP (the largest agency) came out with a dif
ficult stance to begin with," Holt said. She said it
wanted to calculate the fee the University would pay
using 1) the largest facility where music is played (the
stadium), 2) the highest ticket price charged for single
music events ($8 or so) and 3) the total number of
performances per year (about 350).
"That figure," she said, "would include the Lively
Arts, ASSU programs, Mem Chu concerts where pub
lic is invited, plusTresidder, Coffee House and Ram's
Head performances."
Then, she said, "to cover all things not formally
scheduled — what I like to call 'singing in the shower

incidents' — ASCAP wanted to charge 10 cents per
student. For Stanford," she noted, "that would be
$1200."
What is more, the formula would apply separately
to all three agencies, Holt said.
Holt outlined another problem. "The societies
want their money 'up front.' " That means univer
sities must pay royalties before all performances at
the beginning of the year. If performances are can
celed, schools can ask for refunds, but the chances of
getting refunds from ASCAP are, she said, "nil or next
to nothing."
Should ASCAP maintain its hard line and the others
follow, alternatives to paying the large royalties are
several — and scary.
The performing arts series would be forced to book
two fewer performances per year, Holt said. "A cut
back in programming," she said, "would defeat the
purpose" of the law, for authors might get even less
revenue from royalties than before.
Bands and other groups could stick only to classical
music considered in the public domain. But Holt said,
"We can't limit programming just to things prior to
1750 or whatever. That would be a challenge in prog
ramming I don't think anyone could handle."
Schools could simply break the law, playing music
without paying for it. But in areas where ASCAP chap
ters are active, "you can't sneak by," Holt said. The
fine would be steep — $250.
The costs are high for using music — legally or
illegally — because the University derives so many
benefits from it.
"The real problem came with half-time perfor

mances at football games on national television —
bowl games in particular," she said. "Schools got a lot
of TV rights; teams get percentages; the band gets
special benefits with such wide exposure. The only
person not getting anything is the guy who published
the music. That's the bone of contention that started
the hassle," Holt said.
Authors weren't getting many royalties from the
performing art series, either, she said.
She agreed that composers deserve a bigger cut.
"The issue is not that we want to deny licensing; it's
very appropriate. These people wrote music and
that's the only way they can get a long-term payment
for it."
The issue, she said, is how much and under what
terms to pay the licensing societies.
A less startling, more complicated part of the
copyright law restricts professors' photocopying
printed material for their classes. Some schools have
set up on-campus copyright clearinghouses, provid
ing machines, explanations of the law and form let
ters to professors requesting royalty rights.
When asked if Stanford had one, Staff Counsel
Michael Hudnall said, "No, notyet. There is planning
going on about the impact of the law and the clearing
house. There is certainly beginning awareness" on
the part of the faculty members, he said.
Dorothy Riddell, Hudnall's assistant, added, "Fees
will be higher." She said the University has not re
ceived any copyright "how-to circulars."
"The real impact," she said, "we won't know for a
while yet."

That's not a madrigal they're singing, but it might soon have
to be, unless Ram's Head can afford to pay increased royalty
costs. A new copyright law takes effect next year, and all
campus music organizations will pay more to perform
modern composers' works.

music considered in the public domain. But Holt said,
"We can't limit programming just to things prior to
1750 or whatever. That would be a challenge in prog
ramming I don't think anyone could handle."
Schools could simply break the law, playing music
without paying for it. But in areas where ASCAP chap
ters are active, "you can't sneak by," Holt said. The
fine would be steep — $250.
The costs are high for using music — legally or
illegally — because the University derives so many
benefits from it.
"The real problem came with half-time perfor

mances at football games on national television —
bowl games in particular," she said. "Schools got a lot
of TV rights; teams get percentages; the band gets
special benefits with such wide exposure. The only
person not getting anything is the guy who published
the music. That's the bone of contention that started
the hassle," Holt said.
Authors weren't getting many royalties from the
performing art series, either, she said.
She agreed that composers deserve a bigger cut.
"The issue is not that we want to deny licensing; it's
very appropriate. These people wrote music and
that's the only way they can get a long-term payment
for it."
The issue, she said, is how much and under what
terms to pay the licensing societies.
A less startling, more complicated part of the
copyright law restricts professors' photocopying
printed material for their classes. Some schools have
set up on-campus copyright clearinghouses, provid
ing machines, explanations of the law and form let
ters to professors requesting royalty rights.
When asked if Stanford had one, Staff Counsel
Michael Hudnall said, "No, notyet. There is planning
going on about the impact of the law and the clearing
house. There is certainly beginning awareness" on
the part of the faculty members, he said.
Dorothy Riddell, Hudnall's assistant, added, "Fees
will be higher." She said the University has not re
ceived any copyright "how-to circulars."
"The real impact," she said, "we won't know for a
while yet."

That's not a madrigal they're singing, but it might soon have
to be, unless Ram's Head can afford to pay increased royalty
costs. A new copyright law takes effect next year, and all
campus music organizations will pay more to perform
modern composers' works.
Increased royalty costs may force cutbacks in the
number of musical performances put on by campus
organizations, due to a new federal copyright law
effective Jan. 1.
The law raises the fees the three licensing socieites
— ASCAP, BMI and SESAC — can charge for the use of
music written by member composers, according to
Vicki Holt, director of public events.
A licensing fee, she said, is a general license that
allows schools to present a year of programming.
"To get a license just for the Lively Arts," she said,
"the bill would be $5000 annually."
"No programming unit can pay those kinds of fees.
It's ridiculous," Holt said.
With such large sums involved, colleges are mak
ing legal moves, seeking at least a moratorium on
licensing fees, Holt said. A "national consortium" of
collegiate organizations has retained a New York law
firm "to negotiate for all college campuses," she said.
"ASCAP (the largest agency) came out with a dif
ficult stance to begin with," Holt said. She said it
wanted to calculate the fee the University would pay
using 1) the largest facility where music is played (the
stadium), 2) the highest ticket price charged for single
music events ($8 or so) and 3) the total number of
performances per year (about 350).
"That figure," she said, "would include the Lively
Arts, ASSU programs, Mem Chu concerts where pub
lic is invited, plusTresidder, Coffee House and Ram's
Head performances."
Then, she said, "to cover all things not formally
scheduled — what I like to call 'singing in the shower

incidents' — ASCAP wanted to charge 10 cents per
student. For Stanford," she noted, "that would be
$1200."
What is more, the formula would apply separately
to all three agencies, Holt said.
Holt outlined another problem. "The societies
want their money 'up front.' " That means univer
sities must pay royalties before all performances at
the beginning of the year. If performances are can
celed, schools can ask for refunds, but the chances of
getting refunds from ASCAP are, she said, "nil or next
to nothing."
Should ASCAP maintain its hard line and the others
follow, alternatives to paying the large royalties are
several — and scary.
The performing arts series would be forced to book
two fewer performances per year, Holt said. "A cut
back in programming," she said, "would defeat the
purpose" of the law, for authors might get even less
revenue from royalties than before.

— ASCAP, BMI and SESAC — can charge for the use of
music written by member composers, according to
Vicki Holt, director of public events.
A licensing fee, she said, is a general license that
allows schools to present a year of programming.
"To get a license just for the Lively Arts," she said,
"the bill would be $5000 annually."
"No programming unit can pay those kinds of fees.
It's ridiculous," Holt said.
With such large sums involved, colleges are mak
ing legal moves, seeking at least a moratorium on
licensing fees, Holt said. A "national consortium" of
collegiate organizations has retained a New York law
firm "to negotiate for all college campuses," she said.
"ASCAP (the largest agency) came out with a dif
ficult stance to begin with," Holt said. She said it
wanted to calculate the fee the University would pay
using 1) the largest facility where music is played (the
stadium), 2) the highest ticket price charged for single
music events ($8 or so) and 3) the total number of
performances per year (about 350).
"That figure," she said, "would include the Lively
Arts, ASSU programs, Mem Chu concerts where pub
lic is invited, plusTresidder, Coffee House and Ram's
Head performances."
Then, she said, "to cover all things not formally
scheduled — what I like to call 'singing in the shower

incidents' — ASCAP wanted to charge 10 cents per
student. For Stanford," she noted, "that would be
$1200."
What is more, the formula would apply separately
to all three agencies, Holt said.
Holt outlined another problem. "The societies
want their money 'up front.' " That means univer
sities must pay royalties before all performances at
the beginning of the year. If performances are can
celed, schools can ask for refunds, but the chances of
getting refunds from ASCAP are, she said, "nil or next
to nothing."
Should ASCAP maintain its hard line and the others
follow, alternatives to paying the large royalties are
several — and scary.
The performing arts series would be forced to book
two fewer performances per year, Holt said. "A cut
back in programming," she said, "would defeat the
purpose" of the law, for authors might get even less
revenue from royalties than before.
Bands and other groups could stick only to classical
music considered in the public domain. But Holt said,
"We can't limit programming just to things prior to
1750 or whatever. That would be a challenge in prog
ramming I don't think anyone could handle."
Schools could simply break the law, playing music
without paying for it. But in areas where ASCAP chap
ters are active, "you can't sneak by," Holt said. The
fine would be steep — $250.
The costs are high for using music — legally or
illegally — because the University derives so many
benefits from it.
"The real problem came with half-time perfor

mances at football games on national television —
bowl games in particular," she said. "Schools got a lot
of TV rights; teams get percentages; the band gets
special benefits with such wide exposure. The only
person not getting anything is the guy who published
the music. That's the bone of contention that started
the hassle," Holt said.
Authors weren't getting many royalties from the
performing art series, either, she said.
She agreed that composers deserve a bigger cut.
"The issue is not that we want to deny licensing; it's
very appropriate. These people wrote music and
that's the only way they can get a long-term payment
for it."
The issue, she said, is how much and under what
terms to pay the licensing societies.
A less startling, more complicated part of the
copyright law restricts professors' photocopying
printed material for their classes. Some schools have
set up on-campus copyright clearinghouses, provid
ing machines, explanations of the law and form let
ters to professors requesting royalty rights.
When asked if Stanford had one, Staff Counsel
Michael Hudnall said, "No, notyet. There is planning
going on about the impact of the law and the clearing
house. There is certainly beginning awareness" on
the part of the faculty members, he said.
Dorothy Riddell, Hudnall's assistant, added, "Fees
will be higher." She said the University has not re
ceived any copyright "how-to circulars."
"The real impact," she said, "we won't know for a
while yet."

That's not a madrigal they're singing, but it might soon have
to be, unless Ram's Head can afford to pay increased royalty
costs. A new copyright law takes effect next year, and all
campus music organizations will pay more to perform
modern composers' works.
