# Filling the gap
## Are students too isolated? 
### 
Steve Schiller

A frequent comment that arises
when discussing campus life is that
students are isolated from the "real
world," they rarely keep up with
quality newspapers or magazines
and therefore know little about day
to-day events in the outside world.
Most classes do not emphasize cur
rent events and many reduce past
crises to a few generalizations in a
lecture or a couple of paragraphs in
an article of reserve reading. So
much is clear to the point of becom
ing a cliche.
The results are also obvious. Stu
dents do not discuss current prob
lems or events or, at least, we deal
with them in only superficial and per
functory ways. Our energy and
creativity go to waste simply because
we are not aware of the challenges of
the larger world.
Local or personal concerns occupy
our thinking and we retreat into a
type of selfish isolationism, surren
dering to the popular notion that "a
wareness" lies not in knowledge of
the social, economic and political
forces which affect millions of lives,
but in being "in touch" with one's
own body or emotions.
Lack of understanding
The cause is simply that most of us
— students, faculty and staff — are
poorly informed about the day-to
day events outside Stanford. Even
more acute is the lack of understand
ing about world affairs, since most
newspapers cover only the most
major international disasters with
any thoroughness. Indeed, this
problem affects the whole nation:
Americans are woefully uninformed
about problems or events outside
the 50 states. In addition, they cannot
analyze intelligently those events
which do break through the interna
tional news barrier because they
have little background about the his
torical settings in which these crises
break.
These events are important be
cause they affect all of us at least indi
rectly and, more importantly, theyaf
fect others. The course of the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT) with the Soviet Union has im
plications for our very survival; the

discussions about a new interna
tional economic order among na
tions will affect both the prices we
pay as consumers and the well-being
of some two billion fellow human be
ings in the developing world.
Filling the gap
We believe that one way to fill the
gap on campus is simply to provide
information through a variety of
forums. People realize that these is
sues are important, but it can be dif
ficult to find the time and energy to
learn about them. Sometimes it is dif
ficult to know where to begin.
When Jimmy Carter was campaign
ing, he said that Washington rarely
consulted Americans on foreign pol
icy questions. We agree, but we feel
the fault lies less with Washington
than with the people who do not tell
their representatives their opinions
on foreign policy questions.
Last spring, out of concern for this
lack of awareness and discussion
about global issues, a handful of stu
dents started a group dedicated to
informing themselves and the cam
pus about international issues, such
as nuclear proliferation, the world
food problem and human rights.
Starting with a brown-bag discussion
series, the size of our organization,
called Stanford New Directions,
reached 40 regular members by the
end of the quarter.
Task forces
This year, we plan a number of ac
tivities to inform the campus com
munity about global issues and
stimulate thoughtful consideration
of them. We will form issue task
forces of members to research par
ticular issues in depth and present
findings to the larger group.
The brown-bag lunch series con
tinues each Thursday noon and con
siders such topics as SALT,
Eurocommunism, U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, and the Panama Canal treaties.
We will also sponsor larger speeches
and symposia from time to time deal
ing with specific global or foreign
policy issues.
One of our key focuses will be a
newsletter, published three times a
quarter, which will attempt to inter
pret and analyze recent develop-

ments in selected issues, report on
recent campus speeches and discus
sions, and provide a calendar of fu
ture campus events dealing with
these problems.
In addition, we want to help make
the dorms centers of thought and
discussion by bringing in, for meals,
sherry hours, talks and perhaps even
stays "in residence" of several days,
off-campus speakers and foreign vis
itors, as well as Stanford professors.
In obtaining expert speakers on
various issues and information about
recent developments, we will be
aided by our informal affiliation with
the new national foreign policy lobby
organization, New Directions. While
our focus is primarily local and in
formational, we will likely be par
ticipating in some of its nationwide
lobbying campaigns, such as that to
win ratification of the Panama Canal
treaties. We also hope our task
fprces will generate information and
ideas that can be useful to New Di
rections, and to the Congress.
The task is large, but the pos
sibilities are truly exciting. We need
your involvement.
