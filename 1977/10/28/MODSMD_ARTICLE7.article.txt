# Solving the nuclear waste problem
## Space—the ultimate dump 
### 
Moshe Aelion

The problem of waste disposal is
one of the most severe facing our
industrial society. It is a problem
which directly affects the prosperity
and standard of living of every
American; actually, of every human
being on this planet.
When the waste disposal problem
is solved, the energy crisis will be
resolved. The strongest and most
valid objection to nuclear power
concerns nuclear wastes. In addition
to energy, nuclear reactors produce
an extremely toxic liquid which is
both chemically toxic and radioac
tive. This liquid must be stored in
special tanks for years; there it gen
erates intense heat for a long period
of time. After several years, the
liquid, which has quieted down, can
be unloaded from the tanks.
Present day methods of disposing
of the liquid consist of either loading
it into drums and dropping them to
the bottom of the ocean, or pumping
the liquid into underground salt
layers where, geologists hope, it will
stay forever.
Both methods generate strong ob
jections from environmentalists,
since it is not absolutely clear that the
liquid wastes will not pollute the at
mosphere, the oceans, or under
ground water.
The other objections to nuclear

reactors — security and safety — are
not that serious. The safety record of
nuclear reactors up to now has been
very good — maybe better than that
of conventional power stations. Ac
cess by terrorists or fanatics to
radioactive materials can be pre
vented by increasing security mea
sures. Even if terrorists obtain
radioactive materials, the possibility
that they will manufacture an atomic
bomb is very remote.
Endless supply
Therefore, if we solve the nuclear
waste disposal problem, we shall
solve the energy crisis. We could
have an endless supply of electricity.
Of course, for several decades the
cost of nuclear-generated electricity
will not be low.
However, with technological ad
vances which are sure to come, and
with the payment of initial research
and development costs, prices
should come down. Our society will
have a limitless supply of cheap elec
tricity.
This supply will meet all our energy
needs. Cars could be propelled by
hydrogen produced from sea water
by electroproduction. The same
goes for airplanes. This v\ill also solve
airpollution, sincewhen hydrogen is
burned, no CO, CO(2), or NO(3) are

produced.
Going back to the beginning of the
argument, the only problem prevent
ing us from reaching or approaching
this Utopia is nuclear waste disposal.
Send it into space!
As Governor jerry Brown recently
said, space is our final frontier. Our
socfety needs a frontier for it not to
deteriorate.
The way to get rid of nuclear
wastes is simple — send it into space.
The vastness of space is astronom
ical. Space cannot be polluted — al
most by definition. We can send nuc
lear wastes to the sun — just give it a
push (with a rocket) so it escapes
earth's gravitational pull; the sun will
subsequently pull it, and when it
reaches the sun it will disappear
there without leaving a trace. Any
thing reaching the sun disintegrates
immediately into its elementary par
ticles.
If you are a hardened environmen
talist, still worried about polluting
the sun, you may prefer sending the
waste on a course slightly missing the
sun. The sun will then push it away
from the solar system, into an end
less voyage through the galaxy. The
worst that can happen is that another
civilization of thinking beings will in
tercept it and consider it worthwhile
to get in contact with us; a contact
which will benefit us all.
Dumping wastes in space may be
an expensive undertaking initially.
But, considering the immense be
nefits, it should be worth while to
invest in it at least ten per cent of the
U.S. defense budget, annually.
