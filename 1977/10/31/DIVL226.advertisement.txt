EARN OVER'6OOA MONTH
FOR THE REST Of YOUR
SENIOR YEAR.
If you are interested in math, physics or engineering,
the Navy has a program you should know about.
It's called the NUPOC-Collegiate Program (NUPOC
is short for Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate), and if
you qualify it can pay you as much as $611 a month for
the remainder of your senior year. Then after 16 weeks of
Officer Candidate School, you will receive an additional
year of advanced technical education, education that
would cost thousands in a civilian school, but in the
Navy we pay you. And at the end of the year of training,
you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus.
It isn't easy. Only one of every six applicants will be
selected, and there are fewer than 300 openings. But
those who make it find themselves in one of the most
elite engineering training programs anywhere. With
unequalled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 salary in
four years, plus travel, medical benefits and education
opportunities.
For more details on this program, ask your
placement officer when a Navy representative will be on
campus, or call the Officer Program Office listed below;
or send your resume to Navy Nuclear Officer Program,
Code 312, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22203. The
NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help
you finish college; it can lead to an exciting opportunity.
