# Stanford takes Pac-8 lead
## Cards down Beavers, 26-7 
### Bruce Anderson 
Corvallis, Ore. — It rained
on everything in Corvallis
Saturday — everything but
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances
which seemed nurtured by the
lite-giving showers.
With |ust seconds remaining
in the Cardinals' 26-7 victory
over Oregon State, the Parker
Stadium public address an
nouncer read two scores to any
of the 20,196 drenched fans
who remained for the final
gun.
The first score was a final
one: California 17, USC 14.
And with five minutes remain
ing, he announced, UCLA led
Washington, 20-12. The Bruins
held on to that advantage and
Stanford moved to the top of
the juggled Pacific-8 stand
ings.
Through the damp, chill
Oregon air wafted a premature
redolence of roses. Stanford,
alone atop the conference
standings, now must confront
the reality that it is a Rose Bowl
contender.
But things must still happen
before Stanford tans can make
plane reservations for
Pasadena:
—Stanford must win its re

maining three games and
—Washington must lose one
more game or
—Washington and UCLA
must win all their remaining
games.
Stanford only a spoiler?
First-year Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has maintained a low
profile about Stanford's Rose
Bowl possibilities throughout
the season saying that the Car
dinals' role will be as a spoiler
of others' bowl ambitions.
"Today's results make it all
very interesting in the Pac-8
this year," Walsh said Satur
day. "Don't count 'SC out.
UCLA, Washington, Cal and
ourselves are all in it. It's cer
tainly a race now."
The Cardinals got them
selves in contending position
by downing the Beavers with
strong defense and a sound
ball-control offense despite
driving rain which came and
went during the game.
"The highlight ot the game
was the play of our defense,"
Walsh said. "Our defense
played well today. It was our
best defensive game of the
year."
The Card defense held the
Beavers at bay through the first

quarter while the Stanford of
fense waited for the rain to
subside enough to establish its
offense.
And when the rain let up in
the second quarter, the Stan
ford attack provided the de
luge. With first-and-10 from
the Cardinal 20, quarterback
Guy Benjamin fired a bullet to
flanker James Lofton for a 24-
yard pickup.
As it did through much of the
game, Oregon State blitzed its
linebackers up the middle on
the next play but fullback |ohn
Finley slid off left end and
romped 26 yards to the Beaver
29. Finley's run set up a 48-yard
field goal by Ken Naber, the
freshman place kicker's
longest three-pointer ever.
Stanford's defense thwarted
Oregon State for three plays
and took possession on the
OSU 49 following a 10-yard
punt return by Card Darrin
Nelson.
On first down Benjamin
threw a screen pass to Finley
who powered down the side
line for a 12-yard gain. Nelson
then broke loose ewer Stan
ford's left tackle Gordon King
and raced 24 yards before
