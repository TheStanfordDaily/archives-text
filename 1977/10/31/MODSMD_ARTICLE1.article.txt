# Stanford takes Pac-8 lead
## Cards down Beavers, 26-7 
### Bruce Anderson 
Corvallis, Ore. — It rained
on everything in Corvallis
Saturday — everything but
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances
which seemed nurtured by the
lite-giving showers.
With |ust seconds remaining
in the Cardinals' 26-7 victory
over Oregon State, the Parker
Stadium public address an
nouncer read two scores to any
of the 20,196 drenched fans
who remained for the final
gun.
The first score was a final
one: California 17, USC 14.
And with five minutes remain
ing, he announced, UCLA led
Washington, 20-12. The Bruins
held on to that advantage and
Stanford moved to the top of
the juggled Pacific-8 stand
ings.
Through the damp, chill
Oregon air wafted a premature
redolence of roses. Stanford,
alone atop the conference
standings, now must confront
the reality that it is a Rose Bowl
contender.
But things must still happen
before Stanford tans can make
plane reservations for
Pasadena:
—Stanford must win its re

maining three games and
—Washington must lose one
more game or
—Washington and UCLA
must win all their remaining
games.
Stanford only a spoiler?
First-year Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has maintained a low
profile about Stanford's Rose
Bowl possibilities throughout
the season saying that the Car
dinals' role will be as a spoiler
of others' bowl ambitions.
"Today's results make it all
very interesting in the Pac-8
this year," Walsh said Satur
day. "Don't count 'SC out.
UCLA, Washington, Cal and
ourselves are all in it. It's cer
tainly a race now."
The Cardinals got them
selves in contending position
by downing the Beavers with
strong defense and a sound
ball-control offense despite
driving rain which came and
went during the game.
"The highlight ot the game
was the play of our defense,"
Walsh said. "Our defense
played well today. It was our
best defensive game of the
year."
The Card defense held the
Beavers at bay through the first

quarter while the Stanford of
fense waited for the rain to
subside enough to establish its
offense.
And when the rain let up in
the second quarter, the Stan
ford attack provided the de
luge. With first-and-10 from
the Cardinal 20, quarterback
Guy Benjamin fired a bullet to
flanker James Lofton for a 24-
yard pickup.
As it did through much of the
game, Oregon State blitzed its
linebackers up the middle on
the next play but fullback |ohn
Finley slid off left end and
romped 26 yards to the Beaver
29. Finley's run set up a 48-yard
field goal by Ken Naber, the
freshman place kicker's
longest three-pointer ever.
Stanford's defense thwarted
Oregon State for three plays
and took possession on the
OSU 49 following a 10-yard
punt return by Card Darrin
Nelson.
On first down Benjamin
threw a screen pass to Finley
who powered down the side
line for a 12-yard gain. Nelson
then broke loose ewer Stan
ford's left tackle Gordon King
and raced 24 yards before

and one loss.
being shoved out of bounds at
the 13.
Finley bulled through the
middle for three yards and
then Benjamin tossed a 10-yard
touchdown pass to James Lof
ton. From a slot right, Lofton
ran a square out and found
himself all alone one yard into
the end zone with Benjamin's
pass. The touchdown recep
tion was Lofton's 10th TD grab
of the season, breaking the
Stanford record for single sea
son touchdown receptions.
The rain, which had stopped
before halftime, returned with
the players for the second half.
Oregon State put together
its only sustained drive late in
the third quarter. With fourth
and-goal from the three, quar
terback John Norman threw a
sprint-out pass to tailback

Terry Beck in the right corner
of the end zone.
The rain eased up again and
Stanford retaliated for the OSU
touchdown with an 80-yard
scoring drive.
Dry scores
"Every time we scored it
wasn't raining, if I remember
right," Lofton said after the
game.
Finley began the drive bust
ing through the middle and
breaking four tackles on a 21-
yard ramble.
"John Finley ran the ball ex
tremely well today," Walsh
said. "He had two or three vital
runs during the game."
Sending Nelson wide and
Finley through the center of
the line, Benjamin moved the
Cards to the OSU 22. The na
tion's leading passer then
flicked a pass to Nelson who

was alone near the right side
line.
Nelson ran untouched to the
four where an OSU defender
hit him, but the freshman run
ning phenom managed to stay
on his feet until he lunged ac
ross the goal line to put Stan
ford on top, 17-7.
Exploit the blitz
"Nelson was the primary re
ceiver," Benjamin said. "They
had a safety blitzing and
linebackers blitzing. I don't
know how six or seven guys
managed to pick up eight or
nine guys but we did and that
gave me enough time to make
the play go."
While Benjamin turned in
another superior passing per
formance — completing 17 of
29 passes for 176 yards —
OSU's Norman was a study in
ineptness, completing but five

of 14 passes for 31 yards.
Norman suffered further in
dignity when freshman
linebacker Tom Hall dumped
him in the OSU end zone mid
way through the final period.
The safety gave Stanford
possession of the ball. The
Cards then drove 57 yards for
their final touchdown, the
score coming on a 9-yard pass
over the middle from Benjamin
to sophomore halfback Gor
don Banks.
Heavens in Stanford's favor
"The weather broke in our
favor as the game progressed,"
Walsh said. "We were con
cerned at the start because of
the rain. We couldn't handle
the ball and we couldn't
throw."
"It was tough to throw long
so we tried to run a ball-control
offense," Benjamin said.
"When the ball gets wet it's dif
ficult to throw. Fortunately our
running game was going and
we didn't need it (the long pass
game). They have a good de
fensive line and for us to be
able to run so well against them
was impressive."
Nelson and Finley shoul
dered the brunt of the
backfield duties for the Cards,
Nelson carrying 13 times for 82
yards and Finley running nine
times for 67 yards. Nelson has
742 yards for the season and
needs only three more to set a
Pacific-8 freshman rushing re

cord.
Stanford's fired-up defense
complemented its balanced of
fense.
Shored-up middle
"The linebacking was
dramatically better than it has
been," Walsh said. "Gordy
Ceresino returned to his old
form today."
Ceresino, Stanford's middle
linebacker, has had his effec
tiveness reduced most of the
season by a knee injury. He
said that his knee felt better
yesterday than it has at any
time since the preseason. He
led the Cards with 21 tackles
but only had words of praise
for another part of the defense
— the front four.
"The defensive line played
its most fantastic game ever. I
didn't have much action with
everything stopping at the
line."
"We knew they'd try to run
the ball up the middle," said
defensive end Chuck Evans,
who finished the game with 16
tackles. "We worked on cut
ting off the inside running
game and the sprint out. Dean
Wilson and Geoff Kieburtz did
a great job shutting down the
inside run."
"It was the kind of defense
we've been looking for all sea
son — aggressive defense,"
Ceresino said. "It's the kind of
defense we'll need next week
in the Coliseum against USC."

tremely well today," Walsh
said. "He had two or three vital
runs during the game."
Sending Nelson wide and
Finley through the center of
the line, Benjamin moved the
Cards to the OSU 22. The na
tion's leading passer then
flicked a pass to Nelson who

was alone near the right side
line.
Nelson ran untouched to the
four where an OSU defender
hit him, but the freshman run
ning phenom managed to stay
on his feet until he lunged ac
ross the goal line to put Stan
ford on top, 17-7.
Exploit the blitz
"Nelson was the primary re
ceiver," Benjamin said. "They
had a safety blitzing and
linebackers blitzing. I don't
know how six or seven guys
managed to pick up eight or
nine guys but we did and that
gave me enough time to make
the play go."
While Benjamin turned in
another superior passing per
formance — completing 17 of
29 passes for 176 yards —
OSU's Norman was a study in
ineptness, completing but five

of 14 passes for 31 yards.
Norman suffered further in
dignity when freshman
linebacker Tom Hall dumped
him in the OSU end zone mid
way through the final period.
The safety gave Stanford
possession of the ball. The
Cards then drove 57 yards for
their final touchdown, the
score coming on a 9-yard pass
over the middle from Benjamin
to sophomore halfback Gor
don Banks.
Heavens in Stanford's favor
"The weather broke in our
favor as the game progressed,"
Walsh said. "We were con
cerned at the start because of
the rain. We couldn't handle
the ball and we couldn't
throw."
"It was tough to throw long
so we tried to run a ball-control
offense," Benjamin said.
"When the ball gets wet it's dif
ficult to throw. Fortunately our
running game was going and
we didn't need it (the long pass
game). They have a good de
fensive line and for us to be
able to run so well against them
was impressive."
Nelson and Finley shoul
dered the brunt of the
backfield duties for the Cards,
Nelson carrying 13 times for 82
yards and Finley running nine
times for 67 yards. Nelson has
742 yards for the season and
needs only three more to set a
Pacific-8 freshman rushing re

cord.
Stanford's fired-up defense
complemented its balanced of
fense.
Shored-up middle
"The linebacking was
dramatically better than it has
been," Walsh said. "Gordy
Ceresino returned to his old
form today."
Ceresino, Stanford's middle
linebacker, has had his effec
tiveness reduced most of the
season by a knee injury. He
said that his knee felt better
yesterday than it has at any
time since the preseason. He
led the Cards with 21 tackles
but only had words of praise
for another part of the defense
— the front four.
"The defensive line played
its most fantastic game ever. I
didn't have much action with
everything stopping at the
line."
"We knew they'd try to run
the ball up the middle," said
defensive end Chuck Evans,
who finished the game with 16
tackles. "We worked on cut
ting off the inside running
game and the sprint out. Dean
Wilson and Geoff Kieburtz did
a great job shutting down the
inside run."
"It was the kind of defense
we've been looking for all sea
son — aggressive defense,"
Ceresino said. "It's the kind of
defense we'll need next week
in the Coliseum against USC."

Corvallis, Ore. — It rained
on everything in Corvallis
Saturday — everything but
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances
which seemed nurtured by the
lite-giving showers.
With |ust seconds remaining
in the Cardinals' 26-7 victory
over Oregon State, the Parker
Stadium public address an
nouncer read two scores to any
of the 20,196 drenched fans
who remained for the final
gun.
The first score was a final
one: California 17, USC 14.
And with five minutes remain
ing, he announced, UCLA led
Washington, 20-12. The Bruins
held on to that advantage and
Stanford moved to the top of
the juggled Pacific-8 stand
ings.
Through the damp, chill
Oregon air wafted a premature
redolence of roses. Stanford,
alone atop the conference
standings, now must confront
the reality that it is a Rose Bowl
contender.
But things must still happen

Pasadena:
—Stanford must win its re

maining three games and
—Washington must lose one
more game or
—Washington and UCLA
must win all their remaining
games.
Stanford only a spoiler?
First-year Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has maintained a low
profile about Stanford's Rose
Bowl possibilities throughout
the season saying that the Car
dinals' role will be as a spoiler
of others' bowl ambitions.
"Today's results make it all
very interesting in the Pac-8
this year," Walsh said Satur
day. "Don't count 'SC out.
UCLA, Washington, Cal and
ourselves are all in it. It's cer
tainly a race now."
The Cardinals got them
selves in contending position
by downing the Beavers with
strong defense and a sound
ball-control offense despite
driving rain which came and
went during the game.
"The highlight ot the game
was the play of our defense,"
Walsh said. "Our defense
played well today. It was our
best defensive game of the
year."
The Card defense held the
Beavers at bay through the first

quarter while the Stanford of
fense waited for the rain to
subside enough to establish its
offense.
And when the rain let up in
the second quarter, the Stan
ford attack provided the de
luge. With first-and-10 from
the Cardinal 20, quarterback
Guy Benjamin fired a bullet to
flanker James Lofton for a 24-
yard pickup.
As it did through much of the
game, Oregon State blitzed its
linebackers up the middle on
the next play but fullback |ohn
Finley slid off left end and
romped 26 yards to the Beaver
29. Finley's run set up a 48-yard
field goal by Ken Naber, the
freshman place kicker's
longest three-pointer ever.
Stanford's defense thwarted
Oregon State for three plays
and took possession on the
OSU 49 following a 10-yard
punt return by Card Darrin
Nelson.
On first down Benjamin
threw a screen pass to Finley
who powered down the side
line for a 12-yard gain. Nelson
then broke loose ewer Stan
ford's left tackle Gordon King
and raced 24 yards before

the 13.
Finley bulled through the
middle for three yards and
then Benjamin tossed a 10-yard
touchdown pass to James Lof
ton. From a slot right, Lofton
ran a square out and found
himself all alone one yard into
the end zone with Benjamin's
pass. The touchdown recep
tion was Lofton's 10th TD grab
of the season, breaking the
Stanford record for single sea
son touchdown receptions.
The rain, which had stopped
before halftime, returned with
the players for the second half.
Oregon State put together
its only sustained drive late in
the third quarter. With fourth
and-goal from the three, quar
terback John Norman threw a
sprint-out pass to tailback

Terry Beck in the right corner
of the end zone.
The rain eased up again and
Stanford retaliated for the OSU
touchdown with an 80-yard
scoring drive.
Dry scores
"Every time we scored it
wasn't raining, if I remember
right," Lofton said after the
game.
Finley began the drive bust
ing through the middle and
breaking four tackles on a 21-
yard ramble.
"John Finley ran the ball ex

said. "He had two or three vital

Stanford only a spoiler?
First-year Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has maintained a low
profile about Stanford's Rose
Bowl possibilities throughout
the season saying that the Car
dinals' role will be as a spoiler
of others' bowl ambitions.
"Today's results make it all
very interesting in the Pac-8
this year," Walsh said Satur
day. "Don't count 'SC out.
UCLA, Washington, Cal and
ourselves are all in it. It's cer
tainly a race now."
The Cardinals got them
selves in contending position
by downing the Beavers with
strong defense and a sound
ball-control offense despite
driving rain which came and
went during the game.
"The highlight ot the game
was the play of our defense,"
Walsh said. "Our defense
played well today. It was our
best defensive game of the
year."
The Card defense held the
Beavers at bay through the first

quarter while the Stanford of
fense waited for the rain to
subside enough to establish its
offense.
And when the rain let up in
the second quarter, the Stan
ford attack provided the de
luge. With first-and-10 from
the Cardinal 20, quarterback
Guy Benjamin fired a bullet to
flanker James Lofton for a 24-
yard pickup.
As it did through much of the
game, Oregon State blitzed its
linebackers up the middle on
the next play but fullback |ohn
Finley slid off left end and
romped 26 yards to the Beaver
29. Finley's run set up a 48-yard
field goal by Ken Naber, the
freshman place kicker's
longest three-pointer ever.
Stanford's defense thwarted
Oregon State for three plays
and took possession on the
OSU 49 following a 10-yard
punt return by Card Darrin
Nelson.
On first down Benjamin
threw a screen pass to Finley
who powered down the side
line for a 12-yard gain. Nelson
then broke loose ewer Stan
ford's left tackle Gordon King
and raced 24 yards before

and one loss.
being shoved out of bounds at
the 13.
Finley bulled through the
middle for three yards and
then Benjamin tossed a 10-yard
touchdown pass to James Lof
ton. From a slot right, Lofton
ran a square out and found
himself all alone one yard into
the end zone with Benjamin's
pass. The touchdown recep
tion was Lofton's 10th TD grab
of the season, breaking the
Stanford record for single sea
son touchdown receptions.
The rain, which had stopped
before halftime, returned with
the players for the second half.
Oregon State put together
its only sustained drive late in
the third quarter. With fourth
and-goal from the three, quar
terback John Norman threw a
sprint-out pass to tailback

Terry Beck in the right corner
of the end zone.
The rain eased up again and
Stanford retaliated for the OSU
touchdown with an 80-yard
scoring drive.
Dry scores
"Every time we scored it
wasn't raining, if I remember
right," Lofton said after the
game.
Finley began the drive bust
ing through the middle and
breaking four tackles on a 21-
yard ramble.
"John Finley ran the ball ex
tremely well today," Walsh
said. "He had two or three vital
runs during the game."
Sending Nelson wide and
Finley through the center of
the line, Benjamin moved the
Cards to the OSU 22. The na
tion's leading passer then
flicked a pass to Nelson who

was alone near the right side
line.
Nelson ran untouched to the
four where an OSU defender
hit him, but the freshman run
ning phenom managed to stay
on his feet until he lunged ac
ross the goal line to put Stan
ford on top, 17-7.
Exploit the blitz
"Nelson was the primary re
ceiver," Benjamin said. "They
had a safety blitzing and
linebackers blitzing. I don't
know how six or seven guys
managed to pick up eight or
nine guys but we did and that
gave me enough time to make
the play go."
While Benjamin turned in
another superior passing per
formance — completing 17 of
29 passes for 176 yards —
OSU's Norman was a study in
ineptness, completing but five

of 14 passes for 31 yards.
Norman suffered further in
dignity when freshman
linebacker Tom Hall dumped
him in the OSU end zone mid
way through the final period.
The safety gave Stanford
possession of the ball. The
Cards then drove 57 yards for
their final touchdown, the
score coming on a 9-yard pass
over the middle from Benjamin
to sophomore halfback Gor
don Banks.
Heavens in Stanford's favor
"The weather broke in our
favor as the game progressed,"
Walsh said. "We were con
cerned at the start because of
the rain. We couldn't handle
the ball and we couldn't
throw."
"It was tough to throw long
so we tried to run a ball-control
offense," Benjamin said.
"When the ball gets wet it's dif
ficult to throw. Fortunately our
running game was going and
we didn't need it (the long pass
game). They have a good de
fensive line and for us to be
able to run so well against them
was impressive."
Nelson and Finley shoul
dered the brunt of the
backfield duties for the Cards,
Nelson carrying 13 times for 82
yards and Finley running nine
times for 67 yards. Nelson has
742 yards for the season and
needs only three more to set a
Pacific-8 freshman rushing re

cord.
Stanford's fired-up defense
complemented its balanced of
fense.
Shored-up middle
"The linebacking was
dramatically better than it has
been," Walsh said. "Gordy
Ceresino returned to his old
form today."
Ceresino, Stanford's middle
linebacker, has had his effec
tiveness reduced most of the
season by a knee injury. He
said that his knee felt better
yesterday than it has at any
time since the preseason. He
led the Cards with 21 tackles
but only had words of praise
for another part of the defense
— the front four.
"The defensive line played
its most fantastic game ever. I
didn't have much action with
everything stopping at the
line."
"We knew they'd try to run
the ball up the middle," said
defensive end Chuck Evans,
who finished the game with 16
tackles. "We worked on cut
ting off the inside running
game and the sprint out. Dean
Wilson and Geoff Kieburtz did
a great job shutting down the
inside run."
"It was the kind of defense
we've been looking for all sea
son — aggressive defense,"
Ceresino said. "It's the kind of
defense we'll need next week
in the Coliseum against USC."

had a safety blitzing and
linebackers blitzing. I don't
know how six or seven guys
managed to pick up eight or
nine guys but we did and that
gave me enough time to make
the play go."
While Benjamin turned in
another superior passing per
formance — completing 17 of
29 passes for 176 yards —
OSU's Norman was a study in
ineptness, completing but five

of 14 passes for 31 yards.
Norman suffered further in
dignity when freshman
linebacker Tom Hall dumped
him in the OSU end zone mid
way through the final period.
The safety gave Stanford
possession of the ball. The
Cards then drove 57 yards for
their final touchdown, the
score coming on a 9-yard pass
over the middle from Benjamin
to sophomore halfback Gor
don Banks.
Heavens in Stanford's favor
"The weather broke in our
favor as the game progressed,"
Walsh said. "We were con
cerned at the start because of
the rain. We couldn't handle
the ball and we couldn't
throw."
"It was tough to throw long
so we tried to run a ball-control
offense," Benjamin said.
"When the ball gets wet it's dif
ficult to throw. Fortunately our
running game was going and
we didn't need it (the long pass
game). They have a good de
fensive line and for us to be
able to run so well against them
was impressive."
Nelson and Finley shoul
dered the brunt of the
backfield duties for the Cards,
Nelson carrying 13 times for 82
yards and Finley running nine
times for 67 yards. Nelson has
742 yards for the season and
needs only three more to set a
Pacific-8 freshman rushing re

cord.
Stanford's fired-up defense
complemented its balanced of
fense.
Shored-up middle
"The linebacking was
dramatically better than it has
been," Walsh said. "Gordy
Ceresino returned to his old
form today."
Ceresino, Stanford's middle
linebacker, has had his effec
tiveness reduced most of the
season by a knee injury. He
said that his knee felt better
yesterday than it has at any
time since the preseason. He
led the Cards with 21 tackles
but only had words of praise
for another part of the defense
— the front four.
"The defensive line played
its most fantastic game ever. I
didn't have much action with
everything stopping at the
line."
"We knew they'd try to run
the ball up the middle," said
defensive end Chuck Evans,
who finished the game with 16
tackles. "We worked on cut
ting off the inside running
game and the sprint out. Dean
Wilson and Geoff Kieburtz did
a great job shutting down the
inside run."
"It was the kind of defense
we've been looking for all sea
son — aggressive defense,"
Ceresino said. "It's the kind of
defense we'll need next week
in the Coliseum against USC."

Corvallis, Ore. — It rained
on everything in Corvallis
Saturday — everything but
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances
which seemed nurtured by the
lite-giving showers.
With |ust seconds remaining
in the Cardinals' 26-7 victory
over Oregon State, the Parker
Stadium public address an
nouncer read two scores to any
of the 20,196 drenched fans
who remained for the final
gun.
The first score was a final
one: California 17, USC 14.
And with five minutes remain
ing, he announced, UCLA led
Washington, 20-12. The Bruins
held on to that advantage and
Stanford moved to the top of
the juggled Pacific-8 stand
ings.
Through the damp, chill
Oregon air wafted a premature
redolence of roses. Stanford,
alone atop the conference
standings, now must confront
the reality that it is a Rose Bowl
contender.
But things must still happen
before Stanford tans can make
plane reservations for
Pasadena:
—Stanford must win its re

maining three games and
—Washington must lose one
more game or
—Washington and UCLA
must win all their remaining
games.
Stanford only a spoiler?
First-year Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has maintained a low
profile about Stanford's Rose
Bowl possibilities throughout
the season saying that the Car
dinals' role will be as a spoiler
of others' bowl ambitions.
"Today's results make it all
very interesting in the Pac-8
this year," Walsh said Satur
day. "Don't count 'SC out.
UCLA, Washington, Cal and
ourselves are all in it. It's cer
tainly a race now."
The Cardinals got them
selves in contending position
by downing the Beavers with
strong defense and a sound
ball-control offense despite
driving rain which came and
went during the game.
"The highlight ot the game
was the play of our defense,"
Walsh said. "Our defense
played well today. It was our
best defensive game of the
year."
The Card defense held the
Beavers at bay through the first

quarter while the Stanford of
fense waited for the rain to
subside enough to establish its
offense.
And when the rain let up in
the second quarter, the Stan
ford attack provided the de
luge. With first-and-10 from
the Cardinal 20, quarterback
Guy Benjamin fired a bullet to
flanker James Lofton for a 24-
yard pickup.
As it did through much of the
game, Oregon State blitzed its
linebackers up the middle on
the next play but fullback |ohn
Finley slid off left end and
romped 26 yards to the Beaver
29. Finley's run set up a 48-yard
field goal by Ken Naber, the
freshman place kicker's
longest three-pointer ever.
Stanford's defense thwarted
Oregon State for three plays
and took possession on the
OSU 49 following a 10-yard
punt return by Card Darrin
Nelson.
On first down Benjamin
threw a screen pass to Finley
who powered down the side
line for a 12-yard gain. Nelson
then broke loose ewer Stan
ford's left tackle Gordon King
and raced 24 yards before

being shoved out of bounds at
the 13.
Finley bulled through the
middle for three yards and
then Benjamin tossed a 10-yard
touchdown pass to James Lof
ton. From a slot right, Lofton
ran a square out and found
himself all alone one yard into
the end zone with Benjamin's
pass. The touchdown recep
tion was Lofton's 10th TD grab
of the season, breaking the
Stanford record for single sea
son touchdown receptions.
The rain, which had stopped
before halftime, returned with
the players for the second half.
Oregon State put together
its only sustained drive late in
the third quarter. With fourth
and-goal from the three, quar
terback John Norman threw a
sprint-out pass to tailback

Terry Beck in the right corner
of the end zone.
The rain eased up again and
Stanford retaliated for the OSU
touchdown with an 80-yard
scoring drive.
Dry scores
"Every time we scored it
wasn't raining, if I remember
right," Lofton said after the
game.
Finley began the drive bust
ing through the middle and
breaking four tackles on a 21-
yard ramble.
"John Finley ran the ball ex
tremely well today," Walsh
said. "He had two or three vital
runs during the game."
Sending Nelson wide and
Finley through the center of
the line, Benjamin moved the
Cards to the OSU 22. The na
tion's leading passer then
flicked a pass to Nelson who

was alone near the right side
line.
Nelson ran untouched to the
four where an OSU defender
hit him, but the freshman run
ning phenom managed to stay
on his feet until he lunged ac
ross the goal line to put Stan
ford on top, 17-7.
Exploit the blitz
"Nelson was the primary re
