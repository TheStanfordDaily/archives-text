'What is fair?'
I hope the Supreme Court's deci
sion in the Bakke case will have
answered the question "what is
fair?" For if a democracy, republic, or
any legitimate organization is to sur
vive and grow, there must be con
stitutional, legislative and legal fair
ness.
Fairness in this country is nothing
more or less than equality of oppor
tunity â€” everybody getting an equal
shot at the goodies. To be fair to all,
the Bakke decision must decide what
is equality of opportunity.
The Bakke case is quite simple. The
University of California thinks affir
mative action is fair. Bakke thinks it is
not. The many other university
related cases are also quite clear. Is
or is not affirmative action fair?
The answer to all of these cases
must begin with another question.
Has there been equality of opportun

ity?
Consider a hypothetical case of
two high school seniors trying to
enter Stanford as undergraduates.
One applicant is from Choate and
the other from Los Angeles Manual
Arts.
Choate likely offers more classes
in Russian literature than Manual
Arts does in English. The Choate
preppie might spend his whole
senior year studying for the SAT. The
Manual Arts fellow may be ignorant
of the SAT until the week he takes it.
Quite predictably, the Choate
preppie is better qualified to enter
Stanford. But is it fair to compare the
two? Has there been equality of op
portunity?
Obviously there hasn't. But be
cause Stanford is fair, allowances are
made, and both are accepted.
Now, four years later both are try
ing to enter Stanford as medical stu

dents, and Choate again lias higher
grades and MCAT scores. Now what
should Stanford do? What is fair?
The answer again starts with the
question, has there been equal op
portunity? This time there has. Both
applicants spent four years at the
same school where they had access
to the same professors, classes, labs
and MCAT study sessions.
Affirmative action, if it is to be fair,
must have a starting and ending
point. It must start when people with
unequal opportunities compete for
similar ends. It must end when equal
opportunity is present.
All applicants to the UC-Davis
medical school have had four years
as undergraduates to prepare for
medical school. The opportunities
were equal for everyone. If Bakke is
justly qualified, he should be admit
ted. This is fair. R|ch Kar|gaard
