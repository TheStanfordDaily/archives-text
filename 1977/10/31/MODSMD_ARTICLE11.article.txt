# Pot growing gains hobby status

### Theresa Simons 
The presence of marijuana at
Stanford is nothing new. How
ever, the popularity of the
leaves has led many en
thusiasts to a new pastime —
gardening.
Assemblyman Willy Brown's
bill, recently introduced in the
California State Legislature,
would reduce the crime of hav
ing two Cannabis plants from a
felony to a misdemeanor.
Growing marijuana now car
ries a state penalty of three to
14 years in prison and/or a fine
of $10,000.
Despite its consequences,
pot cultivators say there is little
fear of the law.
Lax
"Police are so lax. Unless
they find a lot of it, and they
find you're dealing, they'll
leave you alone," explained
one student living off-campus
with two roommates.
Others were not so blase. Of

the three roommates, one felt
quite "paranoid" for months
about the plants growing in the
backyard despite the fact they
were well-hidden by trees and
a vegetable garden.
The popularity of growing
pot has spread, in many cases,
by word of mouth. As one cul
tivator commented, "Those
who do it, like it and recom
mend it to others."
Since animals are not al
lowed in dormitories, the
plants become pets.
They acquire such names as
the "Willy Brown Special," are
talked to and even serenaded.
"Yes, I talk to my plants a
lot," said one dorm resident.
"So does everyone else who
comes in." Such cared-for
plants usually thrive.
Outdoors
In California, most persons
prefer to grow their plants out
doors provided they can find a
secluded place. This is because

a higher grade of pot can be
produced outdoors than in
doors with lights.
La Honda is a popular grow
ing spot. The soil is excellent
although the climate is some
what cool and foggy for tropi
cal plants, according to one of
many books on the subject of
pot growing.
Those living in dormitories
and fraternities often keep pot
plants inside their rooms but
save themselves the expense
and inconvenience of lights by
placing the plants on the win
dowsill where they have as
much sunshine and fresh air as
needed.
Like in any other hobby, the
level of interest and care varies
from one cultivator to another.
The off-campus student had
disposed of some roaches in
his backyard during a party.
The favorable soil and climate
resulted in a garden of six
plants.

"They grow better than the
other weeds," he said.
Preferences
Other cultivators view their
hobby as a science. Quality of
seeds and soil is a prime con
sideration. Hawaiian and
Panamanian Red are common
preferences, according to
pot-growing literature. Col
ombian, though popular for
smoking, is more difficult to
cultivate.
Some enthusiasts have even
obtained Sensimilla, a seedless
breed that is known for its po
tency since the resin (Can
nabinol) that would normally
go into seed production stays
in the leaves.
When seeds are selected,
planting begins. According to
books on growing marijuana,
germination in water can ac
celerate early development but
it can also decrease the po
tency of the plant.
Seeds should be planted
where they will have plenty of
room for root development,
either outdoors or in a pot no
smaller than one foot deep and
nine inches in diameter
Cornfields
For indoor plants, nursery
potting soil is good. Outdoor

plants are known to thrive in
cornfields. One student found
that "Tennessee homegrown
(in a cornfield) was the best I
ever had."
Once they have sprouted,
the plants should be watered
every four or five days. If
fluorescent lights are used,
very high output (VHO) fix
tures are best. They should be
used nine to 16 hours per day.
When the plants are ready to
harvest, certain measures can
be taken to increase the
amount of resin in the leaves.
Fertilizing and watering should
be terminated two weeks be
fore the harvest. Temperature
should be increased. Sun
lamps and heat lamps are good
for this.
An excellent book on the ac
tual harvesting of the plant
(and what to do with the har
vest) is "A Child's Garden of
Grass" by Jack S. Margolis and
Richard Ghlorfene.
The introduction of "A
Guide to Growing Cannabis
Under Fluorescents," states
that the pamphlet is not
printed to "promote any illegal
acts," but to be used simply as
a reference work on raising
plants under fluorescents.

outdoors, although many enthusiasts keep their plants as pets
inside their rooms.
