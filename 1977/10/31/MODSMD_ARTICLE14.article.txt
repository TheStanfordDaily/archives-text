## Soccer team tops Santa Clara 
### Dean Eyre 
Moraga — The Stanford soc
cer team ran its undefeated
streak to nine games with vic
tories over Santa Clara Thurs
day and St. Mary's College Fri
day. Since their last loss, on
Oct. 5 to UCLA, the offense has
chalked up 39 goals, while the
stingy defense has allowed
only one regulation score, and
two others in overtime.
The Cardinals turned back
the Broncos 1-oThursday night
at Buck Shaw Stadium before
700 spectators and the travel
led across the Bay Saturday to
defeat the Gaels 5-0. The two
victories raise Stanford's sea
son record to 9-6-2.
The game against Santa Clara
began with early domination

by the Broncos, and it looked
like a long nightwas in store for
Stanford.
"Santa Clara's attack the first
12 minutes was the most awe
some I've ever seen in my
whole collegiate career," said
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge. "We couldn't even
throw the ball in properly.
They were overruning us —
I've never seen anything like
it."
However, the Card defense
kept the Broncos from scoring
as the team recovered its poise
and turned the tide.
"All of a sudden we caught
on, as a matter of fact, they
(Santa Clara) started to tire,"
said Lodge. "It's the type of
training we do. While they are

tiring, we are running by
them."
Stanford kept the pressure
on Santa Clara for the rest of
the match, creating oppor
tunities by running hard
through its defense. With
11:36 remaining in the game,
Paul Kozachenko scored the
game's only goal in a one-on
one situation against the
Bronco goalkeeper.
"First I thought, 'Oh wow,
what if I miss,' then I just tried
to concentrate and put the ball
in," Kozachenko said. "It was
very nice to beat them —we've
never beaten them before (in
his Stanford career)."
"It comes awfully close to
the feeling when we tied (de
fending NCAA champion) USF

4-4 (last season)," said Lodge.
Against St. Mary's, the Cards
jumped off to an early lead on a
head ball by Jon Hecht.
Second half goals by
Kozachenko, Hecht and two by
Dan McNevin put the game out
of reach.
St. Mary's head coach
George Oousakas said that the
Gaels "stayed close in the first
half, but couldn't keep up in
the second half. Stanford has
good athletes and can run
well."
Oousakas said he was par
ticularly impressed with Jim
Melamed's play, describing
the Card midfielder as "very
strong, a good play-maker, and
able to make good passes and
set up the offense."
