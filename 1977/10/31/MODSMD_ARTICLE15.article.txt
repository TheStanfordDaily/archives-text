### Tom Simpson 
The Stanford men's cross
country team ran away from
Cal and UCLA to capture the
Pacific-8 Southern Division
Championship at UCLA Satur
day. Roy Kissin was the Card's
top finisher, placing third at
31:25 over the 6.2-mile course.
The two other teams in the
meet, Arizona and Arizona
State, placed runners in first
and second, respectively.

Kissin set the pate for the
first three miles before Thorn
Hunt of Arizona took over.
Hunt's time of 3:34.6 was the
third fastest ever over UCLA's
hilly, urban course. Steve Pre
fontaine set the record at
29:56.
Finishing behind Kissin for
Stanford were Tom Lobsinger
in 10th at 32:13, Harold Celms
in 16th at 32:36, Jerry Emory in
17th at 32:44, and Tom O'Neill
in 22nd at 33:09.
Arizona, expected to be
tough, won the five-way meet
with 35 points, followed by
Stanford with 68, Cal with 71,
UCLA with 83 and Arizona State
with 101. In the Pac-8 three-way
meet, the scoring was Stanford
36, Cal 40 and UCLA 46.
Stanford coach Marshall
Clark said he felt that Kissin
and Lobsinger ran well. He said
Emory looks to be back in form
after a slow start this year.
The women's team rested
this week but will compete in
the AIAW Qualifying Meet on
Nov. 5. The men now prepare
for their biggest meet of the
year, the Pac-8
Championships/NCAA District
8 Qualifying-Combined Meet
at the Stanford Golf Course,
Nov. 12 at 11 a.m. Washington
State, featuring Kenyans
Joshua Kimeto, Samson Kim
wombwa and Henry Rono, will
be favorites for the team
championship.
