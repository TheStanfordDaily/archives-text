The Pacific-8 Conference provides its football champion as
its representative in the Rose Bowl. If a tie for the champion
ship occurs, all tied teams are declared conference champ
ions, and the following procedures determine the Pac-8 rep
resentative in the Rose Bowl:
a. If one champion has defeated the other champion(s),
that victorious team shall be the Rose Bowl representative.
b. If one champion has not defeated the other champ
ion(s), the team with the best overall season percentage will be
the representative.
c. If one champion has not defeated the other champ-
and the teams have identical overall season percen
tages, the team which has not appeared in the Rose Bowl for
the longest period of time will be the representative.
