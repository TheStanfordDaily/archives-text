# Poloists sink USC, UC-lrvine
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
Junior Tom Angelo scored a
goal with 19 seconds left in the
second overtime period to
break a 10-10 tie and give the
Stanford water polo team an
11-10 victory over UC-lrvine
Saturday.
The victory followed a strong
defensive effort against USC
Friday which resulted in a 10-2
win for the Stanford poloists.
In Saturday's cliff-hanger,
the Cards led the entire game
and held a 9-8 lead with only
five seconds to play in regula
tion time. Irvine, however,
executed a perfect play in the
remaining seconds, climaxed
by Gary Figueroa firing a shot
past freshman goalie John
Cansel's outstretched arms,
sending the game into over
time.
After an exciting first over
time period in which both
teams scored a goal in the last
minute, the battle continued
into the last moments of the
second overtime when
sophomore Randy Kalbus
lofted a pass to Angelo, who
popped out in front of the goal
and whipped it into the netting
for the victory margin. With six
seconds left, Gansel sealed the
victor by grabbing an Irvine
lob shot.

Angelo led the team with
four goals in the game and
junior Doug Burke had five as
sists, all on man-up situations.
"We dominated play," said
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti, "and we really
worked for good shots. We
played a good team game, of
fensively and defensively. We
did everything we wanted to
do, particularly on defense.
"Angelo is 'Mr. Clutch,' " he
added. "He played a very in
tense game. When he wants it,
he just goes out and gets it."
According to Dettamanti,
two factors contributed to the
closeness of the game.
"I usually don't criticize the
referees," he said, "but every
time we got ahead, the officials
turned it around for Irvine."
The other factor was Cansel,
who was weak and tired from
an illness. Even so, the
freshman finished the game
with 15 saves and three steals.
"John played a super game,
considering," Dettamanti said.
"If he had been able to have
just an average game for us, we
might have won by three or
four goals."
Cansel's problems on Satur
day, however, were more than
made up for by his perfor
mance the previous day.

Against USC Cansel made 17
saves in the three quarters he
played. At one point in the
game, the Trojans took four
successive shots from close
range. The first three Cansel
blocked back to Trojan players
and on the fourth, he reached
to the opposite side of the cage
to block the ball, recovering it
himself.
Afterward, Cansel could say
nothing more about his play
than, "Everything was right. It
was just luck."
Though Dettamanti was
complimentary of his goalie's
play, he was more impressed
by the Cardinal defense.
"It was the best defensive ef
fort for us all year," he said.
"We didn't give them any good
shots."
Junior Robby Arnold, who
was shut down on offense last
week against Long Beach and
Irvine, came back this
weekend with four goals, three
of which came against the Tro
jans. Juniors Doug Burke and
Dave Egan each put two past

the USC goalie.
Egan, who also had an assist
and a steal, has now secured
the starting job as hole man,
switching off with senior Rick
Johannsen. According to De
ttamanti, there are two reasons
for this.
"Egan is a little stronger and
a little bit better ball handler
than Rick," he said. "Putting
Egan in the hole lets Rick drive
more which he (Rick) is excel
lent at."
Senior Marty Davis, who
scored three goals over the
weekend, summed up his feel
ings about the USC game by
saying, "Anytime I can get out
of the pool in the third quarter,
I'm happy."
Next Friday, the Cards travel
to Los Angeles for games with
USC and UCLA. Dettamanti,
after his team's performance
this weekend, is confident.
"If john has a good game and
we play good defense," he
said, "I believe we can keep
any team from scoring more
than five goals."
