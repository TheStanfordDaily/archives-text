The Stanford field hockey
team improved its season re
cord to 9-2-1 after three hard
fought games in southern
California this weekend.
Friday, the scotchers held
undefeated Pomona to a 2-2 tie
after coming from behind with
a last minute goal.
Three-year letter winner
Onnie Kiilefer produced the
first score which put Stanford
in the lead throughout most of
the game. Late in the second
period, Pomona scored two
goals to jump ahead, but
senior Mandy Read retaliated
to tie the score 2-2.
Saturday Stanford dealt Long
Beach State its second defeat

of the season as Nancy White
scored on a corner shot to win
the game 2-1.
Stanford coach Barbara
Longstreth attributes the suc
cess to a much-improved de
fense.
"Our defense got consis
tently better as the weekend
went along. Onnie was inter
cepting all over the field and
everyone was playing as a
unit."
The Cards' final game against
San Diego State was won 2-0 on
first-half goals from Kelly Wes
terwick and Onnie Kiilefer.
The first-year Stanford coach
said "the quality of competi
tion in the south is excellent."
