Idi Amin's repression of the Ugan
dan Anglican Church is not an iso
lated event, a Ugandan bishop told a
Mem Chu audience Friday.
Bishop Festo Kivengere, who, fear
ing tor his life, fled Uganda last
winter, said that pressure against
Christians has occurred throughout
Ugandan history.
In his speech, which was spon
sored by the Stanford Christian Fel
lowship, he described oppression of
Christians in Rhodesia, Ethiopia and
Northern Ireland as well.
Anniversary
Kivengere, pointing out that |une
was the 100 th anniversary of the
Christian church in Uganda, de
scribed the history of the Ugandan
Anglican church. Ffe said that the
Christian church suffered a great
deal of persecution even in its be
ginning.
In 1885, Kivengere said, a Ugandan
bishop was murdered because the
king felt he was becoming too strong
and because the king felt the bishop
would overthrow him. This death
was followed by hundreds of deaths
climaxing in the public execution of
three boys, aged 11 to 15.
The deaths did not deter Ugandans
from joining the Christian faith.
When the boys were murdered, the
citizens were so impressed that the
boys died for their religion 40 more
people wanted to be baptized Christ
ians, Kivengere said.
But he said he did not expect to
"go through the same thing 100 years
later." Although the bishop said he
was prepared for his own execution
any time, he was shocked when Ar
chbishop Luwum was taken by Idi
Amin in front of Kivengere's eyes and
then executed last Feb. 16.
'Committed to preach'
He added that he remembered Ar
chbishop Luwum saying in February
at a sermon, "I am committed to
preach this and therefore I am com
mitted to die for it." The bishop fi
nally said that after Luwum's execu
tion, he realized he was next in the
line for executions, so he had to
leave Uganda.
Kivengere said the Christian
church's troubles are not peculiar to
Uganda or even Africa. He referred
to the troubles in Ulster, saying that
pressures on the Irish church caused
such violence. Kivengere said he was
horrified at the destruction and
death when he visited Ireland this
year.
"Why is there so much death in
religion?" he asked.
Kivengere has preached in
Fthiopia, Germany, Ireland and
throughout the United States since
his exile in February. He received his
seminary training at the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, where he
graduated in 1966. He was ordained a
bishop in 1972.
