Rampage reported in Lithuania
Moscow — Thousands of Lithuanians shouted
anti-Soviet and nationalist slogans at a recent soc
cer match and then went on a rampage through
the streets of Vilnius, the capital of Soviet
Lithuania, dissident sources said yesterday.
They reported cars were overturned, police veh
icles set afire, windows smashed and Soviet prop
aganda banners torn down in the rioting on the
night of Oct. 10.
The next morning, they said, troops armed with
automatic weapons patrolled the streets of Vil
nius, also known as Vilna. There has been sporadic
violence there since Lithuania was taken over by
the Soviet Union in 1940.
Contacted by telephone, the duty officer at the
International Ministry in Vilnius confirmed a dis
turbance had taken place after the soccer match
but he said it was not serious.
Alexander Podrabinek, an ambulance medic
who also speaks out on human rights, told West
ern newsmen he recently visited Vilnius, where he
gathered details of the incident.
He said residents told him that the troubles
began at an evening soccer match between a Vil
nius team and a Russian team from Smolensk,
when members of the crowd began to shout "Rus
sians go home" and "Katsapy," a derogatory term
for Russians.
Israelis demand compensation
Tel Aviv, Israel — Israel's move toward a free
market economy set off strikes and buying sprees
yesterday as workers demanded compensation for
sudden price hikes and shoppers hunted last
minute bargains before the increases take full ef
fect.
Postal employes staged a one-day strike, com
munications technicians walked out for two hours
and longshoremen planned a day-long shutdown
today of Ashodod, Israel's biggest port.
Leaders of the 1.1 million member Histadrut
labor federation set up what they called a "war
room" to coordinate their campaign for wage in
creases by lanuary to offset a 10 per cent cost-of

living rise expected to result from the new
economic policy announced late Friday.
Prices of 150 basic commodities such as food,
gasoline and public transportation rose an average
of 11 per cent yesterday after the Likud govern
ment eliminated subsidies for them as part of its
move toward a free market economy after 29 years
of Socialist policies under Labor governments.
Factory relocation rules urged
Washington — A campaign is on in Congress
and among local officials to regulate the relocation
of factories in the wake of recent changes by some
major corporations.
Proponents hope to minimize the damage to a
community when a company moves a production
site.
"Not only are jobs being lost, but the entire tax
and financial structures of many states and cities
are in jeopardy," says Edward Kelly of the Ohio
Public Interest Campaign.
The issue heated up after Voungstown Steel and
Iron announced it was closing its foundry in
Struthers, Ohio, to concentrate declining produc
tion needs in Illinois. Later, Zenith announced it is
shifting assembly of its television sets from U.S.
communities to the low-cost labor meccas of
Taiwan and Mexico.
Bill stalled by abortion impasse
Washington — Still deadlocked over a national
energy program, Congress will try today to break
an impasse over abortions which could tie up
paychecks for thousands of federal employes.
House and Senate conferees have been arguing
since july over guidelines for federal funding of
abortions, the most controversial portion of a bill
that will govern health care programs for the poor
during the next year.
The resolution was passed Oct. 13, when it be
came clear Congress could not agree immediately
on an abortion policy. Without it, employes at the
departments of Labor and Health, Education and
Welfare and some smaller, related agencies would
have gone without full paychecks until the issue
was resolved.

Cosmetic firms get delay
Washington — The Food and Drug Administra
tion (FDA) is giving the cosmetics industry a partial
delay on a new requirement that aerosol spray
cans with fluorocarbons carry warning labels.
Most newly shipped aerosol cans of deodor
ants, hair spray and other products must carry the
fluorocarbon warning starting today.
But the cosmetics industry won a delay in the
warning requirement for an estimated 43 million
to 60 million cans of cosmetic fragrances and gift
packs until Dec. 31, after the peak Christmas sale
season for those items is over.
The industry convinced FDA Commissioner
Donald Kennedy that it would be costly and would
disrupt sales to require the warning now on the
fragrances and gift packs.
The warning requirement is part of a govern
ment plan to phase out use of fluorocarbon prop
ellants by 1979 because of fears that the chemical is
eroding the protective layer of ozone in the earth's
atmosphere and may lead to more skin cancers.
