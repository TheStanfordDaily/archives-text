# Cal's banner now on The Farm

The biggest play of the USC-Cal
game was executed after the final
gun.
Eight members of Stanford's Zeta
Psi fraternity, including longtime ac
tive Ed Snate, risked lite and
ankle to abscond with Berkeley's
6-by-30-foot blue and gold banner
Saturday afternoon at Cal.
The banner has been unfurled at
every major athletic event in recent
Cal history, and is handcuffed to
guards when moved. It was Stan
ford's first successful attempt on the
banner.
Other members of the strike force
were Charlie Hepworth, Tom Peder
son, Bob Fleintz, Peter Dailey, lack
Bunce, Tom Maynard and Paul
Stewart.
After casing the Cal-Oregon State
game two weeks ago, the group
gathered for a final strategy session
in Snate's clandestine office under
neath the Zete pond. Operation
"Edna" was underway.
Five BVj by 11 Vi topographical
maps delineating the scene of the
potential hit were distributed to each
man.
At 11:15 a.m. Saturday, the eight
had taken up positions among the
trees on "Tightwad Hill." Five hours
later, it was time.
Forty-five minutes after the game,
Pederson, Dailey, Flepworth, Bunce
and Maynard entered the stadium.
Snate, guiding the attack from the
press box, gave the go-ahead.
Pederson and Dailey edged their
way to the top of the stands, one
section over from where security
guards were stuffing the banner into
a duffle bag.
Before the Berkeley rally guards
had a chance to handcuff themselves
to the bag, Pederson and Dailey
raced over, ripped it away and
heaved it over the 10-foot fence sur
rounding Cal's stadium. Stewart was
waiting (impatiently) there to grab
and go.
"Everybody was frozen," recalled
Pederson.
Fortunately, the banner ended up
on the outside, where Stewart trans

ferred it to Fleintz on the getaway
minibike.
While Heintz and the concealed
banner were having some Blitz beers
at the Cal band rally, Pederson was in
a more precarious position.
Hounded by three even-better
muscled goons and a Doberman
Pinscher, Pederson was forced to go
down a staircase leading out of the
stadium. One of the guards wisely
dove down the concrete stairs, and
broke his ankle. Not Pederson's
ankle, but the security guard's.
Typical of the Stanford humanita
rian student body, Pederson re
mained there to help the guard, and
was consequently arrested by the
UC-Berkeley campus police.
While his accomplices were across

the street discussing the events of
the day at Blimpies, a local watering
hole, Pederson was being processed
by the police. According to patrol
man Eric Colburn, charges of grand
the*t against Pederson will be filed
today. A hearing has been set for
Nov. 21, two days after the Big Game.
In summing up "Edna," Snate said,
"The execution was dazzling. I didn't
think coach Walsh could have de
signed a better play."
Pederson, who was released on his
own recognizance, had nothing to
say.
"But next time I think Pederson
will appreciate the importance of
conditioning," Snate said. "Instead
of running the stadium stairs last
week, he worked out at Zot's."

brothers' escapades at the USC-Cal game on Saturday.
