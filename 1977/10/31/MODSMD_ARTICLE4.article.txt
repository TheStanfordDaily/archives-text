# S. Africans battle SWAPO guerillas

### 
Pretoria, South Africa — Black
guerrillas fought a 36-hour battle
with South African troops on both
sides of South-West Africa's border
with Angola last week in the heaviest
fighting of the 10-year-old bush war
over the disputed territory.
Sixty-one guerrillas and five gov
ernment troops were killed in the
battle, military officials reported late
Saturday. It was the highest govern
ment toll to date against guerrillas of
the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), who are fight
ing to end South African administra
tion of the former German colony.
The officials said the battle erupted
Thursday afternoon just south of the
800-mile Angolan border.
They said government forces en
gaged an 80-man SWAPO unit, bat
tled back and forth across the border
and reached the guerrillas' "most
northern base" in Angola before re
treating Saturday morning.
The announcement gave no other
details about the location of the fight
ing or how far the South Africans
penetrated into Angola.
South Africa has ruled South-West
Africa — a former German colony
populated by 850,000 blacks and
100,000 whites and called Namibia by
black Africans — for 31 years, 12 of
them in defiance of United Nations
resolutions. The Pretoria govern
ment is currently negotiating with
Western powers for the territory's
independence.
The stepped-up fighting occurred
as the U.N. Security Council debated
a proposed arms embargo to punish
SoutFi Africa's white minority gov
ernment for an Oct. 19 crackdown
against critics of its racial policies at

home.
Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said in
an interview published yesterday
that the government would "recon
sider its position" favoring indepen
dence for South-West Africa and
black rule in Rhodesia if the council
adopted the measure.
A council vote is expected early
this week. Black African diplomats
are holding out for a comprehensive
trade boycott, but U.S. Ambassador
Andrew Young said yesterday he
would not support one.
He said such a move "doesn't
make sense businesswise" because
462 American corporations have $3
billion invested in South Africa and"I
know nobody is reasonably going to
pick up three billion dollars worth of
plants and products and equipment
and move it anywhere."
Botha and other officials here have
said South Africa could withstand an
arms embargo because the country
can produce most of the armaments
it needs.
Independent observers estimate
South Africa has 10,000 to 15,000
troops in South-West Africa. They
are arrayed against 300 guerrillas in
side the territory and another 3400
across the borders in Angola and
Zambia.
The Western-sponsored talks on
the territory are bogged down over
demands by the guerrilla group for a
complete withdrawal of the South
African troops as a condition for tak
ing part in the election of a pre
independence government.
South Africa says it will not pull out
completely unless asked to do so by
such a government.

The announcement gave no other
details about the location of the fight
ing or how far the South Africans
penetrated into Angola.
South Africa has ruled South-West
Africa — a former German colony
populated by 850,000 blacks and
100,000 whites and called Namibia by
black Africans — for 31 years, 12 of
them in defiance of United Nations
resolutions. The Pretoria govern
ment is currently negotiating with
Western powers for the territory's
independence.
The stepped-up fighting occurred
as the U.N. Security Council debated
a proposed arms embargo to punish
SoutFi Africa's white minority gov
ernment for an Oct. 19 crackdown
against critics of its racial policies at

home.
Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said in
an interview published yesterday
that the government would "recon
sider its position" favoring indepen
dence for South-West Africa and
black rule in Rhodesia if the council
adopted the measure.
A council vote is expected early
this week. Black African diplomats
are holding out for a comprehensive
trade boycott, but U.S. Ambassador
Andrew Young said yesterday he
would not support one.
He said such a move "doesn't
make sense businesswise" because
462 American corporations have $3
billion invested in South Africa and"I
know nobody is reasonably going to
pick up three billion dollars worth of
plants and products and equipment
and move it anywhere."
Botha and other officials here have
said South Africa could withstand an
arms embargo because the country
can produce most of the armaments
it needs.
Independent observers estimate
South Africa has 10,000 to 15,000
troops in South-West Africa. They
are arrayed against 300 guerrillas in
side the territory and another 3400
across the borders in Angola and
Zambia.
The Western-sponsored talks on
the territory are bogged down over
demands by the guerrilla group for a
complete withdrawal of the South
African troops as a condition for tak
ing part in the election of a pre
independence government.
South Africa says it will not pull out
completely unless asked to do so by
such a government.
Pretoria, South Africa — Black
guerrillas fought a 36-hour battle
with South African troops on both
sides of South-West Africa's border
with Angola last week in the heaviest
fighting of the 10-year-old bush war
over the disputed territory.
Sixty-one guerrillas and five gov
ernment troops were killed in the
battle, military officials reported late
Saturday. It was the highest govern
ment toll to date against guerrillas of
the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), who are fight
ing to end South African administra
tion of the former German colony.
The officials said the battle erupted
Thursday afternoon just south of the
800-mile Angolan border.
They said government forces en
gaged an 80-man SWAPO unit, bat
tled back and forth across the border
and reached the guerrillas' "most
northern base" in Angola before re
treating Saturday morning.
The announcement gave no other
details about the location of the fight
ing or how far the South Africans
