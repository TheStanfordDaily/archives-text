# Hookers Ball: a smooth, limp affair
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
It was the guy in the black velvet
suit who did it.
I went to the Fourth Annual Hook
ers Ball Friday night expecting at the
minimum something along the lines
of the downfall of Western civiliza
tion, a continuous reenactment of
the final bacchanalian orgy before
the Vandals sacked Rome, with more
sex than the Chronicle can muster
for the front page on a good day.
I had heard stories from my
friends: dark allusions to people en
gaged in various modes of social in
tercourse (demonstrating great im
agination and animal lust), various
parts of the anatomy looming
through the darkness and a woman
blowing smoke rings without using
her mouth. . . .
And here was this impeccably tai
lored old fart in black velvet right out
of some executive suite, carrying a
Kodak instamatic and chasing after
the backside of a woman wearing a
very sheer dress.
This, of course, can be seen to rep
resent an eternal Stanford theme —
frustrated man clandestinely pursues
unattainable woman — but it smacks

too much of reality.
Reality is not what one wants to see
at the Hookers Ball. People go for
liscentious, uninhibited and possibly
illegal behavior — they do not want
to hear ball co-producer Ron Gibson
say, "All we want to see is that the
ball is run smoothly, safely and pro
fessionally," as he did this year.
The fall of Western civilization was
not run smoothly, safely or profes
sionally. The Vandals were princi
pally concerned with, and have been
admired for, pillage, arson and rape,
the honest and open expression of
deeply-held personal convictions.
The Vandals and their fellow Ger
manic barbarians did not sell sour
venir programs, posters, T-shirts or
balloons. Nor did they feel obligated
to advertise inhuman cruelty or gory
dismemberments, the way Margo St.
lames, originator and founder of the
ball, guaranteed that nudity "would
abound" at this year's ball.
In short, the Vandals never
threatened to become respectable or
a "beloved institution" — a fate
which seems to be awaiting the ball.
But maybe I am being too critical or
wasn't drunk enough Friday night —

even though the guy drinking in
front of me actually looked apologe
tic after emitting a loud, satisfying
belch. There sure were a lot of
people peering in through the glass
doors.
It's true, the Vandals weren't in
terested in fundraising for worthy
causes. St. fames' COYOTE (Cast Off
Your Old Tired Ethics), recently re
named the Victoria C. Woodhull
Foundation, after paying expenses,
will apply the remainder of the al
leged $93,000 they made to lobbying
for, among other things, the de
criminalization of prostitution and
federal funding for abortions.
And yes, there actually were
bizarrely-garbed persons who mer
ited particular attention, or de
manded it when they appeared on
the two closed-circuit TV monitors
that flanked the stage. Many of these
more imaginative costumes that left
little to the imagination are difficult
to categorize, but they relied heavily
on body paint, glitter, feathers, sex
ual innuendo, muscletone and an
obvious faith in the engineering
skills which were responsible for the
strategically placed fig leaves.

Both the Star Wars and punk
phenomena were well-represented;
then there were the usual run-of
the-mill mummies, belly dancers,
gorillas, werewolves, transvestites
and a wide variety of others: a pre
gnant nun, pregnant girl scout,
number two pencil (and two
crayons), brick wall, blind Venetian
(get it?), man whose sign declared he
was blind due to excessive masturba
tion (he asked for a tissue when he
got on stage) and the winner of the
costume competition, Rick Tringali,
who wore a spectacular but some
what conventional royal Egyptian
outfit (he got his picture in all the
papers).
The Incomparables, the LSJUMB,
transformed themselves into the
Unmentionables in honor of the oc
casion — several were in drag, one
was a tampon, another was a penis —
and duly upheld the honor of their
alma mater at the ball.
Traveling in buses, in a manner
reminiscent of Lenin's being sent ac
ross Europe by the Germans to fo
ment revolution in Russia in 1917,
and looking like a rummage sale, the
Band entered the Civic Auditorium
chanting, "Drugs, sex, violence"
after informing the crowd, "Yeah,
we're weird right here!"
It soon became apparent people
go to the ball to ogle weird people
rather than for the musical enter
tainment offered — other than the
Incomparables, it was pretty lame.
Due to the fact that the band wasn't
allowed on stage to play while the
Dollies performed — they only
played four songs — the high point
of the evening on stage was a sur
prise appearance by Chevy Chase

who volunteered the information
that the balloons which covered the
50-foot organ in the back were actu
ally inflated Trojan rubbers, donated
by the manufacturer. The symbolism
was not lost on the crowd.
Frankly, the only thing that could
have made the evening truly memor
able was if Prince Charles had ac
cepted his invitation — but he was
across the street at the Opera House
being protested at. Perhaps it was
just as well he didn't come.
What would a Prince say to a naked
lady?

ment revolution in Russia in 1917,
and looking like a rummage sale, the
Band entered the Civic Auditorium
chanting, "Drugs, sex, violence"
after informing the crowd, "Yeah,
we're weird right here!"
It soon became apparent people
go to the ball to ogle weird people
rather than for the musical enter
tainment offered — other than the
Incomparables, it was pretty lame.
Due to the fact that the band wasn't
allowed on stage to play while the
Dollies performed — they only
played four songs — the high point
of the evening on stage was a sur
prise appearance by Chevy Chase

who volunteered the information
that the balloons which covered the
50-foot organ in the back were actu
ally inflated Trojan rubbers, donated
by the manufacturer. The symbolism
was not lost on the crowd.
Frankly, the only thing that could
have made the evening truly memor
able was if Prince Charles had ac
cepted his invitation — but he was
across the street at the Opera House
being protested at. Perhaps it was
just as well he didn't come.
What would a Prince say to a naked
lady?
It was the guy in the black velvet
suit who did it.
I went to the Fourth Annual Hook
ers Ball Friday night expecting at the
minimum something along the lines
of the downfall of Western civiliza
tion, a continuous reenactment of
the final bacchanalian orgy before
the Vandals sacked Rome, with more
sex than the Chronicle can muster
for the front page on a good day.
I had heard stories from my
friends: dark allusions to people en
gaged in various modes of social in
tercourse (demonstrating great im
agination and animal lust), various
parts of the anatomy looming
through the darkness and a woman
blowing smoke rings without using
her mouth. . . .
And here was this impeccably tai
lored old fart in black velvet right out
of some executive suite, carrying a
Kodak instamatic and chasing after
the backside of a woman wearing a
very sheer dress.
This, of course, can be seen to rep
resent an eternal Stanford theme —
frustrated man clandestinely pursues
unattainable woman — but it smacks

too much of reality.
Reality is not what one wants to see
at the Hookers Ball. People go for
liscentious, uninhibited and possibly
illegal behavior — they do not want
to hear ball co-producer Ron Gibson
say, "All we want to see is that the
ball is run smoothly, safely and pro
fessionally," as he did this year.
The fall of Western civilization was
not run smoothly, safely or profes
sionally. The Vandals were princi
pally concerned with, and have been
admired for, pillage, arson and rape,
the honest and open expression of
deeply-held personal convictions.
The Vandals and their fellow Ger
manic barbarians did not sell sour
venir programs, posters, T-shirts or
balloons. Nor did they feel obligated
to advertise inhuman cruelty or gory
dismemberments, the way Margo St.
lames, originator and founder of the
ball, guaranteed that nudity "would
abound" at this year's ball.
In short, the Vandals never
threatened to become respectable or
a "beloved institution" — a fate
which seems to be awaiting the ball.
But maybe I am being too critical or
wasn't drunk enough Friday night —

even though the guy drinking in
front of me actually looked apologe
tic after emitting a loud, satisfying
belch. There sure were a lot of
people peering in through the glass
doors.
It's true, the Vandals weren't in
terested in fundraising for worthy
causes. St. fames' COYOTE (Cast Off
Your Old Tired Ethics), recently re
named the Victoria C. Woodhull
Foundation, after paying expenses,
will apply the remainder of the al
leged $93,000 they made to lobbying
for, among other things, the de
criminalization of prostitution and
federal funding for abortions.
And yes, there actually were
bizarrely-garbed persons who mer
ited particular attention, or de
manded it when they appeared on
the two closed-circuit TV monitors
that flanked the stage. Many of these
more imaginative costumes that left
little to the imagination are difficult
to categorize, but they relied heavily
on body paint, glitter, feathers, sex
ual innuendo, muscletone and an
obvious faith in the engineering
skills which were responsible for the
strategically placed fig leaves.

Both the Star Wars and punk
phenomena were well-represented;
then there were the usual run-of
the-mill mummies, belly dancers,
gorillas, werewolves, transvestites
and a wide variety of others: a pre
gnant nun, pregnant girl scout,
number two pencil (and two
crayons), brick wall, blind Venetian
(get it?), man whose sign declared he
was blind due to excessive masturba
tion (he asked for a tissue when he
got on stage) and the winner of the
costume competition, Rick Tringali,
who wore a spectacular but some
what conventional royal Egyptian
outfit (he got his picture in all the
papers).
The Incomparables, the LSJUMB,
transformed themselves into the
Unmentionables in honor of the oc
casion — several were in drag, one
was a tampon, another was a penis —
and duly upheld the honor of their
alma mater at the ball.

ual innuendo, muscletone and an
obvious faith in the engineering
skills which were responsible for the
strategically placed fig leaves.

Both the Star Wars and punk
phenomena were well-represented;
then there were the usual run-of
the-mill mummies, belly dancers,
gorillas, werewolves, transvestites
and a wide variety of others: a pre
gnant nun, pregnant girl scout,
number two pencil (and two
crayons), brick wall, blind Venetian
(get it?), man whose sign declared he
was blind due to excessive masturba
tion (he asked for a tissue when he
got on stage) and the winner of the
costume competition, Rick Tringali,
who wore a spectacular but some
what conventional royal Egyptian
outfit (he got his picture in all the
papers).
The Incomparables, the LSJUMB,
transformed themselves into the
Unmentionables in honor of the oc
casion — several were in drag, one
was a tampon, another was a penis —
and duly upheld the honor of their
alma mater at the ball.
Traveling in buses, in a manner
reminiscent of Lenin's being sent ac
ross Europe by the Germans to fo
ment revolution in Russia in 1917,
and looking like a rummage sale, the
Band entered the Civic Auditorium
chanting, "Drugs, sex, violence"
after informing the crowd, "Yeah,
we're weird right here!"
It soon became apparent people
go to the ball to ogle weird people
rather than for the musical enter
tainment offered — other than the
Incomparables, it was pretty lame.
Due to the fact that the band wasn't
allowed on stage to play while the
Dollies performed — they only
played four songs — the high point
of the evening on stage was a sur
prise appearance by Chevy Chase

who volunteered the information
that the balloons which covered the
50-foot organ in the back were actu
ally inflated Trojan rubbers, donated
by the manufacturer. The symbolism
was not lost on the crowd.
Frankly, the only thing that could
have made the evening truly memor
able was if Prince Charles had ac
cepted his invitation — but he was
across the street at the Opera House
being protested at. Perhaps it was
just as well he didn't come.
What would a Prince say to a naked
lady?
It was the guy in the black velvet
suit who did it.
I went to the Fourth Annual Hook
ers Ball Friday night expecting at the
minimum something along the lines
of the downfall of Western civiliza
tion, a continuous reenactment of
the final bacchanalian orgy before
the Vandals sacked Rome, with more
sex than the Chronicle can muster
for the front page on a good day.
I had heard stories from my
friends: dark allusions to people en
gaged in various modes of social in
tercourse (demonstrating great im
agination and animal lust), various
parts of the anatomy looming
through the darkness and a woman
blowing smoke rings without using
her mouth. . . .
And here was this impeccably tai
lored old fart in black velvet right out
of some executive suite, carrying a
Kodak instamatic and chasing after
the backside of a woman wearing a
very sheer dress.
This, of course, can be seen to rep
resent an eternal Stanford theme —
frustrated man clandestinely pursues
unattainable woman — but it smacks

too much of reality.
Reality is not what one wants to see
at the Hookers Ball. People go for
liscentious, uninhibited and possibly
illegal behavior — they do not want
to hear ball co-producer Ron Gibson
say, "All we want to see is that the
ball is run smoothly, safely and pro
fessionally," as he did this year.
The fall of Western civilization was
not run smoothly, safely or profes
sionally. The Vandals were princi
pally concerned with, and have been
admired for, pillage, arson and rape,
the honest and open expression of
deeply-held personal convictions.
The Vandals and their fellow Ger
manic barbarians did not sell sour
venir programs, posters, T-shirts or
balloons. Nor did they feel obligated
to advertise inhuman cruelty or gory
dismemberments, the way Margo St.
lames, originator and founder of the
ball, guaranteed that nudity "would
abound" at this year's ball.
In short, the Vandals never
threatened to become respectable or
a "beloved institution" — a fate
which seems to be awaiting the ball.
But maybe I am being too critical or
wasn't drunk enough Friday night —

even though the guy drinking in
front of me actually looked apologe
tic after emitting a loud, satisfying
belch. There sure were a lot of
people peering in through the glass
doors.
It's true, the Vandals weren't in
terested in fundraising for worthy
causes. St. fames' COYOTE (Cast Off
Your Old Tired Ethics), recently re
named the Victoria C. Woodhull
Foundation, after paying expenses,
will apply the remainder of the al
leged $93,000 they made to lobbying
for, among other things, the de
criminalization of prostitution and
federal funding for abortions.
And yes, there actually were
bizarrely-garbed persons who mer
ited particular attention, or de
manded it when they appeared on
the two closed-circuit TV monitors
that flanked the stage. Many of these
more imaginative costumes that left
little to the imagination are difficult
to categorize, but they relied heavily
on body paint, glitter, feathers, sex
ual innuendo, muscletone and an
obvious faith in the engineering
skills which were responsible for the
