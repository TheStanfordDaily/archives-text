## Justice, anyone? 
### 
This afternoon there will be the first meet
ing of the ASSU Senate — or rather, the first
meeting of those senate candidates who re
ceived the ten highest vote totals as under
graduates and graduates. The senate will ap
parently consider appointing a special elec
tion review board to examine the recent cam
paign and election.
We urge the senate to set up such a board —
and to grant the board full powers of investi
gation and disqualification. The senate should
also state that all decisions of the board are
final and not subject to any review.
Furthermore, the board should be charged
to consider the University's Fundamental
Standard along with the ASSU Constitution
and By-laws in judging candidates' conduct
and deciding who must be disqualified.
The ASSU by-laws deal only with the techni
cal violations of a campaign — such as posting
material in certain places. Just because past
senates chose not to write rules against the
questionable and cheap tactics that were re
cently perpetrated is no reason why the cur
rent senate can not choose to rectify these
wrongs against the student body.

Actions committed in the election include
lying, conspiring to lie, disseminating al
legedly defamatory printed attacks against
other students, attempting to deceive and
manipulate voters through "anonymous" lit
erature, intending to avoid the campaign ex
pense limit, and interfering with the election
investigation. In some cases there is evidence
of malicious intent. We fail to see how any of
these activities evidence "respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the rights of
others," as the Fundamental Standard asserts.
The credibility of the senate has not been
high during recent years. If senators, who are
ostensibly dedicated to protecting the rights
of others and truthfully informing students at
all times, vote to form a board and then leave
the board with no power and no standards
except a few technical rules on where to place
posters, they will have effectively destroyed
the senate's credibility for this year and a long
time to come.
And they will also open the way for future
senate and other student political candidates
to commit such acts as extortion, vote-buying
and physical assault during campaigns —
those aren't forbidden by ASSU rules, either.
