# A 						message to freshpeople: 'Get the hell out of Stanford!'

May I be so indulgent as to begin
what promises to be a disastrous
career as an official Daily columnist
with a small word of advice to the
newest and youngest members of
our community, the freshpeople?
Yes? Thank you.
I would like to heartily welcome all
of you to this great institution of
higher earnings, and just as heartily
bid you to get the hell out of it as fast
as possible.
Save yourselves while there is still
time. For, my dear sisters and
brothers, you are about to be intel
lectually, emotionally, and spiritually
mauled — perhaps for life.
The truth of the matter is, you are
not about to be mauled; you already
are mauled — and probably for life.
The point is, however, that this uni
versity is only going to perpetuate
your malaise, perhaps even deepen

"Goodness gracious!" you
exclaim. Does this lad have all his
wits about him? Surely, he could not
be referring to Stanford, The Stan
ford University of world fame and
acclaim. And surely he could not be
addressing himself to America's shin
ing hope for tomorrow, the best and
brightest, so solicitously selected
from amongst the supplicating
thousands. Or could he?
In 1956, Allen Ginsberg saw the
"best minds of (his) generation"
being destroyed. Things have not
changed much. Only now they are
not being destroyed by "madness,
starving hysterical naked, dragging
themselves through the negro
streets at dawn looking for an angry
fix."
Now the best minds are destroyed
quietly, almost imperceptibly as they

passively sit in great laboratories of
learning like so many inert globs of
cytoplasm, absorbing disembodied
bits of knowledge hurled at them
from a podium.
Now they are being destroyed by
the deadening hand of familiarity, by
a womb-like environment that chal
lenges only the most superficial of
cerebral content, leaving intact the
deepest prejudices of class, culture,
and familial upbringing.
No, but seriously, all poetic exces
ses aside, Stanford is really a very fine
place to be indeed, as most of you
have probably already discovered.
The people are bright and friendly,
the campus idyllic, the facilities
superb, the choice of courses
breathtaking, the ambiance free and
easy.
You must understand, of course —
as the administration will be quick to
remind you —the University is em
phatically not a democratic institu
tion. But once you have accepted this
fact, and the un-American activities it
implies, you will find, no doubt, that
the arrangement here on the whole,
is extremely liberal, flexible, and
generous. Stanford is, as I once
overheard a gentleman informing a
visitior in aristocratic cadences, "ter
ribly civilized."
Yes, indeed. One might wish Stan
ford on everybody. You might even
wish Stanford on yourself; that is, if
your major goals in life are to be just
as physically and psychologically
comfortable as could be, to be
spoon-fed as much knowledge
ideologically fitted to the status quo
as possible, and to assure your own
meteoric rise to fame and glory in
this little old crumbling world of
ours.
If, however, you have some vague,
dark inkling that life has more to
offer than obsessively worrying
about how your grade point average

is shaping up; if you, the majority to
whom I am really speaking, are
slightly troubled that your white,
middle-to-upper class, American
background (as they can tell you,
minority and lower class students
face a whole different set of conflicts
about being at Stanford) may be giv
ing you a skewed view of the world,
99 per cent of which does not share
such a background; or if, for some
quirky reason, you suspect it might
be valuable to really come to grips
with your entire conditioning, i.e. if
you want to begin to get to know
yourself; then let me reiterate my
modest proposal.
Get the hell out of Stanford! For a
year. For two. Maybe forever. Leave

with an open mind. Travel. Work. Do
anything that puts you in a totally dif
ferent milieu from that which you are
accustomed to, a milieu that chal
lenges, threatens, and affirms every
thing that you are. Above all let the
milieu work on you.
I direct this harangue especially to
the freshpeople because I myself did
receive such sage advice during one
of my very first days as a freshman
here — in an orientation session, in
fact — from an upperclassman, a
free-spirit, a product of that more
iconoclastic and adventuresome de
cade, the '60s.
I took the advice. I left for two
years after my sophomore year,
hitch-hiked around Europe, worked,

and spent the rest of the time doing
some very solitary reading and writ
ing. The whole experience was en
lightening and liberating beyond all
words.
And so why, it is only fair to ask,
did I come back to an institution
about which I obviously have so
many reservations? Well, perhaps so
that I could warn you. Perhaps with
the hope that I have enough perspec
tive and strength to resist the subtle,
but nonetheless powerful socializing
effects of being at Stanford. Or
perhaps my coming back is only a
measure of just how unfree I still am.
