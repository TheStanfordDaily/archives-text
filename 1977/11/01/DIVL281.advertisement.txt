PERSONALS
There once was a frat named KA
The boys we all thought were gay
Tf»ey had champagne and roses
And smoke in their noses
And Lambda Nu proved it could play
Hell Week is guite an occasion
The boys all think it's vacation
But nudies must study
Though eggs are guite cruddy
So we started a commando invasion
Hell week is now at its end
We re losing a late night friend
The RA used threats
But we have no regrets
1 el's hope we re not starting a trend
Love and Kisses, the nudies
