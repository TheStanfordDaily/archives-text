YES! We can bring you the finest names in athletic shoes at savings up
to 50% OFF the regular price
HOW CAN WE DO IT?
By making special arrangements with the factories to purchase those
shoes that may have a minor flaw or blemish or that have been
discontinued. You'll probably not even notice the difference. The shoe
still functions the same, giving first-class action. When you come into
the store, we also ask you to select your own size and the famous brand
you want right out of the packing case. Try them on. We'll give you
professional help if needed.

ATHLETIC
SHOE FACTORY
Comes To Palo Alto!
YES! We can bring you the finest names in athletic shoes at savings up
to 50% OFF the regular price
HOW CAN WE DO IT?
By making special arrangements with the factories to purchase those
shoes that may have a minor flaw or blemish or that have been
discontinued. You'll probably not even notice the difference. The shoe
still functions the same, giving first-class action. When you come into
the store, we also ask you to select your own size and the famous brand
you want right out of the packing case. Try them on. We'll give you
professional help if needed.
COME IN NOW AND SAVE! 3 — 5
