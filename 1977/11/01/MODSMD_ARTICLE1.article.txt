# ASSU Senate rejects plan to review election
## 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate defeated by a
13-5 vote yesterday a proposal to
create an independent Elections Re
view Board to examine alleged cam
paign irregularities.
Defeat of the ERB proposal came
after heated debate over whether
senators should be allowed to vote
on seating or disqualifying them
selves. "No" votes and arguments
against the ERB came primarily from
members of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) slate.
Almost immediately following the
senate meeting, the Daily was in
formed by senior Barry Parr of peti
tions being circulated to recall those
undergraduate senators who failed
to support the ERB.
Senators Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack also gave their support
to efforts of the ad hoc committee
circulating the petitions.
The ERB proposal called for a
senate-created review board, with
the full power of the senate, to rule
on disqualification recommenda
tions cited by the elections commis
sioner, according to Co-President
Greg Larson. The board would have
been composed of members ap
pointed by the Council of Presidents
(COP) with the approval of the se
nate, with results due Nov. 8.
Discussion on the ERB proposal
was initiated by Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy, who urged pas
sage of the COP resolution.
Murphy had earlier presented a
report calling for the disqualification
of Senators Janet Rappaport, Dan
Livingston and several alternate
senators for exceeding the $50 per
candidate spending limit.
Murphy also advocated disqualifi
cation of any SOC member who "had
any involvement in the idea, prepara

tion, or distribution" of a leaflet in
serted without authorization into the
Oct. 12 Daily.
In answer to questions by Sen.
Kenneth Nunn, Larson said the
"constitutionality of the matter is not
in question. . . the senate can create
any body it wants, to deal with any
matter."
He further urged passage of the
proposal "out of a sense of fairness"
and for student concerns which de
monstrate that it is kind of 'funny'
that the senate vote on its own dis
qualification.
Nunn said he saw no reason to
delay business of the senate any
further.
Co-President Steve Westly said he
saw no other "pressing business" at
this time and said he felt it would be
"grossly unfair that the accused
judge themselves."
Alternate-Sen. David Catanzarite
disagreed, saying that he felt the
main concern of students was to
have a credible and responsible se
nate.
Catanzarite said he thought a re
sponsible, credible senate could
exist without creation of an ERB
which could hinder that senate for an
indefinite amount of time.
Co-President Glenn Jordan re

peated that "the most important
issue is our credibility."
He added that if a review board of
some sort were not set up, he would
help with recall procedures.
Sen. Howard Wolf said he was
"firmly opposed to setting up a re
view board."
He added that the senate has little
power as it is and the senate would
be abdicating what little power it has
left in setting up an ERB.
"The way I see it, the elections
commissioner in conjunction with
the COP has screwed things up com
pletely thus far . . . and I see no
reason to let them screw things up
farther," Wolf said.
Sen. Rick Levy said he would "feel
very uncomfortable voting for any
elections review board without
knowing the extent of its powers."
He added he thought if the Senate
"brings up the issues and investi
gates the motions for disqualification
. . . and the students see that it is
handled fairly ... I don't see how
that will constitute a black cloud."
Also strongly opposed to the ERB
proposal was Sen. Marvin Anderson.
He said he had "extreme reserva
tions" as to the competence of the
elections commissioner, the accu-

racy of the articles in the Daily, and
the conduct of the COP.
He added that he thought "that
the students' judgment of honesty,
integrity and fairness is to me the
best judgment ... I am fully able to
qualify or disqualify anyone who is
now sitting on the present senate,
including myself."
Sen. Buckley supported the ERB,
saying he thought "we have to justify
ourselves in the eyes of the stu
dents."
In other senate actions, Fred
Crethel was elected senate chairman
and Meriel Burtle was approved as
deputy chairperson.
Parr said the recall petitions will be
circulated because of the "flagrant
abuse of power on the part of those
members who failed to vote for the
ERB."
Sen. Buckley also told the Daily
that "Tom McCormack and myself
will support the efforts of the ad hoc
committee and will work towards
that end to recall those undergrad
senators not supporting the ERB."
Senators can be recalled with a pet
ition signed by at least 15 per cent of
the undergraduates and with the
concurrence of two-thirds of con
stituents voting in a recall election.
Sen. Rappaport also told the Daily
"I am resigning the post of senator
because I feel that the senate has
lost, by voting down the ERB, all its
credibility as a legitimate body of
student government.

and Meriel Burtle was approved as
deputy chairperson.
Parr said the recall petitions will be
circulated because of the "flagrant
abuse of power on the part of those
members who failed to vote for the
ERB."
Sen. Buckley also told the Daily
that "Tom McCormack and myself
will support the efforts of the ad hoc
committee and will work towards
that end to recall those undergrad
senators not supporting the ERB."
Senators can be recalled with a pet
ition signed by at least 15 per cent of
the undergraduates and with the
concurrence of two-thirds of con
stituents voting in a recall election.
Sen. Rappaport also told the Daily
"I am resigning the post of senator
because I feel that the senate has
lost, by voting down the ERB, all its
credibility as a legitimate body of
student government.
The ASSU Senate defeated by a
13-5 vote yesterday a proposal to
create an independent Elections Re
view Board to examine alleged cam
paign irregularities.
Defeat of the ERB proposal came
after heated debate over whether
senators should be allowed to vote
on seating or disqualifying them
selves. "No" votes and arguments
against the ERB came primarily from
members of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) slate.
Almost immediately following the
senate meeting, the Daily was in
formed by senior Barry Parr of peti
tions being circulated to recall those
undergraduate senators who failed
to support the ERB.
Senators Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack also gave their support
to efforts of the ad hoc committee
circulating the petitions.
The ERB proposal called for a
senate-created review board, with
the full power of the senate, to rule
on disqualification recommenda
tions cited by the elections commis
sioner, according to Co-President
Greg Larson. The board would have
been composed of members ap
pointed by the Council of Presidents
(COP) with the approval of the se
nate, with results due Nov. 8.
Discussion on the ERB proposal
was initiated by Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy, who urged pas
sage of the COP resolution.
Murphy had earlier presented a
report calling for the disqualification
of Senators Janet Rappaport, Dan
Livingston and several alternate
senators for exceeding the $50 per
candidate spending limit.
Murphy also advocated disqualifi
cation of any SOC member who "had
any involvement in the idea, prepara

tion, or distribution" of a leaflet in
serted without authorization into the
Oct. 12 Daily.
In answer to questions by Sen.
Kenneth Nunn, Larson said the
"constitutionality of the matter is not
in question. . . the senate can create
any body it wants, to deal with any
matter."
He further urged passage of the
proposal "out of a sense of fairness"
and for student concerns which de
monstrate that it is kind of 'funny'
that the senate vote on its own dis
qualification.
Nunn said he saw no reason to
delay business of the senate any
further.
Co-President Steve Westly said he
saw no other "pressing business" at
this time and said he felt it would be
"grossly unfair that the accused
judge themselves."
Alternate-Sen. David Catanzarite
disagreed, saying that he felt the
main concern of students was to
have a credible and responsible se
nate.
Catanzarite said he thought a re
sponsible, credible senate could
exist without creation of an ERB
which could hinder that senate for an
indefinite amount of time.
Co-President Glenn Jordan re

peated that "the most important
issue is our credibility."
He added that if a review board of
some sort were not set up, he would
help with recall procedures.
Sen. Howard Wolf said he was
"firmly opposed to setting up a re
view board."
He added that the senate has little
power as it is and the senate would
be abdicating what little power it has
left in setting up an ERB.
"The way I see it, the elections
commissioner in conjunction with
the COP has screwed things up com
pletely thus far . . . and I see no
reason to let them screw things up
farther," Wolf said.
Sen. Rick Levy said he would "feel
very uncomfortable voting for any
elections review board without
knowing the extent of its powers."
He added he thought if the Senate
"brings up the issues and investi
gates the motions for disqualification
. . . and the students see that it is
handled fairly ... I don't see how
that will constitute a black cloud."
Also strongly opposed to the ERB
proposal was Sen. Marvin Anderson.
He said he had "extreme reserva

elections commissioner, the accu-

He added that he thought "that
the students' judgment of honesty,
integrity and fairness is to me the
best judgment ... I am fully able to

racy of the articles in the Daily, and
the conduct of the COP.
He added that he thought "that
the students' judgment of honesty,
integrity and fairness is to me the
best judgment ... I am fully able to
qualify or disqualify anyone who is
now sitting on the present senate,
including myself."
Sen. Buckley supported the ERB,
saying he thought "we have to justify
ourselves in the eyes of the stu
dents."
In other senate actions, Fred
Crethel was elected senate chairman
and Meriel Burtle was approved as
deputy chairperson.
Parr said the recall petitions will be
circulated because of the "flagrant
abuse of power on the part of those
members who failed to vote for the
ERB."
Sen. Buckley also told the Daily
that "Tom McCormack and myself
will support the efforts of the ad hoc
committee and will work towards
that end to recall those undergrad
senators not supporting the ERB."
Senators can be recalled with a pet
ition signed by at least 15 per cent of
the undergraduates and with the
concurrence of two-thirds of con
stituents voting in a recall election.
Sen. Rappaport also told the Daily
"I am resigning the post of senator
because I feel that the senate has
lost, by voting down the ERB, all its
credibility as a legitimate body of
student government.
The ASSU Senate defeated by a
13-5 vote yesterday a proposal to
create an independent Elections Re
view Board to examine alleged cam
paign irregularities.
Defeat of the ERB proposal came
after heated debate over whether
senators should be allowed to vote
on seating or disqualifying them
selves. "No" votes and arguments
against the ERB came primarily from
members of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) slate.
Almost immediately following the
senate meeting, the Daily was in
formed by senior Barry Parr of peti
tions being circulated to recall those
undergraduate senators who failed
to support the ERB.
Senators Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack also gave their support
to efforts of the ad hoc committee
circulating the petitions.
The ERB proposal called for a
senate-created review board, with
the full power of the senate, to rule
on disqualification recommenda
tions cited by the elections commis
sioner, according to Co-President
Greg Larson. The board would have
been composed of members ap
pointed by the Council of Presidents
(COP) with the approval of the se
nate, with results due Nov. 8.
Discussion on the ERB proposal
was initiated by Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy, who urged pas
sage of the COP resolution.
Murphy had earlier presented a
report calling for the disqualification
of Senators Janet Rappaport, Dan
Livingston and several alternate
senators for exceeding the $50 per
candidate spending limit.
Murphy also advocated disqualifi
cation of any SOC member who "had
any involvement in the idea, prepara

tion, or distribution" of a leaflet in
serted without authorization into the
Oct. 12 Daily.
In answer to questions by Sen.
Kenneth Nunn, Larson said the
"constitutionality of the matter is not
in question. . . the senate can create
any body it wants, to deal with any
matter."
He further urged passage of the
proposal "out of a sense of fairness"
and for student concerns which de
monstrate that it is kind of 'funny'
that the senate vote on its own dis
qualification.
Nunn said he saw no reason to
delay business of the senate any
further.
Co-President Steve Westly said he
saw no other "pressing business" at
this time and said he felt it would be
"grossly unfair that the accused
judge themselves."
Alternate-Sen. David Catanzarite
disagreed, saying that he felt the
main concern of students was to
have a credible and responsible se
nate.
Catanzarite said he thought a re
sponsible, credible senate could
exist without creation of an ERB
which could hinder that senate for an
indefinite amount of time.
Co-President Glenn Jordan re

peated that "the most important
issue is our credibility."
He added that if a review board of
some sort were not set up, he would
help with recall procedures.
Sen. Howard Wolf said he was
"firmly opposed to setting up a re
view board."
He added that the senate has little
power as it is and the senate would
be abdicating what little power it has
left in setting up an ERB.
"The way I see it, the elections
commissioner in conjunction with
the COP has screwed things up com
pletely thus far . . . and I see no
reason to let them screw things up
farther," Wolf said.
Sen. Rick Levy said he would "feel
very uncomfortable voting for any
elections review board without
knowing the extent of its powers."
He added he thought if the Senate
"brings up the issues and investi
gates the motions for disqualification
. . . and the students see that it is
handled fairly ... I don't see how
that will constitute a black cloud."
Also strongly opposed to the ERB
proposal was Sen. Marvin Anderson.
He said he had "extreme reserva
tions" as to the competence of the
