# Group brings politics here
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Political education is not in
doctrination, but an active ex
change of various views. And a
student-run organization has
taken the initiative to bring var
ious politicians and top-level
decision-makers to Stanford to
tell students what goes on
beyond the Farm fences.
The Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE) is
"not here to entertain. We're
here to educate," according to
co-chairman Kick Weber.
"Students carr skim a news
paper or watch 10 to 15 minutes
of Walter Cronkite but they
won't have the background
they need to make their own
political decisions. We try to
educate the students so they
can make their own deci
sions," said Weber.
SCOPE was tormed two
years ago as an off-shoot ot the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Filling a void
The Speakers Bureau, sup
ported by student fee assess
ments, was "under pressure"
to avoid concentrating solely
on political and/or controver
sial speakers, said co-chairman
Brad Krevoy.
Thus, SCOPE came to fill the
political education vacuum,
and now provides symposia
on current political topics of in
terest.
"We like to work with the
departments of the univer
sity," said Weber.

"These events represent an
additional commitment on the
part of professors and the uni
versity to bring education from
the outside world into the clas
sroom," said Krevoy.
SCOPE'S first program for
this quarter will feature Benja
min Bradlee, executive editor
of the Washington Post and
former editor of Newsweek
magazine, discussing "The
Power of the Press, from
Watergate to Lancegate."
"It won't be a Watergate re
hash, but a symposium on the
power of the press in shaping
public opinion and the effect
of the media or government,"
said Weber.
The committee plans to have
Asst. Prof. Marion Lewenstein
from the communication de
partment and an as yet un
selected political science pro
fessor participate in the sym
posium and comment on Brad
lee's lecture.
Day with Bradlee
The committee, which
began contacting speakers for
this year during the summer,
has also planned to have Brad
lee discuss the Kennedy Ad
ministration with a political
science class, have dinner with
faculty members, drink coffee
with Stanford's professional
journalism fellows and meet
students at Toyon Lounge after
the symposium.
The ASSU Flicks Service has
obtained the film "All The Pres

ident's Men," the dramatiza
tion of Washington Post jour
nalists Carl Bernstein and Bob
Woodward's uncovering of the
Watergate crimes, to be shown
prior to Bradlee's speech, said
Krevoy.
While the movie may cost a
dollar, all SCOPE symposia are
free, Krevoy said.
SCOPE members estimate
the cost of bringing Bradlee to
campus will be about $3635.
SCOPE obtains funding for its
programs from the Dickinson
Symposium, the Office of Stu
dent Activities and from some
university departments.
Determining who comes to
campus is "a trade-off deci
sion," said Krevoy. "We con
sider what it will cost, how well
the event will come off, the
dates available for au
ditoriums."
Campaigns
Not limited to hiring speak
ers alone, SCOPE, in the spring
of 1976, invited speakers rep
resenting the various primary
presidential candidates to
speak, distributed campaign
information and then held a
straw election whose results
were reported in Time and
Newsweek magazines, said
Krevoy.
Last fall, "Campaign '76" was
SCOPE's theme as it sponsored
the debate between Republi
can U.S. Representative Pete
McCloskey and his Democratic
opponent, David Harris, to an

overflow crowd at Kresge Au
ditorium.
Sen. Frank Church came to
speak on behalf of then
presidential hopeful Jimmy
Carter and Asst. Secretary of
the Treasury Gerald Parksy
spoke on behalf of President
Gerald Ford.
"Campaign '76" was held in
conjunction with the Politics in
America class sponsored by
the Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI). The program cul
minated at the American
Studies House on election
night where throngs of stu
dents and a few professors
gave play by play commentary
as theelection results rolled in.
Other speakers brought to
campus over the year included
Paul Warnke, chief negotiator
during the SALT; Bud Arnold,
a media consultant who pro
duced President John F. Ken
nedy's presidential media
campaign; David Broder, a
syndicated columnist who
commented on changes in
Washington since the arrival of
the Carter Administration and
Allard Lowenstein, head of the
U.S. delegation to the United
Nations on human rights.
Future SCOPE plans include
doing programs on cabinet
level decision-making with
speakers from the various pres
idential administrations since
Kennedy, environmental is

sues in California organized by
SCOPE member Kitty Boone
and women in politics, or
ganized by one of SCOPE'S ini
tial founders, Lisa Foster.

"The resources are here,"
remarked co-chairman Alex
Alben.
"And the reward is seeing
people talking about the

events. It shows SCOPE pro
vides an ideal supplement to
their education," said Krevoy.
SCOPE is having a meeting at
7 tonight at Toyon lounge.
