# Sun watch to show 'mysteries'

### 
Pasadena (AP) A four-year
space mission, designed to il
luminate mysteries of the sun
from vantage points never
reached before, is being plan
ned for the 1980s by U.S. and
European scientists.
Officials of the Jet Propul
sion Laboratory said yesterday
that the project was planned to
observe the sun from positions
other than along its equatorial
plane, the flat, disc-shaped im
aginary line known as the eclip
tic that extends from the sun
through the orbits of the
planets.
It is as if the sun were at the
center of a giant phonograph
record and the planets spun
around in orbits arranged like
the bands of individual songs.
The aim of the proposed mis
sion could be compared to
leaving the record's surface to
view it from above and below.
The plan calls for the use of
twin spacecraft, one to be built
by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and
the other by the 10-nation
European Space Agency.
The Space Shuttle, a reusa
ble spaceplane now being de
veloped for short space flights,
would carry the satellites out of
the Earth's gravitational pull
and launch them toward |upi-
ter, the largest planet in the
solar system, lupiter's gravita
tional pull would be used as a
slingshot-like booster to posi
tion the spacecraft.
Officials said it would be im
possible, by today's standards,
to generate a rocket blast tre
mendous enough to place the
satellites in position without
using lupiter's pull as a boos
ter.
The satellites would simul
taneously observe the sun's
northern and southern hemis
pheres and take scientific read

ings of its radiation, magnetic
field, outer atmosphere and
surface features at all latitudes
The flights would also take
the satellites over the sun's
poles.
"All the observations of the
sun we've made are based on
being in a single plane; we
don't see what comes out of
the sun at its poles," said Nor
man Haynes, manager of
spacecraft programs at |PL.
The team of scientists which
proposed the project in a | PL
report said the flow of energy
from the sun is of tremendous

interest because of its effects
on the climate and weather of
the Earth.
Their report also stressed the
need to observe the sun's con
vection layer. "Energy is
brought to the surface of the
sun, to be radiated into space,
by fluid motions in the outer
layer of the sun, the convec
tion layer," it said.
"Our climate, and thus life
on Earth are dependent on the
physics of the convection
layer, and we are in need of
understanding it. Indeed,
there is tantalizing evidence
that in the historical past the

fluid motions in the convection
layer changed, with resulting
climate changes on Earth."
NASA reportedly will re
quest startup funds for the pro
ject in its next budget to meet a
198* launch date and arrival of
the spacecraft at observation
distance of the sun in 1986.
Cost of the project to the
U.S. agency would be an esti
mated $140 million.
Because of the sun's intense
heat, the craft would be aimed
to arrive no closer than about
70 million miles — about the
same distance away as the
planet Venus.
