# NFL ticket prices attacked
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Ralph Nader
sponsored consumer sports organization, say
ing high ticket prices set by some National Foot
hall League (NFL) teams are making the sport an
"elitist form of entertainment," called on the
league yesterday to impose a limit on ticket
prices.
In arguing that the high ticket prices in the
league rarely are justified by the teams' operat
ing expenses, the recently formed group also
asked that the 28 teams annually disclose costs,
revenues and profits.
The comments came in a letter to NFL Com
missioner Pete Rozelle.
Peter Gruenstein, the executive director of
Fight to Advance the Nation's Sport (FANS),
wrote: "The corporations, law firms and other
businesses which purchase large blocks of tic
kets can afford to pay high prices — especially
since they take tax write-offs on them but, in
creasingly, the average fan is in danger of being
priced out of the stadium.
"It's a myth, pure and simple, that ticket
prices in the NFL generally bear a strong rela
tionship to costs, particularly player salaries,"
said Gruenstein. "The NFL provides a classic
case of monopoly pricing. There is no competi
tive pressure to keep prices down, so teams
charge what the market will bear.
"The more loyalty customers show, the more
the owners sock it to them," he said.
FANS, whose formation was announced Sept.

27, officially begins its operation today. It is an
independent membership organization of
sports fans which received $10,000 in start-up
money from Nader.
The group, which charges annual dues of $9,
hopes to attract a membership of 10,000 to
20,(XX) within a year to protect sports fans from
what its organizers call abuses by leagues,
teams, owners and players.
According to research done by FANS, the NFL
is on the verge of "pricing the average fan out of
the stadium."
The organization said the Seattle Seahawks
have the highest average ticket prices in the NFL
at $11.79 followed by Washington, $11.27 and
Denver, $11.12. Los Angeles, at $7.37, has the
lowest average prices followed by Cleveland,
$7.38 and Green Bay, $7.48.
It was pointed out to Cruenstein that the Rams
only sell tickets priced at $12 and $10 so there is
no way the average price could be $7.37.
Cruenstein said his researcher was out of
town yesterday but conceded that the figures
could be in error. He said he would double
check when the researcher returned to
Washington.
According to FANS, the average ticket price in
the NFL is $9.67.
The group also said Washington and Philadel
phia sell the highest priced tickets — $20 —with
the New York lets next at $19.75.
