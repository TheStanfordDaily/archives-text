# Ski
## A special section of the Stanford Daily The Big Question: will it snow this year?
### 
The question riding in the
back of each and every ski en
thusiast's mind this year as De
cember draws ever nearer is
"Will it snow?"
You can't ski if it doesn't.
That's a fact that is impossible
to bypass. Artificial snow is fine
for a day, not great for a week,
and what's more, it just isn't
the real thing. You need snow.
On the heels of some of the
most serious drought Califor
nia has seen in years, the ski
season may or may not develop
this year.
Last year, it was just plain
depressing. One had to take a
trip to Montana or Utah to get
some really good skiing. Tahoe
was depressing; bare rocks
showing through as the
Christmas charters zoomed
over.
The U.S. Weather Bureau in
Redwood City has said that
their satellite predictions, gen
erally less than 50 per cent ac
curate, predict a less than
normal snowfall for November
in the areas south of Lake
Tahoe and a slightly higher
amount for the north Tahoe
region.
No snow now
The station in Redwood City
also said there was almost no
snow in Tahoe now, but there
had been some near the Ore
gon border over the weekend.
Temperature yesterday in
Tahoe Valley â€” 55 degrees.
Despite the rather grim fore
cast from the official sources,
at least one man sees the story
differently. He's Brady Hodge,
the director of information for
the Heavenly Valley resort.

Hodge prefers to trust the
prediction of Berkeley
meterologist Orman Granger,
who has said there will be
snows up to 160 per cent of
normal this year in the Tahoe
area.
"Needless to say, that makes
us very happy,' Hodge said.
Largest
Heavenly, with its 25 lifts, 55
runs (including one seven mile
4000 drop run on the Nevada
side of the resort) and 20
square miles of ski area, is the
largest ski resort in the nation.
Hodge said the management at
Heavenly had spent more than
$750,000 since last season on

artificial snow machinery, and
that the area would open on
Nov. 19 whether it snows be
fore then or not.
He said the Heavenly lift
prices this year will be $12 per
day.
Bear Valley
f urther south, at Bear Valley,
things don't look quite so
good. Officials there said they
are geared to expect about 75
per cent of the normal snowfall
this year. They hope to open in
mid-November, expect a
rather dry month, but hope for
normal snow from December
on.
Bear Valley has expanded
this year, adding a new area cal
led Bear West, opening up 250
new acres of ski capacity, in
creasing the size of the resort
by one third.
Bear contains about 20 per
cent beginning runs, 50 per
cent intermediate runs and ?0
per cent advanced runs. There
are seven double chair lifts;
the longest run is three miles.
All day lift passes will be $11
this year.
Squaw Valley
Squaw Valley, located on the
north shore of Lake Tahoe, was
altered a good bit during the
summer. According to officials
there, more than $50,000 was
spent smoothing the north
slope of the descent runs, a
stretch of about a half mile.
Since the run now has fewer
rocks, the skiing will be fine
even if there is only about a
foot of snow.
Squaw has 21 chairs, two
planter lifts and ticket prices
will be $1) per day, with a spe
cial "slip-class-and-ski" offer
of lifts Monday through Friday
for $50.
