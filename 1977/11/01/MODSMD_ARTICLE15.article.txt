# High court rules on drunk driving, journalists rights, insurance cases
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court yesterday sup
ported states with tough
drunken-driving laws, dealt a
blow to news reporters seek
ing to protect confidential
sources, and placed in
jeopardy a consumers' victory
over insurance companies.
Taking action in more than
200 cases, the justices also ag
reed to review obscenity pro
secutions in California and an
Alaska law requiring job pre
ferences for state residents in
non-public jobs.
The court gave what
amounts to an endorsement of
state laws that suspend the
driver's licenses of motorists
who refuse to take a chemical
or breath analysis test after
being stopped for alleged
drunken driving — even when
the motorist receives no pre
suspension hearing.
Danger
The justices unanimously
ruled that holding such hear
ings in every case in which the
state found a driver's record
bad enough to take action
would impede administrative
efficiency and prove a danger
to the highways.
All 50 states have laws requir
ing temporary license suspen
sion for refusal to take breath
analysis tests and the like, but
only 13 make no provision for
pre-suspension hearings.
The high court refused to re
view the contempt of court
conviction of an Idaho news
paper reporter — an indication
that the justices believe repor
ters have no right under any
circumstances to withhold in
formation from a court or
grand jury.
The court's refusal means
James "Jay" Shielledy of the
Lewiston Tribune now faces a
30-day jail sentence for refus
ing to disclose to a state court
the name of a police source he

quoted in an article which
sparked a libel suit against the
newspaper.
No special rights
In 1972, the Supreme Court
ruled that reporters enjoy no
special rights to protect their
news sources in criminal cases.
Shelledy's refusal, however,
came in a civil case — the libel
suit over his article.
Shelledy's attorney, Reed
Clements of Lewiston, said his
client could end up serving
more than 30 days in jail.
Saying Shelledy probably
will serve the sentence in the
Latah County Jail, Clements
added that after 30 days "he
would probably be brought be
fore the court again and asked
to reveal the source. This could
continue, the sentence would
not be just for 30 days," Cle
ments said.
The Supreme Court agreed
to review a lower court's ruling
that gives consumers the right
to sue insurance companies in
federal courts under antitrust
laws.
The court's review of an ap
peal filed by four insurance
firms makes less secure a vic
tory won by a group of Rhode
Island doctors and their pa
tients in the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston. The Sup
reme Court might uphold the
lower court's ruling after study
ing the case more closely, but it
took the votes of at least four of
the nine justices to grant re
view.
Other action
In other matters, the court:
—Agreed to decide whether
children should be included in
the definition of a community
when obscene materials are
being judged on "community
standards." William Pinkus,
who was convicted in a Los
Angeles trial of mailing
obscene materials, says chil
dren should have been

excluded from such a defini
tion because he mailed his
publications to adults only.
—Agreed to decide whether
Alaska constitutionally may re
quire private employers in
volved in any oil or gas ac
tivities to hire Alaska residents
before out-of-state workers.
—Barred former Atty. Gen.

John Mitchell and ex-White
House aide John Ehrlichman
from practicing law before the
Supreme Court because of
their Watergate cover-up con
victions. Both officials of
former President Richard Ni
xon's administration are fed
eral prisoners and already have
been disbarred by other
courts.

The high court refused to re

conviction of an Idaho news

James "Jay" Shielledy of the
Lewiston Tribune now faces a
30-day jail sentence for refus
ing to disclose to a state court
the name of a police source he

quoted in an article which
sparked a libel suit against the
newspaper.
No special rights
In 1972, the Supreme Court
ruled that reporters enjoy no
special rights to protect their
news sources in criminal cases.
Shelledy's refusal, however,
came in a civil case — the libel
suit over his article.
Shelledy's attorney, Reed
Clements of Lewiston, said his
client could end up serving
more than 30 days in jail.
Saying Shelledy probably
will serve the sentence in the
Latah County Jail, Clements
added that after 30 days "he
would probably be brought be
fore the court again and asked
to reveal the source. This could
continue, the sentence would
not be just for 30 days," Cle
ments said.
The Supreme Court agreed
to review a lower court's ruling
that gives consumers the right
to sue insurance companies in
federal courts under antitrust
laws.
The court's review of an ap

firms makes less secure a vic
tory won by a group of Rhode
Island doctors and their pa
tients in the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston. The Sup
reme Court might uphold the
lower court's ruling after study
ing the case more closely, but it
took the votes of at least four of
the nine justices to grant re
view.
Other action
In other matters, the court:
—Agreed to decide whether
children should be included in
the definition of a community
when obscene materials are
being judged on "community
standards." William Pinkus,
who was convicted in a Los
Angeles trial of mailing
obscene materials, says chil
dren should have been

excluded from such a defini
tion because he mailed his
publications to adults only.
—Agreed to decide whether
Alaska constitutionally may re
quire private employers in
volved in any oil or gas ac
tivities to hire Alaska residents
before out-of-state workers.
—Barred former Atty. Gen.

John Mitchell and ex-White
House aide John Ehrlichman
from practicing law before the
Supreme Court because of
their Watergate cover-up con
victions. Both officials of
former President Richard Ni
xon's administration are fed
eral prisoners and already have
been disbarred by other
courts.

Washington (AP) — The Sup
reme Court yesterday sup
ported states with tough
drunken-driving laws, dealt a
blow to news reporters seek
ing to protect confidential
sources, and placed in
jeopardy a consumers' victory
over insurance companies.
Taking action in more than
200 cases, the justices also ag
reed to review obscenity pro
secutions in California and an
Alaska law requiring job pre
ferences for state residents in
non-public jobs.
The court gave what
amounts to an endorsement of
state laws that suspend the
driver's licenses of motorists
who refuse to take a chemical
or breath analysis test after
being stopped for alleged
drunken driving — even when
the motorist receives no pre
suspension hearing.
Danger
The justices unanimously
ruled that holding such hear
ings in every case in which the
state found a driver's record
bad enough to take action
would impede administrative
efficiency and prove a danger
to the highways.
