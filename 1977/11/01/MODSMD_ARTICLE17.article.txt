# Spain to spot heir apparent today
## 
### 
Madrid, Spain (AP) — Felipe Borbon,
a 9-year-old who likes motorbiking
more than monarchy, is being formally
invested today as heir to the five
century-old Spanish throne.
With King Juan Carlos and Creek
born Queen Sofia looking on, their
only son will be pinned with the "ven
era" or badge that marks him as Prince
of Asturias, traditional heir to the
crown.
Monarchists insist there is no ques
tion of the young prince's right of suc
cession to the throne. But they say the
simple religious-civil ceremony in the
northern city of Oviedo will head off
any possible future challenge to his

claim to the crown.
The investiture has taken on special
significance in the aftermath of two
assassination attempts against the 39-
year-old king in the past two months.
Palace aides report that the blond
prince — whose full name is Felipe de
Borbon y Grecia — is aware of his royal
role but more interested in zipping
around the hills and roads of the
palace grounds outside Madrid on his
Spanish-built motorbike.
The king, who often rides a motor
cycle alongside his son, had the hor
sepower of the boy's trail bike cut
down for safety. Young Felipe also skis
and sails.

His new title, equivalent to Britain's
Prince of Wales, was never given to his
father because Juan Carlos was hand
picked by Gen. Francisco Franco as
heir to the Spanish throne six years
before the long-time rightist dictator's
death in 1975.
Under present constitutional law,
Felipe cannot become king until he
reaches age 31. If his father dies before
then, a regency council would rule
until Felipe reached legal age.
As the Bourbons, the current
Spanish royal line began in France in
the year 1272. The first Borbon ruler of
Spain became king in 1700.
