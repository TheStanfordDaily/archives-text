## Overseas Studies eyes Lima 
### Jill Liscom 
An overseas studies program may
be initiated next year in Lima, Peru, if
Stanford and a numbec of other uni
versities agree to adopt the program,
said Corb Smith, associate director
of Overseas Studies.
Indiana University presently runsa
program at the Pontifical Catholic
University in Lima, but "has been
looking for a larger pool of schools"
to help keep the program financially
stable, said Smith.
Stanford has been asked to join the
Southern California Conference on
International Studies (SOCCIS),
which is composed of state and pri
vate southern California universities,
as "the other partner in the prog
ram," Smith explained.
"After some discussion and visit to
the program in Lima in |une, we have
worked out a tentative agreement
among SOCCIS," Smith said.
According to Smith, 30 students
will participate in the program. Fif
teen students will come from Indiana
University and the remaining 15
openings will be divided among
SOCCIS "roughly according to size."
Stanford will be permitted to send
two students.
Students in the program will spend
a full year in Lima and will "face a
much more rigorous selection pro
cess," compared to admission to
other overseas programs, added
Smith.
Applicants must be of junior stand
ing, must have completed the equi
valent of two years of college level
Spanish, and must have a B average.
In addition, applicants will be in
terviewed "in part to determine lan
guage ability and also to determine
seriousness in purpose and
academic preparation," said Smith.
"One of the really important
things that will determine the applic

ant pool is that students who are
selected will have to have more than
a general interest in studying in
South America. They must be speci
fically interested in one field of
study, such as Andean studies, an
thropology or political economy, so
that they can really utilize the re
sources available," Smith com
mented.
Smith remarked that when he and
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall visited the Lima campus in
|une, "our assessment was that the
affiliation looked like a good one.
We were impressed with the Ameri
can students there and they were
impressed with the quality of teach
ing they were getting."
The cost of the program would be

less than $5000 for Stanford, said
Smith, but "we still have to find those
funds."
Students would pay approximately
the same for room, board and tuition
at the Lima program as they would
here. Student living arrangements
would be "generally private accom
modations in houses or apartments
with families or people with rooms to
rent," Smith added.
Overseas Studies should be dis
cussing the program within the next
several weeks with the Committee
on Foreign Studies and Provost Wil
liam Miller, said Smith. The decision
will be made before the end of the
quarter since the agreement with
SOCCIS must be returned by Dec. 1.

will be made before the end of the
quarter since the agreement with
SOCCIS must be returned by Dec. 1.
An overseas studies program may
be initiated next year in Lima, Peru, if
Stanford and a numbec of other uni
versities agree to adopt the program,
said Corb Smith, associate director
of Overseas Studies.
Indiana University presently runsa
program at the Pontifical Catholic
University in Lima, but "has been
looking for a larger pool of schools"
to help keep the program financially
stable, said Smith.
Stanford has been asked to join the
Southern California Conference on
International Studies (SOCCIS),
which is composed of state and pri
vate southern California universities,
as "the other partner in the prog
ram," Smith explained.
"After some discussion and visit to
the program in Lima in |une, we have
worked out a tentative agreement
among SOCCIS," Smith said.
According to Smith, 30 students
will participate in the program. Fif
teen students will come from Indiana
University and the remaining 15
openings will be divided among
SOCCIS "roughly according to size."
Stanford will be permitted to send
two students.
Students in the program will spend
a full year in Lima and will "face a
much more rigorous selection pro
cess," compared to admission to
other overseas programs, added
Smith.
Applicants must be of junior stand
ing, must have completed the equi
valent of two years of college level
Spanish, and must have a B average.
In addition, applicants will be in
terviewed "in part to determine lan
guage ability and also to determine
seriousness in purpose and
academic preparation," said Smith.
"One of the really important
things that will determine the applic

ant pool is that students who are
selected will have to have more than
a general interest in studying in
South America. They must be speci
fically interested in one field of
study, such as Andean studies, an
thropology or political economy, so
that they can really utilize the re
sources available," Smith com
mented.
Smith remarked that when he and
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall visited the Lima campus in
|une, "our assessment was that the
affiliation looked like a good one.
We were impressed with the Ameri
can students there and they were
impressed with the quality of teach
ing they were getting."
The cost of the program would be

less than $5000 for Stanford, said
Smith, but "we still have to find those
funds."
Students would pay approximately
the same for room, board and tuition
at the Lima program as they would
here. Student living arrangements
would be "generally private accom
modations in houses or apartments
with families or people with rooms to
rent," Smith added.
Overseas Studies should be dis
cussing the program within the next
several weeks with the Committee
on Foreign Studies and Provost Wil
liam Miller, said Smith. The decision
will be made before the end of the
quarter since the agreement with
SOCCIS must be returned by Dec. 1.
