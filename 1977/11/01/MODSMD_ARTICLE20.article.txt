It's impossible to learn to ski
from any book, even a good ski
book. Believe me, I know. I
spent five of the most frustrat
ing days I can remember
(mostly resting on my
backside, swearing) trying to
learn to ski at Big Sky in Mon
tana my freshman year.
And I had read all the books.
But for those who want to at
least know what to anticipate,
for those who have some basic
skills and want to sharpen up
on their technical, mental
knowledge, for those who
want to remember back when
they didn't know a mogul from
a binding, this little book may
be just the answer.
Previously published in a
hard-back edition, this soft
cover re-issue is bound to ex
tend the popularity of the book
which caused even the nor
mally staid William F. Buckley
Jr. to gush in the New York
Times that "We Learned to Ski"
is "unlikely to be improved on
in the lifetime of its authors."
Perhaps the most helpful
feature of the book for the
pre-hotshot skier is the profu
sion of illustrations. The book
contains more than4oo illustra
tions, photos and diagrams,
giving the right and wrong way
to do almost anything a skier
must do (including several
ways to raise oneself off the
ground . . .).
For the already-experienced,
there is an especially complete
section on breaking bad skiing
habits and an exhaustive com
pilation of pre-slope exercises.

For the general ski-freak,
there is information on choos
ing a ski resort (including
evaluations of a number of ski
resorts and areas), advice on
renting and purchasing
equipment, tips on ski safety,
and all sorts of other tips and
tid-bits.
Perhaps the best feature
about the beginning directions
is that the three journalist-skier
authors have assumed abso
lutely no prior knowledge
about skiing. There are instruc
tions on what to do if you fall

(including "wait 30 seconds
and relax before you try to
stand"), what to do if your ski
falls off, and how to avoid
stabbing yourself with your
poles.
But most important, the en
tire book acknowledges that it
is at best a preparation, a refer
ence, a guide. There is no way
to ski without spending some
time on one's backside,
swearing, wondering why you
went to Montana rather than
Hawaii.
