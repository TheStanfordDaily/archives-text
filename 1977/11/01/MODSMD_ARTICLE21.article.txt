# Outlaws at Frost
## 
### 
Saturday was a perfect afternoon in Frost. The
combination of sun and music with the know
ledge that midterms were right around the
corner made lying on the amphitheater grass
that much more enjoyable.
The crowd, sprinkled with cowboy hats, sat
complacently through the first two opening
groups, Mistress and Country joe McDonald,
before erupting to the country rock sound they
had come to hear. The Outlaws entered the
stage to the energizing tune of "The Lone
Ranger" and played with such intensity and
power that the emotion remained high through
out the test of the afternoon.
Mistress, a group composed of offshoots from
many of today's most successful bands, began
the four hour day on the green. Their 50 minute
set of straight rock was culminated by an encore
of "Jungle Love," written by the group's lead
guitarist, Greg Douglas, for the Steve Miller
Band.
Country Joe McDonald provided a welcome
relief with his more melodic ballads including
"Save The Whales" and a nostalgic rendition of
"I'm Fixing To Die Rag" reminiscent of his
legendary performance at Woodstock.
Finally the Outlaws emerged onstage before
an anxious audience. Performing only a handful
of pieces, the six-man group was able to expose
the audience to the full spectrum of their talents,
from bluegrass to rock and roll. A final 25 minute
rendition of "Green Crass and High Tides"
brought together the best of their musical ta
lents before a two number encore.
