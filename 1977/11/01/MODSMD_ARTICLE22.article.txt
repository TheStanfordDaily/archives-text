# Super-slick oils by Ramos
## 
### 
Superman, Miss Lemon
Drop and Manet's "Olympia"
have one thing in common —
they are the subject of Oakland
artist Mel Ramos' super-slick
oil paintings.
Ramos is the focus of a re
trospective at the Oakland
Museum, concurrent with the
Richard Diebenkorn retros
pective. And no two contem
porary artists could seem more
unlike each other. Both share
roots in the Bay Area Figurative
school, from the 19505, but
only Ramos stayed consistently
with the figure.
The show covers the artist's
development from 1959 to the

present, starting with thickly
painted, almost unreadable fi
gure studies, moving to a
sharper but still thick painting
style (reminiscent of Wayne
Thiebaud's sculpted surface),
and ending with super
finished oils, and ironically,
watercolors.
Ramos is humorous but
facile in the early pop works —
they are easily consumed, like
the popular art they satirize.
His use of the pop culture's
image of ideal women lends an
ideological weight to his work
in the '60s. Otherwise, they are
simply illustration art pushed
to a fine art level, undercut by

funny titles, and visual puns.
Ramos' work remains light
and satirical, but gains increas
ing social relevance as the artist
matures. By the late '60s, the
canvases are painted without a
trace of the brush, and the fi
gures retain the stereotypical
look put forth by advertising
and film.
But then, Ramos tackles art
history, both as a tribute, and,
perhaps unintentionally, as a
way to raise questions about
our own culture's legacy. He
copies known masterpieces in
his own style, interjecting the
modern ideal figure.
Ramos poses an an

thropological as well as
philosophical question in
these later works — not only,
how do we see ourselves in re
lation to the media's hybrid
men and women, but also,
how will our culture be seen?
The artist's watercolors are a
visual relief from the strident
pop works. They also remind
the viewer of what one over
looks in his big canvases —
Ramos does know how to
paint, controlling color and
contour, butitisa superhuman
control, quickly consumed.
The oils are anything but
naturalistic. They are illusionis
tically convincing simply be
cause we have learned to read
magazine art as "real."
Ramos' final series is rich in
its synthesis of early styles and
interests. A tribute to William
de Kooning's female studies,
the"I Still Get a Thrill When I
See Bill" works integrate the
idealized female face, either in
oil or watercolor, with a slick
but still expressionistic de
Kooning body. In the water
colors, Ramos latches onto a
more naturalistic light, creat
ing a more human quality in
the faces. This is perhaps the
ultimate irony of the recent
works — neither the original
de Kooning's not Ramos' pop
figures are seen as naturalistic
until Ramos creates these hyb
rids. They seem particularly
human.

they are easily consumed, like
the popular art they satirize.
His use of the pop culture's
image of ideal women lends an
ideological weight to his work
in the '60s. Otherwise, they are
simply illustration art pushed
to a fine art level, undercut by

funny titles, and visual puns.
Ramos' work remains light
and satirical, but gains increas
ing social relevance as the artist
matures. By the late '60s, the
canvases are painted without a
trace of the brush, and the fi
gures retain the stereotypical
look put forth by advertising
and film.
But then, Ramos tackles art
history, both as a tribute, and,
perhaps unintentionally, as a
way to raise questions about
our own culture's legacy. He
copies known masterpieces in
his own style, interjecting the
modern ideal figure.
Ramos poses an an

thropological as well as
philosophical question in
these later works — not only,
how do we see ourselves in re
lation to the media's hybrid
men and women, but also,
how will our culture be seen?
The artist's watercolors are a
visual relief from the strident
pop works. They also remind
the viewer of what one over
looks in his big canvases —
Ramos does know how to
paint, controlling color and
contour, butitisa superhuman
control, quickly consumed.
The oils are anything but
naturalistic. They are illusionis
tically convincing simply be
cause we have learned to read
magazine art as "real."
Ramos' final series is rich in
its synthesis of early styles and
interests. A tribute to William
de Kooning's female studies,
the"I Still Get a Thrill When I
See Bill" works integrate the
idealized female face, either in
oil or watercolor, with a slick
but still expressionistic de
Kooning body. In the water
colors, Ramos latches onto a
more naturalistic light, creat
ing a more human quality in
the faces. This is perhaps the
ultimate irony of the recent
works — neither the original
de Kooning's not Ramos' pop
figures are seen as naturalistic
until Ramos creates these hyb
rids. They seem particularly
human.

oil paintings.
Ramos is the focus of a re

school, from the 19505, but
only Ramos stayed consistently
with the figure.
The show covers the artist's
development from 1959 to the

present, starting with thickly
painted, almost unreadable fi

sharper but still thick painting
style (reminiscent of Wayne

and ending with super
finished oils, and ironically,
watercolors.
