# The 						Mystic Knights
## A 						musical evolution 
### 
A Tchaikovsky ballet pre
cedes the plinking of West Af
rican xylophones. The devil
rasps out a tune of "Violent
Love." Cavorting dinosaurs
give way to a pianist from the
planet of Chedrania.
This isn't a nightmare; it's
only the Mystic Knights of the
Oingo Boingo taking you on a
mystery tour of jazz.
"It's our oingo boingo fan
tasy," says Dan Elfman, creator
and ringmaster of the 8-man,
1-woman revue. The Mystic
Knights' show studiously av
oids any comment on current
issues or politics, but offers an
unthreatening escape which
projects roots in the past and
branches to the future. ,
"I like the audience to feel
that when they step into our
show they don't have to worry
about agreeing with it," Elfman
explains.
The Mystic Knights present a
musical history from the year
two million B.C. (the di
nosaurs) to the 24th century
(Chedrania), unlike any story
ever told. The point doesn't
seem to be to make sense, but
to blend childlike fantasy and
seasoned musicianship in what
Elfman calls "an alternative
kind of entertainment."
The circus is tempered,
however, by familiar elements:
Monty Pythonesque film sequ
ences, early-jazz-blues-hot
hell-devil imagery, and
melodies such as the Dance of
the Marionettes from the Nut
cracker Suite by Tchaikovsky.
Even the group's name has a
fineage: Amos 'n' Andy's
"Mystic Knights of the Sea."
"Oingo Boingo just popped

up in somebody's head in the
middle of the night and it
seemed to fit the craziness,"
adds Elfman. A good deal of the
show's craziness stems from
Elfman's own major influ
ences: the TV serial "Little Ras
cals" and Monty Phthon's Fly
ing Circus.
Elfman's original composi
tions, which make up about a
third of the show's 28 musical
numbers, are partly inspired by
his experience with "Le Grand
Magic Circus" in Paris and a
nine-month jaunt to West Af
rica. He and another Boingo,
Leon Schneiderman, hand
made the group's exotic in
struments, including
balaphones (West African
xylophones) and gamalones
(an Indonesian cousin). Each
Knight plays at least three in
struments, and as individuals
have played in such groups as
the Strawberry Alarm Clock
(they did a song called "In
cense and Peppermints" in the
'60s) and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic.
But even those without
background familiarity gave
the Boingos a standing ovation
last Saturday.
"You don't have to have a
background in (our music) to
appreciate it," Elfman says.
Variety creates its own melody
for the unschooled: costumes
depicting creatures from the
past and boingo-land, Betty
Boop cartoons, a "Grease"-y
version of Willie Dixon's "Vio
lent Love" sung by the devil
(Elfman, of course).
The original Boingos of five
years ago put on a show as vio
lent as ten minutes of kazoos

and bass drums could create;
the present group has been
symphonizing for about two
years. Based in Los Angeles,
they have played private par
ties for Hugh Hefner and
Andy Warhol, and once ap
peared on Bill Cosby's TV show
"Cos." While touring, the
group has performed both on
the streets and at Lincoln
Center in New York City, and is
presently doing a three-week
show at San Franisco's Board
ing House.
Now the Boarding House
just doesn't do three-week
shows, and Elfman credits the
club's owner, David Allen, for
taking a chance on the Knights.
"Club owners tend only to
want to put themselves behind
a group if there's a major label
behind it," Elfman explains.
The boingos are currently un
signed, but did make a tape of
"Oh Dominique, Send Me,"
an Elfman original, with the
help of Garth Hudson of The
Band.
That tape garnered the
Knights their biggest honor
yet: they were chosen out of
2,000 entries from 60 countries
to perform at the Yamaha
Music Festival in Tokyo, Japan
next month. This is an annual
contest for unsigned groups
sponsored by the makers of
Yamaha musical instruments.
The step forward seems only
logical considering Elfman's
philosophy:
"We like to keep one foot in
our Boingo past and one foot in
our Boingo future."
Yesterday, Chedrania; to
morrow, the world?

(an Indonesian cousin). Each
Knight plays at least three in
struments, and as individuals
have played in such groups as
the Strawberry Alarm Clock
(they did a song called "In
cense and Peppermints" in the
'60s) and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic.
But even those without
background familiarity gave
the Boingos a standing ovation
last Saturday.
"You don't have to have a
background in (our music) to
appreciate it," Elfman says.
Variety creates its own melody
for the unschooled: costumes
depicting creatures from the
past and boingo-land, Betty
Boop cartoons, a "Grease"-y
version of Willie Dixon's "Vio
lent Love" sung by the devil
(Elfman, of course).
The original Boingos of five
years ago put on a show as vio
lent as ten minutes of kazoos

and bass drums could create;
the present group has been
symphonizing for about two
years. Based in Los Angeles,
they have played private par
ties for Hugh Hefner and
Andy Warhol, and once ap
peared on Bill Cosby's TV show
"Cos." While touring, the
group has performed both on
the streets and at Lincoln
Center in New York City, and is
presently doing a three-week
show at San Franisco's Board
ing House.
Now the Boarding House
just doesn't do three-week
shows, and Elfman credits the
club's owner, David Allen, for
taking a chance on the Knights.
"Club owners tend only to
want to put themselves behind
a group if there's a major label
behind it," Elfman explains.
The boingos are currently un
signed, but did make a tape of
"Oh Dominique, Send Me,"
an Elfman original, with the
help of Garth Hudson of The
Band.
That tape garnered the
Knights their biggest honor
yet: they were chosen out of
2,000 entries from 60 countries
to perform at the Yamaha
Music Festival in Tokyo, Japan
next month. This is an annual
contest for unsigned groups
sponsored by the makers of
Yamaha musical instruments.
The step forward seems only
logical considering Elfman's
philosophy:
"We like to keep one foot in
our Boingo past and one foot in
our Boingo future."
Yesterday, Chedrania; to
morrow, the world?
—LAURA OST
A Tchaikovsky ballet pre
cedes the plinking of West Af
rican xylophones. The devil
rasps out a tune of "Violent
Love." Cavorting dinosaurs
give way to a pianist from the
planet of Chedrania.
This isn't a nightmare; it's
only the Mystic Knights of the
Oingo Boingo taking you on a
mystery tour of jazz.
"It's our oingo boingo fan
tasy," says Dan Elfman, creator
and ringmaster of the 8-man,
1-woman revue. The Mystic
Knights' show studiously av
oids any comment on current
issues or politics, but offers an
unthreatening escape which
projects roots in the past and
branches to the future. ,
"I like the audience to feel
that when they step into our
show they don't have to worry
about agreeing with it," Elfman
explains.
The Mystic Knights present a
musical history from the year
two million B.C. (the di
nosaurs) to the 24th century
(Chedrania), unlike any story
ever told. The point doesn't
seem to be to make sense, but
to blend childlike fantasy and
seasoned musicianship in what
Elfman calls "an alternative
kind of entertainment."
The circus is tempered,
however, by familiar elements:
Monty Pythonesque film sequ
ences, early-jazz-blues-hot
hell-devil imagery, and
melodies such as the Dance of
the Marionettes from the Nut
cracker Suite by Tchaikovsky.
Even the group's name has a
fineage: Amos 'n' Andy's
"Mystic Knights of the Sea."
"Oingo Boingo just popped

up in somebody's head in the
middle of the night and it
seemed to fit the craziness,"
adds Elfman. A good deal of the
show's craziness stems from
Elfman's own major influ
ences: the TV serial "Little Ras
cals" and Monty Phthon's Fly
ing Circus.
Elfman's original composi
tions, which make up about a
third of the show's 28 musical
numbers, are partly inspired by
his experience with "Le Grand
Magic Circus" in Paris and a
nine-month jaunt to West Af
rica. He and another Boingo,
Leon Schneiderman, hand
made the group's exotic in
struments, including
balaphones (West African
xylophones) and gamalones
(an Indonesian cousin). Each

rican xylophones. The devil
rasps out a tune of "Violent
Love." Cavorting dinosaurs
give way to a pianist from the
planet of Chedrania.
This isn't a nightmare; it's
only the Mystic Knights of the
Oingo Boingo taking you on a
mystery tour of jazz.
"It's our oingo boingo fan
tasy," says Dan Elfman, creator
and ringmaster of the 8-man,
1-woman revue. The Mystic
Knights' show studiously av
oids any comment on current
issues or politics, but offers an
unthreatening escape which
projects roots in the past and
branches to the future. ,
"I like the audience to feel
that when they step into our
show they don't have to worry
about agreeing with it," Elfman
explains.
The Mystic Knights present a
musical history from the year
two million B.C. (the di
nosaurs) to the 24th century
(Chedrania), unlike any story
ever told. The point doesn't
seem to be to make sense, but
to blend childlike fantasy and
seasoned musicianship in what
Elfman calls "an alternative
kind of entertainment."
The circus is tempered,
however, by familiar elements:
Monty Pythonesque film sequ
ences, early-jazz-blues-hot
hell-devil imagery, and
melodies such as the Dance of
the Marionettes from the Nut
cracker Suite by Tchaikovsky.
Even the group's name has a
fineage: Amos 'n' Andy's
"Mystic Knights of the Sea."
"Oingo Boingo just popped

up in somebody's head in the
middle of the night and it
seemed to fit the craziness,"
adds Elfman. A good deal of the
show's craziness stems from
Elfman's own major influ
ences: the TV serial "Little Ras
cals" and Monty Phthon's Fly
ing Circus.
Elfman's original composi
tions, which make up about a
third of the show's 28 musical
numbers, are partly inspired by
his experience with "Le Grand
Magic Circus" in Paris and a
nine-month jaunt to West Af
rica. He and another Boingo,
Leon Schneiderman, hand
made the group's exotic in
struments, including
balaphones (West African
xylophones) and gamalones
(an Indonesian cousin). Each
Knight plays at least three in
struments, and as individuals
have played in such groups as
the Strawberry Alarm Clock
(they did a song called "In
cense and Peppermints" in the
'60s) and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic.
But even those without
background familiarity gave
the Boingos a standing ovation
last Saturday.
"You don't have to have a
background in (our music) to
appreciate it," Elfman says.
Variety creates its own melody
for the unschooled: costumes
depicting creatures from the
past and boingo-land, Betty
Boop cartoons, a "Grease"-y
version of Willie Dixon's "Vio
lent Love" sung by the devil
(Elfman, of course).
The original Boingos of five
years ago put on a show as vio
lent as ten minutes of kazoos

and bass drums could create;
the present group has been
symphonizing for about two
years. Based in Los Angeles,
they have played private par
ties for Hugh Hefner and
Andy Warhol, and once ap
peared on Bill Cosby's TV show
"Cos." While touring, the
group has performed both on
the streets and at Lincoln
Center in New York City, and is
presently doing a three-week
show at San Franisco's Board
ing House.
Now the Boarding House
just doesn't do three-week
shows, and Elfman credits the
club's owner, David Allen, for
taking a chance on the Knights.
"Club owners tend only to
want to put themselves behind
a group if there's a major label
behind it," Elfman explains.
The boingos are currently un
signed, but did make a tape of
"Oh Dominique, Send Me,"
an Elfman original, with the
help of Garth Hudson of The
Band.
That tape garnered the
Knights their biggest honor
yet: they were chosen out of
2,000 entries from 60 countries
to perform at the Yamaha
Music Festival in Tokyo, Japan
next month. This is an annual
contest for unsigned groups
sponsored by the makers of
Yamaha musical instruments.
The step forward seems only
logical considering Elfman's
philosophy:
"We like to keep one foot in
our Boingo past and one foot in
our Boingo future."
Yesterday, Chedrania; to
morrow, the world?
