# Fellini's many-sided Rome
## 
### 
"Roma" is a fascinating por
trayal of past and present Rome
in which Fellini has succeeded
in creating a visually stunning
panorama contrasting tradi
tions with the newer culture of
city life. The plot centers on a
movie director making a film
about present-day Rome, but
includes many flashbacks from
the director's reminiscences
about his days as a young man
in Rome, immediately preced
ing and also during World War
11.
A major theme is the in
creased influence of the com
munists and the fight for major
social reforms in comparison
with the decreased importance
of the church and the end of
the dominance once held by
the conservative leadership.
The bells of the churches are
an everyday fact of life, remind
ing Rome of the vast number of
beautiful monuments to
Catholicism. The capping
sequence to this theme is an
ecclesiastical fashion show in

the home of one of the last ves
tiges of past aristocratics, with
an audience which includes
the Pope.
Fellini shows the present day
city from a variety of perspec
tives. First, he begins with the
drive down the highway to
ward Roma, giving a view of the
roads, driving attitudes, indus
try and finally arriving in the
city proper. There are strikes
and demonstrations, while
people are eating in the adja
cent street restaurants, totally
unconcerned. The younger
generation lives a carefree life
of ideals and freedoms never
known to an older populace fil
led with memories of World
War 11 and the ways of the past.
Pre-war Italy is equally vib
rant with life. The movie direc
tor reminisces about his first
visit to Rome to stay with a dis
tant relative. This pride brings
home the horror people feel,
interrupted from a vaudeville
show and forced to realize that
the Allies are bombing Rome.

There are also the carefree
days of going to the whore
houses — the cheap crowded
dives as well as the elegant
upper class establishments.
Fellini presents an incredible
variety of scenes from present
and past Rome. Different parts
of the movie are confusing,
comic, awe-inspiring, and
tragic. Fellini's perverted
synthesis of this great variety of
ideas and actions results in a
film which really conveys the
feelings, attitudes, lifestyle,
and culture of Rome, which are
fascinatingly different from the
U.S.
Combine this with the stun
ning architectural backdrop of
traditional Rome, and "Roma"
is a very enjoyable movie that
intrigues, fascinates and awes
the viewer.

days of going to the whore
houses — the cheap crowded
dives as well as the elegant
upper class establishments.
Fellini presents an incredible
variety of scenes from present
and past Rome. Different parts
of the movie are confusing,
comic, awe-inspiring, and
tragic. Fellini's perverted
synthesis of this great variety of
ideas and actions results in a
film which really conveys the
feelings, attitudes, lifestyle,
and culture of Rome, which are
fascinatingly different from the
U.S.
Combine this with the stun
ning architectural backdrop of
traditional Rome, and "Roma"
is a very enjoyable movie that
intrigues, fascinates and awes
the viewer.

"Roma" is a fascinating por
trayal of past and present Rome
in which Fellini has succeeded
in creating a visually stunning
panorama contrasting tradi
tions with the newer culture of
city life. The plot centers on a
movie director making a film
about present-day Rome, but
includes many flashbacks from
the director's reminiscences
about his days as a young man
in Rome, immediately preced
ing and also during World War
11.
A major theme is the in
creased influence of the com
munists and the fight for major
social reforms in comparison
with the decreased importance
of the church and the end of
the dominance once held by
the conservative leadership.
The bells of the churches are
an everyday fact of life, remind
ing Rome of the vast number of
beautiful monuments to
Catholicism. The capping
sequence to this theme is an
ecclesiastical fashion show in

the home of one of the last ves
tiges of past aristocratics, with
an audience which includes
the Pope.
Fellini shows the present day
city from a variety of perspec
tives. First, he begins with the
drive down the highway to
ward Roma, giving a view of the
roads, driving attitudes, indus
try and finally arriving in the
city proper. There are strikes
and demonstrations, while
people are eating in the adja
cent street restaurants, totally
unconcerned. The younger
generation lives a carefree life
of ideals and freedoms never
known to an older populace fil
led with memories of World
War 11 and the ways of the past.
Pre-war Italy is equally vib
rant with life. The movie direc
tor reminisces about his first
visit to Rome to stay with a dis
tant relative. This pride brings
home the horror people feel,
interrupted from a vaudeville
show and forced to realize that
the Allies are bombing Rome.

There are also the carefree
days of going to the whore
houses — the cheap crowded
dives as well as the elegant
upper class establishments.
