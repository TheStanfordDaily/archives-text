# Stunning crucifixion ends 'Superstar'
## 
### 
"Jesus Christ Superstar" at
Foothill College is a powerful,
yet technically lacking produc
tion of the classic rock opera.
Director John Ford has at
tempted through music, sing
ing and simplicity to convey
the power inherent in what he
calls "The greatest story about
one person in the entire
world."
Geoff Ward, as Jesus, trans
mits emotion through simple
motions on stage.
Joseph Munoz plays an
energetic Judas. The voices of
both Ward and Munoz are
superlative.
Ford has proven that he is a
master director. "Superstar" is
one of the most creative pro
ductions that I have seen. The
power here comes from a rear
screen projector that shows
constantly changing images of
spacial phenomena. The
majority of the slides were sec
ured from NASA. Also, the
music is sped up to increase
the intensity. The arrange
ments are excellent.
The show is stolen by two

characters that are somewhat
out of the mainstream of
things, but nonetheless, have
their moments of glory. Anne
Sutton, and Terry Tosh play
Mary and Simon, respectively.
Sutton has a voice that conveys
passion and insecurity. Tosh
uses vocal inflections and tonal
alterations in the timbre of his
voice that transmit the inten
sity of his "zealousness."
There is one major flaw in
the show; its format is such
that it lends itself to the use of
wireless microphones, but the

wireless mikes cut out com
pletely at intermittent times
during the first act, and are
constantly inferior in repro
ducing and amplifying voices.
The crucifixion scene is the
essence of the show. Ford has
chosen to appeal to many
senses in this scene. The
theatre is inundated with the
smell of incense throughout
this scene. The portion of the
scene that depicts Christ on
the cross is unparalleled
in my experience regarding
sheer power onstage. Christ's

silhouette is visible, while the
entire theatre is enveloped by
high intensity beams of light.
This scene is evidence of Ford's
genius for getting a message
across.
The Foothill College Produc
tion of "Superstar" is average
in the first act and superb in the
second. The show runs
November 3-5 at Foothill Col
lege and is its entry in this
year's American College
Theatre Festival.
