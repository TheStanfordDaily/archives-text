S. Africa sanctions vetoed
United Nations, N.Y. — The United States,
Britain and France vetoed three African resolu
tions in the Security Council yesterday that
called for economic sanctions and other strin
gent measures against South Africa.
The 15-member council unanimously ap
proved a fourth African resolution condemn
ing the white-minority government in Pretoria
for its resort to "massive violence and repres
sion" against black South Africans and "all
other opponents" of apartheid.
That resolution also demanded the South
African government release all persons im
prisoned under security laws and for opposi
tion to its racial policies, and lift bans on or
ganizations and newspapers opposed to apar
theid.
The U.N. African group demanded interna
tional sanctions two weeks ago after the latest
South African crackdown on black dissidents
and other opponents of its racial segregation
policies.
The triple veto came after the two sides were
unable to agree on a compromise position in
negotiations that began late last week.
The three permanent Western council
members have proposed only a six-month
mandatory arms embargo — subject to re
newal — against South Africa.
Senate approves energy tax
Washington — The Senate gave President

Jimmy Carter's energy plan a major boost to
ward congressional enactment yesterday by
approving a multi-billion-dollar collection of
taxes and tax credits designed to conserve
energy and reduce U.S. dependence on
foreign oil.
The 52-35 Senate vote sends the fifth and
final piece of the president's energy package
to a House-Senate conference committee
which has already begun work on non-tax as
pects of the plan.
The bill was approved by the Senate under
the leadership of Sen. Russell Long (D-La.),
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
The bill bears little resemblance to the original
Carter plan.
But the Senate has given Long a mandate to
return from negotiations with the House with
many of Carter's biggest proposed taxes.
One tax expected to survive the conference
is the so-called oil equalization tax designed to
raise the price of U.S.-produced oil to the
much higher price charged by other countries.
Clothiers demand import curbs
Washington — Claiming thousands of jobs
are at stake, a major clothing workers union
asked the Carter administration yesterday to
impose penalties on imports of apparel and
textiles from eight South American and Far
Eastern countries.
The 500,000-member Amalgamated Clothing
and Textile Workers Union charged unfair
competition in formal petitions filed with the

Treasury Department. It was the latest in a
growing number of complaints from American
industry and unions about imports.
The clothing workers union said its mem
bers face the loss of "tens of thousands of
jobs" because of what it claimed are low wages
paid by foreign manufacturers and export sub
sidies provided by the eight foreign govern
ments.
Sirica retires
Washington — After 20 years on the bench,
five of them on Watergate, John J. Sirica ended
his career as an active federal judge yesterday,
by listening to lawyers in a $168 damage suit.
Senate abortion plan stalled
Washington — Congressional conferees yes
terday failed again to agree on a policy for
federal funding of abortions as House mem
bers rejected a compromise Senate proposal
that some claimed would lead to "abortion on
demand."
The impasse meant Congress would miss for
a second time a self-imposed deadline for re
solving the abortion dispute, and the govern
ment's major social service agencies would go
temporarily without operating money.
The proposal would allow abortion pay
ments when a woman's life is endangered or
when serious physical health damage to the
mother would result if the pregnancy were

carried to term.

The U.N. African group demanded interna

Senate approves energy tax
Washington — The Senate gave President

Jimmy Carter's energy plan a major boost to
ward congressional enactment yesterday by
approving a multi-billion-dollar collection of
taxes and tax credits designed to conserve
energy and reduce U.S. dependence on
foreign oil.
The 52-35 Senate vote sends the fifth and
final piece of the president's energy package
to a House-Senate conference committee
which has already begun work on non-tax as
pects of the plan.
The bill was approved by the Senate under
the leadership of Sen. Russell Long (D-La.),
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
The bill bears little resemblance to the original
Carter plan.
But the Senate has given Long a mandate to
return from negotiations with the House with
many of Carter's biggest proposed taxes.
One tax expected to survive the conference
is the so-called oil equalization tax designed to
raise the price of U.S.-produced oil to the
much higher price charged by other countries.
Clothiers demand import curbs
Washington — Claiming thousands of jobs
are at stake, a major clothing workers union
asked the Carter administration yesterday to
impose penalties on imports of apparel and
textiles from eight South American and Far
Eastern countries.
The 500,000-member Amalgamated Clothing
and Textile Workers Union charged unfair
competition in formal petitions filed with the

Treasury Department. It was the latest in a
growing number of complaints from American
industry and unions about imports.
The clothing workers union said its mem
bers face the loss of "tens of thousands of
jobs" because of what it claimed are low wages
paid by foreign manufacturers and export sub
sidies provided by the eight foreign govern
ments.
Sirica retires
Washington — After 20 years on the bench,
five of them on Watergate, John J. Sirica ended
his career as an active federal judge yesterday,
by listening to lawyers in a $168 damage suit.
Senate abortion plan stalled
Washington — Congressional conferees yes
terday failed again to agree on a policy for
federal funding of abortions as House mem
bers rejected a compromise Senate proposal
that some claimed would lead to "abortion on
demand."
The impasse meant Congress would miss for
a second time a self-imposed deadline for re
solving the abortion dispute, and the govern
ment's major social service agencies would go
temporarily without operating money.
The proposal would allow abortion pay
ments when a woman's life is endangered or
when serious physical health damage to the
mother would result if the pregnancy were

carried to term.
