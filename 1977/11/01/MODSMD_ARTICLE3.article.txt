# Commuters oppose SP cutback

Southern Pacific's proposed aban
donment of Peninsula passenger
train service drew a vocal response at
public hearings last week.
The railways lose several million
dollars each year on the route and
wish to drop it. The hearings, spon
sored by the California Public
Utilities Commission, which must
rule on Southern Pacific's request,
were held in Palo Alto last Thursday
and Friday nights.
Many commuters spoke against
ending the service.
"I think it will paralyze this penin
sula if you let Southern Pacific elimi
nate the train service," said Gladys
Adams of Menlo Park. "You can't
depend on SamTrans," she added.
SamTrans is the bus service which
has replaced Greyhound on the
Peninsula.
Environmental and energy con

cerns were also discussed. "We be
lieve that the freeways cannot handle
the additional traffic that would be
imposed" if train service is discon
tinued, said Peter Milward of Menlo
Park. "Petroleum is a finite re
source," he added.
"Why, at a time when we're put
ting men on the moon and freeze
dried coffee in the grocery stores,
can't people have a transportation
system that makes sense?" asked
Dorothy Gray of Los Altos.
After the close of the hearing
Thursday night, presiding judge John
Weiss pointed out to several in
terested people that he had a huge
volume of testimony to condense in
making his recommendation.
Gray commented to the judge,
"You just have to decide what's
right."
"What's right â€” and what's legal,"
replied Weiss. "This is a country of

law, not right," he said. Miscarriages
can occur, he admitted, "but I
frankly believe that in the long run,
the rule of law is best."
)udge Weiss indicated in a state
ment Oct. 17, "We will determine
what the deficit really is and what
public funds will be available to meet
it. The people and the regional pub
lic agencies and entities can have
whatever degree of service they are
willing to pay for."
The California Department of
Transportation, the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, and the
three counties involved must de
monstrate that funds will be available
to meet the deficit of Southern
Pacific's passenger service.
Hearings to take evidence from
Southern Pacific and from the or
ganizations opposing discontinua
tion of service will resume in San
Francisco Nov. 14.
