# Big Game festivities to return
## 
### Emily Sachar 
In fewer than two weeks, Cal's Osky Bear, funeral
processions, three-legged races, kegs, hot cocoa,
and 6 a.m. tequila sunrises will debut — all at once.
A gala affair is in the making, and for none other
than Stanford's annual showdown with Cal.
If you turn back the pages of a 1961 Ouad you will
know what's up. The Big Game Fiesta is back, under
the direction of Instant Rally Commissioner Bob
Moog, affectionately labeled Big Game Czar.
Such attractions as Band performances from the
top of Hoover Tower, and a funeral procession where
Osky Bear will be pitched into the Claw will be en
hanced by Ram's Head's Gaieties Friday night.
Added to these, the traditional San Francisco
parade, new buttons, posters and other activities will
turn the week of Nov. 14 into something between
"Smile — you're on Candid Camera" and the Macy's
parade.
Nostalgia
Those of you with parent alums may not find all this
hubbub such a shocking affair. "Years ago, houses
were decorated, floats were about the campus. This
has been dying out," Moog said.
So, last spring, the Office of Student Activities cal
led Band Manager Rich Johnson to organize activities
for the 1977 Big Game. Johnson mentioned the possi
bility to Moog. Four weeks ago, several student or
ganizations were called together for a steering com
mittee meeting and to discuss the fiesta.
Ram's Head, the Band and the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) appeared as the main sponsors. Other
groups also sent representatives to the meeting, ac
cording to Moog.
Moog was chosen then as the coordinator for the
Big Game Fiesta.
In addition to the above festivities, several other
activities are being planned and may be included in
the week.
"There may be a Lagunita Seca car race in the lake
bed. Also, we are trying to have a Superstars Olympic

competition with three-legged races and strange
events like that. On Friday of the week we're trying to
organize a mega-nooner for the frats from 1 to 4 p.m.
or so. On game day there will be an earlybird break
fast at around 6 a.m. to kick off the tailgating parties
with hot cocoa and tequila sunrises," Moog said.
"Oh and I just thought of another idea," Moog
quickened. "I think we'll have an all-night slumber
party Friday night where people can zonk after the
San Francisco parade."
"Most of the organizations involved are pitching in
the money and time for their events," Moog said.
"IFC is putting in around $1500. Ram's Head is putting
in their time for Gaieties. The Band is giving money
and will provide over 30 hours of entertainment plea
sure during the week."
Added budget
Today Moog will submit a budget proposal to the
Office of Student Activities. He's asking for an addi
tional $500 to $1000. This sum will help to cover costs
not defrayed by sponsoring organizations.
"As far as the activities are concerned, most are
already approved. I'm on a loose leash. The office of
activities has veto power but they're pretty much
letting me do what I want," Moog said.
"Some of the ideas like the car race need ap
proval," he said. "But the whole program will go for
sure."
By Nov. 8, the program should be approved and
calendars will be distributed listing daily activities.
In the dorms, the Big Game Fiesta Steering Com
mittee and other volunteers will be hanging pictorial
displays from previous Big Games and Big Game
weeks. Brian Beckerof ASSU Sunday Flicks is working
to put together a film of events from previous years.
The sound track for the flick will feature student
interviews, band sounds and alum remarks, accord
ing to Moog.
"Everyone I've talked to is really keyed for this
event. Even the alums want to see their old traditions
brought to the fore," Moog said.

The clothing and haircuts will be different, but the 1963 scene above un

Big Game Fiesta '77 will be underway.

competition with three-legged races and strange
events like that. On Friday of the week we're trying to
organize a mega-nooner for the frats from 1 to 4 p.m.
or so. On game day there will be an earlybird break
fast at around 6 a.m. to kick off the tailgating parties
with hot cocoa and tequila sunrises," Moog said.
"Oh and I just thought of another idea," Moog
quickened. "I think we'll have an all-night slumber
party Friday night where people can zonk after the
San Francisco parade."
"Most of the organizations involved are pitching in
the money and time for their events," Moog said.
"IFC is putting in around $1500. Ram's Head is putting
in their time for Gaieties. The Band is giving money
and will provide over 30 hours of entertainment plea
sure during the week."
Added budget
Today Moog will submit a budget proposal to the
Office of Student Activities. He's asking for an addi
tional $500 to $1000. This sum will help to cover costs
not defrayed by sponsoring organizations.
"As far as the activities are concerned, most are
already approved. I'm on a loose leash. The office of
activities has veto power but they're pretty much
letting me do what I want," Moog said.
"Some of the ideas like the car race need ap
proval," he said. "But the whole program will go for
sure."
By Nov. 8, the program should be approved and
calendars will be distributed listing daily activities.
In the dorms, the Big Game Fiesta Steering Com
mittee and other volunteers will be hanging pictorial
displays from previous Big Games and Big Game
weeks. Brian Beckerof ASSU Sunday Flicks is working
to put together a film of events from previous years.
The sound track for the flick will feature student
interviews, band sounds and alum remarks, accord
ing to Moog.
"Everyone I've talked to is really keyed for this
event. Even the alums want to see their old traditions
brought to the fore," Moog said.

The clothing and haircuts will be different, but the 1963 scene above un
changed. University yell leaders will carry Cal's Osky Bear in a funeral-type
procession through White Plaza, discarding the enemy in the claws basin. And
Big Game Fiesta '77 will be underway.
In fewer than two weeks, Cal's Osky Bear, funeral
processions, three-legged races, kegs, hot cocoa,
and 6 a.m. tequila sunrises will debut — all at once.
A gala affair is in the making, and for none other
than Stanford's annual showdown with Cal.
If you turn back the pages of a 1961 Ouad you will
know what's up. The Big Game Fiesta is back, under
the direction of Instant Rally Commissioner Bob
Moog, affectionately labeled Big Game Czar.
Such attractions as Band performances from the
top of Hoover Tower, and a funeral procession where
Osky Bear will be pitched into the Claw will be en
hanced by Ram's Head's Gaieties Friday night.
Added to these, the traditional San Francisco
parade, new buttons, posters and other activities will
turn the week of Nov. 14 into something between
"Smile — you're on Candid Camera" and the Macy's
parade.
Nostalgia
Those of you with parent alums may not find all this
hubbub such a shocking affair. "Years ago, houses
were decorated, floats were about the campus. This
has been dying out," Moog said.
So, last spring, the Office of Student Activities cal
led Band Manager Rich Johnson to organize activities
for the 1977 Big Game. Johnson mentioned the possi
bility to Moog. Four weeks ago, several student or
ganizations were called together for a steering com
mittee meeting and to discuss the fiesta.
Ram's Head, the Band and the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) appeared as the main sponsors. Other
groups also sent representatives to the meeting, ac
cording to Moog.
Moog was chosen then as the coordinator for the
Big Game Fiesta.
In addition to the above festivities, several other
activities are being planned and may be included in
the week.
"There may be a Lagunita Seca car race in the lake
bed. Also, we are trying to have a Superstars Olympic

competition with three-legged races and strange
events like that. On Friday of the week we're trying to
organize a mega-nooner for the frats from 1 to 4 p.m.
