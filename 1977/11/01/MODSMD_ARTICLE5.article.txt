# Changing world forces set post-Mao politics
## 
### David Holley 
Changes in China's politics since
Mao's death have been largely the
result of "the changing forces in the
world at large," a British journalist
said here Saturday.
Felix Greene, a frequent visitor to
China, told a Kresge Auditorium au
dience that China's actions have
been often based on the actions of
the world's two superpowers.
The Chinese, Greene said, "are so
certain that there will be massive
conflict between this country and the
Soviet Union, that it would be
foolhardy forthem not toplan on it."
"Although the United States and
the Soviet Union are attempting to
maintain nuclear parity," Greene
said, "on the conventional side there
is the most bitter and continuing
rivalry. The Soviet submarine fleet
alone is fantastically strong."
Likely war
"The U.S. imports 50 per cent of its
oil. Within three or four years the
Soviet Union will have to begin im
porting oil — and what a witch's brew
of competition that will create," he
said.
"War is unthinkable," continued
Greene. "War is always unthinkable
before it happens. But in retrospect,
you can see that it was inevitable."

China must modernize its military,
Greene said, and to do so must mod
ernize its industry. That, in turn, re
quires that "gifted youngsters move
more quickly to college, without
doing two years of work in a factory
or commune."
Political question
Referring to the political struggles
of recent years in China, Greene said
that many foreigners wonder, "What
the hell is this all about?"
Part of the answer, he said, is that,
"when somebody's out in China,
they're 100 per cent out."
"It's like a Chinese drama," he
continued, "the hero is all hero, and
the villain slips around like some
dog. And this sense of drama ... is
also projected on that vast stage of
political life."
"We know — and this is especially
true in Britain — that we are both bad
and good," remarked Greene. "But
the Chinese don't like the gray mid
dle. They never have . . . you either
have the mandate of heaven or you
don't," he said.
Gang sought power
When he was in Peking in July
1976, Greene said, he "realized that
something had gone wrong. There
was an atmosphere of fear."
"The Gang of Four," he said, "out
for power for themselves, were out
to spread fear."
"It reminded me of the feeling we
felt here . . . during the worst period
of the McCarthy era," he added.
When news of the arrests became
official, Greene said, "All of China
went up in tremendous rejoicing."
"There's no fear there now,"
Greene said. Instead, he said, there's
"a fantastic sense of relief. . . .
They're back on the rails again."
Chinese freedoms
Greene said the Chinese have
more freedom than outsiders
realize.
"There seem to me to be all kinds
and levels of freedom," he said, "and
we concentrate, perhaps because of
our history, on certain political free
doms which they do not have."
"Above all," Greene said, "what
they're free of is that personal thrust
of competitiveness."
Greene said that the Chinese
"have seen through the great myth
on which capitalism is based: 'If only
we could get more money, a bigger
house, a degree . . . we would be
happy.' We know it's not working
. . . the people of this country are
more harassed, and more worried,
than the people of almost any other
country that I know."
Greene acknowledged that China
has problems. "They've got a lot of
institutional things to work out," he
said.
But Greene said Chou El-lai, once
told him, "You know, Mr. Greene,
I'm much older than you are, but I
worry much less . . . China's been
here for 4000 years, and it'll go on for
4000 years . . . Mr. Greene, don't
worry about China so much."
Greene told his audience, "Don't
worry about China so much."
