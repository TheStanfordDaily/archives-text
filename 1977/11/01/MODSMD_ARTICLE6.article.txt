# Editorial
## It's perfectly clear 
### 
During the past few weeks sev
eral students have committed
some fairly sordid actions on be
half of ASSU politics. The Daily
has refrained in editorials from
naming students or groups who
have attempted to deprive the
student body of honest represen
tatives. We felt that those in
volved in the recent ASSU Senate
election would attempt to correct
these wrongs, but after yester
day's senate meeting it is appa
rent that most ASSU senators
have no desire to inform stu
dents, nor to take any action as to
possible disqualification. There
are a few decent senators, but
they are powerless in the face of
such an obstinate majority.
Let's start with a few facts. It's
true that those senators who
voted yesterday were elected by
the students — they were elected
in an election that was filled with
lies, conspiracies to lie, and
coverups both during and after
the election. Students were de
frauded through dissemination
of two "anonymous" leaflets
written by candidates or suppor
ters of candidates. Threats were
made to people not to talk to the
ASSU Elections Commission in
vestigating the election. Since
the election, the Council of Pres
idents, the Elections Commis
sion, the Daily and KZSU have all
been attacked — attacked by the
people most under suspicion.
Not one word printed or broad
cast since the election has yet
been shown to be false.
Who is accusing these groups
of wrongdoing or impropriety?
Such people as Sen. Carlyle Kin
nison of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC), who last week
angrily demanded that he know
who is accusing his slate of im
proper activities and just what
the accusations are. A rather
strange statement coming from
someone who, along with the
other SOC senators, has never
apologized to the community for
the allegedly defamatory state
ments disseminated by at least 25
of his supporters.
The charges were contained in
an "anonymous" flyer inserted
without authorization intocopies
of the Daily on the first day of
voting.
Several SOC supporters have

committed malicious activities
which may be in possible viola
tion of state laws and yet no SOC
senator has ever investigated or
publicly demanded to know who
the accusers in the flyer are. No
SOC senator has ever bothered
to correct the record as to the
charges in this flyer. SOC has
only responded with across the
board denials, which have re
cently become across the board
"no comments." Yesterday, a
SOC senator's motion led to clo
ture of debate on election inves
tigation and disqualification.
Sen. Marvin Anderson of SOC
said yesterday the elections in
vestigation should be brought
before the senate, "the body that
has been elected by the stu
dents. ... I think the students'
judgment of honesty, integrity
and fairness is to me the best
judgment. ... I am fully able to
qualify or disqualify anyone who
is now sitting on the present se
nate, myself included."
Richard Nixon couldn't have
said it better.
Indeed, the SOC senators may
have run as a slate but they were
elected individually — and yet in
the short time since the election
the SOC senators have acted and
commented on this crucial issue
almost always as a slate.
SOC senators were almost
alone at yesterday's meeting in
urging that any investigating ex
cept by the senate itself should
end, and the senate should get
on with business. However,
there is no pressing business for
the senate now, according to the
COP. We think the only pressing
business for the senate now is to
air all accusations and facts, and
to anchor students' trust in the
honesty and integrity of their
elected officials. Will SOC con
tinue to ride roughshod over
such crucial issues during the
rest of its term?
SOC senators have also
claimed that any commission
which disqualified senators for
actions not prohibited by the
ASSU Constitution and By-laws
(such as lying) would be using ex
post facto laws. These are the
same people who yesterday
couldn't comprehend or accept
ASSU Co-President Anne Hen
kels' statement that it's not logi
cal for "people who are under
suspicion of something to vote
on their own suspicion." It takes
a rather strange theory of con
stitutional government and rights
to ignore Henkels' observation.
The senators were elected by a
minority of students. If students
want to be truly represented and
let others know what they con
sider to be standards of honesty,
integrity and fairness, then those
students have a duty to show up
at tonight's senate meeting at
7:30. We're sure the SOC
senators would be the first in ap
proving this sort of demonstra
tion of popular belief.
SOC senators have also been
the most vociferous in urging

that the ASSU Constitution be
closely followed in this matter.
Let's all play by the rules. Article
VI, Section 2(B) states that
senators can be recalled follow
ing a petition signed by at least 15
per cent of the constituency of
the senators involved, and with
the concurrence of two-thirds of
those constituents voting in a re
call election. Article VI, Section
2(C) states that a petition to dis
solve a senate shall be valid if
signed by at least 20 per cent of
the association and followed by
the concurrence of two-thirds of
those voting in the election.
Some students are already cir
culating petitions for recall of
seven senators under section
2(B). Students may see this as
their only alternative if senators
refuse to take any action this
evening to investigate the elec
tion and disqualify senators in
volved in improper activities
which may even violate the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard.
We hope the senate will be
able to pursue justice more ac
tively and thus forestall a recall
election.
It's time for the real people to
stand up and be counted.

the accusers in the flyer are. No
SOC senator has ever bothered
to correct the record as to the
charges in this flyer. SOC has
only responded with across the
board denials, which have re
cently become across the board
"no comments." Yesterday, a
SOC senator's motion led to clo
ture of debate on election inves
tigation and disqualification.
Sen. Marvin Anderson of SOC
said yesterday the elections in
vestigation should be brought
before the senate, "the body that
has been elected by the stu
dents. ... I think the students'
judgment of honesty, integrity
and fairness is to me the best
judgment. ... I am fully able to
qualify or disqualify anyone who
is now sitting on the present se
nate, myself included."
Richard Nixon couldn't have
said it better.
Indeed, the SOC senators may
have run as a slate but they were
elected individually — and yet in
the short time since the election
the SOC senators have acted and
commented on this crucial issue
almost always as a slate.
SOC senators were almost
alone at yesterday's meeting in
urging that any investigating ex
cept by the senate itself should
end, and the senate should get
on with business. However,
there is no pressing business for
the senate now, according to the
COP. We think the only pressing
business for the senate now is to
air all accusations and facts, and
to anchor students' trust in the
honesty and integrity of their
elected officials. Will SOC con
tinue to ride roughshod over
such crucial issues during the
rest of its term?
SOC senators have also
claimed that any commission
which disqualified senators for
actions not prohibited by the
ASSU Constitution and By-laws
(such as lying) would be using ex
post facto laws. These are the
same people who yesterday
couldn't comprehend or accept
ASSU Co-President Anne Hen
kels' statement that it's not logi
cal for "people who are under
suspicion of something to vote
on their own suspicion." It takes
a rather strange theory of con
stitutional government and rights
to ignore Henkels' observation.
The senators were elected by a
minority of students. If students
want to be truly represented and
let others know what they con
sider to be standards of honesty,
integrity and fairness, then those
students have a duty to show up
at tonight's senate meeting at
7:30. We're sure the SOC
senators would be the first in ap
proving this sort of demonstra
tion of popular belief.
SOC senators have also been
the most vociferous in urging

that the ASSU Constitution be
closely followed in this matter.
Let's all play by the rules. Article
VI, Section 2(B) states that
senators can be recalled follow
ing a petition signed by at least 15
per cent of the constituency of
the senators involved, and with
the concurrence of two-thirds of
those constituents voting in a re
call election. Article VI, Section
2(C) states that a petition to dis
solve a senate shall be valid if
signed by at least 20 per cent of
the association and followed by
the concurrence of two-thirds of
those voting in the election.
Some students are already cir
culating petitions for recall of
seven senators under section
2(B). Students may see this as
their only alternative if senators
refuse to take any action this
evening to investigate the elec
tion and disqualify senators in
volved in improper activities
which may even violate the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard.
We hope the senate will be
able to pursue justice more ac
tively and thus forestall a recall
election.
It's time for the real people to
stand up and be counted.
During the past few weeks sev
eral students have committed
some fairly sordid actions on be
half of ASSU politics. The Daily
has refrained in editorials from
naming students or groups who
have attempted to deprive the
student body of honest represen
tatives. We felt that those in
volved in the recent ASSU Senate
election would attempt to correct
these wrongs, but after yester
day's senate meeting it is appa
rent that most ASSU senators
have no desire to inform stu
dents, nor to take any action as to
possible disqualification. There
are a few decent senators, but
they are powerless in the face of
such an obstinate majority.
Let's start with a few facts. It's
true that those senators who
voted yesterday were elected by
the students — they were elected
in an election that was filled with
lies, conspiracies to lie, and
coverups both during and after
the election. Students were de
frauded through dissemination
of two "anonymous" leaflets
written by candidates or suppor
ters of candidates. Threats were
made to people not to talk to the
ASSU Elections Commission in
vestigating the election. Since
the election, the Council of Pres
idents, the Elections Commis
sion, the Daily and KZSU have all
been attacked — attacked by the
people most under suspicion.
Not one word printed or broad
cast since the election has yet
been shown to be false.
Who is accusing these groups
of wrongdoing or impropriety?
Such people as Sen. Carlyle Kin
nison of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC), who last week
angrily demanded that he know
who is accusing his slate of im
proper activities and just what
the accusations are. A rather
strange statement coming from
someone who, along with the
other SOC senators, has never
apologized to the community for
the allegedly defamatory state
ments disseminated by at least 25
of his supporters.
The charges were contained in
an "anonymous" flyer inserted
without authorization intocopies
of the Daily on the first day of
voting.
Several SOC supporters have

committed malicious activities
which may be in possible viola
tion of state laws and yet no SOC
senator has ever investigated or
publicly demanded to know who
the accusers in the flyer are. No
SOC senator has ever bothered
to correct the record as to the
charges in this flyer. SOC has

want to be truly represented and
let others know what they con
sider to be standards of honesty,
integrity and fairness, then those
students have a duty to show up
at tonight's senate meeting at
7:30. We're sure the SOC
senators would be the first in ap
proving this sort of demonstra
tion of popular belief.
SOC senators have also been
the most vociferous in urging

that the ASSU Constitution be
closely followed in this matter.
Let's all play by the rules. Article
VI, Section 2(B) states that
senators can be recalled follow
ing a petition signed by at least 15
per cent of the constituency of
the senators involved, and with
the concurrence of two-thirds of
those constituents voting in a re
call election. Article VI, Section
2(C) states that a petition to dis
solve a senate shall be valid if
signed by at least 20 per cent of
the association and followed by
the concurrence of two-thirds of
those voting in the election.
Some students are already cir
culating petitions for recall of
seven senators under section
2(B). Students may see this as
their only alternative if senators
refuse to take any action this
evening to investigate the elec
tion and disqualify senators in
volved in improper activities
which may even violate the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard.
We hope the senate will be
able to pursue justice more ac
tively and thus forestall a recall
election.
It's time for the real people to
stand up and be counted.
During the past few weeks sev
eral students have committed
some fairly sordid actions on be
half of ASSU politics. The Daily
has refrained in editorials from
naming students or groups who
have attempted to deprive the
student body of honest represen
tatives. We felt that those in
volved in the recent ASSU Senate
election would attempt to correct
these wrongs, but after yester
day's senate meeting it is appa
rent that most ASSU senators
have no desire to inform stu
dents, nor to take any action as to
possible disqualification. There
are a few decent senators, but
they are powerless in the face of
such an obstinate majority.
Let's start with a few facts. It's
true that those senators who
voted yesterday were elected by
the students — they were elected
in an election that was filled with
lies, conspiracies to lie, and
coverups both during and after
the election. Students were de
frauded through dissemination
of two "anonymous" leaflets
written by candidates or suppor
ters of candidates. Threats were
made to people not to talk to the
ASSU Elections Commission in
vestigating the election. Since
the election, the Council of Pres
idents, the Elections Commis
sion, the Daily and KZSU have all
been attacked — attacked by the
people most under suspicion.
Not one word printed or broad
cast since the election has yet
been shown to be false.
Who is accusing these groups
of wrongdoing or impropriety?
Such people as Sen. Carlyle Kin
nison of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC), who last week
angrily demanded that he know
who is accusing his slate of im
proper activities and just what
the accusations are. A rather
strange statement coming from
someone who, along with the
other SOC senators, has never
apologized to the community for
the allegedly defamatory state
ments disseminated by at least 25
of his supporters.
The charges were contained in
an "anonymous" flyer inserted
without authorization intocopies
of the Daily on the first day of
voting.
Several SOC supporters have

committed malicious activities
which may be in possible viola
tion of state laws and yet no SOC
senator has ever investigated or
publicly demanded to know who
the accusers in the flyer are. No
SOC senator has ever bothered
to correct the record as to the
charges in this flyer. SOC has
only responded with across the
board denials, which have re
cently become across the board
"no comments." Yesterday, a
SOC senator's motion led to clo
ture of debate on election inves
tigation and disqualification.
Sen. Marvin Anderson of SOC
said yesterday the elections in
vestigation should be brought
before the senate, "the body that
has been elected by the stu
dents. ... I think the students'
judgment of honesty, integrity
and fairness is to me the best
judgment. ... I am fully able to
qualify or disqualify anyone who
is now sitting on the present se
nate, myself included."
Richard Nixon couldn't have
said it better.
Indeed, the SOC senators may
have run as a slate but they were
elected individually — and yet in
the short time since the election
the SOC senators have acted and
commented on this crucial issue
almost always as a slate.
SOC senators were almost
alone at yesterday's meeting in
urging that any investigating ex
cept by the senate itself should
end, and the senate should get
on with business. However,
there is no pressing business for
the senate now, according to the
COP. We think the only pressing
business for the senate now is to
air all accusations and facts, and
to anchor students' trust in the
honesty and integrity of their
elected officials. Will SOC con
tinue to ride roughshod over
such crucial issues during the
rest of its term?
SOC senators have also
claimed that any commission
which disqualified senators for
actions not prohibited by the
ASSU Constitution and By-laws
(such as lying) would be using ex
post facto laws. These are the
same people who yesterday
couldn't comprehend or accept
ASSU Co-President Anne Hen
kels' statement that it's not logi
cal for "people who are under
suspicion of something to vote
on their own suspicion." It takes
a rather strange theory of con
stitutional government and rights
to ignore Henkels' observation.
