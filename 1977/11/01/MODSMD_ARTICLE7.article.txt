I have just seen the Daily of Oct.
19. It says "Lloyd Dixon . . . said no
meetings (with students) had been
scheduled because none of the
members had had the time."
This is partially true, in that the ad
hoc committee has been working
hard on the report, as Lloyd said. But
there are members who, given suffi
cient advance notice, will be very in
terested and expect to meet with
students and to listen to all that they
wish to say.
