## The
						Panama Canal: a campaign issue?

The Panama Canal is an engineer
ing marvel and a 74-year-old dip
lomatic blunder. It is also likely to be
one of the most absurd Presidential
campaign issues ever.
I would first like to give a brief his
tory of the Panama Canal showing
why the United States is where it is
today.
In the late 1800's the United States
became interested in a canal that
would connect the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans. The need for such a
canal occurred during the Spanish-
American War when it took 90 days
for the cruiser Oregon to get from
the Pacific to the Atlantic, almost
missing the war. Toward the end of
the 19th century the French Canal
Company began construction of a
canal through the province of
Panama in Colombia. The canal
company, though, owing to disease,
seemingly insurmountable
technological problems and a lack of
money, was forced to stop construc
tion.
Bunau-Varilla
At this time an engineer for the
French Canal Company, Mr.
Bunau-Varilla, tried to interest the
United States to take over the French
Canal Company's project. The Un
ited States, which had earlier been
studying the feasibility of a canal
through Nicaragua, was interested
and submitted a proposal to the Col
ombian government calling for a
100-year treaty. The Colombian Se
nate rejected the proposal.
Not giving up, the enterprising Mr.
Bunau-Varilla suggested to the Un
ited States in 1903 that if Panama be
came independent, a treaty could be
reached with the new nation that
would be favorable to the United

States. A revolution occurred shortly
thereafter with the prior knowledge,
if not the consent, of the United
States. The United States recognized
Panama's independence several days
later. Bunau-Varilla then finessed
himself an appointment as Panama
nian Ambassador to the United
States, then drafted and signed a tre
aty with the United States while the
official Panamanian delegation was
on a train to Washington from New
York.
Advantages
Secretary of State Hay, the chief
signatory for the United States, at the
time of the signing noted that the
treaty had numerous advantages for
the United States, and"I must con
fess not so many for Panama." The
issue ended when President Theo
dore Roosevelt asked his Attorney
General, Philander C. Knox, to de
fend the United States' actions in
Panama. Replied Mr. Knox, "Oh, Mr.
President, do not let so great an
achievement suffer from any taint of
legality."
Looking over the history of the
Panama Canal I can see why 70 years
later many insist on calling the canal
"the American Canal in Panama" â€”
the Panamanians were never con
sulted. To say that the Panamanians
have no legitimate claim to the canal,
as David Miller said (Daily, Oct. 14),
is to reject basic morality. Says Mil
ler, "The claim that the people of
Panama have a right to the canal is
based on the crudest and most
chauvinistic form of nationalism." I
ask who possessed that crude
nationalism in 1903?
It is ironic that one of the most
outspoken adversaries to the canal
treaties is Senator Dole, the man

vVho, if Gerald Ford had been
elected, would now have the job of
pushing the treaty on his conserva
tive supporters. But, as Dole says,
though he himself does not feel
strongly about the canal treaties,
"looking down the road," a politi
cian needs an issue. It looks like he's
found one.
The Panama Canal negotiations
leading into these treaties have been
bipartisan and were carried out
under the past four Presidents. The
treaties, as reinforced by the recent
joint interpretation by President Car
ter and General OmarTorrijos, gives
the United States the permanent
right to maintain the neutrality of the

canal and provide for the expeditious
passage through the canal by United
States warships. The treaties are a
favorable agreement for the United
States.
In addition, ratification of the
treaties should improve the United
States' relationship with much of the
third world, which regards the
Panama Canal as a remnant from the
days of colonialism.
It would be unfortunate if the
Panama Canal treaties were defeated
by politicians solely interested in
promoting their own political
careers.
