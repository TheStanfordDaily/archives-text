# Western Civ sound move
## Broad education necessary 
### 
Ben Karlin

Last spring, after getting back a
political science midterm, I disco
vered that my point total had been
incorrectly added up. After I called
the error to his attention, my section
leader quickly gave me full credit,
and dismissed the error as an acci
dent by joking that, "Well, you can't
expect much out of me. After all, I'm
only a law student."
Although the instructor was only
half-serious, the incident is symbolic
of one of the greatest dangers facing
higher education today. The prob
lem is simple: students are being al
lowed to graduate from Stanford,
and other universities, with educa
tions which are far too narrow in
scope.
The existence of this problem is
apparent in many ways. In the above
incident, a person who had spent
seven years at Stanford had to joke
about his error in simple addition.
Many engineers graduate from here
with little idea of the roots of western
thought, while most history majors
do not know a derivative from an ex
ponent.
Other colleges have the same
problem. At some, one may earn a
degree in Recreation)!), while others
will allow a student to get by learning
everything about Contemporary

Urban Affairs and nothing about
Roman history or the philosophy of
the Renaissance humanists.
A list of examples of this type of
over-specialization could consume a
volume. However, the salient ques
tion at this point is: How did this
situation come about? To find the
answer, a flashback of 10 years or so
to the late 1960s is needed.
As we are all aware, this time
period was one of intense social tur
bulence in the United States. College
students were at the center of much
of what transpired, and they began to
question many of the basic tenets
and values of American society.
Higher education became one target
of the forces of change, and the in
stitutions were by no means immune
to the process.
In the course of this sequence of
events, students zeroed in on one
aspect of university life which they
found particularly offensive: regula
tions which required each student to
choose a portion of their courses
from a list of designated offerings, or
which specified a limited number of
specific classes which were needed
for graduation. They argued that
such courses were "irrelevant," and
that they "stifled creativity" and "de
stroyed individual initiative" in learn
ing.
What was the result of the pressure
that was subsequently applied on
administrators and faculty? Univer
sities began to liberalize their educa
tional structures by reducing the
number of mandatory courses.
The intent was noble: with fewer
required courses, students were
freer to sample many different divi
sions of the institution. The antici
pated result was that batches of stu
dents with "super-liberal" educa
tions would soon be graduating.

Matters have changed somewhat
since then, however. The idealistic
'60s are past and the pragmatic '70s
have arrived. Positions in graduate
schools of Law, Business, and
Medicine are at a premium. Higher
and higher grade averages are
needed if one hopes to enter one of
these prized professions.
At this point, the lowered re
quirements of the past decade enter.
Students feel compelled to get top
grades, so they take most of their
classes in their major and a few
closely related fields. Many may want
to explore unfamiliar territory, but
feel constrained not to do so by con
cern for the future.
Combined with reduced course
requirements, the result has been
utter disaster. Instead of graduates
with "super-liberal" educations,
places like Stanford are currently
turning out people with shallow
educations and narrow horizons.
Without dwelling any longer on
the causes of this problem, a solution
seems clear. Universities should re
institute and make mandatory one or
a few "core" type course series.
These courses would introduce
every student to the basics of sci
ence, social science, and the
humanities. Bringing back the West
ern Civilization requirement is a
sound move in this direction.
In conclusion, one is reminded of
the parents who want to be nice to
their child and decide to refrain from
spanking him/her. Later, the child
becomes a spoiled, maladjusted and
unhappy adult. The analogy is clear:
higher education does its under
graduates no favor by giving them
nearly total leeway in selection of
their courses.

thought, while most history majors
do not know a derivative from an ex
ponent.
Other colleges have the same
problem. At some, one may earn a
degree in Recreation)!), while others
will allow a student to get by learning
everything about Contemporary

Urban Affairs and nothing about
Roman history or the philosophy of

A list of examples of this type of
over-specialization could consume a
volume. However, the salient ques
tion at this point is: How did this
situation come about? To find the
answer, a flashback of 10 years or so
to the late 1960s is needed.
As we are all aware, this time
period was one of intense social tur
bulence in the United States. College
students were at the center of much
of what transpired, and they began to
question many of the basic tenets
and values of American society.
Higher education became one target
of the forces of change, and the in
stitutions were by no means immune
to the process.
In the course of this sequence of
events, students zeroed in on one
aspect of university life which they
found particularly offensive: regula
tions which required each student to
choose a portion of their courses
from a list of designated offerings, or
which specified a limited number of
specific classes which were needed
for graduation. They argued that
such courses were "irrelevant," and
that they "stifled creativity" and "de
stroyed individual initiative" in learn
ing.
What was the result of the pressure
that was subsequently applied on
administrators and faculty? Univer
sities began to liberalize their educa
tional structures by reducing the
number of mandatory courses.
The intent was noble: with fewer
required courses, students were
freer to sample many different divi
sions of the institution. The antici
pated result was that batches of stu
dents with "super-liberal" educa
tions would soon be graduating.

Matters have changed somewhat
since then, however. The idealistic
'60s are past and the pragmatic '70s
have arrived. Positions in graduate
schools of Law, Business, and
Medicine are at a premium. Higher
and higher grade averages are
needed if one hopes to enter one of
these prized professions.
At this point, the lowered re
quirements of the past decade enter.
Students feel compelled to get top
grades, so they take most of their
classes in their major and a few
closely related fields. Many may want
to explore unfamiliar territory, but
feel constrained not to do so by con
cern for the future.
Combined with reduced course
requirements, the result has been
utter disaster. Instead of graduates
with "super-liberal" educations,
places like Stanford are currently
turning out people with shallow
educations and narrow horizons.
Without dwelling any longer on
the causes of this problem, a solution
seems clear. Universities should re
institute and make mandatory one or
a few "core" type course series.
These courses would introduce
every student to the basics of sci
ence, social science, and the
humanities. Bringing back the West
ern Civilization requirement is a
sound move in this direction.
In conclusion, one is reminded of
the parents who want to be nice to
their child and decide to refrain from
spanking him/her. Later, the child
becomes a spoiled, maladjusted and
unhappy adult. The analogy is clear:
higher education does its under
graduates no favor by giving them
nearly total leeway in selection of
their courses.

Last spring, after getting back a
political science midterm, I disco
vered that my point total had been
incorrectly added up. After I called
the error to his attention, my section
leader quickly gave me full credit,
and dismissed the error as an acci
dent by joking that, "Well, you can't
expect much out of me. After all, I'm
only a law student."
Although the instructor was only
half-serious, the incident is symbolic
of one of the greatest dangers facing
higher education today. The prob
lem is simple: students are being al
lowed to graduate from Stanford,
and other universities, with educa
tions which are far too narrow in
scope.
The existence of this problem is
apparent in many ways. In the above
incident, a person who had spent
seven years at Stanford had to joke
about his error in simple addition.
