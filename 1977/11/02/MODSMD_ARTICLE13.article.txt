Abuse of CSU
The recent election controversy
has brought pain and grief to many,
but no group has been abused as se
verely as the Conservative Student
Union (CSU).
Dan Livingston, Don Barton, and
the Daily have embarrassed and
nearly destroyed the CSU — perhaps
the views of a rank-and-file CSU
membe r can repair the damage.
Persons quoted in the Daily have
accused the CSU of printing and dis
tributing the infamous "blue leaf
let," but nothing is further from the
truth. Here's the real story:
a) The "Students Committed to In
dividual Freedom" was never a
committee of the CSU. At the recent
CSU meeting, President Don Barton
announced that he was the SCIF, a
"committee of one." The CSU never
ratified the "committee," and as far
as I know, no other members joined
it.
b) It is true that Don Barton asked
the CSU to distribute the leaflets,
and a few individuals complied;
however, the group never voted to

sponsor or support the leaflet. In
fact, we never even saw the leaflet, as
Barton had neglected to bring it.
c) The CSU never did and never
will pay for the leaflet. We never
voted to pay for it — such an idea was
not even mentioned at the meeting
— and if Barton and Livingston dare
withdraw our funds for that purpose
. . . well, next year they'll attend
"Stanford-in-San Quentin" . . .
Clearly, the CSU has suffered
much undeserved abuse. Dan
Livingston ruined our integrity by
giving us "credit" for a blue sheet
that we neither printed nor sup
ported. The Daily article was deeply
embarrassing to many innocent CSU
members. Our own president, Don
Barton, took advantage of us.
The Daily owes us an apology. Dan
Livingston owes us 15 bucks. Don
Barton owes us a resignation.

Minimum wage
Doug Bandow's call for repeal of
minimum wage legislation (Daily,
Oct. 26) is a familiar shibboleth of
neoclassical economists. I cannot
quarrel with his argument that the
minimum wage is inefficient. How
ever, Bandow fails to distinguish the
minimum wage from a "guaranteed
minimum income" which promises a
"minimum standard of living."
Minimum income programs, such
as the negative income tax, are
analytically different from the
minimum wage. The minimum wage
is not essential to income mainte
nance programs, nor does its ab
sence necessarily imply a "minimum
standard of living for everyone."
I am left asking "What is the bot
tom line to Bandow's article?"
The social objectives underlying his
case for repeal of the minimum wage
are unclear.
Does Bandow argue that the
minimum wage, should be repealed
because there are more efficient
means to redistribute income than
by disrupting the market
mechanism? Or because society
owes no greater duty to "provide a
minimum standard of living" than to
provide an accessible and efficient
market for those who care to sell
their labor for a lower price?

Those of us who witnessed the first
meeting of the ASSU Senate Monday
night were appalled at the flagrant
disregard of simple ethics displayed
by some members of that body.
Readers of the Daily have noted
the considerable confusion and
numerous charges and counter
charges stemming from events pre
ceding the senate election. The first
decision facing our senate was, iron
ically, how these individual ques
tions of responsibility for ir
regularities in the campaign should
be resolved. This decision was
further complicated by the fact that
those candidates in question consti
tute a majority of the senate. In other
words, they were faced with the task
of passing judgment upon their own
guilt or innocence.
The ASSU Council of Presidents,
recognizing this political dilemma
for what it was, introduced to the
senate a resolution establishing an
independent Election Review Board.
This proposal was well thought out,
comprehensive, and well within the
senate's power to delegate its own
authority.
However, when this resolution

was put to a vote before the senate, it
was soundly defeated.
Of those whose future status as
undergraduate senators is in doubt,
five members of the SOC slate voted
"no": SOC slate member Meriel Bur
tie and senator Dan Livingston chose
to abstain. Only Janet Rappaport
joined Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack in supporting this effort
to remove the "black cloud" one
senator saw hanging over the senate.
The issue here is not one of any
individual's guilt. It is whether those
whose conduct is in question should
be allowed to be the judges in their
own cases. We feel that they should
not.
As a result, we encourage Stanford
students to sign the recall petitions
circulating today. Your signature
does not constitute a recall vote; it
only asks that the electorate have a
second chance to judge the candi
dates they have elected. The petition
seeks a recall vote on those candi
dates not supporting the COP resol
ution.
Has "Watergate come to Stan
ford?" If it has, let's not be fooled
into thinking that one week of
Watergate is enough.

Massy report
University Vice President William
Massy's conclusions regarding dives
titure of Stanford stock and sub
sequent recommendation to the
trustees was outrageous. Massy's
reasoning is essentially that if any
thing costs Stanford anything, then
that's all that is necessary to reject it.
In other words, Massy did not
submit a "cost-benefit" report, he
submitted a "cost" report and made
a recommendation without ever
mentioning whether there existed
any benefits from divestiture (finan
cial or otherwise).
Massy totally ignored the whole
point of divestiture, which is not only
to wield the power of Stanford's
stocks, but to set an example, as
Hampshire College did, to other in
vestors, and thereby ultimately
threaten the South African govern
ment with the kinds of economic
pressure that almost all of the United
Nations are now fighting for.
The point of the report's recom
mendation is clear. Massy, like the
University, is appalled by South Af
rica, and would like for apartheid to
go away, but not at Stanford's ex
pense. How much is social con
sciousness worth?

Poem for a kind soul
Last June our Art Department flag
was taken from the roof of the Cum
mings Art Building, where it was fly
ing in readiness for commencement
ceremonies. We had given up hope
of ever seeing it again but 10, when
we arrived a few days ago, there it
was, floating out against the sky.
We'd like to dedicate the following
poem to the kind soul who brought it
back.
To our unknown benefactor
Oh blessed by the kindly chap
Who brought us back our flag,
His noble act, anonymous,
Has caused our tongues to wag.
Who is this knight whose armor
shines?
Who this good deed has done?
At any rate, we're jolly glad
And thank you all and one.

Sign recall petitions
Those of us who witnessed the first
meeting of the ASSU Senate Monday
night were appalled at the flagrant
disregard of simple ethics displayed
by some members of that body.
Readers of the Daily have noted
the considerable confusion and
numerous charges and counter
charges stemming from events pre
ceding the senate election. The first
decision facing our senate was, iron
ically, how these individual ques
tions of responsibility for ir
regularities in the campaign should
be resolved. This decision was
further complicated by the fact that
those candidates in question consti
tute a majority of the senate. In other
words, they were faced with the task
of passing judgment upon their own
guilt or innocence.
The ASSU Council of Presidents,
recognizing this political dilemma
for what it was, introduced to the
senate a resolution establishing an
independent Election Review Board.
This proposal was well thought out,
comprehensive, and well within the
senate's power to delegate its own
authority.
However, when this resolution

was put to a vote before the senate, it
was soundly defeated.
Of those whose future status as
undergraduate senators is in doubt,
five members of the SOC slate voted
"no": SOC slate member Meriel Bur
tie and senator Dan Livingston chose
to abstain. Only Janet Rappaport
joined Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack in supporting this effort
to remove the "black cloud" one
senator saw hanging over the senate.
The issue here is not one of any
individual's guilt. It is whether those
whose conduct is in question should
be allowed to be the judges in their
own cases. We feel that they should
not.
As a result, we encourage Stanford
students to sign the recall petitions
circulating today. Your signature
does not constitute a recall vote; it
only asks that the electorate have a
second chance to judge the candi
dates they have elected. The petition
seeks a recall vote on those candi
dates not supporting the COP resol
ution.

Massy report
University Vice President William
Massy's conclusions regarding dives
titure of Stanford stock and sub
sequent recommendation to the
trustees was outrageous. Massy's
reasoning is essentially that if any
thing costs Stanford anything, then
that's all that is necessary to reject it.
In other words, Massy did not
submit a "cost-benefit" report, he
submitted a "cost" report and made
a recommendation without ever
mentioning whether there existed
any benefits from divestiture (finan
cial or otherwise).
Massy totally ignored the whole
point of divestiture, which is not only
to wield the power of Stanford's
stocks, but to set an example, as
Hampshire College did, to other in
vestors, and thereby ultimately
threaten the South African govern
ment with the kinds of economic
pressure that almost all of the United
Nations are now fighting for.
The point of the report's recom
mendation is clear. Massy, like the
University, is appalled by South Af
rica, and would like for apartheid to
go away, but not at Stanford's ex
pense. How much is social con
sciousness worth?

Poem for a kind soul
Last June our Art Department flag
was taken from the roof of the Cum
mings Art Building, where it was fly
ing in readiness for commencement
ceremonies. We had given up hope
of ever seeing it again but 10, when
we arrived a few days ago, there it
was, floating out against the sky.
We'd like to dedicate the following
poem to the kind soul who brought it
back.
To our unknown benefactor
Oh blessed by the kindly chap
Who brought us back our flag,
His noble act, anonymous,
Has caused our tongues to wag.
Who is this knight whose armor
shines?
Who this good deed has done?
At any rate, we're jolly glad
And thank you all and one.

Abuse of CSU
The recent election controversy
has brought pain and grief to many,
but no group has been abused as se
verely as the Conservative Student
Union (CSU).
Dan Livingston, Don Barton, and
the Daily have embarrassed and
nearly destroyed the CSU — perhaps
the views of a rank-and-file CSU
membe r can repair the damage.
Persons quoted in the Daily have
accused the CSU of printing and dis
tributing the infamous "blue leaf
let," but nothing is further from the
truth. Here's the real story:
a) The "Students Committed to In
dividual Freedom" was never a
committee of the CSU. At the recent
CSU meeting, President Don Barton
announced that he was the SCIF, a
"committee of one." The CSU never
ratified the "committee," and as far
as I know, no other members joined
it.
b) It is true that Don Barton asked
the CSU to distribute the leaflets,
and a few individuals complied;
however, the group never voted to

sponsor or support the leaflet. In
fact, we never even saw the leaflet, as
Barton had neglected to bring it.
c) The CSU never did and never
will pay for the leaflet. We never
voted to pay for it — such an idea was
not even mentioned at the meeting
— and if Barton and Livingston dare
withdraw our funds for that purpose
. . . well, next year they'll attend
"Stanford-in-San Quentin" . . .
Clearly, the CSU has suffered
much undeserved abuse. Dan
Livingston ruined our integrity by
giving us "credit" for a blue sheet
that we neither printed nor sup
ported. The Daily article was deeply
embarrassing to many innocent CSU
members. Our own president, Don
Barton, took advantage of us.
The Daily owes us an apology. Dan
Livingston owes us 15 bucks. Don
Barton owes us a resignation.

Minimum wage
Doug Bandow's call for repeal of
minimum wage legislation (Daily,
Oct. 26) is a familiar shibboleth of
neoclassical economists. I cannot
quarrel with his argument that the
minimum wage is inefficient. How
ever, Bandow fails to distinguish the
minimum wage from a "guaranteed
minimum income" which promises a
"minimum standard of living."
Minimum income programs, such
as the negative income tax, are
analytically different from the
minimum wage. The minimum wage
is not essential to income mainte
nance programs, nor does its ab
sence necessarily imply a "minimum
standard of living for everyone."
I am left asking "What is the bot
tom line to Bandow's article?"
The social objectives underlying his
case for repeal of the minimum wage
are unclear.
Does Bandow argue that the
minimum wage, should be repealed
because there are more efficient
means to redistribute income than
by disrupting the market
mechanism? Or because society
owes no greater duty to "provide a
minimum standard of living" than to
provide an accessible and efficient
market for those who care to sell
their labor for a lower price?

to wield the power of Stanford's

Poem for a kind soul
Last June our Art Department flag
was taken from the roof of the Cum
mings Art Building, where it was fly
ing in readiness for commencement
ceremonies. We had given up hope
of ever seeing it again but 10, when
we arrived a few days ago, there it
was, floating out against the sky.
We'd like to dedicate the following
poem to the kind soul who brought it
back.
To our unknown benefactor
Oh blessed by the kindly chap
Who brought us back our flag,
His noble act, anonymous,
Has caused our tongues to wag.
Who is this knight whose armor
shines?
Who this good deed has done?
At any rate, we're jolly glad
And thank you all and one.

Abuse of CSU
The recent election controversy
has brought pain and grief to many,
but no group has been abused as se
verely as the Conservative Student
Union (CSU).
Dan Livingston, Don Barton, and
the Daily have embarrassed and
nearly destroyed the CSU — perhaps
the views of a rank-and-file CSU
membe r can repair the damage.
Persons quoted in the Daily have
accused the CSU of printing and dis
tributing the infamous "blue leaf
let," but nothing is further from the
truth. Here's the real story:
a) The "Students Committed to In
dividual Freedom" was never a
committee of the CSU. At the recent
CSU meeting, President Don Barton
announced that he was the SCIF, a
"committee of one." The CSU never
ratified the "committee," and as far
as I know, no other members joined
it.
b) It is true that Don Barton asked
the CSU to distribute the leaflets,
and a few individuals complied;
however, the group never voted to

sponsor or support the leaflet. In
fact, we never even saw the leaflet, as
Barton had neglected to bring it.
c) The CSU never did and never
will pay for the leaflet. We never
voted to pay for it — such an idea was
not even mentioned at the meeting
— and if Barton and Livingston dare
withdraw our funds for that purpose
. . . well, next year they'll attend
"Stanford-in-San Quentin" . . .
Clearly, the CSU has suffered
much undeserved abuse. Dan
Livingston ruined our integrity by
giving us "credit" for a blue sheet
that we neither printed nor sup
ported. The Daily article was deeply
embarrassing to many innocent CSU
members. Our own president, Don
Barton, took advantage of us.
The Daily owes us an apology. Dan
Livingston owes us 15 bucks. Don
Barton owes us a resignation.

Minimum wage
Doug Bandow's call for repeal of
minimum wage legislation (Daily,
Oct. 26) is a familiar shibboleth of
neoclassical economists. I cannot
quarrel with his argument that the
minimum wage is inefficient. How
ever, Bandow fails to distinguish the
minimum wage from a "guaranteed
minimum income" which promises a
"minimum standard of living."
Minimum income programs, such
as the negative income tax, are
analytically different from the
minimum wage. The minimum wage
is not essential to income mainte
nance programs, nor does its ab
sence necessarily imply a "minimum
standard of living for everyone."
I am left asking "What is the bot
tom line to Bandow's article?"
The social objectives underlying his
case for repeal of the minimum wage
are unclear.
Does Bandow argue that the
minimum wage, should be repealed
because there are more efficient
means to redistribute income than
by disrupting the market
mechanism? Or because society
owes no greater duty to "provide a
minimum standard of living" than to
provide an accessible and efficient
market for those who care to sell
their labor for a lower price?

Those of us who witnessed the first
meeting of the ASSU Senate Monday
night were appalled at the flagrant
disregard of simple ethics displayed
by some members of that body.
Readers of the Daily have noted
the considerable confusion and
numerous charges and counter
charges stemming from events pre
ceding the senate election. The first
decision facing our senate was, iron
ically, how these individual ques
tions of responsibility for ir
regularities in the campaign should
be resolved. This decision was
further complicated by the fact that
those candidates in question consti
tute a majority of the senate. In other
words, they were faced with the task
of passing judgment upon their own
guilt or innocence.
The ASSU Council of Presidents,
recognizing this political dilemma
for what it was, introduced to the
senate a resolution establishing an
independent Election Review Board.
This proposal was well thought out,
comprehensive, and well within the
senate's power to delegate its own
authority.
However, when this resolution

was put to a vote before the senate, it
was soundly defeated.
Of those whose future status as
undergraduate senators is in doubt,
five members of the SOC slate voted
"no": SOC slate member Meriel Bur
tie and senator Dan Livingston chose
to abstain. Only Janet Rappaport
joined Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack in supporting this effort
to remove the "black cloud" one
senator saw hanging over the senate.
The issue here is not one of any
individual's guilt. It is whether those
whose conduct is in question should
be allowed to be the judges in their
own cases. We feel that they should
not.
As a result, we encourage Stanford
students to sign the recall petitions
circulating today. Your signature
does not constitute a recall vote; it
only asks that the electorate have a
second chance to judge the candi
dates they have elected. The petition
seeks a recall vote on those candi
dates not supporting the COP resol
ution.

ford?" If it has, let's not be fooled

Massy report
University Vice President William
Massy's conclusions regarding dives
titure of Stanford stock and sub
sequent recommendation to the
trustees was outrageous. Massy's
reasoning is essentially that if any
thing costs Stanford anything, then
that's all that is necessary to reject it.
In other words, Massy did not
submit a "cost-benefit" report, he
submitted a "cost" report and made
a recommendation without ever
mentioning whether there existed
any benefits from divestiture (finan
cial or otherwise).
Massy totally ignored the whole
point of divestiture, which is not only
to wield the power of Stanford's

Clearly, the CSU has suffered
much undeserved abuse. Dan
Livingston ruined our integrity by
giving us "credit" for a blue sheet
that we neither printed nor sup
ported. The Daily article was deeply
embarrassing to many innocent CSU
members. Our own president, Don
Barton, took advantage of us.
The Daily owes us an apology. Dan
Livingston owes us 15 bucks. Don
Barton owes us a resignation.

Minimum wage
Doug Bandow's call for repeal of
minimum wage legislation (Daily,
Oct. 26) is a familiar shibboleth of
neoclassical economists. I cannot
quarrel with his argument that the
minimum wage is inefficient. How
ever, Bandow fails to distinguish the
minimum wage from a "guaranteed
minimum income" which promises a
"minimum standard of living."
Minimum income programs, such
as the negative income tax, are
analytically different from the
minimum wage. The minimum wage
is not essential to income mainte
nance programs, nor does its ab
sence necessarily imply a "minimum
standard of living for everyone."
I am left asking "What is the bot
tom line to Bandow's article?"
The social objectives underlying his
case for repeal of the minimum wage
are unclear.
Does Bandow argue that the
minimum wage, should be repealed
because there are more efficient
means to redistribute income than
by disrupting the market
mechanism? Or because society
owes no greater duty to "provide a
minimum standard of living" than to
provide an accessible and efficient
market for those who care to sell
their labor for a lower price?

Sign recall petitions
Those of us who witnessed the first
meeting of the ASSU Senate Monday
night were appalled at the flagrant
disregard of simple ethics displayed
by some members of that body.
Readers of the Daily have noted
the considerable confusion and
numerous charges and counter
charges stemming from events pre
ceding the senate election. The first
decision facing our senate was, iron
ically, how these individual ques
tions of responsibility for ir
regularities in the campaign should
be resolved. This decision was
further complicated by the fact that
those candidates in question consti
tute a majority of the senate. In other
words, they were faced with the task
of passing judgment upon their own
guilt or innocence.
The ASSU Council of Presidents,
recognizing this political dilemma
for what it was, introduced to the
senate a resolution establishing an
independent Election Review Board.
This proposal was well thought out,
comprehensive, and well within the
senate's power to delegate its own
authority.
However, when this resolution

was put to a vote before the senate, it
was soundly defeated.
Of those whose future status as
undergraduate senators is in doubt,
five members of the SOC slate voted
"no": SOC slate member Meriel Bur
tie and senator Dan Livingston chose
to abstain. Only Janet Rappaport
joined Steve Buckley and Tom
McCormack in supporting this effort
to remove the "black cloud" one
senator saw hanging over the senate.
The issue here is not one of any
individual's guilt. It is whether those
whose conduct is in question should
be allowed to be the judges in their
own cases. We feel that they should
not.
As a result, we encourage Stanford
students to sign the recall petitions
circulating today. Your signature
does not constitute a recall vote; it
only asks that the electorate have a
second chance to judge the candi
dates they have elected. The petition
seeks a recall vote on those candi
dates not supporting the COP resol
ution.
Has "Watergate come to Stan
ford?" If it has, let's not be fooled
into thinking that one week of
Watergate is enough.

Massy report
University Vice President William
Massy's conclusions regarding dives
titure of Stanford stock and sub
sequent recommendation to the
trustees was outrageous. Massy's
reasoning is essentially that if any
thing costs Stanford anything, then
that's all that is necessary to reject it.
In other words, Massy did not
submit a "cost-benefit" report, he
submitted a "cost" report and made
a recommendation without ever
mentioning whether there existed
any benefits from divestiture (finan
cial or otherwise).
Massy totally ignored the whole
point of divestiture, which is not only
to wield the power of Stanford's
stocks, but to set an example, as
Hampshire College did, to other in
vestors, and thereby ultimately
threaten the South African govern
ment with the kinds of economic
pressure that almost all of the United
Nations are now fighting for.
The point of the report's recom
mendation is clear. Massy, like the
University, is appalled by South Af
rica, and would like for apartheid to
go away, but not at Stanford's ex
pense. How much is social con
sciousness worth?

Poem for a kind soul
Last June our Art Department flag
was taken from the roof of the Cum
mings Art Building, where it was fly
ing in readiness for commencement
ceremonies. We had given up hope
of ever seeing it again but 10, when
we arrived a few days ago, there it
was, floating out against the sky.
We'd like to dedicate the following
poem to the kind soul who brought it
back.
To our unknown benefactor
Oh blessed by the kindly chap
Who brought us back our flag,
His noble act, anonymous,
Has caused our tongues to wag.
Who is this knight whose armor
shines?
Who this good deed has done?
At any rate, we're jolly glad
And thank you all and one.
