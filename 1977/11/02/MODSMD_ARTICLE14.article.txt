# Girl testifies at Chowchilla trial
## 
### 
Oakland, Calif. (AP) — A 12-
year-old girl burst into tears on
the witness stand yesterday as
she looked across a courtroom
at her three confessed kidnap
pers and told how she and 25
classmates were abducted and
buried in an underground
tomb for 16 hours.
The three are on trial for kid
napping with bodily harm.
jodi Heffington, who was a
fifth-grader in Chowchilla
when the kidnapping occurred
July 15, 1976, began to tell of
her abduction but only man
aged a few words before she
began crying.
"A man got out with a gun,"
she said of the moment she
knew their school bus was
being hijacked. Then she wept
bitterly and a recess was called.
She was the second of the
young victims to testify after
the bus driver kidnapped with
them testified that he and the
youngsters huddled together,
prayed and expected to die.
"I thought we was all gonna
die right there," said Ed Ray,
the 56-year-old driver who be
came a hero after he and the
youngsters escaped 16 hours
after they were buried follow
ing their abduction.
"There was a lot of crying,"
Ray said of the hours they
spent in a buried moving van.
"The kids — they thought that
they wouldn't see their mom
mies and their daddies no
more."
Later, Jodi's father, seated in
the jury box next to thewitness
stand, put an arm around his
daughter and encouraged her
to continue after the recess.
Jodi, testifying at the non
jury trial, then told the judge of
the terrifying ordeal during
which she suffered five noseb
leeds, wet her pants and hurt
her knee.
She said the children who
were buried with her in a dirt
covered moving van cried con
tinuously and sometimes even
screamed.
Ray had described earlier
how three young men com
mandeered his school bus as
he drove the children home
from summer school.
He said they were herded
into two vans where the heat
and crowded conditions were

oppressive.
"It was real crowded," he
said. "I laid across the back
fender well and the kids piled
up against me — on my arms
and legs, all over me.
"I got cramps in my legs and
tried to move, but I couldn't
because the little kid;, just
started crying more . . . the
poor little kids didn't want to
move so I let them lay on me."
Ray was the first witness in a
trial which is to determine
whether the victims of the na
tion's most bizarre kidnapping
suffered bodily injuries while
held captive.
The men on trial — James

Schoenfeld, 26, Fred Woods,
26, and Richard Schoenfeld, 23
— stared impassively at Ray as
he testified.
The three young men, pro
ducts of privileged upbring
ings in a wealthy area south of
San Francisco, have admitted
they were the masked gunmen
who hijacked the bus and later
buried their captives.
However, they claim they in
flicted no bodily harm on the
victims. This is the crucial issue
of the trial.
Kidnapping with bodily harm
carries a mandatory life sen
tence with no possibility of
parole. Simple kidnapping, to

which they pleaded guilty, car
ries life with eligibility for
parole in seven years.
Madera County District At
torney David Minier won a
legal round at the start of the
trial when he was given per
mission to present evidence of
the children's emotional anxi
ety during the ordeal.
Superior Court Judge Leo
Deegan ruled earlier that
psychiatric testimony from
doctors would not be allowed
in evidence. The children's pa
rents have refused to let them
undergo extensive psychiatric
examination.

youngsters huddled together,
prayed and expected to die.
"I thought we was all gonna
die right there," said Ed Ray,
the 56-year-old driver who be
came a hero after he and the
youngsters escaped 16 hours
after they were buried follow
ing their abduction.
"There was a lot of crying,"
Ray said of the hours they
spent in a buried moving van.
"The kids — they thought that
they wouldn't see their mom
mies and their daddies no
more."
Later, Jodi's father, seated in
the jury box next to thewitness
stand, put an arm around his
daughter and encouraged her
to continue after the recess.
Jodi, testifying at the non
jury trial, then told the judge of
the terrifying ordeal during
which she suffered five noseb
leeds, wet her pants and hurt
her knee.
She said the children who
were buried with her in a dirt
covered moving van cried con
tinuously and sometimes even
screamed.
Ray had described earlier
how three young men com
mandeered his school bus as
he drove the children home
from summer school.
He said they were herded
into two vans where the heat
and crowded conditions were

oppressive.
"It was real crowded," he
said. "I laid across the back
fender well and the kids piled
up against me — on my arms
and legs, all over me.
"I got cramps in my legs and
tried to move, but I couldn't
because the little kid;, just
started crying more . . . the
poor little kids didn't want to
move so I let them lay on me."
Ray was the first witness in a
trial which is to determine
whether the victims of the na
tion's most bizarre kidnapping
suffered bodily injuries while
held captive.
The men on trial — James

Schoenfeld, 26, Fred Woods,
26, and Richard Schoenfeld, 23
— stared impassively at Ray as
he testified.
The three young men, pro
ducts of privileged upbring
ings in a wealthy area south of
San Francisco, have admitted
they were the masked gunmen
who hijacked the bus and later
buried their captives.
However, they claim they in
flicted no bodily harm on the
victims. This is the crucial issue
of the trial.
Kidnapping with bodily harm
carries a mandatory life sen
tence with no possibility of
parole. Simple kidnapping, to

which they pleaded guilty, car
ries life with eligibility for
parole in seven years.
Madera County District At
torney David Minier won a
legal round at the start of the
trial when he was given per
mission to present evidence of
the children's emotional anxi
ety during the ordeal.
Superior Court Judge Leo
Deegan ruled earlier that
psychiatric testimony from
doctors would not be allowed
in evidence. The children's pa
rents have refused to let them
undergo extensive psychiatric
examination.
Oakland, Calif. (AP) — A 12-
year-old girl burst into tears on
the witness stand yesterday as
she looked across a courtroom
at her three confessed kidnap
pers and told how she and 25
classmates were abducted and
buried in an underground
tomb for 16 hours.
The three are on trial for kid
napping with bodily harm.
jodi Heffington, who was a
fifth-grader in Chowchilla
when the kidnapping occurred
July 15, 1976, began to tell of
her abduction but only man
aged a few words before she
began crying.
"A man got out with a gun,"
she said of the moment she
knew their school bus was
being hijacked. Then she wept
bitterly and a recess was called.
She was the second of the
young victims to testify after
