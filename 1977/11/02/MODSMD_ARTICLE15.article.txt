# Senate joins House in breeder
## Reactor funds approved 
### 
Washington (AP)â€”The Senate
joined the House on Tuesday
in voting to require President
Jimmy Carter to spend $80 mill
ion on the nuclear breeder
reactor program he wants to
scrap.
By a 90 to 0 vote, the Senate
approved an $8-billion sup
plemental appropriations bill
that contains money for the
Clinch River breeder reactor
project as well as many other
major federal programs.
The measure was sent to a
conference with the House to
compromise differences bet
ween the bills passed by the
two chambers.
The Senate bili also contains
provisions carrying out Car
ter's decision to cancel pro
duction of the B-1 bomber.
Before the Sente acted, Sen.
Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), urged
Carter to kill the breeder reac
tor by vetoing both the au
thorization and appropriations
bills which contain the prog
ram.
Bumpers introduced an
amendment to cut the breeder
reactor appropriation to $58
million, a funding level that
backers of the project claim
would result in canceling it. He
later withdrew the amend
ment, saying he realized it had
no chance.

Bumpers siad the project ul
timately will cost some $2 bill
ion and will "bring us closer to
the time when a holocaust can
take place."
Clinch River, a joint
government-industry venture
tobebuiltatOak Ridge,Tenn.,
would produce more nuclear
fuel than it consumes. But the
fuel produced is plutonium,
which can be converted for use
in nuclear bombs.
Carter wants the project shut
down as part of his program to
halt the worldwide spread of
weapons-grade nuclear mate

rials.
Congress has made that
more difficult by including the
project in much larger funding
bills.
Among other things, the bills
contain $4.5 billion for the
sewage treatment grant con
struction program, $1.4 billion
for Small Business Administra
tion disaster loans, $383.1 mill
ion for a strategic petroleum
reserve, $124 million for In
dochinese refugee assistance
and $67.5 million for strip
mining reclamation and en
forcement.
