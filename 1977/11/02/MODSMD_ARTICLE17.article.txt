# Professor sees activism beneath the calm
## 
### Todd Bauman Lisa Bormann 
In the wake of student pro
tests here this past spring, His
tory Prof. Cordon Wright said
he does not think students are
less politically concerned than
they were 10 years ago.
"There are still issues that
could create an uproar on
campus today. If we were deep
in a Vietnam War now, we
would be having the same kind
of activities on campus we had
then," said Wright, who will be
leaving Stanford this January.
During his 20years in the his
tory department, Wright said
the only time he felt like get
ting out of teaching was in the
spring of 1970, during the
height of the student anti-
Vietnam War activities.
"I never had so many un
pleasant things said to me as
that spring. I had never been
called a fascist before, as I was
then," he remarked.
Exchange ideas
"I was against the war but I
didn't want to show it by
smashing windows. I felt that
the university should be open,
that it should be a place for the
free exchange of ideas," he

added.
"I can't imagine the univer
sity striking for any length of
time, unless the institution or
the country were threatened."
On the dismissal of English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin in
January 1972, Wright said, "He
was never touched for any
thing he said, only for what he
did." Franklin was an active
participant in student protests
in 1972.
"Bruce Franklin could have
said anything he wanted to and
nobody would have touched
him — trustees, administra
tion, alumni — nobody," he
added.
Reflecting on the years of
student activism, Wright said,
"I don't think the experience
was healthy or constructive. It
created a kind of negative at
titude to authority that we still
have now, a kind of cynicism."
Social change difficult
He said his own political
views were not changed by the
experience, although he has
become less optimistic about
the possibilities of peaceful
change.
"Social change is not an easy
thing to accomplish," he re
marked. "It takes constant vigi
lance and any kind of social ac
tion comes from a small minor
ity — like Stanford people —
which is why it is such a plea
sure to be here."
Wright first came to Stanford
as a graduate student in the late
'30s.
"Admissions were easier
then and rich students tended
to get in. Stanford generally
catered to upper-middle class
California," he recalled.
The day Hitler invaded Rus
sia, Wright moved up to
Eugene to teach at the Univer
sity of Oregon, before joining

the State Department in 1943.
He served as a foreign ser
vice officer in Paris during the
years just following the libera
tion.
"I had a lot of youthful illu
sions of influencing the
world's future, but then what
we did was pretty darned im
portant," he said.
Paris
The Paris he lived and
worked in was a "grim place,"
with the economy in ruin and
fears of a fascist or Communist
coup.
"We had an obligation to
help get Western Europe back
on its feet — to encourage so
cial justice if we could. Some
conservatives wanted to resur
rect the old right-wing, but our
real policy was to encourage
democratic socialism," Wright
said.
"I don't think they could
have gotten through it without
us."
Reflecting on the Cold War,
which was in its infancy then,
Wright said, "The rift between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. de
veloped from 1944 on. America
hoped to prevent it, but we
were very cautious.
"Differences in values were
bound to bring on a clash. I
don't think we could easily
co-exist in a world where Sta
lin's values were leading a
great power," he added.
Building up
In 1947, Wright went back to
Oregon to teach and provide a
better environment to raise his
sons. In 1957 he returned to
Stanford as a history professor.
Stanford's history depart
ment was improving rapidly in
the '50s, he said.
"We built a very good de
partment," said Wright. "We
were able to bring in some

good, young people — and a
few stars — back in those days
when money was around."
Wright earned a reputation
as a superb scholar, teacher
and administrator. He was de
partment chairman for six
years. His teaching and writing
style is described by one of his
colleagues as "elegantly sim
ple."
One student, Bob Fikso, re
marked, "He exudes great
scholarship, but otherwise he
comes across as nice as the guy
next door."
Wright is acutely aware of his
responsibilities as an educator.
"I admit it's sometimes tough
for a liberal teacher teaching
that the truth isn't all in one
place," he said.
Liberal's dilemma
"But a teacher should give
the students many sides of the
story, and I guess a liberal can
be accused of hypocritically
indoctrinating in that sense."
Wright was responsible for
starting the university's first
undergraduate colloquium
back in the early '60s, and he
said the rise in small group
courses over the years has
been good for the school.
"I think more education
takes place in small groups
than in big lectures," he said.
Evaluating Carter's foreign
policy, Wright said he doesn't
think it is as different from Kis
singer's policies as it may
seem.
"Carter's emphasis on
human rights is the biggest pol
icy change," he said.
"I lean toward it; it fits my
values. We ought to stand up
for our beliefs and say it, and if
the Russians don't like, that's
fine, I don't like them much
either."
Wright said he opposed the
California Supreme Court's
decision in the Bakke case, but
acknowledged the complexity
of the problem.
"If you want to be absolutely
logical, then discrimination is
always bad. But it seems some
people in our society have to
start with a twenty yard hand
icap, and society has the right
to try and correct that hand
icap," he said.
Looking to Western Europe,
Wright said he doubts that the
left will gain power in France in
the immediate future, and sees
Eurocommunism gradually in
creasing its independence
from the Soviet Union.
"I think the Communist
movement is going to change
over time, in Russia and with
out," he said. "It will be a
change for the better, an open
ing up of the system."
"Some European Com
munists are beginning to
realize there are flaws in all sys
tems and are looking critically
at themselves, and that's
good," he added.
Wright intends to complete
this quarter, then teach a
semester at Arizona State Uni
versity. Next year he plans to
teach at William and Mary Col
lege in Virginia.

vice officer in Paris during the
years just following the libera
tion.
"I had a lot of youthful illu
sions of influencing the
world's future, but then what
we did was pretty darned im
portant," he said.
Paris
The Paris he lived and
worked in was a "grim place,"
with the economy in ruin and
fears of a fascist or Communist
coup.
"We had an obligation to
help get Western Europe back
on its feet — to encourage so
cial justice if we could. Some
conservatives wanted to resur
rect the old right-wing, but our
real policy was to encourage
democratic socialism," Wright
said.
"I don't think they could
have gotten through it without
us."
Reflecting on the Cold War,
which was in its infancy then,
Wright said, "The rift between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. de
veloped from 1944 on. America
hoped to prevent it, but we
were very cautious.
"Differences in values were
bound to bring on a clash. I
don't think we could easily
co-exist in a world where Sta
lin's values were leading a
great power," he added.
Building up
In 1947, Wright went back to
Oregon to teach and provide a
better environment to raise his
sons. In 1957 he returned to
Stanford as a history professor.
Stanford's history depart
ment was improving rapidly in
the '50s, he said.
"We built a very good de
partment," said Wright. "We
were able to bring in some

good, young people — and a
few stars — back in those days
when money was around."
Wright earned a reputation
as a superb scholar, teacher
and administrator. He was de
partment chairman for six
years. His teaching and writing
style is described by one of his
colleagues as "elegantly sim
ple."
One student, Bob Fikso, re
marked, "He exudes great
scholarship, but otherwise he
comes across as nice as the guy
next door."
Wright is acutely aware of his
responsibilities as an educator.
"I admit it's sometimes tough
for a liberal teacher teaching
that the truth isn't all in one
place," he said.
Liberal's dilemma
"But a teacher should give
the students many sides of the
story, and I guess a liberal can
be accused of hypocritically
indoctrinating in that sense."
Wright was responsible for
starting the university's first
undergraduate colloquium
back in the early '60s, and he
said the rise in small group
courses over the years has
been good for the school.
"I think more education
takes place in small groups
than in big lectures," he said.
Evaluating Carter's foreign
policy, Wright said he doesn't
think it is as different from Kis
singer's policies as it may
seem.
"Carter's emphasis on
human rights is the biggest pol
icy change," he said.
"I lean toward it; it fits my
values. We ought to stand up
for our beliefs and say it, and if
the Russians don't like, that's
fine, I don't like them much
either."
Wright said he opposed the
California Supreme Court's
decision in the Bakke case, but
acknowledged the complexity
of the problem.
"If you want to be absolutely
logical, then discrimination is
always bad. But it seems some
people in our society have to
start with a twenty yard hand
icap, and society has the right
to try and correct that hand
icap," he said.
Looking to Western Europe,
Wright said he doubts that the
left will gain power in France in
the immediate future, and sees
Eurocommunism gradually in
creasing its independence
from the Soviet Union.
"I think the Communist
movement is going to change
over time, in Russia and with
out," he said. "It will be a
change for the better, an open
ing up of the system."
"Some European Com
munists are beginning to
realize there are flaws in all sys
tems and are looking critically
at themselves, and that's
good," he added.
Wright intends to complete
this quarter, then teach a
semester at Arizona State Uni
versity. Next year he plans to
teach at William and Mary Col
lege in Virginia.

In the wake of student pro
tests here this past spring, His
tory Prof. Cordon Wright said
he does not think students are
less politically concerned than
they were 10 years ago.
"There are still issues that
could create an uproar on
campus today. If we were deep
in a Vietnam War now, we
would be having the same kind
of activities on campus we had
then," said Wright, who will be
leaving Stanford this January.
During his 20years in the his
tory department, Wright said
the only time he felt like get
ting out of teaching was in the
spring of 1970, during the
height of the student anti-
Vietnam War activities.
"I never had so many un
pleasant things said to me as
that spring. I had never been
called a fascist before, as I was
then," he remarked.
Exchange ideas
"I was against the war but I
didn't want to show it by
smashing windows. I felt that
the university should be open,
that it should be a place for the
free exchange of ideas," he

added.
"I can't imagine the univer
sity striking for any length of
time, unless the institution or
the country were threatened."
On the dismissal of English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin in
January 1972, Wright said, "He
was never touched for any
thing he said, only for what he
did." Franklin was an active
participant in student protests
in 1972.
"Bruce Franklin could have
said anything he wanted to and
nobody would have touched
him — trustees, administra
tion, alumni — nobody," he
added.
Reflecting on the years of
student activism, Wright said,
"I don't think the experience
was healthy or constructive. It
created a kind of negative at
titude to authority that we still
have now, a kind of cynicism."
Social change difficult
He said his own political
views were not changed by the
experience, although he has
become less optimistic about
the possibilities of peaceful
change.
"Social change is not an easy
thing to accomplish," he re
marked. "It takes constant vigi
lance and any kind of social ac
tion comes from a small minor
ity — like Stanford people —
which is why it is such a plea
sure to be here."
Wright first came to Stanford
as a graduate student in the late
'30s.
"Admissions were easier
then and rich students tended
to get in. Stanford generally
catered to upper-middle class
California," he recalled.
The day Hitler invaded Rus
sia, Wright moved up to
Eugene to teach at the Univer
sity of Oregon, before joining

the State Department in 1943.
He served as a foreign ser
vice officer in Paris during the
years just following the libera

than in big lectures," he said.
Evaluating Carter's foreign
policy, Wright said he doesn't
think it is as different from Kis
singer's policies as it may
seem.
"Carter's emphasis on
human rights is the biggest pol
icy change," he said.
"I lean toward it; it fits my
values. We ought to stand up
for our beliefs and say it, and if
the Russians don't like, that's
fine, I don't like them much
either."
Wright said he opposed the
California Supreme Court's
decision in the Bakke case, but
acknowledged the complexity
of the problem.
"If you want to be absolutely
logical, then discrimination is
always bad. But it seems some
people in our society have to
start with a twenty yard hand
icap, and society has the right
to try and correct that hand
icap," he said.
Looking to Western Europe,
Wright said he doubts that the
left will gain power in France in
the immediate future, and sees
Eurocommunism gradually in
creasing its independence
from the Soviet Union.
"I think the Communist
movement is going to change
over time, in Russia and with
out," he said. "It will be a
change for the better, an open
ing up of the system."
"Some European Com
munists are beginning to
realize there are flaws in all sys
tems and are looking critically
at themselves, and that's
good," he added.
Wright intends to complete
this quarter, then teach a
semester at Arizona State Uni
versity. Next year he plans to
teach at William and Mary Col
lege in Virginia.

In the wake of student pro
tests here this past spring, His
tory Prof. Cordon Wright said
he does not think students are
less politically concerned than
they were 10 years ago.
"There are still issues that
could create an uproar on
campus today. If we were deep
in a Vietnam War now, we
would be having the same kind
of activities on campus we had
then," said Wright, who will be
leaving Stanford this January.
During his 20years in the his
tory department, Wright said
the only time he felt like get
ting out of teaching was in the
spring of 1970, during the
height of the student anti-
Vietnam War activities.
"I never had so many un
pleasant things said to me as
that spring. I had never been
called a fascist before, as I was
then," he remarked.
Exchange ideas
"I was against the war but I
didn't want to show it by
smashing windows. I felt that
the university should be open,
that it should be a place for the
free exchange of ideas," he

added.
"I can't imagine the univer
sity striking for any length of
time, unless the institution or
the country were threatened."
On the dismissal of English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin in
January 1972, Wright said, "He
was never touched for any
thing he said, only for what he
did." Franklin was an active
participant in student protests
in 1972.
"Bruce Franklin could have
said anything he wanted to and
nobody would have touched
him — trustees, administra
tion, alumni — nobody," he
added.
Reflecting on the years of
student activism, Wright said,
"I don't think the experience
was healthy or constructive. It
created a kind of negative at
titude to authority that we still
have now, a kind of cynicism."
Social change difficult
He said his own political
views were not changed by the
experience, although he has
become less optimistic about
the possibilities of peaceful
change.
"Social change is not an easy
thing to accomplish," he re
marked. "It takes constant vigi
lance and any kind of social ac
tion comes from a small minor
ity — like Stanford people —
which is why it is such a plea
sure to be here."
Wright first came to Stanford
as a graduate student in the late
'30s.
"Admissions were easier
then and rich students tended
to get in. Stanford generally
catered to upper-middle class
California," he recalled.
The day Hitler invaded Rus
sia, Wright moved up to
Eugene to teach at the Univer
sity of Oregon, before joining

the State Department in 1943.
He served as a foreign ser
vice officer in Paris during the
years just following the libera
tion.
"I had a lot of youthful illu
sions of influencing the
world's future, but then what
we did was pretty darned im
portant," he said.
Paris
The Paris he lived and
worked in was a "grim place,"
with the economy in ruin and
fears of a fascist or Communist
coup.
"We had an obligation to
help get Western Europe back
on its feet — to encourage so
cial justice if we could. Some
conservatives wanted to resur
rect the old right-wing, but our
real policy was to encourage
democratic socialism," Wright
said.
"I don't think they could
have gotten through it without
us."
Reflecting on the Cold War,
which was in its infancy then,
Wright said, "The rift between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. de
veloped from 1944 on. America
hoped to prevent it, but we
were very cautious.
"Differences in values were
bound to bring on a clash. I
don't think we could easily
co-exist in a world where Sta
lin's values were leading a
great power," he added.
Building up
In 1947, Wright went back to
Oregon to teach and provide a
better environment to raise his
sons. In 1957 he returned to
Stanford as a history professor.
Stanford's history depart
ment was improving rapidly in
the '50s, he said.
"We built a very good de
partment," said Wright. "We
were able to bring in some

good, young people — and a
few stars — back in those days
when money was around."
Wright earned a reputation
as a superb scholar, teacher
and administrator. He was de
partment chairman for six
years. His teaching and writing
style is described by one of his
colleagues as "elegantly sim
ple."
One student, Bob Fikso, re
marked, "He exudes great
scholarship, but otherwise he
comes across as nice as the guy
next door."
Wright is acutely aware of his
responsibilities as an educator.
"I admit it's sometimes tough
for a liberal teacher teaching
that the truth isn't all in one
place," he said.
Liberal's dilemma
"But a teacher should give
the students many sides of the
story, and I guess a liberal can
be accused of hypocritically
indoctrinating in that sense."
Wright was responsible for
starting the university's first
undergraduate colloquium
back in the early '60s, and he
said the rise in small group
courses over the years has
been good for the school.
"I think more education
takes place in small groups
than in big lectures," he said.

policy, Wright said he doesn't
think it is as different from Kis

sity striking for any length of
time, unless the institution or
the country were threatened."
On the dismissal of English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin in
January 1972, Wright said, "He
was never touched for any
thing he said, only for what he
did." Franklin was an active
participant in student protests
in 1972.
"Bruce Franklin could have
said anything he wanted to and
nobody would have touched
him — trustees, administra
tion, alumni — nobody," he
added.
Reflecting on the years of
student activism, Wright said,
"I don't think the experience
was healthy or constructive. It
created a kind of negative at
titude to authority that we still
have now, a kind of cynicism."
Social change difficult
He said his own political
views were not changed by the
experience, although he has
become less optimistic about
the possibilities of peaceful
change.
"Social change is not an easy
thing to accomplish," he re
marked. "It takes constant vigi
lance and any kind of social ac
tion comes from a small minor
ity — like Stanford people —
which is why it is such a plea
sure to be here."
Wright first came to Stanford
as a graduate student in the late
'30s.
"Admissions were easier
then and rich students tended
to get in. Stanford generally
catered to upper-middle class
California," he recalled.
The day Hitler invaded Rus
sia, Wright moved up to
Eugene to teach at the Univer
sity of Oregon, before joining

the State Department in 1943.
He served as a foreign ser
vice officer in Paris during the
years just following the libera
tion.
"I had a lot of youthful illu
sions of influencing the
world's future, but then what
we did was pretty darned im
portant," he said.
Paris
The Paris he lived and
worked in was a "grim place,"
with the economy in ruin and
fears of a fascist or Communist
coup.
"We had an obligation to
help get Western Europe back
on its feet — to encourage so
cial justice if we could. Some
conservatives wanted to resur
rect the old right-wing, but our
real policy was to encourage
democratic socialism," Wright
said.
"I don't think they could
have gotten through it without
us."
Reflecting on the Cold War,
which was in its infancy then,
Wright said, "The rift between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. de
veloped from 1944 on. America
hoped to prevent it, but we
were very cautious.
"Differences in values were
bound to bring on a clash. I
don't think we could easily
co-exist in a world where Sta
lin's values were leading a
great power," he added.
Building up
In 1947, Wright went back to
Oregon to teach and provide a
better environment to raise his
sons. In 1957 he returned to
Stanford as a history professor.
Stanford's history depart
ment was improving rapidly in
the '50s, he said.
"We built a very good de
partment," said Wright. "We
were able to bring in some

good, young people — and a
few stars — back in those days
when money was around."
Wright earned a reputation
as a superb scholar, teacher
and administrator. He was de
partment chairman for six
years. His teaching and writing
style is described by one of his
colleagues as "elegantly sim
ple."
One student, Bob Fikso, re
marked, "He exudes great
scholarship, but otherwise he
comes across as nice as the guy
next door."
Wright is acutely aware of his
responsibilities as an educator.
"I admit it's sometimes tough
for a liberal teacher teaching
that the truth isn't all in one
place," he said.
Liberal's dilemma
"But a teacher should give
the students many sides of the
story, and I guess a liberal can
be accused of hypocritically
indoctrinating in that sense."
Wright was responsible for
starting the university's first
undergraduate colloquium
back in the early '60s, and he
said the rise in small group
courses over the years has
been good for the school.
"I think more education
takes place in small groups
than in big lectures," he said.
Evaluating Carter's foreign
policy, Wright said he doesn't
think it is as different from Kis
singer's policies as it may
seem.
"Carter's emphasis on
human rights is the biggest pol
icy change," he said.
"I lean toward it; it fits my
values. We ought to stand up
for our beliefs and say it, and if
the Russians don't like, that's
fine, I don't like them much
either."
Wright said he opposed the
California Supreme Court's
decision in the Bakke case, but
acknowledged the complexity
of the problem.
"If you want to be absolutely
logical, then discrimination is
always bad. But it seems some
people in our society have to
start with a twenty yard hand
icap, and society has the right
to try and correct that hand
icap," he said.
Looking to Western Europe,
Wright said he doubts that the
left will gain power in France in
the immediate future, and sees
Eurocommunism gradually in
creasing its independence
from the Soviet Union.
"I think the Communist
movement is going to change
over time, in Russia and with
out," he said. "It will be a
change for the better, an open
ing up of the system."
"Some European Com
munists are beginning to
realize there are flaws in all sys
tems and are looking critically
at themselves, and that's
good," he added.
Wright intends to complete
this quarter, then teach a
semester at Arizona State Uni
versity. Next year he plans to
teach at William and Mary Col
lege in Virginia.
