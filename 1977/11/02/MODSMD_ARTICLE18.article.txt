# Volleyball team thrashes USF; hosts Broncos
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
The women's volleyball
team added another win to
its 1977 season total Monday
night as the Cardinals
over-powered the Univer
sity of San Francisco in three
straight games 15-4, 15-4
and 15-7 in Maples Pavilion.
Freshmen Sherry Norman
and Chris Anderson led the
Cardinal attack, each play
ing an outstanding match.
In the first game, with
Stanford leading 2-1, the
Cards took possession of
the ball and Sherry Norman
served nine straight points.
All of a sudden Stanford was
sitting on top of a 10-point
lead with no way they could
possibly lose. They went on
to win the first contest 15-4,
and the following two were
no tougher.
"It wasn't much of a con
test," said Stanford coach
Art Lambert, making refer
ences to the nine straight
points. "We didn't get a
chance to work on our de
fense very much," said
Lambert. "However, we
were able to work on our
serves," he added.
Stanford plays Santa Clara

tonight at 8 p.m. in Maples,
but both Lambert and the
team members are looking
past tonight's game since
Santa Clara is perhaps the
worst team in the league.
(Santa Clara recently lost a
tough match to USF in five
games.) Instead, they're
looking forward to this
weekend's matches at the
UCLA Invitational.
"We think we can do
pretty well (this weekend),"
said Lambert, receiving a
nod of approval from assis
tant coach Fred Sturm, "but
we don't know if the girls
think that way." Lambert
added, "If we play at the
level we're capable of play
ing, we could do extremely
well."
Twenty-four teams, in
pools of six each, from all
over the nation will be com
peting in the tournament.
Stanford has been placed in
the top pool along with
UCLA, Arizona, Michigan
State, Southwest Missouri
and UC-Riverside.
The top two teams from
each of the four pools will
play in a single-elimination
competition beginning at
3:45 p.m. on Saturday.

In the first game, with
Stanford leading 2-1, the
Cards took possession of
the ball and Sherry Norman
served nine straight points.
All of a sudden Stanford was
sitting on top of a 10-point
lead with no way they could
possibly lose. They went on
to win the first contest 15-4,
and the following two were
no tougher.
"It wasn't much of a con
test," said Stanford coach
Art Lambert, making refer
ences to the nine straight
points. "We didn't get a
chance to work on our de
fense very much," said
Lambert. "However, we
were able to work on our
serves," he added.
Stanford plays Santa Clara

tonight at 8 p.m. in Maples,
but both Lambert and the
team members are looking
past tonight's game since
Santa Clara is perhaps the
worst team in the league.
(Santa Clara recently lost a
tough match to USF in five
games.) Instead, they're
looking forward to this
weekend's matches at the
UCLA Invitational.
"We think we can do
pretty well (this weekend),"
said Lambert, receiving a
nod of approval from assis
tant coach Fred Sturm, "but
we don't know if the girls
think that way." Lambert
added, "If we play at the
level we're capable of play
ing, we could do extremely
well."
Twenty-four teams, in
pools of six each, from all
over the nation will be com
peting in the tournament.
Stanford has been placed in
the top pool along with
UCLA, Arizona, Michigan
State, Southwest Missouri
and UC-Riverside.
The top two teams from
each of the four pools will
play in a single-elimination
competition beginning at
3:45 p.m. on Saturday.
