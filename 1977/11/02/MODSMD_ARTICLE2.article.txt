# Social Security bill may increase tuition

Tuition may increase here because
of a bill currently before the U.S. Se
nate which would triple Social Sec
urity taxes in 10 years, according to
Director of Government Relations
Robert Freelan.
The bill passed the House last
Thursday and is now being consi
dered in the Senate.
"There are several variations of the
bill right now, so it's difficult to tell
what the immediate effects will be,"
Freelen explained. "However, there
is no question that there will be a
Social Security tax increase, and that
it will be a large increase. The ques
tion is whether the large increase will
be put into effect this year."
Stanford paid $6,708,000 in Social
Security taxes last year, said Ray Bac
chetti, vice provost for budget and
planning. Hew much more the Uni
versity will have to pay depends on
how great the increase is, and
whether Congress will maintain par
ity — that is, the present system of
equal payment by employer and
employe, Bacchetti said
Where will the University get the

extra money? "The money is not
likely to come from gifts or endow
ments," Freelan said. Those funds
are used for buildings and land de
velopment. Government grants are
used by the various departments to
offset the costs. That leaves only one
other source — tuition. And tuition
will be affected even more if parity is
not maintained, Freelan said.
Bacchetti gave a different view. "A
tax increase has a slight effect when
spread across the entire University
budget. We don't relate a particular
expense to a particular source of
funds, so it doesn't necessarily fol
low that if taxes go up, tuition must
also increase.
"We have a number of options
since we don't operate under pass
through pricing — that is, extending
cost increases directly to the cus
tomer, or, in this case, the student.
"We could cut expenses
elsewhere, mitigate the costs, or ob
tain money from sources other than
tuition. It is important to keep in
mind that these taxes are only one
factor in the entire University
budget."
