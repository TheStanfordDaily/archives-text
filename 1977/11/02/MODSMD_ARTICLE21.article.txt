# Benjamin earns Pac-8 honor
## Walsh plots against impregnable Troy 
### David Georgette 
How do you defeat a football
team that, according to Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh, doesn't
have any weaknesses?
That's the problem Walsh
and his coaching staff face this
week in preparing the Cardi
nals for their most important
game of the year Saturday
against USC in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
The Cards, who are ranked
18th in the UPI Coaches Poll
this week, are 4-1 and lead the
Pacific-8. USC is in a three-way
tie for second at 3-1.
The least difficult way (there
is no easy way) to upend the
Trojans is for them to lend a
hand. And that is what Walsh is
hoping will happen. "We have
to play our best, then allow for
errors on their part, and we'll
have a chance," Walsh told the
Bay Area sports media Mon
day.
The Trojans have been less
than perfect recently. Three
losses in their last four games,
including Saturday's 17-14
streetfight loss against Califor
nia, have left the men of Troy
with a 5-3 record, which ac
cording to 'SC standards qual
ifies for national disaster
status.
"Anytimeyou lose," said 'SC
coach John Robinson, "you
start asking what's wrong."
Against the Bears, it was the
'SC offense that was out of
synch. "We don't have much
offensive rhythm," said Robin
son, citing the "seeming inabil
ity for us to convert any third
down situations."
Senior Randy Simmrin, one
of the Trojans' top receivers,
"can't catch a cold right now,"
Robinson said.
Still tough
Despite the Trojans' prob
lems, Walsh said 'SC is
the "No. 1 Rose Bowl conten
der. They're still capable of
beating anyone in the country
by a big score."
Stanford's defensive per
formance against Oregon State
offers some hope that the
Cards might be able to contain
the Trojans. "Our defense
played its best game of the sea

son," Walsh said. "Robby
Chapman, our free safety,
played extremely well for a
freshman."
Offensively for the Cards,
quarterback Guy Benjamin's 17
for 29 passing effort and three
scoring passes earned him
Pac-8 Offensive Player of the
Week honors.
"He played a great game,"
said Beaver coach Craig Fertig.
"It seems we've sepn a lot of
good quarterbacks, but Ben
jamin is special. I really
thought the weather would
bother him but he handled it
extremely well. In my mind,
he's deserving of the Heisman
Trophy."
Teams with Heisman Trophy
winners are attractive to post
season bowl officials and rep
resentatives of the Liberty Bowl
will be at the Coliseum. But
Walsh said, "We're not talking
about bowl bids. You're not a
bowl team until someone in
vites you."
Striped-shirt presence
Walsh is more concerned
with the presence of another
kind of official — the striped
shirt ones — in the Coliseum.
"I hope the officials in our
game against USC will partici
pate," said Walsh in the wake
of the fourth-quarter fight and
charges of cheap shots follow
ing the USC-Cal game. "There
were some incidents in Ber
keley that are not in the best
interests of college football,"
said Walsh.
Ralph DeLoach, the Cal de
fensive end who lined up
against tight end Bill Gay and
disrupted the Trojans' run
blocking, said, "We've played
aggressive defense all season.

That's the way we've been
coached. Our defensive backs
applied physical and mental
pressure."
It was one of Cal's defensive
backs — Anthony Washington
— who was involved in the
bench-emptying brawl. De-
Loach said he and Washington
tackled 'SC's Charles White
and the trio ended out of
bounds.
White shoved Washington
when he thought the defensive
back wasn't getting off him fast
enough, DeLoach said, "and
Anthony hit him, which is
wrong — in front of their
bench. It was an unfortunate
thing, but tempers flare in an

emotional game.
"We ended up winning, and
they were crying about cheap
shots," said DeLoach. "I just
think that's the type of people
they have down there."
Bowl picture
Regardless of what type of
people they have down there,
USC is the only team of the five
Rose Bowl contenders which
can win the trip to Pasadena
without help from someone
else. Should they win their re
maining games against Stan
ford, Washington and UCLA,
the Trojans will be back in
Pasadena for the eighth time in
11 years.
However, they do not have

much margin for error. A loss
to the Cards would eliminate
the Trojans from Rose Bowl
picture.
The remaining schedule
favors UCLA, who faces only
one of the contenders. For the
Washington Huskies to make
their first Rose Bowl appear
ance since 1964, they will have
to win at Cal Saturday, then
beat USC and Washington
State in Seattle while UCLA
loses to someone.
Cal's chances of making it
are about the same as Tampa
Bay finishing at .500 this sea
son.
And Stanford? Well, first the
Cards have to win Saturday.
