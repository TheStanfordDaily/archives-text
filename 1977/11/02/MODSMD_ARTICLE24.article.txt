Carter withdraws U.S. from ILO
Washington — President Jimmy Carter pulled the Un
ited States out of the International Labor Organization
(ILO) yesterday, marking the first U.S. withdrawal from a
United Nations agency since the world organization was
founded in 1945.
ILO critics contended the organization has increas
ingly fallen under Soviet and Third World domination.
As he was withdrawing U.S. support from the ILO,
Carter criticized the United Nations sharply for a "dis
appointing" record on human rights, but he pledged his
full support to the world organization.
The ILO is a U.N. agency aimed at improving world
labor conditions, living standards and economic and
social stability. The agency has been a main source of
statistics on hours, pay and labor safety.
In recent years, it set up technical training courses in
former colonial areas of Africa and Asia. It received the
Nobel Peace Prize on its 50th anniversary in 1959.
Carter's decision will weaken the ILO. The U.S. con
tribution to the ILO has been $20 million a year, about
one-fourth of its budget.i
AFL-CIO President George Meany, who told reporters
about Carter's decision before it was announced, said
he was not particularly pleased that it had to be made.
But he said it will have no practical effect on the United
States.
Two opinions urged before surgery
Washington — The Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) Department, saying there is an increasing
amount of unnecessary surgery, yesterday urged the
public to get a second doctor's opinion before undergo
ing elective surgery.
The department also said it would urge all states to
quickly begin allowing — and paying for — second opin
ion consultations for low-income patients in state
administered Medicaid programs. And it said it would
pay for second opinions on surgery requested by elderly
patients in Medicare programs.
HEW Undersecretary Hale Champion, testifying be
fore a House commerce subcommittee, said one of the
reasons for the increasing amounts of unnecessary
surgery is because "there are many thousands more
surgeons" than we need in the United States.
He advised the public to get second opinions on elec

tive surgery, especially tonsillectomies, hysterectomies
and gall-bladder removals.
Champion said the overall rate of surgery in the nation
increased by 23 per cent between 1970 and 1975. Specifi
cally, the rate for hysterectomy increased 35 per cent;
for prostatectomy — removal of the prostate gland —18
per cent; and for cholecystectomy 17 per cent.
Israeli workers continue strikes
Tel Aviv — Thousands of workers staged a third day of
strikes yesterday as the government's sweeping
economic changes, taking full effect, raised Israelis'
food prices 15 per cent. •
The measures are designed to invite foreign invest
ment, reverse a trade deficit and, in the long run, reduce
inflation.
More than 70,000 workers walked off their jobs in
Haifa, closing the port for a day and shutting down
factories and government offices half a day. Other
workers struck in suburban Tel Aviv, the southern town
of Ashquelon and in several industrial areas of the north.
Labor leaders have called for immediate compensa
tion for the new economic policy, which the govern
ment said would raise overall living costs 10 per cent
within five months. But the 1.1 million member Histad
rut labor federation has made no formal wage demands.
Prime Minister Menahem Begin's five-month-old con
servative government won parliamentary approval yes
terday for its weekend measures ending subsidies for
basic commodities, floating the pound, allowing Israelis
to buy foreign currency, eliminating some sales taxes
and raising the value-added tax from eight to 12 per cent.
Senate debates Social Security hike
Washington — The Senate began debate yesterday on
a Social Security financing bill that would more than
double the maximum payroll tax paid by employes by
1986.
Unlike a measure passed by the House last week, the
bill would, for the first time, require employers to pay a
greater share of Social Security taxes than is paid by
workers.
The bill is aimed at shoring up the Social Security
system, whose financial health is threatened by some
overly generous benefits, a declining birth rate and high
unemployment.

The Senate Finance Committee gave final approval to
the bill earlier in the day, and Senate leaders hope to
pass the bill this week.
The current maximum annual Social Security tax paid
by a worker is $965. The employer matches that for each
employe earning $16,500 or more. When increases al
ready scheduled under current law are added in, the
committee bill would raise that maximum to $1525 in
1981, $1684 in 1982, $2121 in 1985 and $2263 in 1986.
An employer, however, would see his maximum tax
per employe jump from $965 to $3068 in 1979, and to
$5250 in 1985.
Conferees act on energy bill
Washington — A House-Senate energy conference
committee voted tentatively yesterday to ban most new
power plants from burning either oil or natural gas.
Similar provisions have been approved by both cham
bers as part of President Jimmy Carter's plan to force
industries to convert to coal.
The prohibition likely would be coupled with a tax on
at least some use of these scarce fuels by existing power
plants and factories. Such a tax also has been passed by
both chambers.
The conference committee took up the coal parts of
the president's energy program after completing action
on a wide variety of energy conservation measures.
Although readily agreeing to the proposed oil and gas
ban on new power plants — generally those built after
last April 20 — the conferees still must resolve differ
ences on what to do about existing plants that use these
fuels.
The House-passed bill contains tougher non-tax pro
visions aimed at forcing such plants to convert to coal
than does the Senate version.
Conferees failed again to agree on how to deal with
cars that give poor fuel economy. The Senate voted to
ban, beginning in 1980, cars getting less than 16 miles to
a gallon of gasoline. The House passed the president's
proposed tax on fuel-wasting vehicles.
Soviets enter supersonic age
Moscow — The Soviet Union entered the era of super
sonic travel yesterday with the first passenger flight of
the Tu-144, the much-delayed Soviet answer to the

British-French Concorde.
The droop-nosed 140-seat liner, which strongly re
sembles the Concorde in outer appearance, took two
hours and two minutes to fly a special delegation of
reporters and Soviet VIPs from Moscow to Alma Ata in
Soviet Central Asia, 1992 miles away. The plane then
returned with its passengers to Moscow.
The Concorde, once expected to trail the Soviet plane
into service, made its first passenger flight 21 months
ago.
Reporters aboard the plane said its layout and facilities
were similar to those aboard other airliners, but that
noise in the cabin was considerable.
The inaugural flight from Moscow's Domtdedovo air
port was smooth after the initial climb, which some
passengers called sharp and abrupt. The plane's transi
tion to its top supersonic speed of 1426 miles per hour
could not be noticed inside the cabin.
The aircraft leveled off at an altitude of 10 miles.
ERA deadline extension possible
Washington — Congress has the authority to extend
the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amend
ment, Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Harmon said
yesterday.
Thirty-five states have ratffied the ERA since Congress
passed it in 1972. Three more states are needed.
Unless Congress extends the deadline or three more
states ratify the amendment by March 22,1979, it will die.
The assistant attorney general testified at a hearing on
whether Congress should extend the deadline another
seven years. He said Congress could change the time
deadline for the ERA by a simple majority vote because
the limit was not contained in the proposed amend
ment, only in the resolution sending the amendment to
the states.
Regarding attempts by Tennessee, Idaho and Neb
raska to withdraw ratification by their state legislatures,
Harmon says that states can only ratify amendments and
cannot change their mind once the action is taken.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local low clouds and
fog this morning. Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs 60s to low
70s.

ERA deadline extension possible
Washington — Congress has the authority to extend
the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amend
ment, Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Harmon said
yesterday.
Thirty-five states have ratffied the ERA since Congress
passed it in 1972. Three more states are needed.
Unless Congress extends the deadline or three more
states ratify the amendment by March 22,1979, it will die.
The assistant attorney general testified at a hearing on
whether Congress should extend the deadline another
seven years. He said Congress could change the time
deadline for the ERA by a simple majority vote because
the limit was not contained in the proposed amend
ment, only in the resolution sending the amendment to
the states.
Regarding attempts by Tennessee, Idaho and Neb
raska to withdraw ratification by their state legislatures,
Harmon says that states can only ratify amendments and
cannot change their mind once the action is taken.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local low clouds and
fog this morning. Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs 60s to low
70s.
Carter withdraws U.S. from ILO
Washington — President Jimmy Carter pulled the Un
ited States out of the International Labor Organization
(ILO) yesterday, marking the first U.S. withdrawal from a
United Nations agency since the world organization was
founded in 1945.
ILO critics contended the organization has increas
ingly fallen under Soviet and Third World domination.
As he was withdrawing U.S. support from the ILO,
Carter criticized the United Nations sharply for a "dis
appointing" record on human rights, but he pledged his
full support to the world organization.
The ILO is a U.N. agency aimed at improving world
labor conditions, living standards and economic and
social stability. The agency has been a main source of
statistics on hours, pay and labor safety.
In recent years, it set up technical training courses in
former colonial areas of Africa and Asia. It received the
Nobel Peace Prize on its 50th anniversary in 1959.
Carter's decision will weaken the ILO. The U.S. con
tribution to the ILO has been $20 million a year, about
one-fourth of its budget.i
AFL-CIO President George Meany, who told reporters
about Carter's decision before it was announced, said
he was not particularly pleased that it had to be made.
But he said it will have no practical effect on the United
States.
Two opinions urged before surgery
Washington — The Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) Department, saying there is an increasing
amount of unnecessary surgery, yesterday urged the
public to get a second doctor's opinion before undergo
ing elective surgery.
The department also said it would urge all states to
quickly begin allowing — and paying for — second opin
ion consultations for low-income patients in state
administered Medicaid programs. And it said it would
pay for second opinions on surgery requested by elderly
patients in Medicare programs.
HEW Undersecretary Hale Champion, testifying be
fore a House commerce subcommittee, said one of the
reasons for the increasing amounts of unnecessary
surgery is because "there are many thousands more
surgeons" than we need in the United States.
He advised the public to get second opinions on elec

tive surgery, especially tonsillectomies, hysterectomies
and gall-bladder removals.
Champion said the overall rate of surgery in the nation
increased by 23 per cent between 1970 and 1975. Specifi
cally, the rate for hysterectomy increased 35 per cent;
for prostatectomy — removal of the prostate gland —18
per cent; and for cholecystectomy 17 per cent.
Israeli workers continue strikes
Tel Aviv — Thousands of workers staged a third day of
strikes yesterday as the government's sweeping
economic changes, taking full effect, raised Israelis'
food prices 15 per cent. •
The measures are designed to invite foreign invest
ment, reverse a trade deficit and, in the long run, reduce
inflation.
More than 70,000 workers walked off their jobs in
Haifa, closing the port for a day and shutting down
factories and government offices half a day. Other
workers struck in suburban Tel Aviv, the southern town
of Ashquelon and in several industrial areas of the north.
Labor leaders have called for immediate compensa
tion for the new economic policy, which the govern
ment said would raise overall living costs 10 per cent
within five months. But the 1.1 million member Histad
rut labor federation has made no formal wage demands.
Prime Minister Menahem Begin's five-month-old con
servative government won parliamentary approval yes
terday for its weekend measures ending subsidies for
basic commodities, floating the pound, allowing Israelis
to buy foreign currency, eliminating some sales taxes
and raising the value-added tax from eight to 12 per cent.
Senate debates Social Security hike
Washington — The Senate began debate yesterday on
a Social Security financing bill that would more than
double the maximum payroll tax paid by employes by
1986.
Unlike a measure passed by the House last week, the
bill would, for the first time, require employers to pay a
greater share of Social Security taxes than is paid by
workers.
The bill is aimed at shoring up the Social Security
system, whose financial health is threatened by some
overly generous benefits, a declining birth rate and high
unemployment.

The Senate Finance Committee gave final approval to
the bill earlier in the day, and Senate leaders hope to
pass the bill this week.
The current maximum annual Social Security tax paid
by a worker is $965. The employer matches that for each
employe earning $16,500 or more. When increases al
ready scheduled under current law are added in, the
committee bill would raise that maximum to $1525 in
1981, $1684 in 1982, $2121 in 1985 and $2263 in 1986.
An employer, however, would see his maximum tax
per employe jump from $965 to $3068 in 1979, and to
$5250 in 1985.
Conferees act on energy bill
Washington — A House-Senate energy conference
committee voted tentatively yesterday to ban most new
power plants from burning either oil or natural gas.
Similar provisions have been approved by both cham
bers as part of President Jimmy Carter's plan to force
industries to convert to coal.
The prohibition likely would be coupled with a tax on
at least some use of these scarce fuels by existing power
plants and factories. Such a tax also has been passed by
both chambers.
The conference committee took up the coal parts of
the president's energy program after completing action
on a wide variety of energy conservation measures.
Although readily agreeing to the proposed oil and gas
ban on new power plants — generally those built after
last April 20 — the conferees still must resolve differ
ences on what to do about existing plants that use these
fuels.
The House-passed bill contains tougher non-tax pro
visions aimed at forcing such plants to convert to coal
than does the Senate version.
Conferees failed again to agree on how to deal with
cars that give poor fuel economy. The Senate voted to
ban, beginning in 1980, cars getting less than 16 miles to
a gallon of gasoline. The House passed the president's
proposed tax on fuel-wasting vehicles.
Soviets enter supersonic age
Moscow — The Soviet Union entered the era of super
sonic travel yesterday with the first passenger flight of
the Tu-144, the much-delayed Soviet answer to the

British-French Concorde.
The droop-nosed 140-seat liner, which strongly re
sembles the Concorde in outer appearance, took two
hours and two minutes to fly a special delegation of
reporters and Soviet VIPs from Moscow to Alma Ata in
Soviet Central Asia, 1992 miles away. The plane then
returned with its passengers to Moscow.
The Concorde, once expected to trail the Soviet plane
into service, made its first passenger flight 21 months
ago.
Reporters aboard the plane said its layout and facilities
were similar to those aboard other airliners, but that
noise in the cabin was considerable.
The inaugural flight from Moscow's Domtdedovo air
port was smooth after the initial climb, which some
passengers called sharp and abrupt. The plane's transi
tion to its top supersonic speed of 1426 miles per hour
could not be noticed inside the cabin.
The aircraft leveled off at an altitude of 10 miles.

Soviets enter supersonic age
Moscow — The Soviet Union entered the era of super
sonic travel yesterday with the first passenger flight of
the Tu-144, the much-delayed Soviet answer to the

British-French Concorde.
The droop-nosed 140-seat liner, which strongly re
sembles the Concorde in outer appearance, took two
hours and two minutes to fly a special delegation of
reporters and Soviet VIPs from Moscow to Alma Ata in
Soviet Central Asia, 1992 miles away. The plane then
returned with its passengers to Moscow.
The Concorde, once expected to trail the Soviet plane
into service, made its first passenger flight 21 months
ago.
Reporters aboard the plane said its layout and facilities
were similar to those aboard other airliners, but that
noise in the cabin was considerable.
The inaugural flight from Moscow's Domtdedovo air
port was smooth after the initial climb, which some
passengers called sharp and abrupt. The plane's transi
tion to its top supersonic speed of 1426 miles per hour
could not be noticed inside the cabin.
The aircraft leveled off at an altitude of 10 miles.
ERA deadline extension possible
Washington — Congress has the authority to extend
the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amend
ment, Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Harmon said
yesterday.
Thirty-five states have ratffied the ERA since Congress
passed it in 1972. Three more states are needed.
Unless Congress extends the deadline or three more
states ratify the amendment by March 22,1979, it will die.
The assistant attorney general testified at a hearing on
whether Congress should extend the deadline another
seven years. He said Congress could change the time
deadline for the ERA by a simple majority vote because
the limit was not contained in the proposed amend
ment, only in the resolution sending the amendment to
the states.
Regarding attempts by Tennessee, Idaho and Neb
raska to withdraw ratification by their state legislatures,
Harmon says that states can only ratify amendments and
cannot change their mind once the action is taken.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local low clouds and
fog this morning. Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs 60s to low
70s.
Carter withdraws U.S. from ILO
Washington — President Jimmy Carter pulled the Un
ited States out of the International Labor Organization
(ILO) yesterday, marking the first U.S. withdrawal from a
United Nations agency since the world organization was
founded in 1945.
ILO critics contended the organization has increas
ingly fallen under Soviet and Third World domination.
As he was withdrawing U.S. support from the ILO,
Carter criticized the United Nations sharply for a "dis
appointing" record on human rights, but he pledged his
full support to the world organization.
The ILO is a U.N. agency aimed at improving world
labor conditions, living standards and economic and
social stability. The agency has been a main source of
statistics on hours, pay and labor safety.
In recent years, it set up technical training courses in
former colonial areas of Africa and Asia. It received the
Nobel Peace Prize on its 50th anniversary in 1959.
Carter's decision will weaken the ILO. The U.S. con
tribution to the ILO has been $20 million a year, about
one-fourth of its budget.i
AFL-CIO President George Meany, who told reporters
about Carter's decision before it was announced, said
he was not particularly pleased that it had to be made.
But he said it will have no practical effect on the United
States.
Two opinions urged before surgery
Washington — The Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) Department, saying there is an increasing
amount of unnecessary surgery, yesterday urged the
public to get a second doctor's opinion before undergo
ing elective surgery.
The department also said it would urge all states to
quickly begin allowing — and paying for — second opin
ion consultations for low-income patients in state
administered Medicaid programs. And it said it would
pay for second opinions on surgery requested by elderly
patients in Medicare programs.
HEW Undersecretary Hale Champion, testifying be
fore a House commerce subcommittee, said one of the
reasons for the increasing amounts of unnecessary
surgery is because "there are many thousands more
surgeons" than we need in the United States.
He advised the public to get second opinions on elec

tive surgery, especially tonsillectomies, hysterectomies
and gall-bladder removals.
Champion said the overall rate of surgery in the nation
increased by 23 per cent between 1970 and 1975. Specifi
cally, the rate for hysterectomy increased 35 per cent;
for prostatectomy — removal of the prostate gland —18
per cent; and for cholecystectomy 17 per cent.
Israeli workers continue strikes
Tel Aviv — Thousands of workers staged a third day of
strikes yesterday as the government's sweeping
economic changes, taking full effect, raised Israelis'
food prices 15 per cent. •
The measures are designed to invite foreign invest
ment, reverse a trade deficit and, in the long run, reduce
inflation.
More than 70,000 workers walked off their jobs in
Haifa, closing the port for a day and shutting down
factories and government offices half a day. Other
workers struck in suburban Tel Aviv, the southern town
of Ashquelon and in several industrial areas of the north.
Labor leaders have called for immediate compensa
tion for the new economic policy, which the govern
ment said would raise overall living costs 10 per cent
within five months. But the 1.1 million member Histad
rut labor federation has made no formal wage demands.
Prime Minister Menahem Begin's five-month-old con
servative government won parliamentary approval yes
terday for its weekend measures ending subsidies for
basic commodities, floating the pound, allowing Israelis
to buy foreign currency, eliminating some sales taxes
and raising the value-added tax from eight to 12 per cent.
Senate debates Social Security hike
Washington — The Senate began debate yesterday on
a Social Security financing bill that would more than
double the maximum payroll tax paid by employes by
1986.
Unlike a measure passed by the House last week, the
bill would, for the first time, require employers to pay a
greater share of Social Security taxes than is paid by
workers.
The bill is aimed at shoring up the Social Security
system, whose financial health is threatened by some
overly generous benefits, a declining birth rate and high
unemployment.

The Senate Finance Committee gave final approval to
the bill earlier in the day, and Senate leaders hope to
pass the bill this week.
The current maximum annual Social Security tax paid
by a worker is $965. The employer matches that for each
employe earning $16,500 or more. When increases al
ready scheduled under current law are added in, the
committee bill would raise that maximum to $1525 in
1981, $1684 in 1982, $2121 in 1985 and $2263 in 1986.
An employer, however, would see his maximum tax
per employe jump from $965 to $3068 in 1979, and to
$5250 in 1985.
Conferees act on energy bill
Washington — A House-Senate energy conference
committee voted tentatively yesterday to ban most new
power plants from burning either oil or natural gas.
Similar provisions have been approved by both cham
bers as part of President Jimmy Carter's plan to force
industries to convert to coal.
The prohibition likely would be coupled with a tax on
at least some use of these scarce fuels by existing power
plants and factories. Such a tax also has been passed by
both chambers.
The conference committee took up the coal parts of
the president's energy program after completing action
on a wide variety of energy conservation measures.
Although readily agreeing to the proposed oil and gas
ban on new power plants — generally those built after
last April 20 — the conferees still must resolve differ
ences on what to do about existing plants that use these
fuels.
The House-passed bill contains tougher non-tax pro
visions aimed at forcing such plants to convert to coal
than does the Senate version.
Conferees failed again to agree on how to deal with
cars that give poor fuel economy. The Senate voted to
ban, beginning in 1980, cars getting less than 16 miles to
a gallon of gasoline. The House passed the president's
proposed tax on fuel-wasting vehicles.

per employe jump from $965 to $3068 in 1979, and to
$5250 in 1985.
Conferees act on energy bill
Washington — A House-Senate energy conference
committee voted tentatively yesterday to ban most new
power plants from burning either oil or natural gas.
Similar provisions have been approved by both cham
bers as part of President Jimmy Carter's plan to force
industries to convert to coal.
The prohibition likely would be coupled with a tax on
at least some use of these scarce fuels by existing power
plants and factories. Such a tax also has been passed by
both chambers.
The conference committee took up the coal parts of
the president's energy program after completing action
on a wide variety of energy conservation measures.
Although readily agreeing to the proposed oil and gas
ban on new power plants — generally those built after
last April 20 — the conferees still must resolve differ
ences on what to do about existing plants that use these
fuels.
The House-passed bill contains tougher non-tax pro
visions aimed at forcing such plants to convert to coal
than does the Senate version.
Conferees failed again to agree on how to deal with
cars that give poor fuel economy. The Senate voted to
ban, beginning in 1980, cars getting less than 16 miles to
a gallon of gasoline. The House passed the president's
proposed tax on fuel-wasting vehicles.
Soviets enter supersonic age
Moscow — The Soviet Union entered the era of super
sonic travel yesterday with the first passenger flight of
the Tu-144, the much-delayed Soviet answer to the

British-French Concorde.
The droop-nosed 140-seat liner, which strongly re
sembles the Concorde in outer appearance, took two
hours and two minutes to fly a special delegation of
reporters and Soviet VIPs from Moscow to Alma Ata in
Soviet Central Asia, 1992 miles away. The plane then
returned with its passengers to Moscow.
The Concorde, once expected to trail the Soviet plane
into service, made its first passenger flight 21 months
ago.
Reporters aboard the plane said its layout and facilities
were similar to those aboard other airliners, but that
noise in the cabin was considerable.
The inaugural flight from Moscow's Domtdedovo air
port was smooth after the initial climb, which some
passengers called sharp and abrupt. The plane's transi
tion to its top supersonic speed of 1426 miles per hour
could not be noticed inside the cabin.
The aircraft leveled off at an altitude of 10 miles.
ERA deadline extension possible
Washington — Congress has the authority to extend
the deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amend
ment, Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Harmon said
yesterday.
Thirty-five states have ratffied the ERA since Congress
passed it in 1972. Three more states are needed.
Unless Congress extends the deadline or three more
states ratify the amendment by March 22,1979, it will die.
The assistant attorney general testified at a hearing on
whether Congress should extend the deadline another
seven years. He said Congress could change the time
deadline for the ERA by a simple majority vote because
the limit was not contained in the proposed amend
ment, only in the resolution sending the amendment to
the states.
Regarding attempts by Tennessee, Idaho and Neb
raska to withdraw ratification by their state legislatures,
Harmon says that states can only ratify amendments and
cannot change their mind once the action is taken.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except local low clouds and
fog this morning. Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs 60s to low
70s.
Carter withdraws U.S. from ILO
Washington — President Jimmy Carter pulled the Un
ited States out of the International Labor Organization
(ILO) yesterday, marking the first U.S. withdrawal from a
United Nations agency since the world organization was
founded in 1945.
ILO critics contended the organization has increas
ingly fallen under Soviet and Third World domination.
As he was withdrawing U.S. support from the ILO,
Carter criticized the United Nations sharply for a "dis
appointing" record on human rights, but he pledged his
full support to the world organization.
The ILO is a U.N. agency aimed at improving world
labor conditions, living standards and economic and
social stability. The agency has been a main source of
statistics on hours, pay and labor safety.
In recent years, it set up technical training courses in
former colonial areas of Africa and Asia. It received the
Nobel Peace Prize on its 50th anniversary in 1959.
Carter's decision will weaken the ILO. The U.S. con
tribution to the ILO has been $20 million a year, about
one-fourth of its budget.i
AFL-CIO President George Meany, who told reporters
about Carter's decision before it was announced, said
he was not particularly pleased that it had to be made.
But he said it will have no practical effect on the United
States.
Two opinions urged before surgery
Washington — The Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) Department, saying there is an increasing
amount of unnecessary surgery, yesterday urged the
public to get a second doctor's opinion before undergo
ing elective surgery.
The department also said it would urge all states to
quickly begin allowing — and paying for — second opin
ion consultations for low-income patients in state
administered Medicaid programs. And it said it would
pay for second opinions on surgery requested by elderly
patients in Medicare programs.
HEW Undersecretary Hale Champion, testifying be
fore a House commerce subcommittee, said one of the
reasons for the increasing amounts of unnecessary
surgery is because "there are many thousands more
surgeons" than we need in the United States.
He advised the public to get second opinions on elec

tive surgery, especially tonsillectomies, hysterectomies
and gall-bladder removals.
Champion said the overall rate of surgery in the nation
increased by 23 per cent between 1970 and 1975. Specifi
cally, the rate for hysterectomy increased 35 per cent;
for prostatectomy — removal of the prostate gland —18
per cent; and for cholecystectomy 17 per cent.
Israeli workers continue strikes
Tel Aviv — Thousands of workers staged a third day of
strikes yesterday as the government's sweeping
economic changes, taking full effect, raised Israelis'
food prices 15 per cent. •
The measures are designed to invite foreign invest
ment, reverse a trade deficit and, in the long run, reduce
inflation.
More than 70,000 workers walked off their jobs in
Haifa, closing the port for a day and shutting down
factories and government offices half a day. Other
workers struck in suburban Tel Aviv, the southern town
of Ashquelon and in several industrial areas of the north.
Labor leaders have called for immediate compensa
tion for the new economic policy, which the govern
ment said would raise overall living costs 10 per cent
within five months. But the 1.1 million member Histad
rut labor federation has made no formal wage demands.
Prime Minister Menahem Begin's five-month-old con
servative government won parliamentary approval yes
terday for its weekend measures ending subsidies for
basic commodities, floating the pound, allowing Israelis
to buy foreign currency, eliminating some sales taxes
and raising the value-added tax from eight to 12 per cent.
Senate debates Social Security hike
Washington — The Senate began debate yesterday on
a Social Security financing bill that would more than
double the maximum payroll tax paid by employes by
1986.
Unlike a measure passed by the House last week, the
bill would, for the first time, require employers to pay a
greater share of Social Security taxes than is paid by
workers.
The bill is aimed at shoring up the Social Security
system, whose financial health is threatened by some
overly generous benefits, a declining birth rate and high
unemployment.

The Senate Finance Committee gave final approval to
the bill earlier in the day, and Senate leaders hope to
pass the bill this week.
The current maximum annual Social Security tax paid
by a worker is $965. The employer matches that for each
employe earning $16,500 or more. When increases al
ready scheduled under current law are added in, the
committee bill would raise that maximum to $1525 in
1981, $1684 in 1982, $2121 in 1985 and $2263 in 1986.
An employer, however, would see his maximum tax
per employe jump from $965 to $3068 in 1979, and to
$5250 in 1985.
