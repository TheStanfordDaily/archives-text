# Massy says divestment cost high

"Complete divestment" of South Africa-related stock
"would cost the University about $800,000 in direct costs
the first year and $5 to $10 million which would be lost
from a disruption of investment strategy," said Vice
President for Business and Finance William Massy yes
terday.
Asked on KZSU's Campus Conference about a policy
of partial divestment, Massy replied that a problem
arises in developing suitable criteria for deciding which
company's stock should be sold. He suggested that the
new Committee on Investment Responsibility might
look into this issue.
If the University sold its stock in corporations invest
ing in South Africa, "I doubt it would have any long run
effect on the value of the stock of these companies,"
Massy said.
Slight improvement
He said the most likely effect of divestment would be a
slight improvement in South African policy, "but not
very much" compared with the cost of divestment for
the University.
"There is also a question whether divestiture would
be legal," he said. Massy cited a UC report which
reached the preliminary conclusion that total divest
ment would be illegal in light of laws governing en
dowed institutions.
Massy was asked how an institution such as the Uni
versity of Massachusetts could divest itself of $682,000 of
South Africa related stock investments that comprised
over 50 per cent of its portfolio.
Stanford has about 37 per cent of its holdings in similar
investments. Massy replied, "We rely far, far more on
returns from our endowment than other institutions."
Massy pointed out that about 60 per cent of the Uni
versity's non-real estate endowment was in stocks. The
other 40 per cent is held in bonds. Pulling out of the
stock market would be "very difficult to justify," said
Massy.
'Consensus'
Another argument against divestment, Massy said,
was a lack of an "intellectual consensus on campus." He
said he found much disagreement here on the effect of

divestment on involved companies and on the question
of partial versus total dfvestment.
Intellectual consensus would be reached, Massy said,
when there was a "considerable intellectual commonal
ity" on these questions. He added that it was "not simply
a matter of counting noses."
Massy reported that the University has sold its J.P.
Stevens stock, and said the decision to sell was based on
normal investment criteria. The University's holdings in
Stevens, a large textile firm, aroused considerable stu
dent protest here last year, including a 60-person sit-in at
the office of Robert Augsburger, then vice president of
business and finance.
Stevens has been convicted of numerous violations of
fair labor laws.
Massy felt no comparison could be drawn between
the University's sale of its Stevens holdings and the
current South Africa issue.

dowed institutions.
Massy was asked how an institution such as the Uni
versity of Massachusetts could divest itself of $682,000 of
South Africa related stock investments that comprised
over 50 per cent of its portfolio.
Stanford has about 37 per cent of its holdings in similar
investments. Massy replied, "We rely far, far more on
returns from our endowment than other institutions."
Massy pointed out that about 60 per cent of the Uni
versity's non-real estate endowment was in stocks. The
other 40 per cent is held in bonds. Pulling out of the
stock market would be "very difficult to justify," said
Massy.
'Consensus'
Another argument against divestment, Massy said,
was a lack of an "intellectual consensus on campus." He
said he found much disagreement here on the effect of

divestment on involved companies and on the question
of partial versus total dfvestment.
Intellectual consensus would be reached, Massy said,
when there was a "considerable intellectual commonal
ity" on these questions. He added that it was "not simply
a matter of counting noses."
Massy reported that the University has sold its J.P.
Stevens stock, and said the decision to sell was based on
normal investment criteria. The University's holdings in
Stevens, a large textile firm, aroused considerable stu
dent protest here last year, including a 60-person sit-in at
the office of Robert Augsburger, then vice president of
business and finance.
Stevens has been convicted of numerous violations of
fair labor laws.
Massy felt no comparison could be drawn between
the University's sale of its Stevens holdings and the
current South Africa issue.

"Complete divestment" of South Africa-related stock
"would cost the University about $800,000 in direct costs
the first year and $5 to $10 million which would be lost
from a disruption of investment strategy," said Vice
President for Business and Finance William Massy yes
terday.
Asked on KZSU's Campus Conference about a policy
of partial divestment, Massy replied that a problem
arises in developing suitable criteria for deciding which
company's stock should be sold. He suggested that the
new Committee on Investment Responsibility might
look into this issue.
If the University sold its stock in corporations invest
ing in South Africa, "I doubt it would have any long run
effect on the value of the stock of these companies,"
Massy said.
Slight improvement
He said the most likely effect of divestment would be a
slight improvement in South African policy, "but not
very much" compared with the cost of divestment for
the University.
"There is also a question whether divestiture would
be legal," he said. Massy cited a UC report which
reached the preliminary conclusion that total divest
ment would be illegal in light of laws governing en
dowed institutions.
