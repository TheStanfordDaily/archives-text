# Senate reverses itself on ERB

### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Senate created an Elec
tions Review Board (ERB) by a vote of
14-1 last night, after rejecting a simi
lar proposal Monday afternoon.
Introduced by Sen. Marvin Ander
son, the proposal was amended sev
eral times before it was adopted.
After passage of the ERB measure,
Pete Wirth, a member of the drive to
recall those undergraduate senators
who did not support the ERB Mon
day, said recall efforts will cease.
Andy Lundberg, another member
of the committee, said 1156 signa
tures had been collected on the peti
tions. Only slightly under 1000 are
needed for a recall election.
Also following* passage of re
view board, Sen. Janet Rappaport
commented on her statement Mon
day of intended resignation.
Rappaport said "grounds far my
resignation are no longer
the senate has seen fit to create an
independent review board to rule on
the disqualification proceedings."
After presenting the proposal,
derson said that "the credibilitjM9T
the senate is at stake . . . recall peti

tions are out . . . the Daily editorials
are full of lies . . . the COP has been
in on this whole charade."
He added that he is "weary of the
muddle,-of the unsubstantiated ac
cusations . . . irresponsible and
cheap journalism of our student
newspaper. . . and not being able to
get on with the business of the duly
elected senate."
Anderson said further that he only
hopes beyond ail hopes that the ERB
can give the senate credibility which
he believes the legislative body now
lacks.
The proposal calls for creation of
an election review board with the full
powers of the senate to address the
alleged irregularities surrounding
last month's senate elections.
The board will be composed of five
voting members, with four votes re
quired to disqualify any senator or
alternate senator. The COP will
nominate members and the senate
will approve them. Findings of the
board will be final, due Nov. 10.
Co-president Greg Larson said re
commendations from Stanford
community at large are welcome at

the COP office, regarding possible
members of the ERB.
Senators Paul Framson and Meriel
Burtle, in statements to the senate,
reversed their positions on the idea
of a review board. Framson said he
thought the recall petitions should
be put away, calling recall an action
"just as rash as the actions they are
intended to remedy." He said he fa
vored a review board.
Burtle said she now regretted her
abstention in Monday's vote, and
that she now supported the creation
of a review board. However, she
added that she felt there was "ample
room for clarification" in Monday's
proposal.
After numerous formal and
friendly amendment's, Anderson's
proposal was voted on. The final
count was 14 yes, one no and one
abstention.
The nay vote came from Sen. How
ard Wolf, who said his reasons for
voting against a review board were;
that it is unconstitutional and he
thought the "senate could have
handled the whole matter last even

ing anyway.
In his statement to the senate, Sen.
Carlyle Kinnison expressed dissatis
faction with the way Elections Com
missioner Sean Murphy handled in
vestigation of the unauthorized in
sertion of the leaflet into the Daily.
Lundberg told the senate he felt
"morally bound" to turn in the peti
tions to the COP, "unless the senate
decides to do something within the
spirit of Monday's resolution."
After the meeting, Barry Parr,
another ad hoc committee member,
said that since the "senate has ac
ceded to the voice of the students" in
creating an independent and impar
tial review board, he and the commit
tee saw no need to turn in the peti
tions.
Near the close of the meeting, Sen.
Tom McCormack commented that
he was "pleased to see the senate
working with each other, and not
beating their heads against the wall."
The meeting, held in Room 75 of
the Graduate School of Business,
drew upward of 50 onlookers, the
most in several years.
