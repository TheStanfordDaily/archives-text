# Minimum wage law signed by Carter

### 
Washington (AP) — President
)immy Carter signed into law yester
day the biggest increase ever in the
minimum wage, requiring most
employers to pay their workers an
annual minimum salary of almost
$7000 by 1981. The current minimum
is $4784.
The law raises the minimum wage
from the current $2.30 an hour to
$2.65 on )an. 1, and then in three
annual steps to $3.35 an hour by )an.
1, 1981. Based on a 40-hour week,
that is $6989 a year.
Carter said it will pump an extra $9
billion into the pockets of America's
low-wage workers, who will "use it
for the necessities of life.
"The impact on our economy will
be very beneficial," the president
said during a brief ceremony in the
White House Rose Garden.
Among the labor and congres
sional leaders on hand were AFL-CIO
President George Meany, Sen. Jen
nings Randolph (D-W.Va.), and Rep.
John Dent (D-Pa.). Each also was
there in 1938 when President
Franklin Roosevelt signed a law es
tablishing the first minimum wage at
25 cents an hour.
Belated action
Carter noted that each time the
minimum wage was increased, it
brought predictions of higher infla
tion and catastrophe for the
economy. But, he added, Congress
nevertheless "acted, perhaps be
latedly, but wisely in each instance"
in raising the federal pay floor.
The Labor Department estimates
that 4.3 million workers would re
ceive increased wages totaling $2.6
billion from the initial 35-cent an

hour increase that becomes effective
Jan. 1.
Subsequent increases will affect
another one million workers at a cost
of $6.3 billion over the following
three years as the minimum wage
rises to $2.90 in 1979, $3.10 in 1980
and $3.35 in 1981.
Farmers included
Farm workers, whose present
minimum is $2.20 an "Hour, will re
ceive the same rate as most other
workers under the new law.
Congress approved the new
minimum wage law Oct. 20, despite
heavy opposition from conservatives
and business. Opponents argued
that the increase would contribute to
inflation and put thousands of
people out of work. But the ad
ministration, aided by labor, civil
rights and other groups, successfully
argued that the higher wage was
needed to lift millions of workers out
of poverty.
The new law increases the number
of small businesses exempted from
the minimum wage law. Now,
businesses with less than $250,000 in
annual gross sales are exempt. This
will rise to $362,000 by Dec. 31, 1982,
removing some 850,000 workers
from minimum wage coverage.

Subsequent increases will affect
another one million workers at a cost
of $6.3 billion over the following
three years as the minimum wage
rises to $2.90 in 1979, $3.10 in 1980
and $3.35 in 1981.

Farm workers, whose present
minimum is $2.20 an "Hour, will re
ceive the same rate as most other
workers under the new law.
Congress approved the new
minimum wage law Oct. 20, despite
heavy opposition from conservatives
and business. Opponents argued
that the increase would contribute to
inflation and put thousands of
people out of work. But the ad
ministration, aided by labor, civil
rights and other groups, successfully
argued that the higher wage was
needed to lift millions of workers out
of poverty.
The new law increases the number
of small businesses exempted from
the minimum wage law. Now,
businesses with less than $250,000 in
annual gross sales are exempt. This
will rise to $362,000 by Dec. 31, 1982,
removing some 850,000 workers
from minimum wage coverage.
Washington (AP) — President
)immy Carter signed into law yester
day the biggest increase ever in the
minimum wage, requiring most
employers to pay their workers an
annual minimum salary of almost
$7000 by 1981. The current minimum
is $4784.
The law raises the minimum wage
from the current $2.30 an hour to
$2.65 on )an. 1, and then in three
annual steps to $3.35 an hour by )an.
1, 1981. Based on a 40-hour week,
that is $6989 a year.
Carter said it will pump an extra $9
billion into the pockets of America's
low-wage workers, who will "use it
for the necessities of life.
"The impact on our economy will
be very beneficial," the president
said during a brief ceremony in the
White House Rose Garden.
Among the labor and congres
sional leaders on hand were AFL-CIO
President George Meany, Sen. Jen
nings Randolph (D-W.Va.), and Rep.
John Dent (D-Pa.). Each also was
there in 1938 when President
Franklin Roosevelt signed a law es
tablishing the first minimum wage at
25 cents an hour.
Belated action
Carter noted that each time the
minimum wage was increased, it
brought predictions of higher infla
tion and catastrophe for the
economy. But, he added, Congress
nevertheless "acted, perhaps be
latedly, but wisely in each instance"
in raising the federal pay floor.
The Labor Department estimates
that 4.3 million workers would re
ceive increased wages totaling $2.6
billion from the initial 35-cent an

hour increase that becomes effective
Jan. 1.
