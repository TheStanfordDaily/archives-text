# $37,000 projected
## Surplus expected at Tresidder 
### Juan Zuniga 
This year's $37,000 projected budget surplus will mean
the second year in a row Tresidder Union has ended up
in the black.
And Director Dan Williams said the financial im
provement will make service improvements possible.
Between 1968 and 1974 Tresidder Union ran an aver
age yearly deficit of $205,000.
"The increase in student use of Tresidder facilities is
one reason for the decrease in the overall deficit," said
Williams.
This year's financial report showed that student ser
vices have gained in overall popularity .'Transactions in
the Tresidder Store, the Transition, Marcel's and the
Coffee House increased from 1.7 t01.85 million from last
year.
1300 meetings
In addition, there were in excess of 1300 meetings and
formal programs scheduled at the Union attended by
approximately 75,000 persons, the report said.
What this means for students is that Tresidder may be
able to increase the quality of its services because its
general operating reserve now totals over $153,000,
compared to $109,500 in 1976-77, according to the re
port.
"Our overall reserve level is now at the point where
we can develop a plan for short and long-term capital
improvements," says Williams.

The principal source of previous deficits was in the
operation of the cafeteria which prior to 1974 was
University-operated. Over half of the total deficit during
1968-74 was attributed to the cafeteria losses.
When business manager Gordon Starr stepped out of
this position, Williams kept the position vacant and filled
in himself for two years in order to learn more about and
act upon this sore spot.
Cutting costs
He said that, in the past, attempts at cutting costs often
ended with the elimination of student services, which in
turn decreased the clientele of the Union.
Williams'approach has been to increase clientele by
improving and adding to the existing services as well as
advertising, having exhibitions and free entertainment.
This year's annual report gives detailed reports on the
progress of each of the union's activities, which include
union programs, community services, student activities
and retail services.
The best financial performer this year was the Tresid
der Store, which ended the year with more than
projected profit estimates. The food service, while still
in the red, came out with a deficit $21,000 lower than
expected. The bowling alley and pinball operations lost
$1165 mainly because of a recent decline in student
interest.
Plans for programming of events in Encina Commons
are now in progress to take advantage of its newly
acquired beer license.

This year's $37,000 projected budget surplus will mean
the second year in a row Tresidder Union has ended up
in the black.
And Director Dan Williams said the financial im
provement will make service improvements possible.
Between 1968 and 1974 Tresidder Union ran an aver
age yearly deficit of $205,000.
"The increase in student use of Tresidder facilities is
one reason for the decrease in the overall deficit," said
Williams.
This year's financial report showed that student ser
vices have gained in overall popularity .'Transactions in
the Tresidder Store, the Transition, Marcel's and the
Coffee House increased from 1.7 t01.85 million from last
year.
1300 meetings
In addition, there were in excess of 1300 meetings and
formal programs scheduled at the Union attended by
approximately 75,000 persons, the report said.
What this means for students is that Tresidder may be
able to increase the quality of its services because its
general operating reserve now totals over $153,000,
compared to $109,500 in 1976-77, according to the re
port.
"Our overall reserve level is now at the point where
we can develop a plan for short and long-term capital
improvements," says Williams.

The principal source of previous deficits was in the
operation of the cafeteria which prior to 1974 was
University-operated. Over half of the total deficit during
1968-74 was attributed to the cafeteria losses.
When business manager Gordon Starr stepped out of
this position, Williams kept the position vacant and filled
in himself for two years in order to learn more about and
act upon this sore spot.
Cutting costs
He said that, in the past, attempts at cutting costs often
ended with the elimination of student services, which in
turn decreased the clientele of the Union.
Williams'approach has been to increase clientele by
improving and adding to the existing services as well as
advertising, having exhibitions and free entertainment.
This year's annual report gives detailed reports on the
progress of each of the union's activities, which include
union programs, community services, student activities
and retail services.
The best financial performer this year was the Tresid
der Store, which ended the year with more than
projected profit estimates. The food service, while still
in the red, came out with a deficit $21,000 lower than
expected. The bowling alley and pinball operations lost
$1165 mainly because of a recent decline in student
interest.
Plans for programming of events in Encina Commons
are now in progress to take advantage of its newly
acquired beer license.
