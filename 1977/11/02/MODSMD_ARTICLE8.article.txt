## Cryptic freedom 
### 
Recently it has come to light that an
employe of the National Security Agency
wrote a letter to an engineering association, in
which he hinted that research of a Stanford
professor and other scholars might endanger
"national security" and be in violation of fed
eral statutes. The professor is researching the
development of codes to protect telephone
conversations and computer information.
The NSA, the member agency of the federal
intelligence community charged with creating
and breaking codes, has denied any respon
sibility for the letter, which the employe al
legedly wrote as a private citizen. Science
magazine has found the person listed in an
NSA directory, but the NSA and the employe
refuse to confirm he is an employe.
We are left with another spy agency denying
any secret attempt to manipulate American
citizens, and a federal employe whoclaims his
letter was written solely due to his good consci

ence and desire to inform people that they
may be violating federal law and policy.
All this sounds rather fishy. And the NSA's
silence offers no reassurance. Once again, we
are faced with the possiblity that an intelli
gence agency was involved in an under
handed, secret attempt to scare citizens by
invoking "national security" claims.
When the NSA denied complicity in this
affair, its denial was so specific it must have
been based upon knowledge of the letter and
its contentions. If this research does endanger
national security and violate federal law con
cerning the exportation of weapons technol
ogy, there are apparently statutes under
which the government can take action.
In the meantime, perhaps the NSA could
issue a more complete statement on this mat
ter, so citizens can exercise rights of academic
freedom and freedom of expression without
the spectre of government coercion hanging
over them.
