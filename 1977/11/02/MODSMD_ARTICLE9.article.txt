# Rights not denied
## Bakke: addressing the facts 
### 
Rodney Johnson

Two columns have appeared in the
Daily since the beginning of the
school year in favor of the Bakke de
cision. But neither has addressed the
facts of the case. Richard Fearon's
article failed not only to address the
facts, but misrepresented what little
truth there was in the article.
The facts behind the Bakke "issue"
are fuel to anti-Bakke sentiment.
Minority communities understand
the implications behind the legal
conflict and realize that in 1977 the
14th Amendment, an amendment
formed in the vein of protecting
minority rights, could now be used
against their interests. The slap in the
face is that Bakke had no legal right to
have his case heard. The facts say that
he was not denied his rights.
The Bakke case presumes that
whites are arbitrarily excluded by
special admissions programs. Not
so. The Davis Medical School prog
ram is designed for economically and
educationally disadvantaged stu
dents.
Some have called the program a
quota system. Aside from the fact
that the American Medical Associa
tion has set a quota — the quota that
actually kept Bakke out of medical
school — the 16 seats set aside rep
resented neither a ceiling nor a floor.
Therefore, the Davis program
doesn't qualify as a quota.
In 1974, 56 nonwhites were admit
ted to the university. Twenty-five of
them were admitted under the regu
lar program and 31 under the special
program. And in two years, one of
the special admissions slots had to be
given back to the regular admissions
program because it couldn't be fil
led.
In addition, not all the students
admitted under the special program
were so-called racial minorities.
Chicanos and native Americans rep
resent cultural, political and ethnic
minorities, not racial minorities.
The media has made it appear that
Bakke was well qualified for admis
sion to medical school. This is
another myth. And Bakke's second
rejection from Davis as well as sub
sequent rejections from schools like
Stanford, should have made that
point clear.
In 1973, the regular admissions
students had an overall grade point
average as low as 2.8. The special
admissions students had averages as
high as 3.7.
In 1974, regular students averaged
as low as 2.7, special students as high
as 3.4.
Allan Bakke charges that he would
be admitted if not for special admis
sions programs. Clearly, this is an
empty, unsupported allegation.
Bakke's rejection from 11 medical
schools may have well been attri
buted to his age. When he applied in
'71, he was 31 years old. Anyone over
30 would have fewer productive
years ahead of him/her as a doctor in
service to the community.
Why didn't Bakke challenge the
admittance of lesser qualified
whites? The East Bay Voice said that

in the year Bakke first applied, 1973,
five persons ranking below Bakke
were admitted to the school on the
order of the Dean, C. John Tupper.
The Voice quoted Peter Storandt,
who now is an associate Dean of Ad
missions at Oberlin College, in
Ohio, as saying that until 1976 the
dean intervened in the admissions
process in five cases annually to
admit lesser-qualified applicants fo.
public relations and other reasons.
The newspaper said that Tupper
admitted a student who didn't even
apply. The student was the son of a
state assemblyman.
The special admissions program at
Davis did not deny equal rights to
Bakke.
The whole and sole function and
effect of such programs is not dis
crimination but equalization. It is to
give people a chance to enjoy educa
tion, jobs, housing and lifestyles that
have be/en, and would continue to
be, denied them without such prog
rams.
There have been noticeable im
provements in racial equalization
over the past two decades, but the
statistics show that we are still far
below the levels expressed by our
verbal commitment to affirmative
action.
Of all the physicians in this coun
try, fewer than three per cent are
black. Fewer than two per cent of all
the lawyers are black . . . less than

one per cent of all the architects are
black. Hardly one per cent of all
people who sell stocks and bonds are
black.
These statistics challenge the fal
lacy of 'reverse discrimination.' It is
absurd to say that people of color
have somehow reversed American
history and it is people of color who
are now in positions of power that
enable them to practice 'reverse dis
crimination.'
America has realized its lack of
responsibility toward minorities in
the U.S. The courts have repeatedly
dealt with the problem of equal
rights and in recent cases find it dif
ficult to rule in favor of preferential
treatment to compensate for cen
turies of maltreatment. Acquiring
equal opportunities has been a
challenge to black Americans from
slavery through the Black Codes, Jim
Crow Laws, Civil Rights Acts, land
mark court decisions and yet un
reached government goals.
Bakke's case questions the validity
and constitutionality of programs
that set aside a certain number of
slots for non-whites. Bakke says he
has been denied his rights because
of such a program.
The facts say "not so."
