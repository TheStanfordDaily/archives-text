U.S. denies arms to South Africa
Washington — The United Sttes is prohibiting
export of military and police equipment to South
Africa and will recall two U.S. Embassy attaches in a
further show of U.S. opposition to Pretoria's
crackdown on dissent.
The announcement yesterday by Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance represents a tightening of an arms em
bargo the United States has observed since 1963 and
an escalation of Carter administration efforts to disas
sociate itself from the white supremist regime.
Vance said the actions "reflect our national con
cern" over South Africa's decision two weeks ago to
ban 18 civil rights groups, to shut down the major
black newspaper and arrest scores of dissident lead
ers both black and white.
On Monday, the United States joined Britain and
France in the United Nations Security Council to veto
proposals by black African nations for sweeping
economic sanctions against South Africa. Vance said
the U.S. veto was based on the belief that there is no
consensus for such action in the Security Council.
The tightened arms embargo will have minimal
practical effect on South Africa. For the past 14 years,
the export of items for use in combat or training by
South African military, paramilitary or police forces
has been banned.
Vance's announcement will affect such "gray area"
items as civil aircraft, computers, radar and com
munications equipment.
Hearst robbery conviction upheld
San Francisco — A federal appeals court yesterday
rejected Patricia Hearst's contention that she failed to
get a fair trial and unanimously upheld her 1976 bank
robbery conviction.
A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals declared the trial judge acted properly in
ordering the newspaper heiress to answer govern
ment questions about her months as a fugitive with
her terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army kidnap
pers.
Social Security reform rejected
Washington — President ji mmy Carter's proposal to
use some income-tax revenues for Social Security
benefits was rejected yesterday by the Senate amid
doubts that Congress will complete work on a
payroll-tax bill this year.
The Senate voted 74-16 against an amendment by
Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) that would have
pumped about $3 billion in income-tax collections
into Social Security over the next five years.
Such use of income-tax money would reduce the
payroll-tax increases that otherwise will be necessary
to keep one part of Social Security from going ban
krupt by early 1979.
By rejecting the use of income-tax money for Social
Security, the Senate left itself little choice but to raise
payroll taxes.

U.S. youth work program begins
Washington — The federal government began its
billion-dollar effort to cut down massive youth un
employment this week by sending the first Young
Adults Conservation Corps workers to wildlife re
fuges and forest areas.
By the end of this year, 7895 youth will be tackling
conservation tasks in urban, park and forest settings,
according to Labor Department officials. 50me22,300
out-of-work young people will be awarded jobs with
the corps by next October.
The corps is a $233.3-million piece of the $1 -billion
youth jobs act that passed Congress this year. Other
major elements of the act are experimental training
and employment programs and community job pro
jects. The overall program is expected to eventually
create more than 300,000 jobs.
Big Soviet wheat sale predicted
Washington — Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland
said yesterday"I wouldn't be surprised" if the Soviet
Union bought up to 15 million metric tons of U.S.
wheat and corn to help make up the unexpected
shortfall in its 1977 harvest.
That would be more than double the amount of
grain Russia is committed to purchase this season
from the United States under a long-term trade ag
reement.
Bergland said he could not predict how much grain
the Soviets actually will buy. In any case, he said, up
to 50 million tons could be sold to the Soviet Union
without endangering domestic supplies.
"The American housewife does not need to worry.
We have more than adequate stocks of grain on
hand," Bergland said. "So we can easily meet what
ever Russian demands there may be without devastat
ing impact to the consumers."
The prospect of larger sales, he said, "probably will
bring prices up somewhat to the producer" without
triggering higher consumer prices. "And that is wel
come news because grain prices have been below the
cost of production," Bergland said.
Anti-gay teacher initiative stands
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court yes
terday denied a request to declare the title and sum
mary of an anti-gay teachers' initiative invalid on
grounds it failed to comply with the law.
Despite the ruling, the controversy appears muted
for the time being. That's because state Sen. John
Briggs (R-Fullerton), author of the initiative, said
Tuesday petitions in circulation omitted a required
phrase and he will now have to try to get the measure
on the ballot next November rather than June.
The petition was filed last month by David
Goldman of San Francisco, who described himself as
a taxpayer and a certified teacher "whose economic
security and constitutional rights are endangered by
circulation of the petition under the misleading title
and summary."
The initiative, if approved by voters, would prohibit
hiring and require the dismissal of any teacher or

other school employe who had engaged in a "public
homosexual act" or had "engaged in advocating, sol
iciting, imposing, encouraging or promoting of pri
vate or public homosexual acts directed at or likely to
come to the attention of school children and other
employes."
Compromise on saccharin bill
Washington — A compromise bill requiring cancer
warnings on food and drinks containing saccharin
was approved by a House-Senate conference com
mittee yesterday.
The compromise, which will be sent to the House
and Senate for final approval, also prohibits the Food
and Drug Administration from banning the artificial
sweetener, at least for the next 18 months.
Rep. Paul Rogers (D-Fla.), a member of the confer
ence panel, said he expects final passage of the legis
lation by the end of the week.
The compromise bill would require that saccharin
food products in interstate commerce must bear this
warning:
"Use of this product may be hazardous to your
health. This product contains saccharin which has
been determined to cause cancer in laboratory ani
mals."
Saccharin, the only major artificial sweetener left
on the market, has been linked to bladder cancer in
laboratory animals.
