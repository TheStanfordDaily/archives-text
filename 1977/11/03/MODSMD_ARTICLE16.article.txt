### 
Western European politics are becoming the most
significant on the planet, some scholars believe. They
are at once the politics of the present, having evolved
in a relatively smooth way (at least in comparison to

countries. During his tenure as prime minister, the

and 'capital' " — in fact giving worker's interests total
