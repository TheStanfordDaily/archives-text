We are proud of our staunchly defended democratic
tradition. European history of this century de
monstrates that the reformist labor movement, for
dictatorships of the right and the left, always has been
regarded as the main enemy that has to be crushed at
almost any price. There is much of terrible suffering
but also of great human heroism in this history. This
tradition helps us to play a role in the fight today for
democratic freedoms on our continent."
Palme's Social Democrats have been described var
iously as "socialists," "democratic" and "anti-
Communist." Their actual ideology is at once all of
these things and none of them. They are as far from
the production-conscious "socialists" and Com
munists of the East-bioc countries as they are from

priority. His economic theory is not only an
"economics as though people mattered," but a
theory based on the assumption that they are the only
thing that matters. Stringent environmental regula
tions give precedence to the long-term quality of life
over short-term production expediences. The
Swedish work legislation enlists the entire productive
system to the interests of the worker.
"To live and survive," Palme said, "a society has to
hold and embrace an air of solidarity, empathy and
caring for others." This is the basis of Palme's social
thinking. Its heart he summed up in a quotation from
Carl Sandberg, open-ended yet ripe with intent;
"Yes, the people, yes . . Palme's lecture was
greeted with a standing ovation.
