## Looking for 'Goodbar,' finding Keaton 
### 
"Looking for Mr. Goodbar"
might have been subtitled
"Can a once crippled, psychi-
I tally starred teacher of deaf
[ children make love with every
S stranger she meets and still
j.'. find happiness?" — but there is
more to it than that. There is
i. also a desperately guilty and
I vituperative father, a desper
»' ately religious and patient
I mother, a desperately neurotic
I sister (played neurotically by
Tuesday Weld), a desperately
lovelorn ex-priest social
worker prone to intermittent
psychotic episodes, a desper
-1 ately macho bar groupie with a
I luminescent green switch
| blade, and a just plain desper
. ate homosexual ex-con.
As you can guess, the whole
situation becomes pretty damn
$. desperate. "Goodbar," as a re
fe suit, is a film with all the
r warped personalities, empty
relationships, hopeless charac
ters and profound loneliness
of O'Neill's "A Long Day's
Journey Into Night," made
with hall the skill.
Then again, there is Diane
Keaton. It "Looking for Mr.
Goodbar" has any torce or
humor, or eloquence, it is
primarily her doing. She virtu
ally gives the film life. Keaton
portrays Terry Dunn, a school
teacher/student, who, having
once survived a congenital
curvature ot the spine, must
now survive the deadening ef
fect ot that experience on her
soul. By anyone's standard, it is
a trying and complex role, full
of paradoxical aspects and pas
sions ot all types, but Keaton
pulls it off with grace and per
ception.
