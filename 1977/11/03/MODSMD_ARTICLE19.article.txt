### 
Terry Dunn is a character
who has been abused since
birth, tirst by her disease, then
by her family, and finally by the
men she has allowed into her
life. The abuse has trans
formed her into someone who
wants not to have her emotions
stirred or to stir the emotions
ot others, but only to escape
night after night into the dark
ness of bars and the anonymity
of discotheques. Indepen
dence is the result ot her vul
nerability, but at the cost ot her
desire to love or be loved. She
cannot cry or share herself. To
avoid the sacrifices and in
volvement of motherhood,
she has herself sterilized.
And yet the scenes with her
deaf students are wonderfully
warm and loving. Though
these scenes are set in the film
in rather schizophrenic fash
ion, Keaton manages to fill
them with almost the great
emotion and intensity of an
Annie Sullivan.
"Annie Hall" demonstrated
Keaton's versatility as an actor,
not merely as a comedien,
but "Goodbar," its weaknes
ses aside, lets her strength
emerge into one of the more
compelling performances of
late. It is also reassuring to note
that Keaton has finally broken
free of the Woody Allen
sidekick mold. One more
movie with Allen would have
typecast her for life, though
she is an actress with obviously
wider talents.
The remainder of the film
(nearly two hours) is the story
of her relationship with the
bars and discos she frequents
and with the many men she
takes home to bed. It would
not be a bad premise if there

were dimensions enough to
make it matter. Unfortunately,
there are too many people who
have too many problems which
are too little explained for the
film to have penetration or
deep emotional appeal. Direc
tor and screenwriter Richard
Brook might have been able to
correct this overextension ot
plot, had he given us less of all
the characters, except Terry
Dunn, or concentrated more
heavily on developing one or
two at the diminution of the
others. Instead, the film has a
tendency to throw one
traumatized character after
another at you without allow
ing you the time to consider
what has just happened. If this
approach elicits any emotion,
it is superficial and momen
tary.
It is primarily Keaton who
gives her character any staying
power. She brings us into her
lite and despite her faults and
coldness we have to like her
and empathize with her.
There are some hopelessly
vapid scenes I would be em
barassed to see on "The Edge
of Night." Take Tuesday Weld
sobbing hysterically around
Keaton's neck (as she does
most ot the time she is on sc
reen) saying, "You're my Rock
o'Gibralter, kid. . .Everybody
needs somebody to believe in
them." Lines such as that rank
with "Love means. . ." among
the most vacuous in film.
Even Keaton falls victim at
times. During the realization of
her fantasy of her making love
with her professor, she com
mits some of the silliest coital
Oh Coding ever heard. That is,
no doubt, a difficult image — it
is also a difficult scene.
The editing, too, detracts
from the film — there is not a
smooth transition in the piece.
The way sentences stop, start,
and change point of view con
fuses and distracts the audi
ence.
Visually, "Good bar's"
gratuitous misery is worse tor
the way the makers of the film
have pandered to sen
sationalism, something which
has nothing to do with the sex
ual themes. Even (udith Ross
ner, the novel's author, had
the good sense and sensibility
to put the end first and flash
back the rest. Brook, on the
other hand, saves everything
until a more melodramatic
moment, dropping the final
sequence on the audience like
a bomb. In the scene, Terry
Dunn is knifed to death in a
blaze of blue stroke by one of
her pick-ups, a humiliated and
enraged homosexual. While it
definitely has shock value,
such handling serves only to
cheapen the film and give it a
tabloid cast. The effect is
heavy-handed and almost
moralizing.
If my criticism has been par
ticularly severe, it is due to dis
appointment in a film which
should have been better than it
is. "Looking For Mr. Goodbar"
should be seen and felt, and
Diane Keaton's performance
appreciated before |udgment
is passed. The film is disturbing
and complicated. For most, in
cluding myself, it does not fade
with the final credits but stays
in mind, demanding attention.
There is humor and strength in
it, also, and if nothing else, it is
a vivid demonstration of a
philosophy which might be
said to redefine a statement of
Descarte: "Coito ergo sum."

what has just happened. If this
approach elicits any emotion,
it is superficial and momen
tary.
It is primarily Keaton who
gives her character any staying
power. She brings us into her
lite and despite her faults and
coldness we have to like her
and empathize with her.
There are some hopelessly
vapid scenes I would be em
barassed to see on "The Edge
of Night." Take Tuesday Weld
sobbing hysterically around
Keaton's neck (as she does
most ot the time she is on sc
reen) saying, "You're my Rock
o'Gibralter, kid. . .Everybody
needs somebody to believe in
them." Lines such as that rank
with "Love means. . ." among
the most vacuous in film.
Even Keaton falls victim at
times. During the realization of
her fantasy of her making love
with her professor, she com
mits some of the silliest coital
Oh Coding ever heard. That is,
no doubt, a difficult image — it
is also a difficult scene.
The editing, too, detracts
from the film — there is not a
smooth transition in the piece.
The way sentences stop, start,
and change point of view con
fuses and distracts the audi
ence.
Visually, "Good bar's"
gratuitous misery is worse tor
the way the makers of the film
have pandered to sen
sationalism, something which
has nothing to do with the sex
ual themes. Even (udith Ross
ner, the novel's author, had
the good sense and sensibility
to put the end first and flash
back the rest. Brook, on the
other hand, saves everything
until a more melodramatic
moment, dropping the final
sequence on the audience like
a bomb. In the scene, Terry
Dunn is knifed to death in a
blaze of blue stroke by one of
her pick-ups, a humiliated and
enraged homosexual. While it
definitely has shock value,
such handling serves only to
cheapen the film and give it a
tabloid cast. The effect is
heavy-handed and almost
moralizing.
If my criticism has been par
ticularly severe, it is due to dis
appointment in a film which
should have been better than it
is. "Looking For Mr. Goodbar"
should be seen and felt, and
Diane Keaton's performance
appreciated before |udgment
is passed. The film is disturbing
and complicated. For most, in
cluding myself, it does not fade
with the final credits but stays
in mind, demanding attention.
There is humor and strength in
it, also, and if nothing else, it is
a vivid demonstration of a
philosophy which might be
said to redefine a statement of
Descarte: "Coito ergo sum."
—STEVEN READE


Terry Dunn is a character
who has been abused since
birth, tirst by her disease, then
by her family, and finally by the
men she has allowed into her
life. The abuse has trans
formed her into someone who
wants not to have her emotions
stirred or to stir the emotions
ot others, but only to escape
night after night into the dark
ness of bars and the anonymity
of discotheques. Indepen
dence is the result ot her vul
nerability, but at the cost ot her
desire to love or be loved. She
cannot cry or share herself. To
avoid the sacrifices and in
volvement of motherhood,
she has herself sterilized.
And yet the scenes with her
deaf students are wonderfully
warm and loving. Though
these scenes are set in the film
in rather schizophrenic fash
ion, Keaton manages to fill
them with almost the great
emotion and intensity of an
Annie Sullivan.
"Annie Hall" demonstrated
Keaton's versatility as an actor,
not merely as a comedien,
but "Goodbar," its weaknes
ses aside, lets her strength
emerge into one of the more
compelling performances of
late. It is also reassuring to note
that Keaton has finally broken
free of the Woody Allen
sidekick mold. One more
movie with Allen would have
typecast her for life, though
she is an actress with obviously
wider talents.
The remainder of the film
(nearly two hours) is the story
of her relationship with the
bars and discos she frequents
and with the many men she
takes home to bed. It would
not be a bad premise if there

were dimensions enough to
make it matter. Unfortunately,
there are too many people who
have too many problems which
are too little explained for the
film to have penetration or
deep emotional appeal. Direc
tor and screenwriter Richard
Brook might have been able to
correct this overextension ot
plot, had he given us less of all
the characters, except Terry
Dunn, or concentrated more
heavily on developing one or
two at the diminution of the
others. Instead, the film has a
tendency to throw one
traumatized character after
another at you without allow
ing you the time to consider
what has just happened. If this
approach elicits any emotion,
it is superficial and momen
tary.

Terry Dunn is a character
who has been abused since
birth, tirst by her disease, then
by her family, and finally by the
men she has allowed into her
life. The abuse has trans
formed her into someone who
wants not to have her emotions
stirred or to stir the emotions
ot others, but only to escape
night after night into the dark
ness of bars and the anonymity
of discotheques. Indepen
dence is the result ot her vul
nerability, but at the cost ot her
desire to love or be loved. She
cannot cry or share herself. To
avoid the sacrifices and in
volvement of motherhood,
she has herself sterilized.
And yet the scenes with her
deaf students are wonderfully
warm and loving. Though
these scenes are set in the film
in rather schizophrenic fash
ion, Keaton manages to fill
them with almost the great
emotion and intensity of an
Annie Sullivan.
"Annie Hall" demonstrated
Keaton's versatility as an actor,
not merely as a comedien,
but "Goodbar," its weaknes
ses aside, lets her strength
emerge into one of the more
compelling performances of
late. It is also reassuring to note
that Keaton has finally broken
free of the Woody Allen
sidekick mold. One more
movie with Allen would have
typecast her for life, though
she is an actress with obviously
wider talents.
The remainder of the film
(nearly two hours) is the story
of her relationship with the
bars and discos she frequents
and with the many men she
takes home to bed. It would
not be a bad premise if there

were dimensions enough to
make it matter. Unfortunately,
there are too many people who
have too many problems which
are too little explained for the
film to have penetration or
deep emotional appeal. Direc
tor and screenwriter Richard
Brook might have been able to
correct this overextension ot
plot, had he given us less of all
the characters, except Terry
Dunn, or concentrated more
heavily on developing one or
two at the diminution of the
others. Instead, the film has a
tendency to throw one
traumatized character after
another at you without allow
ing you the time to consider
what has just happened. If this
approach elicits any emotion,
it is superficial and momen
tary.
It is primarily Keaton who
gives her character any staying
power. She brings us into her
lite and despite her faults and
coldness we have to like her
and empathize with her.
There are some hopelessly
vapid scenes I would be em
barassed to see on "The Edge
of Night." Take Tuesday Weld
sobbing hysterically around
Keaton's neck (as she does
most ot the time she is on sc
reen) saying, "You're my Rock
o'Gibralter, kid. . .Everybody
needs somebody to believe in
them." Lines such as that rank
with "Love means. . ." among
the most vacuous in film.
Even Keaton falls victim at
times. During the realization of
her fantasy of her making love
with her professor, she com
mits some of the silliest coital
Oh Coding ever heard. That is,
no doubt, a difficult image — it
is also a difficult scene.
The editing, too, detracts
from the film — there is not a
smooth transition in the piece.
The way sentences stop, start,
and change point of view con
fuses and distracts the audi
ence.
Visually, "Good bar's"
gratuitous misery is worse tor
the way the makers of the film
have pandered to sen
sationalism, something which
has nothing to do with the sex
ual themes. Even (udith Ross
ner, the novel's author, had
the good sense and sensibility
to put the end first and flash
back the rest. Brook, on the
other hand, saves everything
until a more melodramatic
moment, dropping the final
sequence on the audience like
a bomb. In the scene, Terry
Dunn is knifed to death in a
blaze of blue stroke by one of
her pick-ups, a humiliated and
enraged homosexual. While it
definitely has shock value,
such handling serves only to
cheapen the film and give it a
tabloid cast. The effect is
heavy-handed and almost
moralizing.
If my criticism has been par
ticularly severe, it is due to dis
appointment in a film which
should have been better than it
is. "Looking For Mr. Goodbar"
should be seen and felt, and
Diane Keaton's performance
appreciated before |udgment
