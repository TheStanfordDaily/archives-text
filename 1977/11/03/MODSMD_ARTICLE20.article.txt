George Burns as the ad-libbing Almighty
with |ohn Denver as his straight man? That is
the improbable basis of Carl Reiner's new
film, "Oh, God!' Burns plays God and De
nver portrays lerry Landers, a supermarket
worker turned latter-day Moses in this un
even comedy. God wants Landers to tell
everyone to stop killing each other and
"make the world work." Landers fears he's
not equal to the task, but attempts to fulfill
his mission.
The gag images dealing with God under
under unusal circumstances: in a car, on the
phone, in a bathroom, is played for all it is
worth — and then some. How many times
can you get laughs out of God wearing a
fishing cap or driving a cab? About half as
many times as are presented in this movie.
George Burns manages to get more out of
the script than most would, however. His
laconic, deadpan delivery enhances lines
which otherwise would not merit a chuckle.
John Denver is dreadful in his screen debut.
He looks like he's still on a Rocky Mountain
high.
The picture's biggest flaw is that midway
through the action the thinning jokes are
augmented by a homespun homily. God
gives us The Word courtesy of Larry Gel
bart's cutesy script, and its family entertain

ment blandness is enough to make anyone
wince. Half sermon, half comedy is a dis
comforting mixture to take and the strain of
combining these elements grows as the pic
ture progresses. Burns as the philosophizing
Diety sums up the difficulty when he says,
"Voltaire had me pegged. I'm a comedian
playing to an audience that's afraid to
laugh."
Director Reiner allows the story to drift
considerably. He seems uncertain what to
do with an incarnated Cod once the jokes
run out. So he has Cod sententiously answer
puzzling theological questions and proffer
advice in what I assume is meant to be a
warm, witty manner. It is not.
Televison hype, sinister evangelists and
boisterous religious cultists are also thrown
in, presumably to show how much this crazy
world needs saving. What needs saving even
more is the crazy picture. Divine inspiration
is certainly lacking. The novelty of seeing
God in tennis sneakers palls, and a belated
attempt to graft a Sunday school lesson onto
the action causes further enervation. By try
ing to be a little bit of everything, it turns out
to be a whole lot of nothing. If this is God, it
is the kind of God Hollywood deserves.
