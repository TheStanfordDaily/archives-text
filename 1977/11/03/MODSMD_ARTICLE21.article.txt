# On Ibsen's' Master Builder' at the ACT
## 
### 
When a playwright bares his
soul and writes a play in which
he himself is thinly disguised as
the main character, he puts his
literary career on the line. If it
bombs, it is doubly hard for
him to redeem his reputation.
But if it suceeds, he may well
create a masterpiece.
Currently in repertory at the
American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco,
"The Master Builder" soars to
heights previously unexplored
by playwrights of the
nineteenth century. At once
romantic and realistic, it is
often said to be Henrik Ibsen's
finest dramatic work.
"The Master Builder" is de
cidedly autobiographical. It is
the story of an architect who
originally built churches but
has attained commercial suc
cess by building middle class
homes. Ibsen himself achieved
recognition, not for his poetic
epics, but for his plays with
more prosaic themes.
The master builder is Hal
vard Solness, a successful,
aging architect plagued by
common fears: fear of the
younger generation, whom he
thinks is trying to shove him
aside; fear of heights, which
annoys him because he is a
master builder whose job it is
to raise soaring monuments;

fear of his own future, of grow
ing old and useless and even
perhaps insane. He has a
sickly, depressed and depres
sing wife and a talented, rest
less apprentice who is itching
to get out on his own. Solness
fears he himself may be mad,
for he has powers — or de
mons, as he calls them —
which possess him, which
make him wish for things to
happen and which make these
wishes come true. Into this
tense situation walks Hilde
Wangel, a 23-year-old Bohe-

Drama

mian who had encountered
Solness briefly, 101 years ear
lier.
She is decidedly odd.
She reminds Solness of his visit
to her town 10 years earlier
where he built a church with a
lofty spire and then scaled that
spire and tossed a wreath over
the weathervane. She tells
him: "You said I looked beauti
ful in my white dress . . . And
then you said that when I grew
up, I would be your princess
. . . And then when I asked
how long I should have to wait,
you said you'd come back in
101 years . . . and carry me

off. . .
Solness, claiming not to re
member any of this, seems to
tally confused by her fabrica
tion. But Hilde is not finished;
she is very upset that he
doesn't recall the best part:
"You took me in your arms and
kissed me, Mr. Solness. . .You
took me in both your arms and
bent me backwards and kissed
me. Many, many times."
Such is the eerie relationship
between Hilde and Solness;
she leads him on, makes him
believe the unbelieveable, at
tempt the impossible. She
worships him, wants to experi
ence the wonder of everything
he has built. She, in turn, is
someone for whom he can
build, for whom he can rise to
impossible heights. But Hilde
is not only his fulfillment; she
is also his downfall. He im
plicitly realizes this when he
calls her a "falcon." She re
sponds: "and why not a fal
con? Why shouldn't I go hunt
ing, too? Get the prey I want? If
only I can get my claws into it!
Bring it to the ground!
The falcon, or bird of prey, is
Ibsen's symbol of youth in
"The Master Builder." Hilde is
youth, and youth finally does
conquer; Solness is eventually
shoved aside when Hilde
pleads with him to scale the
spire of his newly-built home,
to be what he was 101 years
before and to fling that wreath
around the weathervane. His
wife protests, his doctor for
bids it, his apprentice thinks he
lacks the courage; no one be
lieves in him except Hilde, who
does not see his age at all, just
the splendor of her beautiful
"master builder" who can and
who must do the impossible,
for her.
So Solness climbs. He flings
the wreath around the weath
ervane, shakes his fist at Cod
for the way life has treated him,
and then plummets to his
death as Hilde, in ecstasy,
stares at the spire shouting
"My Master Builder!" over and
over and over again.
Soleness is portrayed with
great energy in the ACT pro
duction by Peter Donat, who is
in fact a little too spry to be
believeable as the troubled,
aging architect. He lacks
depth; his Solness is two
dimensional. Donat tries to
convey Solness' torment by
gesturing grandly and bounc
ing aimlessly across the stage.
Solness should be played sen
sitively; he is an eccentric,
high-strong, emotional crea

ture whose relationship with
Hilde rests at once on a
spiritual and sensual basis.
Above all else, Halvard Sol
ness is an artist, a man driven to
create in his work what he lacks
in his life. Donat shows no
thing of this. His Solness is a
confused middle-aged man
whose fate it is to be an ar
chitect, and not a "master
builder."
Barbara Dirickson's Hilde is
played a little too straight. In
stead of coming across as a true
Bohemian, Dirickson is so
down-to-earth and wholesome
in appearance, she seems
more like a camp counselor.
But in this instance, appear
ances are deceiving. There is
spirit under that demure ex
terior; she commands atten
tion, as Hilde must. It is her
intensity that saves her, that
enables you to believe she can
exercise such mysterious
power over Solness. If it we
ren't for the quality of Di
rickson's performance, the
production would be a dismal
venture indeed.
Anne Lawder as Aline, Sol
ness' depressed wife, gives a
tedious, toneless perfor
mance. It is amazing that she
can take a fascinating,
psychologically-disturbed
character and turn her into no
thing more than a distracted,
distraught housewife. Law
der's Aline is wilted, lifeless;
she reveals absolutely nothing
of the emotional trauma and
stress which have put her in
her present melancholic state
of mind.
This is the fifth Ibsen play to

be performed at ACT in the last
seven seasons. It is directed by
Allen Fletcher who also trans
lated and directed several of
the other Ibsen plays for ACT,
including "An Enemy of the
People," "A Doll's House,"
"Pillars of the Community,"
and "Peer Gynt." Given
Fletcher's background and ex
perience in Ibsen, you would
expect The Master Builder to
move. But there is no ex
citement, no driving pace to
keep the audience at the edge
of its seats waiting to see what
Solness will do: the play drags
along, and after the three-plus
hours it takes for it to end, you
are almost too tired to care.
But there is the customary
ACT piece de resistance, and
that will revive you fast
enough. The audience gets to
see, in livid, living color, Sol
ness' corpse dragged on stage,
complete with blood-stained
stretcher. Gross. Yes. Neces
sary? Not really. Then why?
ACT's restless drive for theatri
cal effect. Add to this the
Twilight Zone music which be
gins each act, and the whole
production assumes super
natural overtones which are a
shade out of line. But just be
cause the production leaves
some things to be desired does
not mean one should avoid the
play. Ibsen, after all, is Ibsen,
and in spite of what is done in
this production, The Master
Builder remains the crowning
achievement in the career of
one of the fathers of modern
drama.
