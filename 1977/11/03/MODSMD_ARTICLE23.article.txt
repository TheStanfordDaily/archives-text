The man who goes blind is
Paul Held, a 36-year-old pro
fessor of medieval literature at
a Manhattan university. He has
just watched as his best friend,
August Blum, whose wife Ruth
he loves, withered away with
cancer.
"August and I had become
close friends in college. . .
From graduate schools on op
posite coasts, we had ex
changed letters steadily. A year
after he joined the state uni
versity's Manhattan branch, he
helped me to get a job there
too. There I spent so much
time with him and his wife that
we were a threesome. And
there we had been colleagues
for years before the future
seemed so clear it was unmen
tionable: he would die, I
would marry here."
On the day that August is
told death is near, Paul and
Ruth rent a Mustang and drive
the parkways to a Connecticut
motel for a brief and chaste va
cation from their long watch at
his side. "At last I reached out
my hand and shedid hers, until
they joined in the air between
our beds. She said, 'I never
thought I would love a man for
being healthy.' "
But he's not healthy long, for
alone and thinking of Ruth,
Paul drifts wide on a curve and
crashes into a bus. Windshield
glass so badly damages his
right eye that doctors at Har
lem Hospital must remove it,
but there is worry too about
the other eye because of a
condition called sympathetic
ophtalmia in which the unin

jured eye duplicates the
symptoms of the other. "It can
sometimes lead to total blind
ness in the uninjured eye."
Gradually it does. And Held,
who saw his best friend denied
academic tenure due to his
long disease, is afraid he'll be
similarly rejected, doomed, if
his own handicap is known.
But more important than his
job, he's terrified that he'll lose
Ruth, that she'll discover in
him only what she'd grown to
resent in August, that she'll

have yet another marriage of
waiting on and caring for a man
who's not complete.
So he hides his affliction,
from the English department
and from the woman he wants
to marry. He enlists Beryl
Kramer, a lonely under
graduate — who happens to be
pretty though that doesn't
mean much to him anymore —
to help him in his semester
long deception. He identifies
his classroom doors with sec
ret strips of tape. He arrives
late so he'll have the baffling
school hallways to himself.
Beryl eagerly runs his errands,
types his tests, reads his books
aloud to him until he has them

memorized.
For a while it seems to work.
Held is invited to a faculty party
and he must elaborately plot
how he'll get through it with
out alerting either Ruth or
Kappy (the woman department
head) to his deteriorating con
dition. "The suggestion that I
bring Ruth was providential. I
could stay seated next to her,
intimately enough to discour
age interruption.Those who did
approach would be people I
knew well, whose voices I
would recognize, and Ruth's
remarks to them would be
further clues. And my brain
skimmed on, planning where I
would sit, what I would drink
and say, planning, yes, to bring
it off, while a wiser Held be
lieved none of it, agreed to go
only because it seemed useless
to stay away."
Ruth isn't fooled and she
stops seeigg him out of "her
anger at my falseness, her
humiliation that I had mis
trusted her, her pain at un
cloaking me." It isn't betraying
too much to say that she does
eventually return to Paul and
that he gets tenure only after
her personal nightmare grows
dark, for this is a book by a
craftsman who knows how to
fill his story with apprehension
and surprise and the kind of

tension one welcomes in a ro
mance. The language is formal,
the medicine in it precise, the
geography of Manhattan nicely
detailed. But it's the subject
that truly makes this novel spe
cial. It has a "how to" fascina
tion, and one puts it down with
the sense of blindness very
real. It is part of Jonathan Pen
ner's achievement if the loss of
sight no longer seems so scary
or pitiful and that the novel
"Going Blind" succeeds as that
rarest of things, a manly book
about love.
