### 
Without further ado, then,
let us all praise the Guarneri
String Quartet. Specifically, let
us praise Arnold Steinhardt
and his violin, Micheal Tree
and his viola, John Dalley and
his violin, and David Soyer and
his cello. En toto the four com
prise the string quartet equiva
lent of Mount Rushmore; indi
vidually they are as mitigating
as musicians can be.
The Guarneri will be in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on
November 6, 8 and 11. They
will play quartets by Haydn,
Berg, Borodin, Schuman, De-
Bussy, Schubert, Lutoslawski
and Brahms. They will perform
excellently, and when they
have finished they will be hear
tily applauded.
Then again, they just might
be better than normal.
