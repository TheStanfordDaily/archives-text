## Medical students discuss ranking in dean's letters 
### Andrea James 
Controversy over a classifi
cation system placed in dean's
letters prompted more than
100 concerned medical stu
dents and faculty members to
attend an all-school forum last
night.
For years, the University
used a no-rank system in which
students were not compared
directly with other students in
the medical school.
This year's letters, which
were mailed as recommenda
tions to hospitals for internship
placement, ranked graduating
students as extraordinary, out
standing, very good or good.
Five letters, mailed without
the students' knowledge of the
contents, also included a final
sentence giving percentages of
medical students falling into
each of the four categories.
After Ron Jones, a fourth
year medical student, disco
vered the ranking system and
complained to the Office of
Student Affairs, the final sen
tence in the letter was drop
ped. However, the letters still
group students into one of the
four categories.
Dr. Ken Vosti, associate dean
of student affairs, said at the
meeting that the system did
not rank students, but rather
grouped them.
"There is a difference bet
ween ranking students and
grouping them," Vosti said.
"We have always grouped
students in the dean's letters,"
he said. "All we have done
here is to arrive at sharper dis
tinctions between the group
ings. We took all the evalua
tions and put them together

and discovered that tour piles
of them were amazingly con
sistent.
"We could have left the final
paragraph so vague as to have
the hospitals attempt to decide
what we were trying to say in
our recommendations, but we
thought you students would
have a better opportunity to
get into an internship position
if we projected a realistic view
than to leave it up to the real
world to group you."
One student pointed out
that even though the adjectival
classification of students is not
a sure determination of class
rank, if more than one Stanford
student applies to a hospital,
those who read the letter will
be able to see through the clas
sification.
Most medical schools num
erically rank students. At Stan
ford, more than 60 per cent of
Stanford Medical School
graduates receive positions in
one of their top three intern
ship choices, it was pointed
out at the meeting.
Richard Stead, a third year
medical student, stated in the
Medical School's publication
that "the pass-fail/no-rank sys
tem has fostered an atmos
phere of trust, cooperation,
and personal development
among some (medical school)
students, rather than the ruth
less competition and mistrust
that plagues so many pre-med
and medical students
elsewhere."
But Dr. Fran Conley, chair
man of the medical school fa
culty senate, said she believes
students object to the group
ing system for a different

reason.
"Why are you so afraid of
competing against each
other?" she asked the hissing
students. "It's a big, bad world
out there and it's very competi
tive. In rushing away from
competitiveness, you're rush
ing toward mediocrity."
"Stanford's no-rank system
fosters an atmosphere to live,
study and work together,"
Stead replied. "We chose to
come here because of that
reason."
Dr. William Creger, former
associate dean of student af
fairs and Vosti's predecessor,
also commented, "The stu
dents feel 'we don't want to
climb over our brother's backs.
We want to help patients and
learn medicine.' I think that in
doing that they're being brave
for perhaps the first time in
man's career."
Both Stead and Creger re
ceived loud applause.
At the end of the meeting,
students voted on whether the
final paragraph of the dean's
letter should divide the stu
dents into adjectival groups.
One student voted yes.
Dr. )ohn Steward, also an as
sociate dean of student affairs,
said that in a "preliminary dis
cussion with the dean, we de
cided to set up a task force to
look into the philosophy of
evaluating students," adding
that evaluating students in
cludes honors programs and
association in medical organi
zations outside Stanford Medi
cal Center.
"I hope the matter will be
dealt with inawayin which you
will be happy," he concluded.

More thdn 100 medical students and faculty members met last night
to discuss the classification system place in recommendations this
year.
Controversy over a classifi
cation system placed in dean's
letters prompted more than
100 concerned medical stu
dents and faculty members to
attend an all-school forum last
night.
For years, the University
used a no-rank system in which
students were not compared
directly with other students in
the medical school.
This year's letters, which
were mailed as recommenda
tions to hospitals for internship
placement, ranked graduating
students as extraordinary, out
standing, very good or good.
Five letters, mailed without
the students' knowledge of the
contents, also included a final
sentence giving percentages of
medical students falling into
each of the four categories.
After Ron Jones, a fourth
year medical student, disco
vered the ranking system and
complained to the Office of
Student Affairs, the final sen
tence in the letter was drop
ped. However, the letters still
group students into one of the
four categories.
Dr. Ken Vosti, associate dean
of student affairs, said at the
meeting that the system did
not rank students, but rather
grouped them.
"There is a difference bet
ween ranking students and
grouping them," Vosti said.
"We have always grouped
students in the dean's letters,"
he said. "All we have done
here is to arrive at sharper dis
tinctions between the group
ings. We took all the evalua
tions and put them together

and discovered that tour piles
of them were amazingly con
sistent.
"We could have left the final
paragraph so vague as to have
the hospitals attempt to decide
what we were trying to say in
our recommendations, but we
thought you students would
have a better opportunity to
get into an internship position
if we projected a realistic view
than to leave it up to the real
world to group you."
One student pointed out
that even though the adjectival
classification of students is not
a sure determination of class
rank, if more than one Stanford
student applies to a hospital,
those who read the letter will
be able to see through the clas
sification.
Most medical schools num
erically rank students. At Stan
ford, more than 60 per cent of
Stanford Medical School
graduates receive positions in
one of their top three intern
ship choices, it was pointed
out at the meeting.
Richard Stead, a third year
medical student, stated in the
Medical School's publication
that "the pass-fail/no-rank sys
tem has fostered an atmos
phere of trust, cooperation,
and personal development
among some (medical school)
students, rather than the ruth
less competition and mistrust
that plagues so many pre-med
and medical students
elsewhere."
But Dr. Fran Conley, chair
man of the medical school fa
culty senate, said she believes
students object to the group
ing system for a different

reason.
"Why are you so afraid of
competing against each
other?" she asked the hissing
students. "It's a big, bad world
out there and it's very competi
tive. In rushing away from
competitiveness, you're rush
ing toward mediocrity."
"Stanford's no-rank system
fosters an atmosphere to live,
study and work together,"
Stead replied. "We chose to
come here because of that
reason."
Dr. William Creger, former
associate dean of student af
fairs and Vosti's predecessor,
also commented, "The stu
dents feel 'we don't want to
climb over our brother's backs.
We want to help patients and
learn medicine.' I think that in
doing that they're being brave
for perhaps the first time in
man's career."
Both Stead and Creger re
ceived loud applause.
At the end of the meeting,
students voted on whether the
final paragraph of the dean's
letter should divide the stu
dents into adjectival groups.
One student voted yes.
Dr. )ohn Steward, also an as
sociate dean of student affairs,
said that in a "preliminary dis
cussion with the dean, we de
cided to set up a task force to
look into the philosophy of
evaluating students," adding
that evaluating students in
cludes honors programs and
association in medical organi
zations outside Stanford Medi
cal Center.
