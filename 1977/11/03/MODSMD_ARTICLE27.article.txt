# Brezhnev asks nuclear halt

Moscow (AP) â€” President
Leonid Brezhnev proposed a
halt in nuclear explosions for
both military and peaceful
purpose yesterday in a speech
marking the 60th anniversary
of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The Soviet leader also re
ported the 1977 grain harvest
was well below the target fixed
by Soviet planners and even
less than U.S. experts had an
ticipated.
The nuclear proposal
marked the first time the Krem
lin had been willing to include
peaceful blasts in nuclear test
ban talks.
The speech text carried by
the official Tass news agency
also included a proposal that
"the nuclear powers could un
dertake to start the gradual re
duction of existing stockpiles
of such atomic weapons, and
move towards their complete,
total destruction."
Brezhnev omitted this point
when delivering the speech,
and Western observers said
later they thought the omission
might have resulted either
from a last-minute revision or
from an inadvertent slip-up in
reading the text.
Washington reaction
Washington's initial reaction
to Brezhnev's nuclear sugges
tions was favorable, but State
Department officials said he
was ambiguous on several
points.
Both the United States and
the Soviet Union staged test
explosions underground just
last week. Western monitors
reported the Soviets set off a
double explosion in Siberia on
Friday and the United States
exploded a nuclear device with
a 20 kiloton blast Oct. 26.
The proposal in the text to
reduce stockpiles of nuclear
weapons matches a goal of
U.S. President Jimmy Carter,
who last month told the United
Nations General Assembly the
United States was "willing
now" to reduce its arsenal of
nuclear arms if the Soviets
would do the same.
Crop below target
During the IVi-hour address
Brezhnev said the Soviet grain
harvest this year amounted to a

disappointing 194 million tons,
the lowest since the 1975 grain
disaster. This year's crop was
19 million tons below the target
and a sharp drop from the 1976
record crop of 223.8 million
tons. The 1975 decade-low
grain crop amounted to 140
million tons.
The Soviet shortfall raised
the prospect of increased im
ports from the United States
and higher U.S. grain prices
following general market
weakness.
