# Nominations to be made tonight
## COP interviews ERB candidates 
### Sara Lessley 
The process of creating an ASSU Elec
tions Review Board continued yesterday as
the Council of Presidents began interview
ing potential members, according to ASSU
Co-president Greg Larson.
Larson said the COP took names and
interviewed people briefly yesterday. The
COP will nominate five members and five
alternates — needed in case of senate dis
approval — to present to the ASSU Senate
tonight. The senate must approve each of
the five members with a three-fourths
majority, Larson added.
"Everybody seems very enthusiastic,"
Larson said. He said ERB candidates have
been "quite honest and open," some ad
mitting they knew "such and such a (se
nate) candidate." Eor the most part they
appear to be able to exercise fairness,

even in judging friends, he added.
Co-president Steve Westly said that out
of about 18 people who have shown an
interest in serving on the ERB, in addition
to the four the COP had originally
suggested, the COP "will pick the best
ones we can."
Criteria for selection includes "fairness,
first and foremost," Westly said. Trying to
establish that is difficult, he conceded.
"We just have to talk to them and get the
best deal we can."
"There's definite student interest" in
the ERB, Westly said. Graduates and un
dergraduates from "all areas of interest"
came to the COP yesterday.
Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel said
he "trusts the COP will be fair" in its selec
tion of potential ERB members.
He said that although he hadn't seen a
list of names, people the COP had previ
ously suggested seemed "in general to be
fair."
Unjustified
Grethel added he believes it was "very
important that the ERB passed." Public
outcry had something to do with the pas
sage of the measure Tuesday, but the furor
was partly unjustified, he said.
Grethel said he thinks the "senate can
work together," as evidenced by Tuesday
night's actions. He said he sees the posi
tion of senate chairperson as a way to keep
the senate together "on a cohesive basis."
However, as a Stanford Organizing
Committee member, he added that he
"fully intends to vehemently pursue the
SOC proposals as per their platform with
every bit of influence the chair has."
Immediate SOC concerns include Uni
versity investments, committee appoint
ments and the problem of sexist language,
he said.

Grethel said his SOC membership
would not prevent him from listening to
other points of view. He said one of the
"misconceptions about SOC" is that it will
not work with other senators. He said
Tuesday's meeting showed the slate can.
Grethel said he intends to delegate
some of the chair's responsibility to Mike
Veiluva, his choice for parliamentarian.
Veiluva will serve as a resource person
for parliamentary rules and also as "a sort
of senate whip." As "whip" he will work
between thechairand the floor, helpingto
effect compromises, Grethel said.
Meriel Burtle, as deputy chairperson,
will help the chair in several areas, Grethel
said. He said he hopes that between the
two of them they can attend most commit
tee meetings and serve as liaisons bet
ween the senate and the committees.

Grethel said he intends to delegate
some of the chair's responsibility to Mike
Veiluva, his choice for parliamentarian.
Veiluva will serve as a resource person
for parliamentary rules and also as "a sort
of senate whip." As "whip" he will work
between thechairand the floor, helpingto
effect compromises, Grethel said.
Meriel Burtle, as deputy chairperson,
will help the chair in several areas, Grethel
said. He said he hopes that between the
two of them they can attend most commit
tee meetings and serve as liaisons bet
ween the senate and the committees.

The process of creating an ASSU Elec
tions Review Board continued yesterday as
the Council of Presidents began interview
ing potential members, according to ASSU
Co-president Greg Larson.
Larson said the COP took names and
interviewed people briefly yesterday. The
COP will nominate five members and five
alternates — needed in case of senate dis
approval — to present to the ASSU Senate
tonight. The senate must approve each of
the five members with a three-fourths
majority, Larson added.
"Everybody seems very enthusiastic,"
Larson said. He said ERB candidates have
been "quite honest and open," some ad
mitting they knew "such and such a (se
nate) candidate." Eor the most part they
appear to be able to exercise fairness,

even in judging friends, he added.
Co-president Steve Westly said that out
of about 18 people who have shown an
interest in serving on the ERB, in addition
to the four the COP had originally
suggested, the COP "will pick the best
ones we can."
Criteria for selection includes "fairness,
first and foremost," Westly said. Trying to
establish that is difficult, he conceded.
"We just have to talk to them and get the
best deal we can."
"There's definite student interest" in
the ERB, Westly said. Graduates and un
dergraduates from "all areas of interest"
came to the COP yesterday.
Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel said
he "trusts the COP will be fair" in its selec
tion of potential ERB members.
He said that although he hadn't seen a
list of names, people the COP had previ
ously suggested seemed "in general to be
fair."
Unjustified
Grethel added he believes it was "very
important that the ERB passed." Public
outcry had something to do with the pas
sage of the measure Tuesday, but the furor
was partly unjustified, he said.
Grethel said he thinks the "senate can
work together," as evidenced by Tuesday
night's actions. He said he sees the posi
tion of senate chairperson as a way to keep
the senate together "on a cohesive basis."
However, as a Stanford Organizing
Committee member, he added that he
"fully intends to vehemently pursue the
SOC proposals as per their platform with
every bit of influence the chair has."
Immediate SOC concerns include Uni
versity investments, committee appoint
ments and the problem of sexist language,
he said.

Grethel said his SOC membership
would not prevent him from listening to
other points of view. He said one of the
"misconceptions about SOC" is that it will
not work with other senators. He said
Tuesday's meeting showed the slate can.
