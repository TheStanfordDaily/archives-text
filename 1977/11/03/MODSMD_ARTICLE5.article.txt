# SRI International — a Jekyll and Hyde story
## 
### 
If it is true that beauty is in the
eye of the beholder, SRI In
ternational" can at the same
time be described as both
beautiful and grotesque.
Those who see beauty in SRI
praise it for its service to soci
ety in tackling complex mod
ern problems. They are proud
of SRl's role in national security
and international affairs. They
are proud that the institute last
year grossed $104.6 million in
revenues. Critics see SRI diffe
rently. They claim the institute
has not lived up to its goals as
stated in its 1946 charter: to
improve "the general standard
of living and the peace and
prosperity of mankind. . .
Instead, they say, SRI, as part of
the military-industrial com
plex, has worked against peace
and is primarily concerned
with its own prosperity.
By anybody's standards, SRI
International, formerly the
Stanford Research Institute, is
an economically robust corpo
ration. It is the second largest
independent, non-profit re
search organization in the Un
ited States. (Battelle Memorial
Institute in Columbus, Ohio is
the largest.) Between 1975 and
1976, its gross revenue rose 10
per cent to the total of $104.6
million. The federal govern
ment, by farSßl's largest client,
provides two-thirds of its re
venue, a third of which comes
from the Department of De
fense and a third from civilian
agencies. The remaining third
is generated from the com
mercial sector, of which 40 per
cent are foreign clients.
The institute employs 3200
people. The vast majority
(2700) work at the 72-acre
headquarters, located on
Ravenswood Avenue in Menlo

Park. The remainder are scat
tered among SRl's 16 domestic
and foreign offices and
laboratories. About a third of
the research professionals are
engineers, one-fourth are so
cial scientists, and the remain-

der are physical scientists, in
cluding medical doctors and
computer programmers.
In 1976, SRI was involved in
2300 different projects, which
were divided among its eight
divisions. To facilitate research
for its foreign clients, SRI has
offices in England, France,
Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia,
Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil
and Japan.
An indication of SRl's signifi
cance in the West Coast
business world is given by the
list of titles appended to the
names of the membership of
its board of directors. Edgar F.
Kaiser, for example, is chair
man of the board of Kaiser In
dustries Corporation; E.
Hornsby Wasson is former

chairman of the board of
Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company; Ernest C. Ar
buckle is chairman of the
board of Wells Fargo Bank; B.F.
Biaggini is chairman of South
ern Pacific Company; A.W.
Clausen is president of Bank of
America N.T.&S.A.; H.J.
Haynes is chairman of the
board of Stanford Oil Com
pany of California; and Arjay
Miller is dean of the Universi
ty's Graduate School of Busi
ness.
The key to SRl's growth and
continued success has been its
ability to adapt to the changing
needs and demands of its
clients. Its proponents call this
"responding to the mar
ketplace" while critics de
nounce it as "capitalistic
exploitation." Whatever the
case, it is a fact that SRI was a
product of the post World War
economic boom. Following
the war, business leaders on
the West Coast were looking
for a way to stimulate the de
velopment of industry in that
area, hoping to turn the
technological advances made
during the war into profit.
Atholl Mcßean, the wealthy
president of Newhall Land and
Farming Company, was a major
proponent of a research insti
tute on the West Coast, similar
to that of Battelle and Armour
in the East.
Meanwhile, as early as 1939,
two Stanford professors,
Robert E. Swain and Philip A.
Leighton, and a Stanford
alumnus, H. Dudley Swim,
who called themselves the
"Three Musketeers," were
discussing the possibility of es
tablishing a research institute
at the University. In 1945, Uni
versity President Donald B.

Tresidder appointed them to
study the concept, and their
subsequent report concluded
that "now is the golden time to
start."
Professor Paul Holden of the
Business School was a key link
between the University and the
industrialists. In 1945, he in
troduced Atholl Mcßean to
University Vice-president Alvin
Eurich. The following year, the
Stanford Research Institute
was established as an inde
pendent, non-profit entity.
Even before its doors were
opened in what was then the
physics corner of the Quad,
SRI had received its first re
search project — developing
rubber from the guayule plant.
A year later, when the federal

government closed down the
Dibble Military Hospital on
Ravenswood Avenue, the Uni
versity leased the property and
SRI moved its offices to the
hospital's administration build
ing.
University trustees were the
only general members of the
corporation and had the power
to appoint a board of directors.

The University lent both its
prestige and $1.5 million to the
formation of the "new star of
the Western scene."
It proved to be a happy mar
riage, since many of the trus
tees were themselves wealthy
industrialists and had a per
sonal financial stake in SRI and
the development of industry.
The first board of directors,
which met in January 1947,
consisted of men no less weal
thy and powerful than those on
the board today. Paul B. McKee
was president of Pacific Power
and Light Co.; D.J. Russell was
vice president of Southern
Pacific Company; William L.
Stewart Jr. was executive vice
president of Union Oil Com
panh; and James D. Zellerbach
was president of Crown Zel
lerbach Corp.
During its first several years,
60 per cent of SRl's busi
ness was done with industry,
primarily in the fields of
economics and engineering.
One of its earliest customers
was the Bank of America, for
which it designed a device
which electronically sorted
and posted checks. SRI was
also involved as early as 1949 in
smog studies in the Los
Angeles area, and was re
searching and designing com
puters, television circuitry, and
instrumentation.
Despite the University's fi
nancial backing and the wealth
of its board members, SRI
floundered somewhat during
this early period, and had to
depend on bank loans and do
nations for survival. In the
words of Weldon Gibson, SRl's
executive vice president today
and one of SKl's first employes,
"An atmosphere of doom and
