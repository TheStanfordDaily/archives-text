gloom developed in some
quarters; it was clearly possi
ble that we would have to close
our doors." In the mid-19505,
SRl's financial situation
brightened when the federal
government, embroiled in the
Korean War, began to pour
money into the institute for
defense-related research. This
allowed SRI to "break even' fi
nancially, and was the begin
ning of a long and close rela
tionship with the federal gov
ernment as a key client.
In the 1960s SRI entered a
third phase. Although the ted
eral government remained its
key client, the government it
self was changing and a new
administration was shifting
emphasis in its spending prog
rams. President Johnson's
"War on Poverty" programs
provided a wealth of federal
funds for research on social
problems. SRI adapted to meet
the new challenge, hiring more
social scientists and expanding
its research facilities in these
areas. In 1967 and 1968, it re
ceived two of the largest
education-evaluation con
tracts ever given by the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare, to studv the Head
Start and Follow Through prog
rams. SRI also contracted heav
ily with state and local agencies
to study urban problems and
welfare programs.
When the "War on Poverty"
began to give way to the war in
Vietnam, however, SRI fol
lowed the action. It was in this
fourth phase of its history that
SRI followed the action a bit
too closely, perhaps, and con
sequently was nearly de
stroyed.
By 1968 , 71 per cent of SRl's
research was sponsored by
the federal government, and of
this, 73 percentwasformilitary
purposes. SRI was thus a
natural target of the anti-war
movement at Stanford Univer
sity. Concern about SRl's in
volvement in the war in South
east Asia began in 1965 when
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam discovered
that two of SRl's contracts in
volved chemical and biological
warfare research. Detailed
studies of the research were
published in Resistance news
paper in 1967, and the
Stanford chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
began covering the campus
with "We Accuse" posters of
the trustees.
"This stimulated talk, but
most people thought it was
outrageous at that time," ac
cording to Lenny Siegel, a
former member of the SDS
who was involved in the early
research on SRI. "In the fall of
1968," Siegel said, "the SDS
chapter decided to pursue a
campaign of getting Stanford
out of Southeast Asia."
On October 8, it tacked a list
of demands on the trustees'
door. In response, SRI Presi
dent Charles Anderson main
tained that government spon
sored research was "in the
public interest." Stanford's
Acting President Robert
Glaser, however, reacted more
positively, forming a student
faculty study committee to
look into SRl's activities and to
evaluate its ties with the Uni
versity.
On (anuary 14, about 50 stu
dents entered a closed trustees
meeting on campus and pre
sented a list of demands, in
cluding a demand for a
student-trustee forum. The
meeting was promptly ad
journed and 29 students were
later "tried" by the newly
formed Stanford (udicial
Council. "As a result of the
publicity about the hearing,
