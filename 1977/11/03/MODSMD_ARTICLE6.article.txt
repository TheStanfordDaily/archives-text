gloom developed in some
quarters; it was clearly possi
ble that we would have to close
our doors." In the mid-19505,
SRl's financial situation
brightened when the federal
government, embroiled in the
Korean War, began to pour
money into the institute for
defense-related research. This
allowed SRI to "break even' fi
nancially, and was the begin
ning of a long and close rela
tionship with the federal gov
ernment as a key client.
In the 1960s SRI entered a
third phase. Although the ted
eral government remained its
key client, the government it
self was changing and a new
administration was shifting
emphasis in its spending prog
rams. President Johnson's
"War on Poverty" programs
provided a wealth of federal
funds for research on social
problems. SRI adapted to meet
the new challenge, hiring more
social scientists and expanding
its research facilities in these
areas. In 1967 and 1968, it re
ceived two of the largest
education-evaluation con
tracts ever given by the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare, to studv the Head
Start and Follow Through prog
rams. SRI also contracted heav
ily with state and local agencies
to study urban problems and
welfare programs.
When the "War on Poverty"
began to give way to the war in
Vietnam, however, SRI fol
lowed the action. It was in this
fourth phase of its history that
SRI followed the action a bit
too closely, perhaps, and con
sequently was nearly de
stroyed.
By 1968 , 71 per cent of SRl's
research was sponsored by
the federal government, and of
this, 73 percentwasformilitary
purposes. SRI was thus a
natural target of the anti-war
movement at Stanford Univer
sity. Concern about SRl's in
volvement in the war in South
east Asia began in 1965 when
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam discovered
that two of SRl's contracts in
volved chemical and biological
warfare research. Detailed
studies of the research were
published in Resistance news
paper in 1967, and the
Stanford chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
began covering the campus
with "We Accuse" posters of
the trustees.
"This stimulated talk, but
most people thought it was
outrageous at that time," ac
cording to Lenny Siegel, a
former member of the SDS
who was involved in the early
research on SRI. "In the fall of
1968," Siegel said, "the SDS
chapter decided to pursue a
campaign of getting Stanford
out of Southeast Asia."
On October 8, it tacked a list
of demands on the trustees'
door. In response, SRI Presi
dent Charles Anderson main
tained that government spon
sored research was "in the
public interest." Stanford's
Acting President Robert
Glaser, however, reacted more
positively, forming a student
faculty study committee to
look into SRl's activities and to
evaluate its ties with the Uni
versity.
On (anuary 14, about 50 stu
dents entered a closed trustees
meeting on campus and pre
sented a list of demands, in
cluding a demand for a
student-trustee forum. The
meeting was promptly ad
journed and 29 students were
later "tried" by the newly
formed Stanford (udicial
Council. "As a result of the
publicity about the hearing,
SDS was able to pressure five
trustees to appear at a forum
with students on March 11,
1969," Siegel said. About 1400
people attended the forum.
The trustees refused to agree
to an open meeting to discuss
the SRI study committee's re
commendations. "At that
forum, most of the students
present were convinced that
SDS was right that the trustees
were warmongers . . . they ag
reed that the trustees were
hypocritical," said Siegel.
From the sentiment built up
at that meeting, 14 liberal/
radical groups met in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on April 3.
About 800 people voted to de
mand, among other things,
that "SRI be brought under
tighter control by the Univer
sity, and that guidelines be es
tablished for socially accepta
ble research to be directly
applied to the SRI and the rest
of the Stanford community."
On April 15, the SRI study
committee finally issued its re
port, which recommended
that Stanford sever all ties with
SRI. A month later the trustees
adopted that recommenda
tion. A survey, however, indi
cated that two-thirds of the
students and one-third of the
faculty wanted SRI brought
under tighter control and con
verted to "socially construc
tive" work, as was voted at the
April 3 meeting.
Most of the staff at SRI fa
vored independence, accord
ing to Ron Deutsch, public in
formation officer at SRI. At the
time of the demonstration,
"the very existence of the or
ganization was threatened,"
Deutsch said, which made the
institute a "very insecure place
to work."
In opposition to the trustees'
decision, students at first
boycotted classes, then on
May 16, about 500 de
monstrators blocked access to
a branch of SRI on Hanover
Street. "Demonstrators
blocked traffic all morning and
ended up nearly destroying the
exterior," Siegel said. Nearly
200 police broke up the protest

with tear gas. Sixteen students
were arrested although "even
tually over 100 were arrested
afterward from photographs,"
Siegel said.
Seven months later, in
January 1970, the University
legally cut its ties with SRI. SRI
agreed to buy its indepen
dence from Stanford for $25
million, at the rate of one per
cent of its gross revenues be
ginning in 1971. SRI also agreed
to drop Stanford from its name
within five years, but was given
a two year extension in 1975,
due to a legal technicality. On
May 16,1977, the name was of
ficially changed to SRI Interna
tional.
SRI Public Information Of
ficer Ron Deutsch is con
vinced thai the split has been

good for SRI. "We have been
able to steer our own course,"
Deutsch said. "We have the
freedom to run our own or
ganization." There are still
close professional ties bet
ween the two organizations,
however, he said.
Its near-collision with disas
ter in the 1960s forced SRI to
take a closer look at its policies
and future goals. In 1976, after
"literally hundreds of discus
sion sessions with staff mem-

bers of all levels," the SRI
Board and Advisory Council
adopted a Statement of Corpo
rate Philosophy in which busi
ness and financial considera
tions are emphasized. "As an
institute, SRI has many charac
teristics that differentiate it
from other professional or
ganizations. It is motivated by
both ideals and economics,"
the statement says in part. Its
1976 Annual Report states that
"SRI survives by providing re
search, advisory and technical
services that its client organiza
tions need and for which they
are willing to pay." Concerning
its research in foreign coun
tries, the report states that "the
major emphasis in SRl's inter
national operation is given to
the advancement of private en
terprise and serving the in
terests of business organiza
tions throughout the world."
SRI today is a "much
changed organization" with a
"more diversified base of sup
port" than it had 10 years ago,
Deutsch claimed, pointing out
that Department of Defense
sponsored research is half
what it was in 1968. SRI offi
cials, however, attribute this
change to the economic need
to diversify its sources of sup
port, rather than to the pres
sure of anti-war groups in the
19605.
Lenny Siegel and other cri
tics are still concerned about
SRl's role in international af
fairs and are not convinced that
the split from Stanford brought
about any significant changes
in SRl's policies. "The split,"
Siegel said, "has allowed SRI to
keep up the dirty work it was
doing and it has also allowed
SRI to take over the classified
research going on at Stan
ford."
War research, such as elec
tronic warfare research, is still
going on, he claimed, and he
accused SRI of "building al
liances between repressive
governments in the Third
World, such as Indonesia and
Brazil, and American business
interests."
Nonetheless, Deutsch
claims that "clearly the trend is
toward increasing the volume
of federal research on pressing
social problems, including
health, transportation and
housing. A bigger and bigger
part of the budget is going to
cancer research. We are also
increasing our volume of work
in the area of business consult
ing. The volume of work for
military agencies remains
rather stable," he said, adding,
"we are proud of this."

forum, most of the students
present were convinced that
SDS was right that the trustees
were warmongers . . . they ag
reed that the trustees were
hypocritical," said Siegel.
From the sentiment built up
at that meeting, 14 liberal/
radical groups met in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on April 3.
About 800 people voted to de
mand, among other things,
that "SRI be brought under
tighter control by the Univer
sity, and that guidelines be es
tablished for socially accepta
ble research to be directly
applied to the SRI and the rest
of the Stanford community."
On April 15, the SRI study
committee finally issued its re
port, which recommended
that Stanford sever all ties with
SRI. A month later the trustees
adopted that recommenda
tion. A survey, however, indi
cated that two-thirds of the
students and one-third of the
faculty wanted SRI brought
under tighter control and con
verted to "socially construc
tive" work, as was voted at the
April 3 meeting.
Most of the staff at SRI fa
vored independence, accord
ing to Ron Deutsch, public in
formation officer at SRI. At the
time of the demonstration,
"the very existence of the or
ganization was threatened,"
Deutsch said, which made the
institute a "very insecure place
to work."
In opposition to the trustees'
decision, students at first
boycotted classes, then on
May 16, about 500 de
monstrators blocked access to
a branch of SRI on Hanover
Street. "Demonstrators
blocked traffic all morning and
ended up nearly destroying the
exterior," Siegel said. Nearly
200 police broke up the protest

with tear gas. Sixteen students
were arrested although "even
tually over 100 were arrested
afterward from photographs,"
Siegel said.
Seven months later, in
January 1970, the University
legally cut its ties with SRI. SRI
agreed to buy its indepen
dence from Stanford for $25
million, at the rate of one per
cent of its gross revenues be
ginning in 1971. SRI also agreed
to drop Stanford from its name
within five years, but was given
a two year extension in 1975,
due to a legal technicality. On
May 16,1977, the name was of
ficially changed to SRI Interna
tional.
SRI Public Information Of
ficer Ron Deutsch is con
vinced thai the split has been

good for SRI. "We have been
able to steer our own course,"
Deutsch said. "We have the
freedom to run our own or
ganization." There are still
close professional ties bet
ween the two organizations,
however, he said.
Its near-collision with disas
ter in the 1960s forced SRI to
take a closer look at its policies
and future goals. In 1976, after
"literally hundreds of discus
sion sessions with staff mem-

bers of all levels," the SRI
Board and Advisory Council
adopted a Statement of Corpo
rate Philosophy in which busi
ness and financial considera
tions are emphasized. "As an
institute, SRI has many charac
teristics that differentiate it
from other professional or
ganizations. It is motivated by
both ideals and economics,"
the statement says in part. Its
1976 Annual Report states that
"SRI survives by providing re
search, advisory and technical
services that its client organiza
tions need and for which they
are willing to pay." Concerning
its research in foreign coun
tries, the report states that "the
major emphasis in SRl's inter
national operation is given to
the advancement of private en
terprise and serving the in
terests of business organiza
tions throughout the world."
SRI today is a "much
changed organization" with a
"more diversified base of sup
port" than it had 10 years ago,
Deutsch claimed, pointing out
that Department of Defense
sponsored research is half
what it was in 1968. SRI offi
cials, however, attribute this
change to the economic need
to diversify its sources of sup
port, rather than to the pres
sure of anti-war groups in the
19605.
Lenny Siegel and other cri
tics are still concerned about
SRl's role in international af
fairs and are not convinced that
the split from Stanford brought
about any significant changes
in SRl's policies. "The split,"
Siegel said, "has allowed SRI to
keep up the dirty work it was
doing and it has also allowed
SRI to take over the classified
research going on at Stan
ford."
War research, such as elec
tronic warfare research, is still
going on, he claimed, and he
accused SRI of "building al
liances between repressive
governments in the Third
World, such as Indonesia and
Brazil, and American business
interests."
Nonetheless, Deutsch
claims that "clearly the trend is
toward increasing the volume
of federal research on pressing
social problems, including
health, transportation and
housing. A bigger and bigger
part of the budget is going to
cancer research. We are also
increasing our volume of work
in the area of business consult
ing. The volume of work for
military agencies remains
rather stable," he said, adding,
"we are proud of this."

gloom developed in some
quarters; it was clearly possi
ble that we would have to close
our doors." In the mid-19505,
SRl's financial situation
brightened when the federal
government, embroiled in the
Korean War, began to pour
money into the institute for
defense-related research. This
allowed SRI to "break even' fi
nancially, and was the begin
ning of a long and close rela
tionship with the federal gov
ernment as a key client.
In the 1960s SRI entered a
third phase. Although the ted
eral government remained its
key client, the government it
self was changing and a new
administration was shifting
emphasis in its spending prog
rams. President Johnson's
"War on Poverty" programs
provided a wealth of federal
funds for research on social
problems. SRI adapted to meet
the new challenge, hiring more
social scientists and expanding
its research facilities in these
areas. In 1967 and 1968, it re
ceived two of the largest
education-evaluation con
tracts ever given by the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare, to studv the Head
Start and Follow Through prog
rams. SRI also contracted heav
ily with state and local agencies
to study urban problems and
welfare programs.
When the "War on Poverty"
began to give way to the war in
Vietnam, however, SRI fol
lowed the action. It was in this
fourth phase of its history that
SRI followed the action a bit
too closely, perhaps, and con
sequently was nearly de
stroyed.
By 1968 , 71 per cent of SRl's
research was sponsored by
the federal government, and of
this, 73 percentwasformilitary
purposes. SRI was thus a
natural target of the anti-war
movement at Stanford Univer
sity. Concern about SRl's in
volvement in the war in South
east Asia began in 1965 when
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam discovered
that two of SRl's contracts in
volved chemical and biological
warfare research. Detailed
studies of the research were
published in Resistance news
paper in 1967, and the
Stanford chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
began covering the campus
with "We Accuse" posters of
the trustees.
"This stimulated talk, but
most people thought it was
outrageous at that time," ac
cording to Lenny Siegel, a
former member of the SDS
who was involved in the early
research on SRI. "In the fall of
1968," Siegel said, "the SDS
chapter decided to pursue a
campaign of getting Stanford
out of Southeast Asia."
On October 8, it tacked a list
of demands on the trustees'
door. In response, SRI Presi
dent Charles Anderson main
tained that government spon
sored research was "in the
public interest." Stanford's
Acting President Robert
Glaser, however, reacted more
positively, forming a student
faculty study committee to
look into SRl's activities and to
evaluate its ties with the Uni
versity.
On (anuary 14, about 50 stu
dents entered a closed trustees
meeting on campus and pre
sented a list of demands, in
cluding a demand for a
student-trustee forum. The
meeting was promptly ad
journed and 29 students were
later "tried" by the newly
formed Stanford (udicial
Council. "As a result of the
publicity about the hearing,
SDS was able to pressure five
trustees to appear at a forum
with students on March 11,
1969," Siegel said. About 1400
people attended the forum.
The trustees refused to agree
to an open meeting to discuss
the SRI study committee's re
commendations. "At that
forum, most of the students
present were convinced that
SDS was right that the trustees
were warmongers . . . they ag

port" than it had 10 years ago,
Deutsch claimed, pointing out
that Department of Defense
sponsored research is half
what it was in 1968. SRI offi
cials, however, attribute this
change to the economic need
to diversify its sources of sup
port, rather than to the pres
sure of anti-war groups in the
19605.
Lenny Siegel and other cri
tics are still concerned about
SRl's role in international af
fairs and are not convinced that
the split from Stanford brought
about any significant changes
in SRl's policies. "The split,"
Siegel said, "has allowed SRI to
keep up the dirty work it was
doing and it has also allowed
SRI to take over the classified
research going on at Stan
ford."
War research, such as elec
tronic warfare research, is still
going on, he claimed, and he
accused SRI of "building al
liances between repressive
governments in the Third
World, such as Indonesia and
Brazil, and American business
interests."
Nonetheless, Deutsch
claims that "clearly the trend is
toward increasing the volume
of federal research on pressing
social problems, including
health, transportation and
housing. A bigger and bigger
part of the budget is going to
cancer research. We are also
increasing our volume of work
in the area of business consult
ing. The volume of work for
military agencies remains
rather stable," he said, adding,
"we are proud of this."

gloom developed in some
quarters; it was clearly possi
ble that we would have to close
our doors." In the mid-19505,
SRl's financial situation
brightened when the federal
government, embroiled in the
Korean War, began to pour
money into the institute for
defense-related research. This
allowed SRI to "break even' fi
nancially, and was the begin
ning of a long and close rela
tionship with the federal gov
ernment as a key client.
In the 1960s SRI entered a
third phase. Although the ted
eral government remained its
key client, the government it
self was changing and a new
administration was shifting
emphasis in its spending prog
rams. President Johnson's
"War on Poverty" programs
provided a wealth of federal
funds for research on social
problems. SRI adapted to meet
the new challenge, hiring more
social scientists and expanding
its research facilities in these
areas. In 1967 and 1968, it re
ceived two of the largest
education-evaluation con
tracts ever given by the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare, to studv the Head
Start and Follow Through prog
rams. SRI also contracted heav
ily with state and local agencies
to study urban problems and
welfare programs.
When the "War on Poverty"
began to give way to the war in
Vietnam, however, SRI fol
lowed the action. It was in this
fourth phase of its history that
SRI followed the action a bit
too closely, perhaps, and con
sequently was nearly de
stroyed.
By 1968 , 71 per cent of SRl's
research was sponsored by
the federal government, and of
this, 73 percentwasformilitary
purposes. SRI was thus a
natural target of the anti-war
movement at Stanford Univer
sity. Concern about SRl's in
volvement in the war in South
east Asia began in 1965 when
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam discovered
that two of SRl's contracts in
volved chemical and biological
warfare research. Detailed
studies of the research were
published in Resistance news
paper in 1967, and the
Stanford chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
began covering the campus
with "We Accuse" posters of
the trustees.
"This stimulated talk, but
most people thought it was
outrageous at that time," ac
cording to Lenny Siegel, a
former member of the SDS
who was involved in the early
research on SRI. "In the fall of
1968," Siegel said, "the SDS
chapter decided to pursue a
campaign of getting Stanford
out of Southeast Asia."
On October 8, it tacked a list
of demands on the trustees'
door. In response, SRI Presi
dent Charles Anderson main
tained that government spon
sored research was "in the
public interest." Stanford's
Acting President Robert
Glaser, however, reacted more
positively, forming a student
faculty study committee to
look into SRl's activities and to
evaluate its ties with the Uni
versity.
On (anuary 14, about 50 stu
dents entered a closed trustees
meeting on campus and pre
sented a list of demands, in
cluding a demand for a
student-trustee forum. The
meeting was promptly ad
journed and 29 students were
later "tried" by the newly
formed Stanford (udicial
Council. "As a result of the
publicity about the hearing,
SDS was able to pressure five
trustees to appear at a forum
with students on March 11,
1969," Siegel said. About 1400
people attended the forum.
The trustees refused to agree
to an open meeting to discuss
the SRI study committee's re
commendations. "At that
forum, most of the students
present were convinced that
SDS was right that the trustees
were warmongers . . . they ag
reed that the trustees were
hypocritical," said Siegel.
From the sentiment built up
at that meeting, 14 liberal/
radical groups met in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on April 3.
About 800 people voted to de
mand, among other things,
that "SRI be brought under
tighter control by the Univer
sity, and that guidelines be es
tablished for socially accepta
ble research to be directly
applied to the SRI and the rest
of the Stanford community."
On April 15, the SRI study
committee finally issued its re
port, which recommended
that Stanford sever all ties with
SRI. A month later the trustees
adopted that recommenda
tion. A survey, however, indi
cated that two-thirds of the
students and one-third of the
faculty wanted SRI brought
under tighter control and con
verted to "socially construc
tive" work, as was voted at the
April 3 meeting.
Most of the staff at SRI fa
vored independence, accord
ing to Ron Deutsch, public in
formation officer at SRI. At the
time of the demonstration,
"the very existence of the or
ganization was threatened,"
Deutsch said, which made the
institute a "very insecure place
to work."
In opposition to the trustees'
decision, students at first
boycotted classes, then on
May 16, about 500 de
monstrators blocked access to
a branch of SRI on Hanover
Street. "Demonstrators
blocked traffic all morning and
ended up nearly destroying the
exterior," Siegel said. Nearly
200 police broke up the protest

with tear gas. Sixteen students
were arrested although "even
tually over 100 were arrested
afterward from photographs,"
Siegel said.
Seven months later, in
January 1970, the University
legally cut its ties with SRI. SRI
agreed to buy its indepen
dence from Stanford for $25
million, at the rate of one per
cent of its gross revenues be
ginning in 1971. SRI also agreed
to drop Stanford from its name
within five years, but was given
a two year extension in 1975,
due to a legal technicality. On
May 16,1977, the name was of
ficially changed to SRI Interna
tional.
SRI Public Information Of
ficer Ron Deutsch is con
vinced thai the split has been

good for SRI. "We have been
able to steer our own course,"
Deutsch said. "We have the
freedom to run our own or
ganization." There are still
close professional ties bet
ween the two organizations,
however, he said.
Its near-collision with disas
ter in the 1960s forced SRI to
take a closer look at its policies
and future goals. In 1976, after
"literally hundreds of discus
sion sessions with staff mem-

bers of all levels," the SRI
Board and Advisory Council
adopted a Statement of Corpo
rate Philosophy in which busi
ness and financial considera
tions are emphasized. "As an
institute, SRI has many charac
teristics that differentiate it
from other professional or
ganizations. It is motivated by
both ideals and economics,"
the statement says in part. Its
1976 Annual Report states that
"SRI survives by providing re
search, advisory and technical
services that its client organiza
tions need and for which they
are willing to pay." Concerning
its research in foreign coun
tries, the report states that "the
major emphasis in SRl's inter
national operation is given to
the advancement of private en
terprise and serving the in
terests of business organiza
tions throughout the world."
SRI today is a "much
changed organization" with a
"more diversified base of sup

"This stimulated talk, but
most people thought it was
outrageous at that time," ac
cording to Lenny Siegel, a
former member of the SDS
who was involved in the early
research on SRI. "In the fall of
1968," Siegel said, "the SDS
chapter decided to pursue a
campaign of getting Stanford
out of Southeast Asia."
On October 8, it tacked a list
of demands on the trustees'
door. In response, SRI Presi
dent Charles Anderson main
tained that government spon
sored research was "in the
public interest." Stanford's
Acting President Robert
Glaser, however, reacted more
positively, forming a student
faculty study committee to
look into SRl's activities and to
evaluate its ties with the Uni
versity.
On (anuary 14, about 50 stu
dents entered a closed trustees
meeting on campus and pre
sented a list of demands, in
cluding a demand for a
student-trustee forum. The
meeting was promptly ad
journed and 29 students were
later "tried" by the newly
formed Stanford (udicial
Council. "As a result of the
publicity about the hearing,
SDS was able to pressure five
trustees to appear at a forum
with students on March 11,
1969," Siegel said. About 1400
people attended the forum.
The trustees refused to agree
to an open meeting to discuss
the SRI study committee's re
commendations. "At that
forum, most of the students
present were convinced that
SDS was right that the trustees
were warmongers . . . they ag
reed that the trustees were
hypocritical," said Siegel.
From the sentiment built up
at that meeting, 14 liberal/
radical groups met in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on April 3.
About 800 people voted to de
mand, among other things,
that "SRI be brought under
tighter control by the Univer
sity, and that guidelines be es
tablished for socially accepta
ble research to be directly
applied to the SRI and the rest
of the Stanford community."
On April 15, the SRI study
committee finally issued its re
port, which recommended
that Stanford sever all ties with
SRI. A month later the trustees
adopted that recommenda
tion. A survey, however, indi
cated that two-thirds of the
students and one-third of the
faculty wanted SRI brought
under tighter control and con
verted to "socially construc
tive" work, as was voted at the
April 3 meeting.
Most of the staff at SRI fa
vored independence, accord
ing to Ron Deutsch, public in
formation officer at SRI. At the
time of the demonstration,
"the very existence of the or
ganization was threatened,"
Deutsch said, which made the
institute a "very insecure place
to work."
In opposition to the trustees'
decision, students at first
boycotted classes, then on
May 16, about 500 de
monstrators blocked access to
a branch of SRI on Hanover
Street. "Demonstrators
blocked traffic all morning and
ended up nearly destroying the
exterior," Siegel said. Nearly
200 police broke up the protest

with tear gas. Sixteen students
were arrested although "even
tually over 100 were arrested
afterward from photographs,"
Siegel said.
Seven months later, in
January 1970, the University
legally cut its ties with SRI. SRI
agreed to buy its indepen
dence from Stanford for $25
million, at the rate of one per
cent of its gross revenues be
ginning in 1971. SRI also agreed
to drop Stanford from its name
within five years, but was given
a two year extension in 1975,
due to a legal technicality. On
May 16,1977, the name was of
ficially changed to SRI Interna
tional.
SRI Public Information Of
ficer Ron Deutsch is con
vinced thai the split has been

good for SRI. "We have been
able to steer our own course,"
Deutsch said. "We have the
freedom to run our own or
ganization." There are still
close professional ties bet
ween the two organizations,
however, he said.
Its near-collision with disas
ter in the 1960s forced SRI to
take a closer look at its policies
and future goals. In 1976, after
"literally hundreds of discus
sion sessions with staff mem-

bers of all levels," the SRI
Board and Advisory Council
adopted a Statement of Corpo
rate Philosophy in which busi
ness and financial considera
tions are emphasized. "As an
institute, SRI has many charac
teristics that differentiate it
from other professional or
ganizations. It is motivated by
both ideals and economics,"
the statement says in part. Its
1976 Annual Report states that
"SRI survives by providing re
search, advisory and technical
services that its client organiza
tions need and for which they
are willing to pay." Concerning
its research in foreign coun
tries, the report states that "the
major emphasis in SRl's inter
national operation is given to
the advancement of private en
terprise and serving the in
terests of business organiza
tions throughout the world."
SRI today is a "much
changed organization" with a
"more diversified base of sup
port" than it had 10 years ago,
Deutsch claimed, pointing out
that Department of Defense
sponsored research is half
what it was in 1968. SRI offi
cials, however, attribute this
change to the economic need
to diversify its sources of sup
port, rather than to the pres
sure of anti-war groups in the
19605.
Lenny Siegel and other cri
tics are still concerned about
SRl's role in international af
fairs and are not convinced that
the split from Stanford brought
about any significant changes
in SRl's policies. "The split,"
Siegel said, "has allowed SRI to
keep up the dirty work it was
doing and it has also allowed
SRI to take over the classified
research going on at Stan
ford."
War research, such as elec
tronic warfare research, is still
going on, he claimed, and he
accused SRI of "building al
liances between repressive
governments in the Third
World, such as Indonesia and
Brazil, and American business
interests."
Nonetheless, Deutsch
claims that "clearly the trend is
toward increasing the volume
of federal research on pressing
social problems, including
health, transportation and
housing. A bigger and bigger
part of the budget is going to
cancer research. We are also
increasing our volume of work
in the area of business consult
ing. The volume of work for
military agencies remains
rather stable," he said, adding,
"we are proud of this."

gloom developed in some
quarters; it was clearly possi
ble that we would have to close
our doors." In the mid-19505,
SRl's financial situation
brightened when the federal
government, embroiled in the
Korean War, began to pour
money into the institute for
defense-related research. This
allowed SRI to "break even' fi
nancially, and was the begin
ning of a long and close rela
tionship with the federal gov
ernment as a key client.
In the 1960s SRI entered a
third phase. Although the ted
eral government remained its
key client, the government it
self was changing and a new
administration was shifting
emphasis in its spending prog
rams. President Johnson's
"War on Poverty" programs
provided a wealth of federal
funds for research on social
problems. SRI adapted to meet
the new challenge, hiring more
social scientists and expanding
its research facilities in these
areas. In 1967 and 1968, it re
ceived two of the largest
education-evaluation con
tracts ever given by the De
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare, to studv the Head
Start and Follow Through prog
rams. SRI also contracted heav
ily with state and local agencies
to study urban problems and
welfare programs.
When the "War on Poverty"
began to give way to the war in
Vietnam, however, SRI fol
lowed the action. It was in this
fourth phase of its history that
SRI followed the action a bit
too closely, perhaps, and con
sequently was nearly de
stroyed.
By 1968 , 71 per cent of SRl's
research was sponsored by
the federal government, and of
this, 73 percentwasformilitary
purposes. SRI was thus a
natural target of the anti-war
movement at Stanford Univer
sity. Concern about SRl's in
volvement in the war in South
east Asia began in 1965 when
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam discovered
that two of SRl's contracts in
volved chemical and biological
warfare research. Detailed
studies of the research were
published in Resistance news
paper in 1967, and the
Stanford chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
began covering the campus
with "We Accuse" posters of
the trustees.

ficially changed to SRI Interna
tional.
SRI Public Information Of
ficer Ron Deutsch is con
vinced thai the split has been

good for SRI. "We have been
able to steer our own course,"
Deutsch said. "We have the
freedom to run our own or
ganization." There are still
close professional ties bet
ween the two organizations,
however, he said.
Its near-collision with disas
ter in the 1960s forced SRI to
take a closer look at its policies
and future goals. In 1976, after
"literally hundreds of discus
sion sessions with staff mem-

bers of all levels," the SRI
Board and Advisory Council
adopted a Statement of Corpo
rate Philosophy in which busi
ness and financial considera
tions are emphasized. "As an
institute, SRI has many charac
teristics that differentiate it
from other professional or
ganizations. It is motivated by
both ideals and economics,"
the statement says in part. Its
1976 Annual Report states that
"SRI survives by providing re
search, advisory and technical
services that its client organiza
tions need and for which they
are willing to pay." Concerning
its research in foreign coun
tries, the report states that "the
major emphasis in SRl's inter
national operation is given to
the advancement of private en
terprise and serving the in
terests of business organiza
tions throughout the world."
SRI today is a "much
changed organization" with a
"more diversified base of sup
port" than it had 10 years ago,
Deutsch claimed, pointing out
that Department of Defense
sponsored research is half
what it was in 1968. SRI offi
cials, however, attribute this
change to the economic need
to diversify its sources of sup
port, rather than to the pres
sure of anti-war groups in the
19605.
Lenny Siegel and other cri
tics are still concerned about
SRl's role in international af
fairs and are not convinced that
the split from Stanford brought
about any significant changes
in SRl's policies. "The split,"
Siegel said, "has allowed SRI to
keep up the dirty work it was
doing and it has also allowed
SRI to take over the classified
research going on at Stan
ford."
War research, such as elec
tronic warfare research, is still
going on, he claimed, and he
accused SRI of "building al
liances between repressive
governments in the Third
World, such as Indonesia and
Brazil, and American business
interests."
Nonetheless, Deutsch
claims that "clearly the trend is
toward increasing the volume
of federal research on pressing
social problems, including
health, transportation and
housing. A bigger and bigger
part of the budget is going to
cancer research. We are also
increasing our volume of work
in the area of business consult
ing. The volume of work for
military agencies remains
rather stable," he said, adding,
"we are proud of this."
