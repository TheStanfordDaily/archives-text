PERSONALS
There once was a frat named KA
The boys, we all thought were gay
They had champagne and roses
And smoke in their noses
And Lambda Nu proved it could play
Hell Week is quite an occasion
The boys all think it's vacation
But nudies must study
Though eggs are quite cruddy
So we started a commando invasion
Hell week is now at its end
We re losing a late-night friend
The RA used threats
But we have no regrets
Let's hope we're not starting a trend
Love and kisses, the nudies

PERSONALS
There once was a frat named KA
The boys, we all thought were gay
They had champagne and roses
And smoke in their noses
And Lambda Nu proved it could play
Hell Week is quite an occasion
The boys all think it's vacation
But nudies must study
Though eggs are quite cruddy
So we started a commando invasion
Hell week is now at its end
We re losing a late-night friend
The RA used threats
But we have no regrets
Let's hope we're not starting a trend
Love and kisses, the nudies
