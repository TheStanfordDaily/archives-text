### George Anders 
All five Council of President nomi
nations for an Elections Review
Board were approved by the ASSU
Senate last night.
The board, created by the Senate
Tuesday, will examine alleged ir
regularities in last month's senate
campaigns, and has power to dis
qualify senators it finds guilty of elec
tions rules violations.
Last night's 3Vi hour meeting was
interrupted at 8 p.m. by a two-song
performance from the Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band.
Three of the nominees, education
graduate student Bill Washburn,
senior Dave Carlson and sophomore
Dorothy Parrish, were approved with
little controversy.
However, former Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Deric Jennings
received the bare minimum of votes
needed to be seated on the board,
and senior Mark Sexton was origi
nally rejected before the senate ap

proved him on a revote.
Three-quarters senate approval
was needed to seat Elections Review
Board (ERB) members. Jennings was
approved by a 12-4 vote, with three
abstentions.
Senate Chairperson Fred Crethels
ruled that abstentions were not to be
included in the three-fourths com
putations, and was upheld following
a challenge by Sen. Howard Wolf.
Alternate Sen. Rob Docters had as
serted that Jennings "was not going
to be able to separate himself" from
his ASSU background.
Senators expressed concern over
whether Sexton would be biased be
cause of what he had read in the
Daily about the election and because
he had served as senate parliamenta
rian two years ago.
"Only one person bothers me and
that's Mark Sexton," Alternate Sen.
Al Miner said. "His opinions appear
clearly formed."
Sexton's nomination initially failed
to receive a three-quarters vote,
drawing 11 yessand six nos.However,
Sexton was passed 12-3 on a second
count.
Alternate Sen. David Catanzarite,
one of the persons who voted no on
the first Sexton vote, then switched
to a yes on the second vote, said he
"wasn't quite sure" about Sexton's
positions before the first vote, but
talked to him between votes and re
ceived some clarifications.
Catanzarite said he "didn't even
hear" an announcement by Co
president Steve Westly between
votes that he believed the next two
nominees, who would be consi
dered if Sexton were rejected, had
"become disgusted and left."
Westly said the COP had talked to

about 30 persons who wanted to
serve on the ERB. "There were a lot of
good people," he said.
Co-president Anne Henkels said
honesty and fairness were the COP's
chief standards of selection. She said
the COP also looked for persons with
"no future political ambition."
The Band's appearance drew
smiles and hand clapping from many
senators. However, Sen. Wolf, who
was interrupted by the concert, said
"I was not amused by the last inci
dent," and added that if the Band
stages a similar incident again, "I in
tend to remember it the next time the
Band asks for a fee assessment."
Carlsen's nomination was passed
15-1, Parrish was passed 15-0 and
Washburn was passed 16-0.
Prior to quizzing the nominees,
Senators debated whether to ask
Westly to disclose names of the
COP's next five recommendations.
Senator Wayne Herriford expres
sed concern that if the senate knew
who the alternate nominees were,
the approval process might turn into
"a popularity contest." The disclo
sure proposal failed on a voice vote,
with only Wolf favoring the measure.
The senate will next meet Nov. 10
at which time it will hear the deci
sions of the ERB.
Immediately following the meet
ing, new ERB members announced
they would hold their first meeting
today. At deadline, no time or place
had been set.
One item the ERB will review is a
recommendation from Election
Commissioner Sean Murphy that
two senators and several alternate
senators be disqualified for exceed
ing the $50 per candidate spending
limit.

rian two years ago.
"Only one person bothers me and
that's Mark Sexton," Alternate Sen.
Al Miner said. "His opinions appear
clearly formed."
Sexton's nomination initially failed
to receive a three-quarters vote,
drawing 11 yessand six nos.However,
Sexton was passed 12-3 on a second
count.
Alternate Sen. David Catanzarite,
one of the persons who voted no on
the first Sexton vote, then switched
to a yes on the second vote, said he
"wasn't quite sure" about Sexton's
positions before the first vote, but
talked to him between votes and re
ceived some clarifications.
Catanzarite said he "didn't even
hear" an announcement by Co
president Steve Westly between
votes that he believed the next two
nominees, who would be consi
dered if Sexton were rejected, had
"become disgusted and left."
Westly said the COP had talked to

about 30 persons who wanted to
serve on the ERB. "There were a lot of
good people," he said.
Co-president Anne Henkels said
honesty and fairness were the COP's
chief standards of selection. She said
the COP also looked for persons with
"no future political ambition."
The Band's appearance drew
smiles and hand clapping from many
senators. However, Sen. Wolf, who
was interrupted by the concert, said
"I was not amused by the last inci
dent," and added that if the Band
stages a similar incident again, "I in
tend to remember it the next time the
Band asks for a fee assessment."
Carlsen's nomination was passed
15-1, Parrish was passed 15-0 and
Washburn was passed 16-0.
Prior to quizzing the nominees,
Senators debated whether to ask
Westly to disclose names of the
COP's next five recommendations.
Senator Wayne Herriford expres
sed concern that if the senate knew
who the alternate nominees were,
the approval process might turn into
"a popularity contest." The disclo
sure proposal failed on a voice vote,
with only Wolf favoring the measure.
The senate will next meet Nov. 10
at which time it will hear the deci
sions of the ERB.
Immediately following the meet
ing, new ERB members announced
they would hold their first meeting
today. At deadline, no time or place
had been set.
One item the ERB will review is a
recommendation from Election
