## World hunger and the Day of Fasting 
### 
Steve Crane

From the American womb where a
meal or a junk food snack is rarely
more than an arm's length away for
most of us, chronic hunger seems
irrelevant to our everyday lives. Sur
rounded by food, we are insulated
from hunger; we are not touched by
it, and rarely even think about it.

But world hunger is real. Hun
dreds of thousands of children and
adults in even this land of plenty are
severely undernourished, suffering
from a variety of physical and mental
illnesses as a direct result. If the
human carnage due to hunger in this
country is malnutrition and disease,
the toll worldwide is starvation and
death.
The magnitude of the tragedy is
crushing; 460 million people are
permanently hungry right now,
people whose bodies cannot func
tion properly, and whose lives are
dominated by an often losing strug
gle for enough to eat.
I wish I could say that the Day of
Fasting at Stanford would solve the
problem, or alleviate the suffering of
those millions trapped in starving
bodies. But it won't. Our efforts on
Thursday, Nov. 17, will unfortunately
leave the world practically as hungry
as it was on Wednesday.
Why, then, do I urge everyone in
the Stanford community to partici
pate in the fast? For two reasons: to
make each of us more aware of the
implications of our own food con
sumption habits, and to raise money
for a wide range of food relief or
other aid organizations.
Empty cliche
The Day of Fasting should not be
viewed as an opportunity for us to
raise our collective "conscious
ness." Besides being an empty
cliche, "consciousness" raisings are
often nothing more than misdirected
attempts to gain some satisfaction
from a public display of "nobility," or
"solidarity" with the suffering mas
ses. Quite frankly, going hungry on

Nov. 17 is not likely to give any of us
even a remote understanding of
what it means to be starving, or
chronically malnourished.
It will, however, hopefully break
our own daily eating habits long
enough to perhaps notice what those
habits are. How much of our food
consumption is simply routine, or
prompted-by social obligation, and
how much for nourishing bodies?
How inefficient are our eating
habits?
Do we consume energy-inten
sive processed foods even when
more nourishing and less expensive
foods are available? How much food,
and with it energy, do we simply
waste, flushing it down sinks or
throwing it into garbage that must
somehow be disposed of? Breaking
our eating cycle for just one day on
the Day of Fasting may be enough for
us to notice.
Money raised
The Day of Fasting has another ex
tremely important function; to raise
money. Last year over $4000 was do
nated by students, faculty, and staff
to 10 different organizations working
on various aspects of the hunger
problem, including UNICEF, CARE,
OXFAM, and African Famine Relief.
These organizations represent a
wide range of relief efforts. OXFAM,
for instance, supports a number of
self-help programs worldwide, in
cluding a project aimed at changing
women's roles in food production
and health care in Bangladesh.
UNICEF is a U.N. sponsored
group, concerned with the health,
education, and social well-being of

children and their parents. Accord
ing to UNICEF figures, 35 cents buys
a mother and child vitamins for four
months, $12 buys a midwife's kit, and
$20 vaccinates 1750 children.
These organizations provide much
needed aid, but require direct sup
port from people like us to continue
or expand their efforts. We all have
an opportunity on the Day of Fasting
to give that support. For students eat
ing in the food service, a donation of
over $2 can be made to any relief
organization by surrendering a meal
card to the food service for the day.
Sign-ups for this will be on Nov. 8-9
in the dining halls, at which time stu
dents can designate the organiza
tions to which they want their money
to go. Off-campus students,
graduate students, faculty and staff
can make donations on the Day of
Fasting in White Plaza, or to the
Committee on Hunger anytime be
fore or after, which will distribute all
the donated funds according to the
donors' preferences.
Additional contributions
Last year, several concerned resi
dences and fraternities make addi
tional contributions from their social
funds Hopefully, other groups this
year will join them, giving to world
hunger on the Day of Fasting what
would have been spent on soft
drinks and munchies for a study
break.
Take a step. It is a mistake to be
lieve that because our energies are
incremental they have no meaning.
They do.
