The Weight Room
The weight room, located in En
cina Gym, is used and enjoyed by
over 1200 members of the Stanford
community. Compared to other
campus athletic facilities, it ranks
second in total usage only to de-
Cuerre pools, yet the problems of
this popular facility continue to be
largely overlooked by the Athletic
Dept.
At present, the weight room suf
fers from overcrowding and in
adequate facilities during peak
periods (3-6 p.m. Monday-Friday).
The situation is aggravated when var
sity teams choose to use the room
during peak periods, forcing the
majority of users to either alter or
curtail their workout schedules.
Overcrowding of the weight room
is dangerous as well as disruptive.
Weightlifting requires a certain
amount of space surrounding the lif
ter to insure that nothing hampers
his or her mobility. When this space
is reduced through overcrowding,
accidents can result.
A larger facility is the most obvious
solution, although the Athletic Dept.
claims that a larger space is unavaila
ble and will not be for some time. As
an alternative, overcrowding could
be reduced within the present facility
simply by rescheduling the varsity
teams' visits so as not to conflict with
the majority of users.
For the amount of interest it gen
erates, the weight room is wholly in
adequate. One thing it lacks is a
complete assortment of barbells and
dumbbells, an essential part of any
well equipped weight room. If the
Athletic Dept. could be persuaded to

invest only one dollar in the weight
room for each of its 1200 users, the
quality of this facility would be up
graded considerably.
It is time for the Athletic Dept. to
recognize the widespread popularity
of weightlifting and weight training
on the campus. Stanford weight
room users deserve a spacious and
well equipped facility in which to
pursue their sport.

Stats manipulated
In recent years, the Arab campaign
against Israel has assumed a new
style. Less loaded with diatribe, the
pitch now relies on "reasonable"
sounding, low key moralisms that
twist truth and history at will. Our
Jordanian friend, Sami Suleiman,
gives us a fine example in "The Pales
tine problem â€” a short history"
(Daily, Oct. 13).
Statistics are easy to manipulate,
and Suleiman does so without re
straint. To say there were over one
million Arabs and about 500,000 Jews
in Palestine in 1940 is meaningless.
The relevant fact is that Jews out
numbered Arabs in the portion of
Palestine granted to Israel under the
1947 partition plan. The rest of Pales
tine was to be an Arab state, but Jor
dan and Egypt gobbled that up in the
1948 war.
Incidentally, the high Arab birth
rate was not the principal reason for
the inordinately rapid growth of the
Palestinian Arab population prior to
1940. Before the Jews began to arrive,
the region was a mix of malaria
ridden swamps and semi-arid lands,

able to support only a relatively small
population. The Jewish settlers
cleared out the swamps, founding
farms and cities. The resultant supply
of jobs attracted large numbers of
itinerant Arabs from other regions.
Suleiman propagates the myth that
Jewish atrocities and terror moti
vated the Palestinian Arab flight.
Sure, it was a tumultuous time, with
both Jews and Arabs living in fear.
But compounding that fear was the
knowledge that the armies of Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon
planned to march through and carve
up Palestine as soon as Israel gained
independence. Many Palestinian
Arabs thought they could move out
of the way while those armies took
care of the local "Jewish problem."
With nowhere else to go, their backs
to the sea, the Jews had no choice
but to stand and fight. Those Jews
and Arabs with the courage to stay
formed the modern, democratic soc
iety of Israel. Those who left were
kept in squalid camps, to be used by
their Arab "brothers" as political
pawns.
Suleiman's column is a "short his
tory" only because he conveniently
ignores most of the relevant history
of Palestine. The full story clearly
shows that the cause of today's
"Palestinian problem" is not Jewish
terror or expansionism. It is the un
willingness of the Arab states to live
in peace with a Jewish neighbor, and
it is the cruelty of Egypt, Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon, who have concen
trated so many Palestinians in camps
for political purposes.
