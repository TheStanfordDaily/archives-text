# Big Brothers and Sisters
## Being more than just a friend

The smell of hot dogs and
baked beans wafted over the
sun drenched trees of Kelly
Park in San Jose. Among the
low trees, eager youngsters
were trying their luck at ringing
soda bottles, tossing balls into
* tic-tac-toe formations and spit
ting out prune seeds.
Big Brothers and Big Sis
- ters, an agency dedicated to
providing adult friendship and
guidance for fatherless boys or
motherless girls, was doing its
part last month to bring kids
and adult volunteers together.
The picnic-carnival at Kelly
112 Park attracted about 150 per
-5 sons — Big Brothers and Big
J Sisters who split their time
' running the dozen or so game
. booths and accompanying
| their Little Brothers and Sisters
' as they won huge stuffed ani
« mals and other prizes.
! "Our Big Brothers and Sis
j ters range in age from 19 on up.
» We'd like to get the colleges
\ and universities in the area in
j volved in Big Brothers and Big
* Sisters, too. We'd like to see
! clubs or fraternities take on Big
] Brothers as a special charity,"
i said Fernando Valcarcel,
I community relations person
* with Big Brothers and Big Sis
* ters.
} Waiting list
; "We can't work without vol
< unteers. You can get X amount
\ of money but without volun
* teers, the childrens' waiting list
> continues to grow. Some kids

have to wait up to a year for a
Big Brother or Big Sister," Val
carcel said.
Big Brothers of Santa Clara
County was started six years
ago. Big Sisters has been in
existence for 10 years. The two
programs merged in August
and its staff has increased from
about four persons in 1976 to
17 persons today. There is an
office in San Jose and a satellite
office in Sunnyvale.
Valcarcel estimated that
there are now over 150 Big and
Little Brother matches and over
100 Big and Little Sister
matches in Santa Clara County.
The non-profit, United
Way-funded agency has served
"about a thousand" fatherless
boys, according to Chuck
Schmidt, executive director of
the agency.
Companions needed
"There are about 18,000
fatherless boys in the county,"
said Schmidt. "There are many
single parent homes here.
Working mothers are raising
families. The boys need male
companionship."
Valcarcel said mothers often
come to the agency inquiring
about getting a Big Brother for
their sons. Social workers,
public health nurses, school
counselors, and juvenile prob
ation officers also refer boys
and girls to the agency in the
hopes of finding an interested
adult Brother or Sister for
them.
Big Brother and Big Sister is

not in competition with other
similar programs, such as the
Stanford Youth Program where
students befriend youths and
participate in activities with
them, Valcarcel said.
"The essence of our prog
ram is to help kids. If more kids
are getting served by a number
of organizations, great. In real
ity, I think there's a more
cooperative feeling then a
competitive feeling between
our agency and other prog
rams," Valcarcel said.
Screening
Volunteers go through an in
tensive six weeks of interviews
with agency social workers.
The volunteer's background
and attitude are carefully con
sidered, before the volunteer
is matched with ayoung friend,
said Schmidt.
The agency looks for a wide
range of volunteers of all
backgrounds, said Valcarcel.
Big Brothers and Sisters must
be with their younger friends at
least once a week.
"I didn't know Big Brothers
and Big Sisters existed until I
talked to a friend who was a Big
Sister at the tennis club last
year," said Big Sister Ann An
tonelli, a secretary for an
aerospace company in Sun
nyvale.
"I am so pleased with the
way it's turned out. It's reward
ing and fun to be with Linda,"
she said as she glanced at her
Little Sister who was ooh-ing
over her carnival grab-bag.

Antonelli joined Big Sisters
last October but did not get
matched with a Little Sister
until February.
"I was not apprehensive
about being a Big Sister," said
Antonelli.
"I was very specific about the
kind of sister I wanted. I was an
only child myself and I always
wanted a sister about 11 years
old."
Bake cookies
"She really needs a woman
to be with her. We like to go
out a lot, to a matinee or to
Great America, or sometimes
we just bake cookies at my
place. Big Sisters just spend
what they can afford," she
said.
Bob Cooper has been as
sociated with Big Brothers in
various counties for 14 years.
Lie's been with the Santa Clara
chapter for three years.
"I'm single, I enjoy young
people and helping them out,"
said Cooper, who works at a
junior high school library.
David, 11, sat next to Cooper
munching on a hot dog.
"You've got to have pati
ence, and like doing things
with your little brother," said
Cooper.
Karen (not her real name) is
15 years old and a student at

San Jose High School. She is a
Little Sister, but was right in
there working in the stuffed
animal booth.
"You really want to know
how I became a Little Sister?"
asked Karen, her eyes glancing
to the ground ever so briefly.
"Well, last year I tried to kill
myself. I needed help," she
said. Bonny Ohlmeyer was that
help.

Ohlmeyer, 23, a fulltime
sales correspondent for a
semi-conductor corporation in
Mountain View and a fulltime
night student at DeAnza Col
lege, has been Karen's Big Sis
ter since last November.
"She's terrific," said Karen.
"She takes me places, we enjoy
doing the same things together
— hiking, swimming, going
out in the snow. Oh, but she
doesn't like fishing and I do,"

Karen laughed.
Part of Ohlmeyer's DeAnza
work in social welfare required
her to work either with a prob
ation office or with Big Sisters.
"I decided to work with Big
Sisters, and be able to help
someone before they ever got
to the probation stage," she
said. She added that she would
like somehow to run a home
for adolescent girls.

to be with her. We like to go
out a lot, to a matinee or to
Great America, or sometimes
we just bake cookies at my
place. Big Sisters just spend
what they can afford," she
said.
Bob Cooper has been as
sociated with Big Brothers in
various counties for 14 years.
Lie's been with the Santa Clara
chapter for three years.
"I'm single, I enjoy young
people and helping them out,"
said Cooper, who works at a
junior high school library.
David, 11, sat next to Cooper
munching on a hot dog.
"You've got to have pati

with your little brother," said
Cooper.
Karen (not her real name) is
15 years old and a student at

San Jose High School. She is a
Little Sister, but was right in
there working in the stuffed
animal booth.
"You really want to know
how I became a Little Sister?"
asked Karen, her eyes glancing
to the ground ever so briefly.
"Well, last year I tried to kill
myself. I needed help," she
said. Bonny Ohlmeyer was that
help.

Ohlmeyer, 23, a fulltime
sales correspondent for a
semi-conductor corporation in
Mountain View and a fulltime
night student at DeAnza Col
lege, has been Karen's Big Sis
ter since last November.
"She's terrific," said Karen.
"She takes me places, we enjoy
doing the same things together
— hiking, swimming, going
out in the snow. Oh, but she
doesn't like fishing and I do,"

Karen laughed.
Part of Ohlmeyer's DeAnza
work in social welfare required
her to work either with a prob
ation office or with Big Sisters.
"I decided to work with Big
Sisters, and be able to help
someone before they ever got
to the probation stage," she
said. She added that she would
like somehow to run a home
for adolescent girls.

Big Sister Barbara Mobley (r) and her Little Sister Luene share a joke at last month's Big Brothers and Big
Sisters carnival in San lose.
The smell of hot dogs and
baked beans wafted over the
sun drenched trees of Kelly
Park in San Jose. Among the
low trees, eager youngsters
were trying their luck at ringing
soda bottles, tossing balls into
* tic-tac-toe formations and spit
ting out prune seeds.
Big Brothers and Big Sis
- ters, an agency dedicated to
providing adult friendship and
guidance for fatherless boys or
motherless girls, was doing its
part last month to bring kids
and adult volunteers together.
The picnic-carnival at Kelly
112 Park attracted about 150 per
-5 sons — Big Brothers and Big
J Sisters who split their time
' running the dozen or so game
. booths and accompanying
| their Little Brothers and Sisters
' as they won huge stuffed ani
« mals and other prizes.

j volved in Big Brothers and Big
* Sisters, too. We'd like to see

i said Fernando Valcarcel,
I community relations person

\ of money but without volun
* teers, the childrens' waiting list

have to wait up to a year for a
Big Brother or Big Sister," Val
carcel said.
Big Brothers of Santa Clara
County was started six years
ago. Big Sisters has been in
existence for 10 years. The two
programs merged in August
and its staff has increased from
about four persons in 1976 to
17 persons today. There is an
office in San Jose and a satellite
office in Sunnyvale.
Valcarcel estimated that
there are now over 150 Big and
Little Brother matches and over
100 Big and Little Sister
matches in Santa Clara County.
The non-profit, United
Way-funded agency has served
"about a thousand" fatherless
boys, according to Chuck
Schmidt, executive director of
the agency.
Companions needed
"There are about 18,000
fatherless boys in the county,"
said Schmidt. "There are many
single parent homes here.
Working mothers are raising
families. The boys need male
companionship."
Valcarcel said mothers often
come to the agency inquiring
about getting a Big Brother for
their sons. Social workers,
public health nurses, school
counselors, and juvenile prob
ation officers also refer boys
and girls to the agency in the
hopes of finding an interested
adult Brother or Sister for
them.
Big Brother and Big Sister is

not in competition with other
similar programs, such as the
Stanford Youth Program where
students befriend youths and
participate in activities with
them, Valcarcel said.
"The essence of our prog
ram is to help kids. If more kids
are getting served by a number
of organizations, great. In real
ity, I think there's a more
cooperative feeling then a
competitive feeling between
our agency and other prog
rams," Valcarcel said.
Screening
Volunteers go through an in
tensive six weeks of interviews
with agency social workers.
The volunteer's background
and attitude are carefully con
sidered, before the volunteer
is matched with ayoung friend,
said Schmidt.
The agency looks for a wide
range of volunteers of all
backgrounds, said Valcarcel.
Big Brothers and Sisters must
be with their younger friends at
least once a week.
"I didn't know Big Brothers
and Big Sisters existed until I
talked to a friend who was a Big
Sister at the tennis club last
year," said Big Sister Ann An
tonelli, a secretary for an
aerospace company in Sun
nyvale.
"I am so pleased with the
way it's turned out. It's reward
ing and fun to be with Linda,"
she said as she glanced at her
Little Sister who was ooh-ing
over her carnival grab-bag.

Antonelli joined Big Sisters
last October but did not get
matched with a Little Sister
until February.
"I was not apprehensive
about being a Big Sister," said
Antonelli.
"I was very specific about the
kind of sister I wanted. I was an
only child myself and I always
wanted a sister about 11 years
old."

Working mothers are raising
families. The boys need male
companionship."
Valcarcel said mothers often
come to the agency inquiring
about getting a Big Brother for
their sons. Social workers,
public health nurses, school
counselors, and juvenile prob
ation officers also refer boys
and girls to the agency in the
hopes of finding an interested
adult Brother or Sister for
them.
Big Brother and Big Sister is

not in competition with other
similar programs, such as the
Stanford Youth Program where
students befriend youths and
participate in activities with
them, Valcarcel said.
"The essence of our prog
ram is to help kids. If more kids
are getting served by a number
of organizations, great. In real
ity, I think there's a more
cooperative feeling then a
competitive feeling between
our agency and other prog
rams," Valcarcel said.
Screening
Volunteers go through an in
tensive six weeks of interviews
with agency social workers.
The volunteer's background
and attitude are carefully con
sidered, before the volunteer
is matched with ayoung friend,
said Schmidt.
The agency looks for a wide
range of volunteers of all
backgrounds, said Valcarcel.
Big Brothers and Sisters must
be with their younger friends at
least once a week.
"I didn't know Big Brothers
and Big Sisters existed until I
talked to a friend who was a Big
Sister at the tennis club last
year," said Big Sister Ann An
tonelli, a secretary for an
aerospace company in Sun
nyvale.
"I am so pleased with the
way it's turned out. It's reward
ing and fun to be with Linda,"
she said as she glanced at her
Little Sister who was ooh-ing
over her carnival grab-bag.

Antonelli joined Big Sisters
last October but did not get
matched with a Little Sister
until February.
"I was not apprehensive
about being a Big Sister," said
Antonelli.
"I was very specific about the
kind of sister I wanted. I was an
only child myself and I always
wanted a sister about 11 years
old."
Bake cookies
"She really needs a woman
to be with her. We like to go
out a lot, to a matinee or to
Great America, or sometimes
we just bake cookies at my
place. Big Sisters just spend
what they can afford," she
said.
Bob Cooper has been as
sociated with Big Brothers in
various counties for 14 years.
Lie's been with the Santa Clara
chapter for three years.
"I'm single, I enjoy young
people and helping them out,"
said Cooper, who works at a
junior high school library.
David, 11, sat next to Cooper
munching on a hot dog.
"You've got to have pati
ence, and like doing things
with your little brother," said
Cooper.
Karen (not her real name) is
15 years old and a student at

San Jose High School. She is a
Little Sister, but was right in
there working in the stuffed
animal booth.
"You really want to know
how I became a Little Sister?"
asked Karen, her eyes glancing
to the ground ever so briefly.
"Well, last year I tried to kill
myself. I needed help," she
said. Bonny Ohlmeyer was that
help.

Ohlmeyer, 23, a fulltime
sales correspondent for a
semi-conductor corporation in
Mountain View and a fulltime
night student at DeAnza Col
lege, has been Karen's Big Sis
ter since last November.
"She's terrific," said Karen.
"She takes me places, we enjoy
doing the same things together
— hiking, swimming, going
out in the snow. Oh, but she
doesn't like fishing and I do,"

Karen laughed.
Part of Ohlmeyer's DeAnza
work in social welfare required
her to work either with a prob
ation office or with Big Sisters.
"I decided to work with Big
Sisters, and be able to help
someone before they ever got
to the probation stage," she
said. She added that she would
like somehow to run a home
for adolescent girls.

Big Brothers and Big Sis

Big Brothers of Santa Clara

programs merged in August
and its staff has increased from
about four persons in 1976 to
17 persons today. There is an
office in San Jose and a satellite
office in Sunnyvale.
Valcarcel estimated that
there are now over 150 Big and
Little Brother matches and over
100 Big and Little Sister
matches in Santa Clara County.
The non-profit, United
Way-funded agency has served
"about a thousand" fatherless
boys, according to Chuck
