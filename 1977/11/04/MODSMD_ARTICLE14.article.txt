# Ohms adds a motherly touch

"I love my job, I love to eat, I
love to cook."
Lois Ohms has what it takes
to serve up tasty meals for over
1400 discriminating palates.
A professional nutritionist
for 23 years, seven of them at
Stanford, Ohms' job as Test
Kitchen Dietician for Univer
sity Food Services entails plan
ning all university meals, test
ing new recipes and overse
eing quality control.
Recipes are adopted from
the National Association of
College University Food Ser
vice Cookbooks so meals in ail
major universities are similar,
Ohms said.
Ohms also includes family
favorites and recipes found in
magazines.
"I'm now testing a recipe
from Sunset Magazine for a
crunchy chicken and rice
salad, a taste supplement to
the tossed green salad," she
said.
Spices
Much time and thought goes
into adopting recipes for food
service. When increasing re
cipe size from a family recipe

"you can't just multiply all the
measurements because the
spices will get too strong,"
Ohms said.
Ohms samples all her exper
iments and, "I'm always watch
ing my weight," she claimed.
Ohms first prepares new re
cipes for approval by her staff
of food service managers from
each residence hall.
"Lois rarely picks a bad re
cipe," remarked one of her col
leagues. Each recipe is
scrutinized and altered for im
provement before going to the
student taste panel.
Student volunteers come to
the test kitchen in the Food
Service Office to savor poten
tial menu items. They then fill
out a rating chart.
"Poorly rated recipes are
discarded but if they are rated
satisfactory or better we will
experiment to improve the re
cipe as best we can," Ohms
said.
Guinea pig
The students on taste panels
seem to enjoy their guinea pig
role in taste control. One stu
dent claimed, "It was interest
ing — free food. They were

very serious about our opin
ions."
Food is rated not only for
taste quality but for texture,
color, seasoning and eye
appeal as well.
"I'm always open for student
input; not only for complaints
but for suggestions as well,"
Ohms said.
A change to Skippy brand
peanut butter was im
plemented due to student in
put. A change in the brand of
coffee used is also
slated, Ohms said.
There isn't that much choice
"in the types of menu pro
teins," Ohms said. She varies
the protein by using chicken,
pork, veal, beef and fish.
Ohms also includes popular
items such as pizza twice a
cycle and hamburgers once a
week.
Special touch
Vegetables and desserts are
served with every meal. While
Ohms plans the basic menu,
resident food service mana
gers add their own touches to
the final meals, she said.
Much effort goes into plan
ning the menu for the typical
American meat and potatoes

diet. Yet Ohms also prepares a
health food and vegetarian
menu. Wilbur Hall recently
started a health food line and
Stern Hall, a vegetarian line.
"Finding vegetarian recipes
isn't easy," claims Ohms.
For students on diets, Ohms
provides the calorie count for
most food service items. She is
also involved in nutritional
awareness and food ecology
programs with the Stanford
Committee on Hunger, the
student group which sponsors
the Day of Fast each autumn.
Maintaining high quality
food is a major concern. Once
a week she tests the fat content
of food service food hambur
gers, which are ground and
formed in the butcher shop at
the food service office on Serra
Street.
"Maximum allowance is 30
per cent fat but we try to stay
around 22 per cent — that
makes the best hamburgers,"
she said.
Serving the best quality food
at the best prices is Ohms'
major concern, and, she ad
ded, "I'm very conscious of
food ingredient labels when
buying new food brands."

very serious about our opin
ions."
Food is rated not only for
taste quality but for texture,
color, seasoning and eye
appeal as well.
"I'm always open for student
input; not only for complaints
but for suggestions as well,"
Ohms said.
A change to Skippy brand
peanut butter was im
plemented due to student in
put. A change in the brand of
coffee used is also
slated, Ohms said.
There isn't that much choice
"in the types of menu pro
teins," Ohms said. She varies
the protein by using chicken,
pork, veal, beef and fish.
Ohms also includes popular
items such as pizza twice a
cycle and hamburgers once a
week.
Special touch
Vegetables and desserts are
served with every meal. While
Ohms plans the basic menu,
resident food service mana
gers add their own touches to
the final meals, she said.
Much effort goes into plan
ning the menu for the typical
American meat and potatoes

diet. Yet Ohms also prepares a
health food and vegetarian
menu. Wilbur Hall recently
started a health food line and
Stern Hall, a vegetarian line.
"Finding vegetarian recipes
isn't easy," claims Ohms.
For students on diets, Ohms
provides the calorie count for
most food service items. She is
also involved in nutritional
awareness and food ecology
programs with the Stanford
Committee on Hunger, the
student group which sponsors
the Day of Fast each autumn.
Maintaining high quality
food is a major concern. Once
a week she tests the fat content
of food service food hambur
gers, which are ground and
formed in the butcher shop at
the food service office on Serra
Street.
"Maximum allowance is 30
per cent fat but we try to stay
around 22 per cent — that
makes the best hamburgers,"
she said.
Serving the best quality food
at the best prices is Ohms'
major concern, and, she ad
ded, "I'm very conscious of
food ingredient labels when
buying new food brands."

Quality control of .ill foods is one of Lois Ohms' primary concerns. Here, she inspects meat being
prepared in the food service butcher shop.
"I love my job, I love to eat, I
love to cook."
Lois Ohms has what it takes
to serve up tasty meals for over
1400 discriminating palates.
A professional nutritionist
for 23 years, seven of them at
Stanford, Ohms' job as Test
Kitchen Dietician for Univer
sity Food Services entails plan
ning all university meals, test
ing new recipes and overse
eing quality control.
Recipes are adopted from
the National Association of
College University Food Ser
vice Cookbooks so meals in ail
major universities are similar,
Ohms said.
Ohms also includes family
favorites and recipes found in
magazines.
"I'm now testing a recipe
from Sunset Magazine for a
crunchy chicken and rice
salad, a taste supplement to
the tossed green salad," she
said.
Spices
Much time and thought goes
into adopting recipes for food
service. When increasing re
cipe size from a family recipe

"you can't just multiply all the
measurements because the
spices will get too strong,"
Ohms said.
Ohms samples all her exper
iments and, "I'm always watch
ing my weight," she claimed.
Ohms first prepares new re
cipes for approval by her staff
of food service managers from
each residence hall.
"Lois rarely picks a bad re
cipe," remarked one of her col
leagues. Each recipe is
scrutinized and altered for im
provement before going to the
student taste panel.
Student volunteers come to
the test kitchen in the Food
Service Office to savor poten
tial menu items. They then fill
out a rating chart.
"Poorly rated recipes are
discarded but if they are rated
satisfactory or better we will
experiment to improve the re
cipe as best we can," Ohms
said.
Guinea pig
The students on taste panels
seem to enjoy their guinea pig
role in taste control. One stu
