# Dan McNevin: frosh booter ready for Card soccer team
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Can a seventh-grader,
"forced to play soccer in P.E.,"
develop into a college star? Is it
possible for his first coach to
incorporate him in a soccer
team (ranked 14th in the West),
six years later?
The answer to both of these
questions, if you ask Stanford
soccer coach Nelson Lodge or
Dan McNevin, freshman mid
fielder, is definitely yes.
Like many of the top athletes
on the Farm, McNevin has
modest roots. "I kicked the
ball, but I never even began to
play until I got to seventh
grade," he said. "Coach Lodge
asked me to go out for the
junior high team. I went out
but didn't play — I just prac
ticed four times a week, and
that was the end of it."
Big decision
Until McNevin's sophomore
year, soccer took a back seat to
an interest in baseball. That
year, however, he made the
varsity soccer team and had to
decide between the post
season tournaments and
baseball practice.
"My sophomore year, I de
cided to play in the State Cup
with my team. That marked
when I began to really think
about playing," McNevin said.
And what role did Lodge's at
tention play? McNevin replied,
"That's what really got me go
ing. If somebody says 'you've
got talent,' you really think
about it. Fie (Lodge) definitely
sparked my interest — if he
hadn't said go out (for soccer),
I'd be playing baseball."
Lodge recalled McNevin's
growth over the years. "He was
interested in soccer (in grade
school) and he was really a
good player as a youngster. I
watched him play at Mission
San lose High School and he
was their best player."
When it came time for col
lege considerations, McNevin
contacted Lodge. "I asked for a
schedule and watched him (at
Bellarmine prep). He grew im
mensely, got all this poise,"
said Lodge. He corresponded
with McNevin "a lot becuase I
knew him. I tried to convince
him that Stanford was the place
for him, not just for soccer, but
academically, professionally,"
said Lodge.
Heavily recruited
Lodge was not alone in his
interests to recruit McNevin.
"He was one of the few players
that everybody wanted, in this
area. Gene Chatlick wanted
him badly (at Santa Clara), Julie
Menendez (San lose State)
wanted him, and so did Lin
dorous Colin of Hayward,"
Lodge said.
Once a part of the Stanford

soccer program, McNevin
found his place on the field. "I
really wanted to play halfback a
lot, and it was his (Lodge's) de
cision to put me there,"
McNevin said.
"He (Lodge) likes to utilize
strengths and I can dribble
more from the halfback posi
tion, so he wanted me to play
there to dribble and shoot. You
have more freedom to work
from halfback," McNevin ad
ded.
McNevin found the initial ad
justment to college soccer dif
ficult. Working at a soccer
camp last summer he heard
people talking about the Stan
ford program — putting it
down as a "kick and run"
game.
"At the beginning of the
year, I had a chip on my shoul
der," McNevin said. "Soccer
became my secondary goal —
I came here (to Stanford) first
to learn. I wasn't keyed up for
games, I was nervous — maybe
it'sa natural reaction,"hesaid.
Team comraderie
Now, with a thorough know
ledge of the soccer program,
McNevin's evaluation is posi
tive — the team as a whole has
progressed and the individuals
feel a true comraderie.

"It's (the program) gone
nowhere but forward because
we're playing a different style
of game," McNevin said. "The
biggest thing is that we got to
know each other, to trust each
other. We just get along so
well, and the thing is that the
coach is part of it (the com
raderie)," he said.
McNevin's achievements on
the field this season have been
very noticeable. "He has to be
at this point a candidate for
all-conference," said Lodge.
"He is in my opinion, the
playmaker on the field — he
has the ability to draw defen
ders. He's a very heady player,
a smart player — he sees the
whole field, not just the im
mediate area."
McNevin will get his next
opportunity to demonstrate
his skills this Sunday as the
Cardinals take on defending
NCAA champion USF at 2 p.m.
on the College of Marin cam
pus.
Sunday's match is a signific
ant test for the rapidly improv
ing Stanford program, a strong
showing against USF and in the
final two games of the season
could also put the Cards in the
regional playoffs.
