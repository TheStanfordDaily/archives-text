# Rose Bowl hopes on line for Pac-8 leader
## Cardinals invade Coliseum to face struggling USC 
### David Georgette 
Beneath the haze, seagulls
circle inside the littered
stadium. The empty field is co
vered by afternoon shadows.
Most of the 70,000 people are
gone, but a pocket of noisy
fans continue to celebrate. It's
almost 5 o'clock. Stanford has
defeated USC in the Coliseum.
The Cardinals seem destined
for Pasadena. That's right, Stan
ford is going to the Rose Bowl.
Hey, wait a minute! Quit
dreaming! The white-haired
coach with the space age of
fense and the meditating quar
terback is supposed to be re
building a team, not getting it a
Pacific-8 championship.
Why even the staunchest
Stanford rooter would have
been kidding himself during
the summer to think the Cards
would have a legitimate shot at
going to the Rose Bowl this
season.
But going into tomorrow af
ternoon's game against USC in
the Coliseum (1:30 KZSU FM
90.1, KSFO AM 650), first-year
head coach Bill Walsh has a 6-2
team on the verge of the most
successful grid season on the
Farm in six years.

"I feel there is some pres
sure off us," Walsh said earlier
this week while preparing for
USC. "We're not fighting for
success. We already have
that."
But knocking oft the Trojans
would go a long way towards
extending the Stanford season
to a 12th game sometime in
December or January.
Stopping the Trojans consti
tutes a formidable task,
though. They are big, they are
fast, they are mean, and they
are ranked first in team offense
and team defense in the Pac-8.
One thing they aren't is in
vincible. The Trojans are 5-3
overall, and on a two-game los
ing streak. They were blitzed
by Notre Dame (49-19) in In
diana before Cal slapped them
with their first conference loss
(17-14) a week ago at Berkeley.
Stanford on top
The defeat left USC with a 1-1
conference mark and a loss to
first-place Stanford (4-1) would
end the Trojans' hopes for the
Rose Bowl.
"The whole team is off a little
bit," said second-year Trojan
head coach John Robinson.
"We ran into places where they
were a little crazy. We didn't
pick the right time to have a
slump."
While getting back home
might prove to be an advantage
for the Trojans, Walsh said the
adversity of playing on the road
won't be critical. "I don't think
it'll be a disadvantage like it
might be in other stadiums
around the country," he said.
A look at the recent past
would indicate playing in the
Coliseum brings out the best in
Stanford. Since 1968, every
time Stanford has played in Los
Angeles, it's had victory within
its grasp. However, only three
times has Stanford come out
on top — one of those being
two years ago when Mike
Langford's last-second field
goal defeated USC, 1 i-10.
Charles White
If the Cards expect to be
close during the fourth quarter
tomorrow, they will have to
handle USC's tailbacks, led by
sophomore Charles White's
988 yards. He needs only 47
more yards to break Anthony
Davis' sophomore rushing re
cord of 1034 set in 1972.
Against Cal, the Trojans gave
White the ball 32 times and he
responded with 154 yards

against the tough Bear de
fense.
But the big run was turned in
by White's back-up, junior
Dwight Ford, who broke off a
62-yard scamper to set up a Tro
jan score.
At fullback, the Trojans have
a battering ram. Senior Mosi
Tatupu (6-foot, 225) has a 5.7
yards per carry average.
As a team, USC averages five
yards a carry on the ground,
but recently the Trojans have
had trouble at critical times.
"Our backs are running hard,"
said Robinson, "and we've
moved the ball well on the
ground in our last two losses,
but when we arrive at crucial
downs we don't make the big
play."
Passing potential
USC has the potential for a
lethal passing attack with
senior quarterback Rob Hertel
(52 per cent completion rate)
and receivers Randy Simmrin
and Calvin Sweeney, both with
26 receptions.
But Hertel has had trouble
getting the ball to open receiv
ers recently and Robinson said
that when the ball has been on
target, some of the passes have
been dropped.
"Our defense is playing well
enough to win, but we're just
not putting enough points on
the scoreboard," said Robin
son. "Everybody on offense
wants so badly to come up with
the big play that we seem to fail
because of it. Our biggest
problem is getting our morale
and confidence back."
It would seem that the vari
able element in the game will
be the play of the Stanford de
fense.
Same defensive
Walsh expects to go with the
same line-up as the last two
weeks, with lineman Steve
Howe available for duty after
being sidelined with a knee in
jury.
The performance of the
Stanford defense should be
the key because the offense
can be counted on to do its
share. No defense, even
USC's, can stop the Cards,
right, coach?
"It's difficult to move on
USC," said Walsh. "They have
big powerful linemen and
linebackers. They are by far the
toughest team we've faced, or
will face."
"We probably have a more

flexible type of defense than
what we've had in the past,"
said Robinson. Led by linebac
kers Garry Cobb (6-3, 220 with
68 tackles) and Dennis Johnson
(6-4, 230 with 63 tackles), the
Trojans still play a fundamen
tal, aggressive defense,
though. They do not make
great efforts to disguise what
they are doing.
Needs time
Given the time, Card quar
terback Guy Benjamin, the na
tion's leading passer with 22.4
completions per game and
1378 yards on the season,
should be able to read the de
fense and get the ball to his
receivers.
"I don't think you ever stop a
man with Benjamin's ability,"
said Robinson. "He's probabiy
the best quarterback in the
country. But we hope to con
tain him some and slow him
down."
Three Card pass catchers are

among the top five in the con
ference — James Lofton is No.
1 with 41 receptions, halfback
Darrin Nelson is second with
39 and receiver Bill Kellar is
fifth with 35.
Nelson, with 742 yards
gained on the ground, needs
only three more to eclipse
White's record rushing yar
dage by a freshman.
Nearly as important as the
personnel on the field is the
strategy of the coaches. "So
much of football is calling the
right play at the right time,"
said Walsh. "We have to make
first downs to win ball games.
People complain we don't
throw the bomb, but our con
cern is more in keeping the
ball."
About three hours after
kick-off tomorrow, the Cards
will know whether they held
onto the ball long enough to
improve their Rose Bowl
chances.

Guy Benjamin fires a pass under pressure in Stanford's 37-24 victory
oyer Illinois early this season. Benjamin, the nation's leading passer
with 22.4 completions per game, hit on 17 of 29 attempts and three
TDs in the rain against Oregon last weekend.
Beneath the haze, seagulls
circle inside the littered
stadium. The empty field is co
vered by afternoon shadows.
Most of the 70,000 people are
gone, but a pocket of noisy
fans continue to celebrate. It's
almost 5 o'clock. Stanford has
defeated USC in the Coliseum.
The Cardinals seem destined
for Pasadena. That's right, Stan
ford is going to the Rose Bowl.
Hey, wait a minute! Quit
dreaming! The white-haired
coach with the space age of
fense and the meditating quar
terback is supposed to be re
building a team, not getting it a
Pacific-8 championship.
Why even the staunchest
Stanford rooter would have
been kidding himself during
the summer to think the Cards
would have a legitimate shot at
going to the Rose Bowl this
season.
But going into tomorrow af
ternoon's game against USC in
the Coliseum (1:30 KZSU FM
90.1, KSFO AM 650), first-year
head coach Bill Walsh has a 6-2
team on the verge of the most
successful grid season on the
Farm in six years.

"I feel there is some pres
sure off us," Walsh said earlier
this week while preparing for
USC. "We're not fighting for
success. We already have
that."
But knocking oft the Trojans
would go a long way towards
extending the Stanford season
to a 12th game sometime in
December or January.
Stopping the Trojans consti
tutes a formidable task,
though. They are big, they are
fast, they are mean, and they
are ranked first in team offense
and team defense in the Pac-8.
One thing they aren't is in
vincible. The Trojans are 5-3
overall, and on a two-game los
ing streak. They were blitzed
by Notre Dame (49-19) in In
diana before Cal slapped them
with their first conference loss
(17-14) a week ago at Berkeley.
Stanford on top
The defeat left USC with a 1-1
conference mark and a loss to
first-place Stanford (4-1) would
end the Trojans' hopes for the
Rose Bowl.
"The whole team is off a little
bit," said second-year Trojan
head coach John Robinson.
"We ran into places where they
were a little crazy. We didn't
pick the right time to have a
slump."
While getting back home
might prove to be an advantage
for the Trojans, Walsh said the
adversity of playing on the road
won't be critical. "I don't think
it'll be a disadvantage like it
might be in other stadiums
around the country," he said.
A look at the recent past
would indicate playing in the
Coliseum brings out the best in
Stanford. Since 1968, every
time Stanford has played in Los
Angeles, it's had victory within
its grasp. However, only three
times has Stanford come out
on top — one of those being
two years ago when Mike
Langford's last-second field
goal defeated USC, 1 i-10.
Charles White
If the Cards expect to be
close during the fourth quarter
tomorrow, they will have to
handle USC's tailbacks, led by
sophomore Charles White's
988 yards. He needs only 47
more yards to break Anthony
Davis' sophomore rushing re
cord of 1034 set in 1972.
Against Cal, the Trojans gave
White the ball 32 times and he
responded with 154 yards

against the tough Bear de
fense.
But the big run was turned in
by White's back-up, junior
Dwight Ford, who broke off a
62-yard scamper to set up a Tro
jan score.
At fullback, the Trojans have
a battering ram. Senior Mosi
Tatupu (6-foot, 225) has a 5.7
yards per carry average.
As a team, USC averages five
yards a carry on the ground,
but recently the Trojans have
had trouble at critical times.
"Our backs are running hard,"
said Robinson, "and we've
moved the ball well on the
ground in our last two losses,
but when we arrive at crucial
downs we don't make the big
play."
Passing potential
USC has the potential for a
lethal passing attack with
senior quarterback Rob Hertel
(52 per cent completion rate)
and receivers Randy Simmrin
and Calvin Sweeney, both with
26 receptions.
But Hertel has had trouble
getting the ball to open receiv
ers recently and Robinson said
that when the ball has been on
target, some of the passes have
been dropped.
"Our defense is playing well
enough to win, but we're just
not putting enough points on
the scoreboard," said Robin
son. "Everybody on offense
wants so badly to come up with
the big play that we seem to fail
because of it. Our biggest
problem is getting our morale
and confidence back."
It would seem that the vari
able element in the game will
be the play of the Stanford de
fense.
Same defensive
Walsh expects to go with the
same line-up as the last two
weeks, with lineman Steve
Howe available for duty after
being sidelined with a knee in
jury.
The performance of the
Stanford defense should be
the key because the offense
can be counted on to do its
share. No defense, even
USC's, can stop the Cards,
right, coach?
"It's difficult to move on
USC," said Walsh. "They have
big powerful linemen and
linebackers. They are by far the
toughest team we've faced, or
will face."
"We probably have a more

flexible type of defense than
what we've had in the past,"
said Robinson. Led by linebac
kers Garry Cobb (6-3, 220 with
68 tackles) and Dennis Johnson
(6-4, 230 with 63 tackles), the
Trojans still play a fundamen
tal, aggressive defense,
though. They do not make
great efforts to disguise what
they are doing.
Needs time
Given the time, Card quar
terback Guy Benjamin, the na
tion's leading passer with 22.4
completions per game and
1378 yards on the season,
should be able to read the de
fense and get the ball to his

"I don't think you ever stop a

senior quarterback Rob Hertel
(52 per cent completion rate)
and receivers Randy Simmrin
and Calvin Sweeney, both with
26 receptions.
But Hertel has had trouble
getting the ball to open receiv
ers recently and Robinson said
that when the ball has been on
target, some of the passes have
been dropped.
"Our defense is playing well
enough to win, but we're just
not putting enough points on
the scoreboard," said Robin
son. "Everybody on offense
wants so badly to come up with
the big play that we seem to fail
because of it. Our biggest
problem is getting our morale
and confidence back."
It would seem that the vari
able element in the game will
be the play of the Stanford de
fense.
Same defensive
Walsh expects to go with the
same line-up as the last two
weeks, with lineman Steve
Howe available for duty after
being sidelined with a knee in
jury.
The performance of the
Stanford defense should be
the key because the offense
can be counted on to do its
share. No defense, even
USC's, can stop the Cards,
right, coach?
"It's difficult to move on
USC," said Walsh. "They have
big powerful linemen and
linebackers. They are by far the
toughest team we've faced, or
will face."
"We probably have a more

flexible type of defense than
what we've had in the past,"
said Robinson. Led by linebac
kers Garry Cobb (6-3, 220 with
68 tackles) and Dennis Johnson
(6-4, 230 with 63 tackles), the
Trojans still play a fundamen
tal, aggressive defense,
though. They do not make
great efforts to disguise what
they are doing.
Needs time
Given the time, Card quar
terback Guy Benjamin, the na
tion's leading passer with 22.4
completions per game and
1378 yards on the season,
should be able to read the de
fense and get the ball to his
receivers.
"I don't think you ever stop a
man with Benjamin's ability,"
said Robinson. "He's probabiy
the best quarterback in the
country. But we hope to con
tain him some and slow him
down."
Three Card pass catchers are

among the top five in the con
ference — James Lofton is No.
1 with 41 receptions, halfback
Darrin Nelson is second with
39 and receiver Bill Kellar is
fifth with 35.
Nelson, with 742 yards
gained on the ground, needs
only three more to eclipse
White's record rushing yar
dage by a freshman.
Nearly as important as the
personnel on the field is the
strategy of the coaches. "So
much of football is calling the
right play at the right time,"
said Walsh. "We have to make
first downs to win ball games.
People complain we don't
throw the bomb, but our con
cern is more in keeping the
ball."
About three hours after
kick-off tomorrow, the Cards
will know whether they held
onto the ball long enough to
improve their Rose Bowl
chances.

Guy Benjamin fires a pass under pressure in Stanford's 37-24 victory
oyer Illinois early this season. Benjamin, the nation's leading passer
with 22.4 completions per game, hit on 17 of 29 attempts and three
TDs in the rain against Oregon last weekend.
Beneath the haze, seagulls
circle inside the littered
stadium. The empty field is co
vered by afternoon shadows.
Most of the 70,000 people are
gone, but a pocket of noisy
fans continue to celebrate. It's
almost 5 o'clock. Stanford has
defeated USC in the Coliseum.
The Cardinals seem destined
for Pasadena. That's right, Stan
ford is going to the Rose Bowl.
Hey, wait a minute! Quit
dreaming! The white-haired
coach with the space age of
fense and the meditating quar
terback is supposed to be re
building a team, not getting it a
Pacific-8 championship.
Why even the staunchest
Stanford rooter would have
been kidding himself during
the summer to think the Cards
would have a legitimate shot at
going to the Rose Bowl this
season.
But going into tomorrow af
ternoon's game against USC in
the Coliseum (1:30 KZSU FM
90.1, KSFO AM 650), first-year
head coach Bill Walsh has a 6-2
team on the verge of the most
successful grid season on the
Farm in six years.

"I feel there is some pres
sure off us," Walsh said earlier
this week while preparing for
USC. "We're not fighting for
success. We already have
that."
But knocking oft the Trojans
would go a long way towards
extending the Stanford season
to a 12th game sometime in
December or January.
Stopping the Trojans consti
tutes a formidable task,
though. They are big, they are
fast, they are mean, and they
are ranked first in team offense
and team defense in the Pac-8.
One thing they aren't is in
vincible. The Trojans are 5-3
overall, and on a two-game los
ing streak. They were blitzed
by Notre Dame (49-19) in In
diana before Cal slapped them
with their first conference loss
(17-14) a week ago at Berkeley.
Stanford on top
The defeat left USC with a 1-1
conference mark and a loss to
first-place Stanford (4-1) would
end the Trojans' hopes for the
Rose Bowl.
"The whole team is off a little
bit," said second-year Trojan
head coach John Robinson.
"We ran into places where they
were a little crazy. We didn't
pick the right time to have a
slump."
While getting back home
might prove to be an advantage
for the Trojans, Walsh said the
adversity of playing on the road
won't be critical. "I don't think
it'll be a disadvantage like it
might be in other stadiums
around the country," he said.
A look at the recent past
would indicate playing in the
Coliseum brings out the best in
Stanford. Since 1968, every
time Stanford has played in Los
Angeles, it's had victory within
its grasp. However, only three
times has Stanford come out
on top — one of those being
two years ago when Mike
Langford's last-second field
goal defeated USC, 1 i-10.
Charles White
If the Cards expect to be
close during the fourth quarter
tomorrow, they will have to
handle USC's tailbacks, led by
sophomore Charles White's
988 yards. He needs only 47
more yards to break Anthony
Davis' sophomore rushing re
cord of 1034 set in 1972.
Against Cal, the Trojans gave
White the ball 32 times and he
responded with 154 yards

against the tough Bear de
fense.
But the big run was turned in
by White's back-up, junior
Dwight Ford, who broke off a
62-yard scamper to set up a Tro
jan score.
At fullback, the Trojans have
a battering ram. Senior Mosi
Tatupu (6-foot, 225) has a 5.7
yards per carry average.
As a team, USC averages five
yards a carry on the ground,
but recently the Trojans have
had trouble at critical times.
"Our backs are running hard,"
said Robinson, "and we've
moved the ball well on the
ground in our last two losses,
but when we arrive at crucial
downs we don't make the big
play."
Passing potential
USC has the potential for a
lethal passing attack with
senior quarterback Rob Hertel
(52 per cent completion rate)
and receivers Randy Simmrin
and Calvin Sweeney, both with
26 receptions.
But Hertel has had trouble
getting the ball to open receiv

that when the ball has been on

for the Trojans, Walsh said the
adversity of playing on the road
won't be critical. "I don't think
it'll be a disadvantage like it
might be in other stadiums
around the country," he said.
A look at the recent past
would indicate playing in the
Coliseum brings out the best in
Stanford. Since 1968, every
time Stanford has played in Los
Angeles, it's had victory within
its grasp. However, only three
times has Stanford come out
on top — one of those being
two years ago when Mike
Langford's last-second field
goal defeated USC, 1 i-10.
Charles White
If the Cards expect to be
close during the fourth quarter
tomorrow, they will have to
handle USC's tailbacks, led by
sophomore Charles White's
988 yards. He needs only 47
more yards to break Anthony
Davis' sophomore rushing re
cord of 1034 set in 1972.
Against Cal, the Trojans gave
White the ball 32 times and he
responded with 154 yards

against the tough Bear de
fense.
But the big run was turned in
by White's back-up, junior
Dwight Ford, who broke off a
62-yard scamper to set up a Tro
jan score.
At fullback, the Trojans have
a battering ram. Senior Mosi
Tatupu (6-foot, 225) has a 5.7
yards per carry average.
As a team, USC averages five
yards a carry on the ground,
but recently the Trojans have
had trouble at critical times.
"Our backs are running hard,"
said Robinson, "and we've
moved the ball well on the
ground in our last two losses,
but when we arrive at crucial
downs we don't make the big
play."
Passing potential
USC has the potential for a
lethal passing attack with
senior quarterback Rob Hertel
(52 per cent completion rate)
and receivers Randy Simmrin
and Calvin Sweeney, both with
26 receptions.
But Hertel has had trouble
getting the ball to open receiv
ers recently and Robinson said
that when the ball has been on
target, some of the passes have
been dropped.
"Our defense is playing well
enough to win, but we're just
not putting enough points on
the scoreboard," said Robin
son. "Everybody on offense
wants so badly to come up with
the big play that we seem to fail
because of it. Our biggest
problem is getting our morale
and confidence back."
It would seem that the vari
able element in the game will
be the play of the Stanford de
fense.
Same defensive
Walsh expects to go with the
same line-up as the last two
weeks, with lineman Steve
Howe available for duty after
being sidelined with a knee in
jury.
The performance of the
Stanford defense should be
the key because the offense
can be counted on to do its
share. No defense, even
USC's, can stop the Cards,
right, coach?
"It's difficult to move on
USC," said Walsh. "They have
big powerful linemen and
linebackers. They are by far the
toughest team we've faced, or
will face."
"We probably have a more

flexible type of defense than
what we've had in the past,"
said Robinson. Led by linebac
kers Garry Cobb (6-3, 220 with
68 tackles) and Dennis Johnson
(6-4, 230 with 63 tackles), the
Trojans still play a fundamen
tal, aggressive defense,
though. They do not make
great efforts to disguise what
they are doing.
Needs time
Given the time, Card quar
terback Guy Benjamin, the na
tion's leading passer with 22.4
completions per game and
1378 yards on the season,
should be able to read the de
fense and get the ball to his
receivers.
"I don't think you ever stop a
man with Benjamin's ability,"
said Robinson. "He's probabiy
the best quarterback in the
country. But we hope to con
tain him some and slow him
down."
Three Card pass catchers are

among the top five in the con
ference — James Lofton is No.
1 with 41 receptions, halfback
Darrin Nelson is second with
39 and receiver Bill Kellar is
fifth with 35.
Nelson, with 742 yards
gained on the ground, needs
only three more to eclipse
White's record rushing yar
dage by a freshman.
Nearly as important as the
personnel on the field is the
strategy of the coaches. "So
much of football is calling the
right play at the right time,"
said Walsh. "We have to make
first downs to win ball games.
People complain we don't
throw the bomb, but our con
cern is more in keeping the
ball."
About three hours after
kick-off tomorrow, the Cards
will know whether they held
onto the ball long enough to
improve their Rose Bowl
chances.

Guy Benjamin fires a pass under pressure in Stanford's 37-24 victory
oyer Illinois early this season. Benjamin, the nation's leading passer
with 22.4 completions per game, hit on 17 of 29 attempts and three
TDs in the rain against Oregon last weekend.
Beneath the haze, seagulls
circle inside the littered
stadium. The empty field is co
vered by afternoon shadows.
Most of the 70,000 people are
gone, but a pocket of noisy
fans continue to celebrate. It's
almost 5 o'clock. Stanford has
defeated USC in the Coliseum.
The Cardinals seem destined
for Pasadena. That's right, Stan
ford is going to the Rose Bowl.
Hey, wait a minute! Quit
dreaming! The white-haired
coach with the space age of
fense and the meditating quar
terback is supposed to be re
building a team, not getting it a
Pacific-8 championship.
Why even the staunchest
Stanford rooter would have
been kidding himself during
the summer to think the Cards
would have a legitimate shot at
going to the Rose Bowl this
season.
But going into tomorrow af
ternoon's game against USC in
the Coliseum (1:30 KZSU FM
90.1, KSFO AM 650), first-year
head coach Bill Walsh has a 6-2
team on the verge of the most
successful grid season on the
Farm in six years.

"I feel there is some pres
sure off us," Walsh said earlier
this week while preparing for
USC. "We're not fighting for
success. We already have
that."
But knocking oft the Trojans
would go a long way towards
extending the Stanford season
to a 12th game sometime in
December or January.
Stopping the Trojans consti
tutes a formidable task,
though. They are big, they are
fast, they are mean, and they
are ranked first in team offense
and team defense in the Pac-8.
One thing they aren't is in
vincible. The Trojans are 5-3
overall, and on a two-game los
ing streak. They were blitzed
by Notre Dame (49-19) in In
diana before Cal slapped them
with their first conference loss
(17-14) a week ago at Berkeley.
Stanford on top
The defeat left USC with a 1-1
conference mark and a loss to
first-place Stanford (4-1) would
end the Trojans' hopes for the
Rose Bowl.
"The whole team is off a little
bit," said second-year Trojan
head coach John Robinson.
"We ran into places where they
were a little crazy. We didn't
pick the right time to have a
slump."
While getting back home
might prove to be an advantage
for the Trojans, Walsh said the
adversity of playing on the road
won't be critical. "I don't think
it'll be a disadvantage like it
might be in other stadiums
around the country," he said.
