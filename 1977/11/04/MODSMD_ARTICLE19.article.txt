# Miller joins soothsaying staffers
## 
### 
Huge sums of money
change hands each week
during off-track (and often
off-the-record) football
bets. Forecasts and point
spreads are a multi-million
dollar business and so the
Daily sports staff, a rank
crew of amateurs not want
ing to lose its shirt, has
sought help with this week's
pigskin picks from the
businessman's business
man, Arjay Miller, dean of
the Stanford Graduate
School of Business.
Miller, who heads the na
tion's No. 1 Biz School, is
experienced in instructing
students how to invest
wisely in the future. Passing
this same wisdom to our
humble sports staff, Miller
foresees winning futures

thus:
"The following solutions
are based on objective input
from our widely recognized
Biz School quant jocks —
modified only where neces
sary by traditional business
wishful thinking.
"Stanford over USC.
Brains over brawn is a Car
dinal rule when it comes to
the bottom line.
"Cal over Washington.
The Bears will be bullish
about bowl possibilities —
including ours.
"UCLA over Oregon.
Webbed feet are no match
for Bruin claws — even if it
rains.
"Washington State over
Oregon State. The Beavers'
dam won't be able to con
tain the Cougars' pressure."
