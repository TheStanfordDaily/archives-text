# Unrest in Lebanon part of 'conspiracy'

"The recent crisis in Lebanon ap
pears to have been the product of an
international conspiracy aimed at
crushing the Palestinian resistance
movement," asserted Stanford Mid
dle East scholar Michel Nabti.
Nabti, speaking on "Lebanon To
day," told an audience of about 150
at Bechtel International Center on
Wednesday that the 1975 Lebanese
civil war was the result of a plot in
volving Israel, other Arab states and
possibly the United States.
These powers sought to topple the
existing Lebanese power structure
and replace it with one more hostile
to Palestinian liberation forces living
within Lebanon, he said.
Historically, the Palestinians have
had training camps and recruiting
centers in Lebanon, he said. Croups
such as the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) have enjoyed re
lative freedom of operation, and
geographically, Lebanon affords
easy access to Israel for military ac
tion, he said.
For this reason, Israel and her
sympathetic allies seek to control the
Lebanese government and sub
sequently eliminate the Palestinian
threat, claims Nabti.
"Also, Israel finds it to her own
advantage if her Arab neighbors are
preoccupied with internal strife," he

added.
The traditional explanation of
domestic strife within Lebanon has
been hostility between different re
ligious factions, said Nabti. He al
leges the Christian-Moslem conflict
is a mere facade â€” a creation of
Western journalists.
"Christians and Moslems have in
termingled for a long time. They have
lived together and gone to school to
gether. There is no partition of
Beirut, as some claim," Nabti said.
"Those who seek power in Leba
non have found it convenient to
manipulate these confessional (re
ligious) groups, and play the diffe
rent factions against each other," he
added.
Nabti claimed that Christians and
Moslems were incited to violence by
Lebanese who were "susceptible
and receptive" to the influence of
the conspiring powers. He also
claimed that hired assassins killed at
random to breed hostility between
religious groups.
He cites as evidence of this man
ipulation the total destruction of the
commercial sector of Beirut, and the
lack of damage in residential areas.
Nabti claims that a religious war
would have devastated the popu
lated areas in an effort to kill off op
posing forces. He said the destruc-
