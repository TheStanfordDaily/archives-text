# Senior All-American plays for fun
## Rick Johannsen: true team player 
### Brad Brockbank 
So you're finally coerced
into watching your very first
water polo game. You stroll to
deCuerre just to see these 14
guys in funny caps, swimming
around and trying to throw this
damn yellow ball into a cage.
And to top it off, you keep se
eing this guy with a 23 on his
cap treading water four meters
in front of one of the cages and
every time he gets the ball, the
guy behind him with the
other-colored cap climbs on
him.
Curious, you check the yel
low roster in your hands,
handed to you by the coach of
this masochist, and find out
that this guy getting dunked,
this glutton for punishment, is
none other than Rick
Johannsen and he's a senior.
Knowing that seniors are god
like and should have better
sense, you conclude that the
roster is in error and decide
Rick Johannsen must be a
freshman from some place you
hope you never have to visit.
"When I came to Stanford, I
didn't come here to play water
polo and I'm still not here to
play water polo. I was going to

swim until I found out that (Art)
Lambert was going to be coach
ing water polo. It was fairly ob
vious, then, that they (Stan
ford) were going to develop a
polo program so I decided I'd
try and play."
Three years, one coach and
two All-American honors later,
senior Rick Johannsen is play
ing for a water polo program
that has risen, in three years,
from the cellar to the top of the
Pac-fl.
Now in his fourth year as a
starter on the Stanford team,
Johannsen has settled into a
dual role as part-time hole
setter, part-time driver.
Though he earned his All-
American honors primarily as a
quick driving shooter, the 6-0,
185 pound pre-law student has
moved in to set the hole, off
and on, for the last two years.
Team player
"It's one of those things
where you're playing a team
sport — you have to fill the
spots where you're needed,"
Johannsen explained. "I think I
actually started playing there
because I'd been playing with
these guys long enough to
know who's going to do what,
when.
"I have no business being a

hole man," he continued. "I
have the weakest legs on the
team, which I'm not afraid to
say because it's true. To play
the hole you've got to have
strong legs and you've got to
be able to get up out of the
water. I have problems with
that.
"The hole man has to control
the offense. He has to make
the decisions about whether to
use the drivers or get the hell
back outside. He has to choose
his passes."
Midway through this season,
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti inserted junior Dave
Egan into the starting lineup to
switch off with Johannsen in
the hole.
"Dave's doing just as good of
a job, now," Johannsen said.
"He does have better legs and
he's stronger. He set the hole
for four years in high school.
That's his position."
Difficult adjustment
According to Dettamanti,
making the adjustment from
driver to hole has been a little
difficult for Johannsen.
"It's hard to make that ad
justment," Johannsen agreed,
"because your hands have to
get quicker. Playing in the
hole, you try to slow things
down, control things, try to get
the ball to the right place and
make the good, accurate pass.
When you're driving, you've
got to be quick and I feel like
I've lost that a little."
Lack of size can also be a
problem for a hole man. A
good team, however, will
compensate for their weaknes
ses.
"This team is a smart team,"
explained Johannsen. "We've
played together for a long time
and I have confidence in every
guy out there. Maybe I can't
muscle a man in there, so I'll
just set to the side and they'll
get the ball to me."
According to fellow senior
Marty Davis, the respect bet
ween the hole man and the rest
of the team is mutual.
"Personally," Davis said, "I
like the kind of hole he sets.
He's very easy to work and get
along with. He's also one of the

best defensive players on the
team."
Athletes not special
"The actual reason that I'm
playing is for these other
guys," said Johannsen. "I'm
not out here for myself be
cause I don't think there's per
sonal glory in athletics. I don't
want people to think that be
cause I'm an athlete, I'm spe
cial. It doesn't matter that
much to me. I'm out there be
cause of the other guys. We
like each other and we like to
play together.
"It takes seven people," he
continued. "If I fall a little short
on something, those guys will
pick up for me. Then, next
time, maybe I'll pick up for
somebody else.
"I like to win, but athletics
is just one of the things in my
life that means something to
me. Water polo is not all I live
for."
There is a lot of rough play in
the hole that is visible to the
spectator. However, there is
also quite a bit that goes on
under the water as well.
"There's a lot of suit grab
bing," Johannsen explained.
"To set position, you've got to
get the man behind you and
keep him there. You can do
that by keeping your arms
wide, but a lot of times, it's
easier to reach back and grab
him by the suit."
"This is not a war," he con
cluded. "Perhaps I'm not as
good a water polo player as I
could be because of that at
titude. I'm out there to play a
game, not to fight a war. I just
want to go out there and be
with six other guys, play hard,
enjoy it, make some good
moves and some good passes.
I don't want to go out there and
fight. That's stupid. Athletics,
to me, is just not that impor
tant. There are other things far
more important in life than
going out there and having a
little war in the pool."
Now convinced that Rick
Johannsen fits your image of a
senior after all, you can
enjoy the game and appreciate
the athletes for what they are
both in and out of the pool.
