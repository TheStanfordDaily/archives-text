# Poloists set for UCLA, USC
## 
### Brad Brookbank 
"We can't afford to overlook
USC and UCLA despite the fact
that we beat them both easily
last time," said Stanford water
polo coach Dante Dettamanti.
"Both teams have shown they
can play well 'in their home
pools."
The Catdinal poloists leave
today for a Southern road trip,
facing the Bruins this after
noon and the Trojans tomor
row morning.
"California made this same
road trip recently," said De
ttamanti. "They lost to USC
and went into overtime against
UCLA. We can't afford to be
too complacent. We're just
going to have to put out of our
minds the fact that we beat
them both by big scores.

"We have to win both
games," he continued. "If we
do, we automatically assure
ourselves of a berth in the
NCAA championships."
Stanford now boasts a 13-2
overall record and is 2-1 in
Pac-8 play. The last time Stan
ford played these two teams,
the Cards prevailed, 7-2 over
UCLA and 10-2 over USC, in
very physical games.
Senior Rick Johannsen and
Junior Dave Egan, the Card
hole-setters, believe the games
should not be quite as rough
this time.
"Usually," said Johannsen,
"when we go down south, the
officiating is tighter. The re
ferees are usually able to con
trol the game and not let it get

out of hand."
"We should be able to set
well against both teams," Egan
added.
The health of goalie John
Cansel has improved greatly,
according to Dettamanti. Gan
sel, who played the Irvine
game last Saturday feeling tired
and weak, has been practicing
extremely well, Dettamanti
said.
"In fact," kidded the coach,
"The way he's been practicing
this week, I wish he'd get sick
more often!"
Dettamanti cited an example
in which his seven best shoot
ers each took five consecutive
shots from six yards out. Of the
35 shots taken at Gansel, only
two got by the freshman.
