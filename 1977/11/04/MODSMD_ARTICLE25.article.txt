Floods, quake ravage Greece
Athens, Greece — Torrential rains swept down hills and over
flowed rivers yesterday in Athens and its port city of Piraeus,
leaving behind 25 dead and damage estimated at millions of
dollars.
Water stood 3.3 feet deep in major highways into the city and
hundreds of cars sat abandoned in the streets. Some archeolog
ical monuments at the-foot of the Acropolis had to be pumped
out.
A fall of 2.7 inches of rain in a 15-hour period Wednesday
night and early yesterday, described as "unprecedented" by
local weathermen, clogged sewer systems with debris.
While Athens and Piraeus lay partially paralyzed under
floodwaters, an earthquake rumbled through northeastern
Greece and neighboring Bulgaria early yesterday. Although no
serious damage or injuries were reported in Greece, the quake
created panic in the Thracian port city of Kavalla, where
thousands of residents fled into the streets in their pajamas.
In Bulgaria the official news agency BTA said the quake dam
aged buildings and railway lines southeast of Sofia, the capital,
but reported no casualties.
U.N. condemns hijacking
United Nations — The U.N. General Assembly approved a
resolution yesterday condemning airliner hijacking and calling
on all nations to take "all necessary steps" to stop it.
The resolution, adopted nearly unanimously without a vote
as a statement of consensus by the 149-nation assembly, is the
first anti-hijacking measure put on the record here. Although
non-binding, the resolution is expected to put pressure on
countries that have been granting asylum to air pirates.
Among nations that have given sanctuary to hijackers are
Algeria, Cuba, Libya, Uganda and North Korea. North Korea is
not a member of the United Nations and hijackers avoid Cuba
these days because they are usually arrested when they land.
The U.N. resolution asks all states to tighten airport and
airline security arrangements, take "all necessary steps ... to
prevent" aerial hijacking or other interference with civil air
travel, and act to make sure threats and violence against pas
sengers, crew or aircraft are "not used as a means of extorting
advantages of any kind."
Brass misuse military planes
Washington — High ranking military and civilian officials sys
tematically misuse military aircraft and have kept some Air

Force pilots so busy flying generals they had no time for re
quired combat training, Pentagon auditors said yesterday.
The Defense Audit Service made the finding in a report that
said the military and civilian defense officials use military planes
for personal trips or for low priority missions at an annual cost
of at least $52.3 million.
The report was made public by Sen. William Proxmire (D-
Wis.) who cited it as an example of flagrant waste.
The audit examined the improper use of aircraft by the Air
Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps at military installations
around the world. It found rank to be the most important factor
in obtaining a free military flight, not the relative importance of
the mission involved.
Wholesale prices take upward turn
Washington — Wholesale prices rose 0.8 per cent in October
as farm prices turned upward for the first time in six months,
signaling higher grocery prices this winter.
The increase was the biggest since a 1.1 per cent rise in
wholesale prices last April, just before farm prices began a
dramatic decline.
Farm prices had plunged nearly 13 per cent in May through
September, and this helped slow the rise in prices at the groc
ery store.
But in October, wholesale farm prices jumped 2.4 per cent.
This, coupled with higher costs for new 1978 model cars and
trucks, pushed overall wholesale prices up 0.8 per cent.
While retail food prices are likely to rise at a faster pace this
winter than during the fall and summer months, government
economists and White House officials said there is no evidence
of a dramatic surge ahead.
Congress speeds up work on energy
Washington — House and Senate leaders, facing the possibil
ity that Congress may fail to complete work on a national
energy bill this year, sought ways yesterday to speed up work
on a compromise.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd arranged to have two conference committees in
stead of one work on the legislation.
One conference committee will continue working on non
tax aspects while the new one will begin meeting next week to
discuss energy taxes.
Carter has said he will cancel his proposed four-continent
trip, scheduled to begin on Nov. 22, if Congress has not
finished its energy work by then.

House rejects compromise on abortion
Washington — The House rejected yesterday a Senate
proposed compromise on guidelines governing when the gov
ernment should pay for poor women's abortions.
Instead, the members adopted a temporary funding resolu
tion which would insure that the 3'/2-month-old abortion dis
pute would not affect the paychecks of thousands of federal
employes.
The resolution, which also would continue appropriations
for the District of Columbia government, passed on a voice
vote. It expires Nov. 30.
The House scuttled plans for adjourning last night for a
three-week recess. The members were to remain for a session
today in case the Senate failed to go along with the resolution.
The abortion disagreement has delayed passage of a $60.2
billion appropriations bill providing funds for the departments
of Labor and Health, Education a>id Welfare along with some
smaller, related agencies.
The controversy is over guidelines for the use of federal
funds from Medicaid and social services programs to pay for
abortions.
Saccharin bill nears final approval
Washington — A bill that would require cancer warning labels
on diet food and soft drinks containing saccharin was passed by
the House last night and sent to the Senate.
The biII, approved by voice vote, was expected to be adopted
by the Senate today.
The legislation would block for 18 months a Food and Drug
Administration ban on the artificial sweetener. The FDA wants
to prohibit saccharin as an additive to food and beverages, but
permit its sale as a nonprescription drug.
Senate and House conferees worked out the bill as a com
promise to two different versions passed earlier by the two
houses.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy with a chance of rain today and tonight. Clear

Highs both days in the 60s. Winds northwest 15 to 25 mph
becoming west to southwest today. Chance of rain 30 per cent
today and tonight.

on all nations to take "all necessary steps" to stop it.
The resolution, adopted nearly unanimously without a vote
as a statement of consensus by the 149-nation assembly, is the
first anti-hijacking measure put on the record here. Although
non-binding, the resolution is expected to put pressure on
countries that have been granting asylum to air pirates.
Among nations that have given sanctuary to hijackers are
Algeria, Cuba, Libya, Uganda and North Korea. North Korea is
not a member of the United Nations and hijackers avoid Cuba
these days because they are usually arrested when they land.
The U.N. resolution asks all states to tighten airport and
airline security arrangements, take "all necessary steps ... to
prevent" aerial hijacking or other interference with civil air
travel, and act to make sure threats and violence against pas
sengers, crew or aircraft are "not used as a means of extorting
advantages of any kind."
Brass misuse military planes
Washington — High ranking military and civilian officials sys
tematically misuse military aircraft and have kept some Air

Force pilots so busy flying generals they had no time for re
quired combat training, Pentagon auditors said yesterday.
The Defense Audit Service made the finding in a report that
said the military and civilian defense officials use military planes
for personal trips or for low priority missions at an annual cost
of at least $52.3 million.
The report was made public by Sen. William Proxmire (D-
Wis.) who cited it as an example of flagrant waste.
The audit examined the improper use of aircraft by the Air
Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps at military installations
around the world. It found rank to be the most important factor
in obtaining a free military flight, not the relative importance of
the mission involved.
Wholesale prices take upward turn
Washington — Wholesale prices rose 0.8 per cent in October
as farm prices turned upward for the first time in six months,
signaling higher grocery prices this winter.
The increase was the biggest since a 1.1 per cent rise in
wholesale prices last April, just before farm prices began a
dramatic decline.
Farm prices had plunged nearly 13 per cent in May through
September, and this helped slow the rise in prices at the groc
ery store.
But in October, wholesale farm prices jumped 2.4 per cent.
This, coupled with higher costs for new 1978 model cars and
trucks, pushed overall wholesale prices up 0.8 per cent.
While retail food prices are likely to rise at a faster pace this
winter than during the fall and summer months, government
economists and White House officials said there is no evidence
of a dramatic surge ahead.
Congress speeds up work on energy
Washington — House and Senate leaders, facing the possibil
ity that Congress may fail to complete work on a national
energy bill this year, sought ways yesterday to speed up work
on a compromise.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd arranged to have two conference committees in
stead of one work on the legislation.
One conference committee will continue working on non
tax aspects while the new one will begin meeting next week to
discuss energy taxes.
Carter has said he will cancel his proposed four-continent
trip, scheduled to begin on Nov. 22, if Congress has not
finished its energy work by then.

House rejects compromise on abortion
Washington — The House rejected yesterday a Senate
proposed compromise on guidelines governing when the gov
ernment should pay for poor women's abortions.
Instead, the members adopted a temporary funding resolu
tion which would insure that the 3'/2-month-old abortion dis
pute would not affect the paychecks of thousands of federal
employes.
The resolution, which also would continue appropriations
for the District of Columbia government, passed on a voice
vote. It expires Nov. 30.
The House scuttled plans for adjourning last night for a
three-week recess. The members were to remain for a session
today in case the Senate failed to go along with the resolution.
The abortion disagreement has delayed passage of a $60.2
billion appropriations bill providing funds for the departments
of Labor and Health, Education a>id Welfare along with some
smaller, related agencies.
The controversy is over guidelines for the use of federal
funds from Medicaid and social services programs to pay for
abortions.
Saccharin bill nears final approval
Washington — A bill that would require cancer warning labels
on diet food and soft drinks containing saccharin was passed by
the House last night and sent to the Senate.
The biII, approved by voice vote, was expected to be adopted
by the Senate today.
The legislation would block for 18 months a Food and Drug
Administration ban on the artificial sweetener. The FDA wants
to prohibit saccharin as an additive to food and beverages, but
permit its sale as a nonprescription drug.
Senate and House conferees worked out the bill as a com
promise to two different versions passed earlier by the two
houses.
Today's weather

Floods, quake ravage Greece
Athens, Greece — Torrential rains swept down hills and over
flowed rivers yesterday in Athens and its port city of Piraeus,
leaving behind 25 dead and damage estimated at millions of
dollars.
Water stood 3.3 feet deep in major highways into the city and
hundreds of cars sat abandoned in the streets. Some archeolog
ical monuments at the-foot of the Acropolis had to be pumped
out.
A fall of 2.7 inches of rain in a 15-hour period Wednesday
night and early yesterday, described as "unprecedented" by
local weathermen, clogged sewer systems with debris.
While Athens and Piraeus lay partially paralyzed under
floodwaters, an earthquake rumbled through northeastern
Greece and neighboring Bulgaria early yesterday. Although no
serious damage or injuries were reported in Greece, the quake
created panic in the Thracian port city of Kavalla, where
thousands of residents fled into the streets in their pajamas.
In Bulgaria the official news agency BTA said the quake dam
aged buildings and railway lines southeast of Sofia, the capital,
but reported no casualties.

said the military and civilian defense officials use military planes
for personal trips or for low priority missions at an annual cost
of at least $52.3 million.
The report was made public by Sen. William Proxmire (D-
Wis.) who cited it as an example of flagrant waste.
The audit examined the improper use of aircraft by the Air
Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps at military installations
around the world. It found rank to be the most important factor
in obtaining a free military flight, not the relative importance of
the mission involved.
Wholesale prices take upward turn
Washington — Wholesale prices rose 0.8 per cent in October
as farm prices turned upward for the first time in six months,
signaling higher grocery prices this winter.
The increase was the biggest since a 1.1 per cent rise in
wholesale prices last April, just before farm prices began a
dramatic decline.
Farm prices had plunged nearly 13 per cent in May through
September, and this helped slow the rise in prices at the groc
ery store.
But in October, wholesale farm prices jumped 2.4 per cent.
This, coupled with higher costs for new 1978 model cars and
trucks, pushed overall wholesale prices up 0.8 per cent.
While retail food prices are likely to rise at a faster pace this
winter than during the fall and summer months, government
economists and White House officials said there is no evidence
of a dramatic surge ahead.
Congress speeds up work on energy
Washington — House and Senate leaders, facing the possibil
ity that Congress may fail to complete work on a national
energy bill this year, sought ways yesterday to speed up work
on a compromise.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd arranged to have two conference committees in
stead of one work on the legislation.
One conference committee will continue working on non
tax aspects while the new one will begin meeting next week to
discuss energy taxes.
Carter has said he will cancel his proposed four-continent
trip, scheduled to begin on Nov. 22, if Congress has not
finished its energy work by then.

House rejects compromise on abortion
Washington — The House rejected yesterday a Senate
proposed compromise on guidelines governing when the gov
ernment should pay for poor women's abortions.
Instead, the members adopted a temporary funding resolu
tion which would insure that the 3'/2-month-old abortion dis
pute would not affect the paychecks of thousands of federal
employes.
The resolution, which also would continue appropriations
for the District of Columbia government, passed on a voice
vote. It expires Nov. 30.
The House scuttled plans for adjourning last night for a
three-week recess. The members were to remain for a session
today in case the Senate failed to go along with the resolution.
The abortion disagreement has delayed passage of a $60.2
billion appropriations bill providing funds for the departments
of Labor and Health, Education a>id Welfare along with some
smaller, related agencies.
The controversy is over guidelines for the use of federal
funds from Medicaid and social services programs to pay for
abortions.
Saccharin bill nears final approval
Washington — A bill that would require cancer warning labels
on diet food and soft drinks containing saccharin was passed by
the House last night and sent to the Senate.
The biII, approved by voice vote, was expected to be adopted
by the Senate today.
The legislation would block for 18 months a Food and Drug
Administration ban on the artificial sweetener. The FDA wants
to prohibit saccharin as an additive to food and beverages, but
permit its sale as a nonprescription drug.
Senate and House conferees worked out the bill as a com
promise to two different versions passed earlier by the two
houses.
Today's weather

today and tonight.
Floods, quake ravage Greece
Athens, Greece — Torrential rains swept down hills and over
flowed rivers yesterday in Athens and its port city of Piraeus,
leaving behind 25 dead and damage estimated at millions of
dollars.
Water stood 3.3 feet deep in major highways into the city and
hundreds of cars sat abandoned in the streets. Some archeolog
ical monuments at the-foot of the Acropolis had to be pumped
out.
A fall of 2.7 inches of rain in a 15-hour period Wednesday
night and early yesterday, described as "unprecedented" by
local weathermen, clogged sewer systems with debris.
While Athens and Piraeus lay partially paralyzed under
floodwaters, an earthquake rumbled through northeastern
Greece and neighboring Bulgaria early yesterday. Although no
serious damage or injuries were reported in Greece, the quake
created panic in the Thracian port city of Kavalla, where
thousands of residents fled into the streets in their pajamas.
In Bulgaria the official news agency BTA said the quake dam
aged buildings and railway lines southeast of Sofia, the capital,
but reported no casualties.
U.N. condemns hijacking
United Nations — The U.N. General Assembly approved a
resolution yesterday condemning airliner hijacking and calling
on all nations to take "all necessary steps" to stop it.
The resolution, adopted nearly unanimously without a vote
as a statement of consensus by the 149-nation assembly, is the
first anti-hijacking measure put on the record here. Although
non-binding, the resolution is expected to put pressure on
countries that have been granting asylum to air pirates.
Among nations that have given sanctuary to hijackers are
Algeria, Cuba, Libya, Uganda and North Korea. North Korea is
not a member of the United Nations and hijackers avoid Cuba
these days because they are usually arrested when they land.
The U.N. resolution asks all states to tighten airport and
airline security arrangements, take "all necessary steps ... to
prevent" aerial hijacking or other interference with civil air
travel, and act to make sure threats and violence against pas
sengers, crew or aircraft are "not used as a means of extorting
advantages of any kind."
