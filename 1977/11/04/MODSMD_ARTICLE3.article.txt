# New composition of CIR recommended
## 
### Will Nixon 
The ad hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility has tenatively
decided to recommend that the
permanent CIR be charged to in
clude two employes, one trustee and
one administrator in addition to its
present membership, according to
CIR member Lloyd Dixon.
Currently, the committee consists
of three students, three faculty
members and three alumni.
Rod Adams, director of finance
and ex-officio CIR member, pointed
out that procedures exist for choos
ing all of the proposed members ex
cept the two non-faculty, non
administration employes. Nelson
Dong, an alumni member of the ad
hoc CIR, said the committee's up
coming report probably won't
suggest any solutions to this prob
lem.

An earlier proposal to have similar
employe representation on the ad
hoc CI R was defeated by a committee
vote of 6 to 3. The present CIR also
has no employe representation.
Thead hoc CIR report is scheduled
to appear in mid-November and"it
looks like it will," said Committee
Chairman Prof. Ron Bracewell. The
report will go to the trustees for dis
cussion at their December meeting.
With the new composition, Dixon
said, "Hopefully anyone in the
community will be able to get any
issue on the agenda."
Other members also stressed their
desire to have an accessable CIR. "I
am concerned with encouraging the
small voice that happens to be right,"
said alumni member Laude Burnett.
The report will suggest a
"mechanism of bringing questions
of substantial social injury to the at

tention of the CIR," said Adams, ad
ding that this process will not be one
"requiring a number of student and
faculty signatures on a petition."
The new CIR "will have a very im
portant diffusing and educational
function" which could take the hot
issue of the moment on campus and
see it in a larger perspective, includ
ing alumni views.
"I hope the new CIR won't diffuse
but sharpen the issues so that a pol
icy could be drawn up," said Ellen
Byrne, a student member of the ad
hoc CIR.
The report, Adams said, will re
commend a way for the CIR to
budget some staff time and money
for research. Members of the ClRwill
be better informed and therefore
better able to ask questions, said
Adams.

Perhaps the most important ques
tion, said Dixon, is how the trustees
will respond to reports from the new
CIR.
The ad hoc report will recommend
that CIR reports go directly to the
trustees and include an opportunity
for minority opinions.
In the past, CIR reports have gone
to the vice president for business and
finance, who then forwarded them
to the trustees.
"There is some evidence that
former Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Augsburger
edited CIR reports before forwarding
them," said Byrne, who also stressed
that there be a mechanism for the
trustees to report back to the CIR and
the community the reasons for their
decisions.

edited CIR reports before forwarding
them," said Byrne, who also stressed
that there be a mechanism for the
trustees to report back to the CIR and
the community the reasons for their
decisions.
The ad hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility has tenatively
decided to recommend that the
permanent CIR be charged to in
clude two employes, one trustee and
one administrator in addition to its
present membership, according to
CIR member Lloyd Dixon.
Currently, the committee consists
of three students, three faculty
members and three alumni.
Rod Adams, director of finance
and ex-officio CIR member, pointed
out that procedures exist for choos
ing all of the proposed members ex
cept the two non-faculty, non
administration employes. Nelson
Dong, an alumni member of the ad
hoc CIR, said the committee's up
coming report probably won't
suggest any solutions to this prob
lem.

An earlier proposal to have similar
employe representation on the ad
hoc CI R was defeated by a committee
vote of 6 to 3. The present CIR also
has no employe representation.
Thead hoc CIR report is scheduled
to appear in mid-November and"it
looks like it will," said Committee
Chairman Prof. Ron Bracewell. The
report will go to the trustees for dis
cussion at their December meeting.
With the new composition, Dixon
said, "Hopefully anyone in the
community will be able to get any
issue on the agenda."
Other members also stressed their
desire to have an accessable CIR. "I
am concerned with encouraging the
small voice that happens to be right,"
said alumni member Laude Burnett.
The report will suggest a
"mechanism of bringing questions
of substantial social injury to the at

tention of the CIR," said Adams, ad
ding that this process will not be one
"requiring a number of student and
faculty signatures on a petition."
The new CIR "will have a very im
portant diffusing and educational
function" which could take the hot
issue of the moment on campus and
see it in a larger perspective, includ
ing alumni views.
"I hope the new CIR won't diffuse
but sharpen the issues so that a pol
icy could be drawn up," said Ellen
Byrne, a student member of the ad
hoc CIR.
The report, Adams said, will re
commend a way for the CIR to
budget some staff time and money
for research. Members of the ClRwill
be better informed and therefore
better able to ask questions, said
Adams.

Perhaps the most important ques
tion, said Dixon, is how the trustees
will respond to reports from the new
CIR.
The ad hoc report will recommend
that CIR reports go directly to the
trustees and include an opportunity
for minority opinions.
In the past, CIR reports have gone
to the vice president for business and
finance, who then forwarded them
to the trustees.
"There is some evidence that
former Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Augsburger
edited CIR reports before forwarding
them," said Byrne, who also stressed
that there be a mechanism for the
trustees to report back to the CIR and
the community the reasons for their
