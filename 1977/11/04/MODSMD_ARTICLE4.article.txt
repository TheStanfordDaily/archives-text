# Med School starts alcoholism program
## 
### Andrea James 
Alcoholism and its accompanying problems are
affecting an increasing number of Americans and
their families. Each year the disease claims more
and more victims, cutting across all barriers such
as race, sex and age.
In response to this mushrooming problem, the
Medical School opened in October a new al
coholic counseling program, which is equipped to
provide services focusing on living problems and
emotional difficulties concerning alcohol, as well
as individual patientdrinking problems, according
to Stephanie Brown, associate director of the
program.
Patients at the clinic are referred to the program
by medical personnel, Brown said.
Wide services
A wide range of outpatient services is offered for
alcoholics and their families, including a com
prehensive diagnostic procedure, individual
counseling, group therapy, couples and sexual
counseling, family therapy and children's ser
vices.
"We are equipped to offer a variety of therapy
groups," she explained. "We'll have as many ses
sions as people need them."
Brown said she hopes interest will warrant hav
ing therapy groups for teetotalers and adolescent
alcoholics.
"We'd also like to see therapy sessions for adult

children of alcoholics," she said. "A lot of kids
grew up with alcoholic parents and they were
never able to talk about the problems they were
having at home."
Brown said the clinic is primarily designed for
problem drinkers who have already gone through
detoxification.
"If the patient is using AA (Alcoholics Anonym
ous) and their therapy is working, then he is wel
come to come to our therapy sessions.
"Detoxification is not one of our goals at this
time. We don't have a 24-hour drop-in service.
Our therapy sessions are done on an
appointment-only basis. We're here to help the
patient return to society, to teach him or her to live
without alcohol in a productive, meaningful way."
She added, "AA can provide the direct head-on
attack needed to detoxify an alcoholic. They do it
beautifully."
Weekly series
The clinic also sponsors a free weekly education
series on alcohol which is open to staff, students,
patients and the general public. The first lecture is
scheduled for Monday at 1 p.m. in Room TB 121 of
the Medical School. Brown's lecture will be,
"What is too much alcohol?"
Lectures, discussions and films are scheduled
every week thereafter.
Several corporations in the area have expressed
a desire to refer alcoholic employes to the clinic's

outpatient program, according to Brown.
"Corporations are beginning to recognize al
coholism as a culturally widespread problem," she
said. "Special programs are set up within busines
ses and corporations which train supervisors to
detect alcoholism, confront the person and con
vince him to seek treatment. Some businesses are
providing funds for the alcoholism counseling and
others provide insurance for alcoholism."
She added that Stanford has an Employe Assis
tance Counseling center on campus with persons
trained in working with alcoholics.
Patient call-ins
Patients who call the clinic are given a series of
interviews for clinical assessment, psychological
testing and, if necessary, a medical evaluation.
Once the interviews are completed, a specific
treatment plan is drawn up by a team of profes
sionals.
The clinic charges a sliding scale ranging from
$30 to $55 for individual counseling and $12 to $22
for group therapy. Rates are based on the patient's
ability to pay and insurance coverage, according to
Brown.
The clinic is directed by Irvin Yalom, professor
of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Brown said
two clinical faculty members serve as consultants
to the clinic, Harvey Pirofsky and Albert Bochner.
Faculty consultant to the clinic is Vincent Zarcone,
another clinical faculty associate.

interviews for clinical assessment, psychological
testing and, if necessary, a medical evaluation.
Once the interviews are completed, a specific
treatment plan is drawn up by a team of profes
sionals.
The clinic charges a sliding scale ranging from
$30 to $55 for individual counseling and $12 to $22
for group therapy. Rates are based on the patient's
ability to pay and insurance coverage, according to
Brown.
The clinic is directed by Irvin Yalom, professor
of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Brown said
two clinical faculty members serve as consultants
to the clinic, Harvey Pirofsky and Albert Bochner.
Faculty consultant to the clinic is Vincent Zarcone,
another clinical faculty associate.
Alcoholism and its accompanying problems are
affecting an increasing number of Americans and
their families. Each year the disease claims more
and more victims, cutting across all barriers such
as race, sex and age.
In response to this mushrooming problem, the
Medical School opened in October a new al
coholic counseling program, which is equipped to
provide services focusing on living problems and
emotional difficulties concerning alcohol, as well
as individual patientdrinking problems, according
to Stephanie Brown, associate director of the
program.
Patients at the clinic are referred to the program
by medical personnel, Brown said.
Wide services
A wide range of outpatient services is offered for
alcoholics and their families, including a com
prehensive diagnostic procedure, individual
counseling, group therapy, couples and sexual
counseling, family therapy and children's ser
vices.
"We are equipped to offer a variety of therapy
groups," she explained. "We'll have as many ses
sions as people need them."
Brown said she hopes interest will warrant hav
ing therapy groups for teetotalers and adolescent
alcoholics.
"We'd also like to see therapy sessions for adult

children of alcoholics," she said. "A lot of kids
grew up with alcoholic parents and they were
never able to talk about the problems they were
having at home."
Brown said the clinic is primarily designed for
problem drinkers who have already gone through
detoxification.
"If the patient is using AA (Alcoholics Anonym
ous) and their therapy is working, then he is wel
come to come to our therapy sessions.
"Detoxification is not one of our goals at this
time. We don't have a 24-hour drop-in service.
Our therapy sessions are done on an
appointment-only basis. We're here to help the
patient return to society, to teach him or her to live
without alcohol in a productive, meaningful way."
She added, "AA can provide the direct head-on
attack needed to detoxify an alcoholic. They do it
beautifully."
Weekly series
The clinic also sponsors a free weekly education
series on alcohol which is open to staff, students,
patients and the general public. The first lecture is
scheduled for Monday at 1 p.m. in Room TB 121 of
the Medical School. Brown's lecture will be,
"What is too much alcohol?"
Lectures, discussions and films are scheduled
every week thereafter.
Several corporations in the area have expressed
a desire to refer alcoholic employes to the clinic's

outpatient program, according to Brown.
"Corporations are beginning to recognize al
coholism as a culturally widespread problem," she
said. "Special programs are set up within busines
ses and corporations which train supervisors to
detect alcoholism, confront the person and con
vince him to seek treatment. Some businesses are
providing funds for the alcoholism counseling and
others provide insurance for alcoholism."
She added that Stanford has an Employe Assis
tance Counseling center on campus with persons
trained in working with alcoholics.
