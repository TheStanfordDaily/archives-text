# Bakke lawyer: no threat to minorities
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The decision of the Califor
nia Supreme Court in the
Bakke case does not prohibit
affirmative action in university
admissions processes, accord
ing to Reynold Colvin, counsel
for Allan Bakke.
Allan Bakke, a white, was
denied admission to the UC-
Davis Medical School. In a suit
filed after his second rejection
by that school, Bakke contends
that a quota system for admit
ting minorities at Davis viol
ated his Fourteenth Amend
ment right to equal protection
under the law.
Since the Davis quota sets
aside 16 out of 100 places for
approved minorities only,
Bakke says he was discrimi
nated against because he is
white.
In an interview with the
Daily, Colvin explained that
while the California Supreme
Court struck down the use of
quotas, "it did not say that af

firmative action is prohibited.
"It did not say that the uni
versity could not recruit minor
ity persons and attempt to lo
cate them and assist them in
their careers. It did not say the
university must admit people
solely on the basis of their
grade point averages of MCAT
(Medical College Aptitude
Test) scores.
"As a matter of fact the Sup
reme Court of California en
couraged the university to do
other things. For example, en
large its medical school
facilities so that more people
could be enrolled and admit
people based on the question
of their individual disadvan
tageness; their economic,
educational, or perhaps their
linguistic disadvantage and to
do that on the basis of looking
at the individual."
Colvin said using "disadvan
tageness" is constitutionally
sound and also "meets the
problems of the disadvantaged

where these problems exist
and that is at the individual
level."
He said that ethnic
background may be enough of
a clue to disadvantageness to
warrant further investigation,
but it should not be the decid
ing factor.
Colvin said he believes that
Davis, if not other schools,
have become "quota happy."
He said they have refused to
accept the recommendations
of the California Supreme
Court and Colvin believes "the
burden is essentially upon the
university."
"The university, without try
ing a single one (of these re
commendations), has thrown
its hands up in the air and said,
'None of this is feasible. We're
not going to try anything. Ifyou
insist on this, the school will be
all white.' "
Colvin disagreed that the
problems imposed on admis
sions officers will be insur

mountable. After all, he said,
Davis has only 100 places to be
concerned about.
Answering arguments that
university admissions should
be left to universities, Colvin
cited a case where the U.S.
Supreme Court felt compelled
to step in because a black
applicant had been denied
admission to the University of
Texas Law School solely be
cause of his race.
"The answer (to this criti
cism) is that academic insular
ity stops where constitutional
rights are violated," he said.
Colvin said the use of quotas
in university admissions causes
many legal problems. In his
brief to the U.S. Supreme
Court, Colvin said he cited the
case of University of California
law school deciding how to di
vide a minority quota among
each group.
Colvin related, "So the
minority people held a caucus,

and the blacks said, 'We will
divide it according to the per
centage of blacks in the United
States.' And the Spanish sur
name people said, 'No, the
correct percentage is based on
the proportions of each group
in the population of the state of
California.'
"And the orientals said, 'No,
the law school is a Bay Area in
stitution, therefore we will
consider our percentage on
the basis of the number of
orientals who live in the Bay
Area.' "
Colvin said he disagrees with
the assumption implicit in the
case that "rights exist in terms
of proportions in popula
tions." Moreover, he said, the
definition of a minority is far
from clear.
"What does one have to
have to qualify to be in this
quota: one parent, one grand
parent, one great-grandparent,

one great-great-grandparent (of
the approved minority)?" he
asked.
"And what are you going to
do with the question of religi
ous discrimination . . . Don't
be misled by the idea that
you're only dealing with one or
two minorities. There are lots
of minorities in this country,"
he added.
Responding to criticism that
minority enrollment will drop
if the California Supreme
Court's decision is upheld,
Colvin said "one of the things
you better consider is taking
the California Supreme Court
at its word and considering
disadvantage as a basis for ad
mitting people.
"If that does increase the
number of minority people, so
be it. But it will increase the
number based on the justifica
tion of their disadvantage in
social and not the color of their
skin or the sound of their last
name or the question of where

their ancestors were born."
Colvin also pointed out what
he called some "problems of
terminology" that have re
sulted from the case. He said
that he has been careful to
make the distinction between
quotas and affirmative action.
Affirmative action retains
"the concepts of individual
competition and opportunity,"
Colvin asserted. "Under
quotas people are judged on
the basis of their ancestry
alone."
There is also an important
distinction between goals and
quotas, Colvin added. A goal
means that a minimum stan
dard has been set for admittees
and only then are persons
sought to fill the number of
places designated as the goal.
At Davis, however, he said,
the number of places they
would definitely fill was fixed
first and then standards were
stretched until the quota was
filled.
Colvin, who has been with

the case from the beginning,
said that he never intended it
to be a "test case."
He said "the purpose of this
litigation is to enable Allan
Bakke to enter medical
school. . . . Immediately after
we filed the lawsuit, I said to
the attorneys for the univer
sity, 'For Heaven's sake, there
is a rule of the universe and
that is that there is always room
for one more. All you have to
do is admit Allan Bakke and the
case will be over.'
"The purpose of the case
was to get Allan Bakke into the
medical school. That was one
of the reasons we filed suit in
Woodland in Yolo County. . . .
We hoped we would find a
local judge who would admit
Allan to medical school pend
ing whatever litigation there
would be, in thefirm belief that
if that would happen, nothing
would dislodge him from the
school and as a practical matter
that was the way in which to
serve this client."

and the blacks said, 'We will
divide it according to the per
centage of blacks in the United
States.' And the Spanish sur
name people said, 'No, the
correct percentage is based on
the proportions of each group
in the population of the state of
California.'
"And the orientals said, 'No,
the law school is a Bay Area in
stitution, therefore we will
consider our percentage on
the basis of the number of
orientals who live in the Bay
Area.' "
Colvin said he disagrees with
the assumption implicit in the
case that "rights exist in terms
of proportions in popula
tions." Moreover, he said, the
definition of a minority is far
from clear.
"What does one have to
have to qualify to be in this
quota: one parent, one grand
parent, one great-grandparent,

one great-great-grandparent (of
the approved minority)?" he
asked.
"And what are you going to
do with the question of religi
ous discrimination . . . Don't
be misled by the idea that
you're only dealing with one or
two minorities. There are lots
of minorities in this country,"
he added.
Responding to criticism that
minority enrollment will drop
if the California Supreme
Court's decision is upheld,
Colvin said "one of the things
you better consider is taking
the California Supreme Court
at its word and considering
disadvantage as a basis for ad
mitting people.
"If that does increase the
number of minority people, so
be it. But it will increase the
number based on the justifica
tion of their disadvantage in
social and not the color of their
skin or the sound of their last
name or the question of where

their ancestors were born."
Colvin also pointed out what
he called some "problems of
terminology" that have re
sulted from the case. He said
that he has been careful to
make the distinction between
quotas and affirmative action.
Affirmative action retains
"the concepts of individual
competition and opportunity,"
Colvin asserted. "Under
quotas people are judged on
the basis of their ancestry
alone."
There is also an important
distinction between goals and
quotas, Colvin added. A goal
means that a minimum stan
dard has been set for admittees
and only then are persons
sought to fill the number of
places designated as the goal.
At Davis, however, he said,
the number of places they
would definitely fill was fixed
first and then standards were
stretched until the quota was
filled.
Colvin, who has been with

the case from the beginning,
said that he never intended it
to be a "test case."
He said "the purpose of this
litigation is to enable Allan
Bakke to enter medical
school. . . . Immediately after
we filed the lawsuit, I said to
the attorneys for the univer
sity, 'For Heaven's sake, there
is a rule of the universe and
that is that there is always room
for one more. All you have to
do is admit Allan Bakke and the
case will be over.'
"The purpose of the case
was to get Allan Bakke into the
medical school. That was one
of the reasons we filed suit in
Woodland in Yolo County. . . .
We hoped we would find a
local judge who would admit
Allan to medical school pend
ing whatever litigation there
would be, in thefirm belief that
if that would happen, nothing
would dislodge him from the
school and as a practical matter
that was the way in which to
serve this client."
The decision of the Califor
nia Supreme Court in the
Bakke case does not prohibit
affirmative action in university
admissions processes, accord
ing to Reynold Colvin, counsel
for Allan Bakke.
Allan Bakke, a white, was
denied admission to the UC-
Davis Medical School. In a suit
filed after his second rejection
by that school, Bakke contends
that a quota system for admit
ting minorities at Davis viol
ated his Fourteenth Amend
ment right to equal protection
under the law.
Since the Davis quota sets
aside 16 out of 100 places for
approved minorities only,
Bakke says he was discrimi
nated against because he is
white.
In an interview with the
Daily, Colvin explained that
while the California Supreme
Court struck down the use of
quotas, "it did not say that af

firmative action is prohibited.
"It did not say that the uni
versity could not recruit minor
ity persons and attempt to lo
cate them and assist them in
their careers. It did not say the
university must admit people
solely on the basis of their
grade point averages of MCAT
(Medical College Aptitude
Test) scores.
"As a matter of fact the Sup
reme Court of California en
couraged the university to do
other things. For example, en
large its medical school
facilities so that more people
could be enrolled and admit
people based on the question
of their individual disadvan
tageness; their economic,
educational, or perhaps their
linguistic disadvantage and to
do that on the basis of looking
at the individual."
Colvin said using "disadvan
tageness" is constitutionally
sound and also "meets the
problems of the disadvantaged

where these problems exist
and that is at the individual
level."
He said that ethnic
background may be enough of
a clue to disadvantageness to
warrant further investigation,
but it should not be the decid
ing factor.
Colvin said he believes that
Davis, if not other schools,
have become "quota happy."
He said they have refused to
accept the recommendations
of the California Supreme
Court and Colvin believes "the
burden is essentially upon the
university."
"The university, without try
ing a single one (of these re
commendations), has thrown
its hands up in the air and said,
'None of this is feasible. We're
not going to try anything. Ifyou
insist on this, the school will be
all white.' "
Colvin disagreed that the
problems imposed on admis
sions officers will be insur

mountable. After all, he said,
Davis has only 100 places to be
concerned about.
Answering arguments that
university admissions should
be left to universities, Colvin
cited a case where the U.S.
Supreme Court felt compelled
to step in because a black
applicant had been denied
admission to the University of
Texas Law School solely be
cause of his race.
"The answer (to this criti
cism) is that academic insular
ity stops where constitutional
rights are violated," he said.
Colvin said the use of quotas
in university admissions causes
many legal problems. In his
brief to the U.S. Supreme

ing whatever litigation there
would be, in thefirm belief that
if that would happen, nothing
would dislodge him from the
school and as a practical matter
that was the way in which to
serve this client."
The decision of the Califor
nia Supreme Court in the
Bakke case does not prohibit
affirmative action in university
admissions processes, accord
ing to Reynold Colvin, counsel
for Allan Bakke.
Allan Bakke, a white, was
denied admission to the UC-
Davis Medical School. In a suit
filed after his second rejection
by that school, Bakke contends
that a quota system for admit
ting minorities at Davis viol
ated his Fourteenth Amend
ment right to equal protection
under the law.
Since the Davis quota sets
aside 16 out of 100 places for
approved minorities only,
Bakke says he was discrimi
nated against because he is
white.
In an interview with the
Daily, Colvin explained that
while the California Supreme
Court struck down the use of
quotas, "it did not say that af

firmative action is prohibited.
"It did not say that the uni
versity could not recruit minor
ity persons and attempt to lo
cate them and assist them in
their careers. It did not say the
university must admit people
solely on the basis of their
grade point averages of MCAT
(Medical College Aptitude
Test) scores.
"As a matter of fact the Sup
reme Court of California en
couraged the university to do
other things. For example, en
large its medical school
facilities so that more people
could be enrolled and admit
people based on the question
of their individual disadvan
tageness; their economic,
educational, or perhaps their
linguistic disadvantage and to
do that on the basis of looking
at the individual."
Colvin said using "disadvan
tageness" is constitutionally
sound and also "meets the
problems of the disadvantaged

where these problems exist
and that is at the individual
level."
He said that ethnic
background may be enough of
a clue to disadvantageness to
warrant further investigation,
but it should not be the decid
ing factor.
Colvin said he believes that
Davis, if not other schools,
have become "quota happy."
He said they have refused to
accept the recommendations
of the California Supreme
Court and Colvin believes "the
burden is essentially upon the
university."
"The university, without try
ing a single one (of these re
commendations), has thrown
its hands up in the air and said,
'None of this is feasible. We're
not going to try anything. Ifyou
insist on this, the school will be
all white.' "
Colvin disagreed that the
problems imposed on admis
sions officers will be insur

mountable. After all, he said,
Davis has only 100 places to be
concerned about.
Answering arguments that
university admissions should
be left to universities, Colvin
cited a case where the U.S.
Supreme Court felt compelled
to step in because a black
applicant had been denied
admission to the University of
Texas Law School solely be
cause of his race.
"The answer (to this criti
cism) is that academic insular
ity stops where constitutional
rights are violated," he said.
Colvin said the use of quotas
in university admissions causes
many legal problems. In his
brief to the U.S. Supreme
Court, Colvin said he cited the
case of University of California
law school deciding how to di
vide a minority quota among
each group.
Colvin related, "So the
minority people held a caucus,
/ nl_ A A 1 v

and the blacks said, 'We will
divide it according to the per
centage of blacks in the United
States.' And the Spanish sur
name people said, 'No, the
correct percentage is based on
the proportions of each group
in the population of the state of
California.'
"And the orientals said, 'No,
the law school is a Bay Area in
stitution, therefore we will
consider our percentage on
the basis of the number of
orientals who live in the Bay
Area.' "
Colvin said he disagrees with
the assumption implicit in the
case that "rights exist in terms
of proportions in popula
tions." Moreover, he said, the
definition of a minority is far
from clear.
"What does one have to
have to qualify to be in this
quota: one parent, one grand
parent, one great-grandparent,

one great-great-grandparent (of
the approved minority)?" he
asked.
"And what are you going to
do with the question of religi
ous discrimination . . . Don't
be misled by the idea that
you're only dealing with one or
two minorities. There are lots
of minorities in this country,"
he added.
Responding to criticism that
minority enrollment will drop
if the California Supreme
Court's decision is upheld,
Colvin said "one of the things
you better consider is taking
the California Supreme Court
at its word and considering
disadvantage as a basis for ad
mitting people.
"If that does increase the
number of minority people, so
be it. But it will increase the
number based on the justifica
tion of their disadvantage in
social and not the color of their
skin or the sound of their last
name or the question of where

their ancestors were born."
Colvin also pointed out what
he called some "problems of
terminology" that have re
sulted from the case. He said
that he has been careful to
make the distinction between
quotas and affirmative action.
Affirmative action retains
"the concepts of individual
competition and opportunity,"
Colvin asserted. "Under
quotas people are judged on
the basis of their ancestry
alone."
There is also an important
distinction between goals and
quotas, Colvin added. A goal
means that a minimum stan
dard has been set for admittees
and only then are persons
sought to fill the number of
places designated as the goal.
At Davis, however, he said,
the number of places they
would definitely fill was fixed
first and then standards were
stretched until the quota was
filled.
Colvin, who has been with

the case from the beginning,
said that he never intended it
to be a "test case."
He said "the purpose of this
litigation is to enable Allan
Bakke to enter medical
school. . . . Immediately after
we filed the lawsuit, I said to
the attorneys for the univer
sity, 'For Heaven's sake, there
is a rule of the universe and
that is that there is always room
for one more. All you have to
do is admit Allan Bakke and the
case will be over.'
"The purpose of the case
was to get Allan Bakke into the
medical school. That was one
of the reasons we filed suit in
Woodland in Yolo County. . . .
We hoped we would find a
local judge who would admit
Allan to medical school pend

would be, in thefirm belief that

case of University of California
law school deciding how to di
vide a minority quota among
each group.
Colvin related, "So the
minority people held a caucus,

and the blacks said, 'We will
divide it according to the per
centage of blacks in the United
States.' And the Spanish sur
name people said, 'No, the
correct percentage is based on
the proportions of each group
in the population of the state of
California.'
"And the orientals said, 'No,
the law school is a Bay Area in
stitution, therefore we will
consider our percentage on
the basis of the number of
orientals who live in the Bay
Area.' "
Colvin said he disagrees with
the assumption implicit in the
case that "rights exist in terms
of proportions in popula
tions." Moreover, he said, the
definition of a minority is far
from clear.
"What does one have to
have to qualify to be in this
quota: one parent, one grand
parent, one great-grandparent,

one great-great-grandparent (of
the approved minority)?" he
asked.
"And what are you going to
do with the question of religi
ous discrimination . . . Don't
be misled by the idea that
you're only dealing with one or
two minorities. There are lots
of minorities in this country,"
he added.
Responding to criticism that
minority enrollment will drop
if the California Supreme
Court's decision is upheld,
Colvin said "one of the things
you better consider is taking
the California Supreme Court
at its word and considering
disadvantage as a basis for ad
mitting people.
"If that does increase the
number of minority people, so
be it. But it will increase the
number based on the justifica
tion of their disadvantage in
social and not the color of their
skin or the sound of their last
name or the question of where

their ancestors were born."
Colvin also pointed out what
he called some "problems of
terminology" that have re
sulted from the case. He said
that he has been careful to
make the distinction between
quotas and affirmative action.
Affirmative action retains
"the concepts of individual
competition and opportunity,"
Colvin asserted. "Under
quotas people are judged on
the basis of their ancestry
alone."
There is also an important
distinction between goals and
quotas, Colvin added. A goal
means that a minimum stan
dard has been set for admittees
and only then are persons
sought to fill the number of
places designated as the goal.
At Davis, however, he said,
the number of places they
would definitely fill was fixed
first and then standards were
stretched until the quota was
filled.
Colvin, who has been with

the case from the beginning,
said that he never intended it
to be a "test case."
He said "the purpose of this
litigation is to enable Allan
Bakke to enter medical
school. . . . Immediately after
we filed the lawsuit, I said to
the attorneys for the univer
sity, 'For Heaven's sake, there
is a rule of the universe and
that is that there is always room
for one more. All you have to
do is admit Allan Bakke and the
case will be over.'
"The purpose of the case
was to get Allan Bakke into the
medical school. That was one
of the reasons we filed suit in
Woodland in Yolo County. . . .
We hoped we would find a
local judge who would admit
Allan to medical school pend
ing whatever litigation there
would be, in thefirm belief that
if that would happen, nothing
would dislodge him from the
school and as a practical matter
that was the way in which to
serve this client."
