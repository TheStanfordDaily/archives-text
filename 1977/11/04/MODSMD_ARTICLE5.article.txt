# Bakke lawyer: no threat to minorities
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The decision of the Califor
nia Supreme Court in the
Bakke case does not prohibit
affirmative action in university
admissions processes, accord
ing to Reynold Colvin, counsel
for Allan Bakke.
Allan Bakke, a white, was
denied admission to the UC-
Davis Medical School. In a suit
filed after his second rejection
by that school, Bakke contends
that a quota system for admit
ting minorities at Davis viol
ated his Fourteenth Amend
ment right to equal protection
under the law.
Since the Davis quota sets
aside 16 out of 100 places for
approved minorities only,
Bakke says he was discrimi
nated against because he is
white.
In an interview with the
Daily, Colvin explained that
while the California Supreme
Court struck down the use of
quotas, "it did not say that af

firmative action is prohibited.
"It did not say that the uni
versity could not recruit minor
ity persons and attempt to lo
cate them and assist them in
their careers. It did not say the
university must admit people
solely on the basis of their
grade point averages of MCAT
(Medical College Aptitude
Test) scores.
"As a matter of fact the Sup
reme Court of California en
couraged the university to do
other things. For example, en
large its medical school
facilities so that more people
could be enrolled and admit
people based on the question
of their individual disadvan
tageness; their economic,
educational, or perhaps their
linguistic disadvantage and to
do that on the basis of looking
at the individual."
Colvin said using "disadvan
tageness" is constitutionally
sound and also "meets the
problems of the disadvantaged

where these problems exist
and that is at the individual
level."
He said that ethnic
background may be enough of
a clue to disadvantageness to
warrant further investigation,
but it should not be the decid
ing factor.
Colvin said he believes that
Davis, if not other schools,
have become "quota happy."
He said they have refused to
accept the recommendations
of the California Supreme
Court and Colvin believes "the
burden is essentially upon the
university."
"The university, without try
ing a single one (of these re
commendations), has thrown
its hands up in the air and said,
'None of this is feasible. We're
not going to try anything. Ifyou
insist on this, the school will be
all white.' "
Colvin disagreed that the
problems imposed on admis
sions officers will be insur

mountable. After all, he said,
Davis has only 100 places to be
concerned about.
Answering arguments that
university admissions should
be left to universities, Colvin
cited a case where the U.S.
Supreme Court felt compelled
to step in because a black
applicant had been denied
admission to the University of
Texas Law School solely be
cause of his race.
"The answer (to this criti
cism) is that academic insular
ity stops where constitutional
rights are violated," he said.
Colvin said the use of quotas
in university admissions causes
many legal problems. In his
brief to the U.S. Supreme
Court, Colvin said he cited the
case of University of California
law school deciding how to di
vide a minority quota among
each group.
Colvin related, "So the
minority people held a caucus,
