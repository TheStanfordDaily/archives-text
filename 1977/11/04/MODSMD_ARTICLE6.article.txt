## Perceiving 'the web' The 						curse of technology 
### 
Allan Chen

If contemporary society can be de
scribed in one word, that word
would probably be "technological."
Past ages have been ages of gold,
darkness, rebirth and reason, but
past ages did not have the blessing
and curse of high technology. Both
blessings and curses, the direct con
sequences of technology, have been
debated an uncountable number of
times, and doubtless they will be in
the future.
Rarely, if ever, do we think about
the subtle, indirect effects of our
technological worldview of ourse
lves. The reductionist philosophy
most overt in scientists and en
gineers is latent in all of us; it is this
latency that we would do well to be
wary of.
Governments which try to solve
specific social problems through
separate, piecemeal efforts are
guilty of lack of foresight from
technological reductionism. They
seek to divide and conquer social
problems by instituting shoddy,
poorly thought out reforms. Uncon
nected, conflicting federal programs
and policies proliferate like dandil
ions, and are about as useful too.
Business, labor, the academic
community and thousands of other
groups seek to promote their own
welfare. But the battle seems uphill
to everyone, including the more
powerful, richer groups, because the
overwhelming majority of these in
terest groups see themselves as mar
tyrs fighting for their own just cause
in an unjust world. We fail to realize
that life does not work that way, that
we are guilty of oversimplifying and
reducing our worldview.
We are all enmeshed in an intricate
web of individuals and collectives,
ideas and events, and conditions and
constraints. Ironically, it is in some of
the science courses themselves that
we learn of this other, non
reductionist worldview. The first
abstraction that sparkles through the
murk of our mind's eye in geology
and biology courses is the nature of
the web; earth systems and living

systems change in ways that depend
on all parts of the system, not just a
localized area. To generalize, the
non-living and living worlds them
selves are part of a larger system
which includes the human subsys
tem and ultimately, the system of the
physical universe.
Why does this abstruse notion of
reality have anything to do with the
"real world?" Simply this: there is no
real world. There is only a collection
of segments which we can't perceive
all at once but which we know are
there. And why should this be of any
use to us? Any decision that we as
individuals or as a collective group
(i.e. the Stanford community) may
make is bound to have indirect,
perhaps counterintuitive effects that
we should be aware of.
For example, would divestiture of
Stanford's investment in South Africa
be worth it? The monetary impact
would be small and not worth the
trouble. The mental impact would be
vast; it might even have a nation
wide effect on others' thinking. It
would certainly raise consciousness
everywhere. But these are direct ef
fects.
Divestiture would also have a chil
ling effect on support from "estab
lishment" sources such as business
and alumni. It might compromise the
quality of education here, and clamp
down intellectual freedom. Of
course if Stanford is indeed a training
ground for the future powerholders
of big business, the military and the
government, perhaps it would be a
good thing to throw a wrench into
the works.
Then, too, in our university-wide
efforts to be socially responsible, we
might find other doors closed to us
by vengeful powers-that-be. Are we
willing to face the longer term con
sequences of our short-term, im
mediate, highly moralistic concern
with the present?
The investment responsibility
question has ramifications that are
far deeper than the explicit moral

questions. This is true of everything,
with no exception.
A long term geothermal energy
program might raise the heat content
of the atmosphere to unacceptable
levels in centuries. The desire to reg
ulate certain kinds of "unsafe" scien
tific research might strengthen the
hold of regulatory interests over
other segments of society. The ac
quisition of heavy industry by a de
veloping nation might improve its
economy; it might also decrease en
vironmental quality, increase the
crime rate and decrease the quality
of services such as education, hous
ing and health care.
In our hasty run for civilization, we
may destroy the very qualities of the
state of human being that are implicit
components of the web, and that
gave us the ability to become
civilized.
And all this from our preoccupa
tion with the Now, our love affair
with technology, our unbalanced
dependence on reductionism and
reason, on divide and conquer. So
cial probelms can be solved, but only
if we temper reductionist perception
and reason with a perception of the
web and of the indirect consequ
ences of our actions.

"real world?" Simply this: there is no
real world. There is only a collection
of segments which we can't perceive
all at once but which we know are
there. And why should this be of any
use to us? Any decision that we as
individuals or as a collective group
(i.e. the Stanford community) may
make is bound to have indirect,
perhaps counterintuitive effects that
we should be aware of.
For example, would divestiture of
Stanford's investment in South Africa
be worth it? The monetary impact
would be small and not worth the
trouble. The mental impact would be
vast; it might even have a nation
wide effect on others' thinking. It
would certainly raise consciousness
everywhere. But these are direct ef
fects.
Divestiture would also have a chil
ling effect on support from "estab
lishment" sources such as business
and alumni. It might compromise the
quality of education here, and clamp
down intellectual freedom. Of
course if Stanford is indeed a training
ground for the future powerholders
of big business, the military and the
government, perhaps it would be a
good thing to throw a wrench into
the works.
Then, too, in our university-wide
efforts to be socially responsible, we
might find other doors closed to us
by vengeful powers-that-be. Are we
willing to face the longer term con
sequences of our short-term, im
mediate, highly moralistic concern
with the present?
The investment responsibility
question has ramifications that are
far deeper than the explicit moral

questions. This is true of everything,
with no exception.
A long term geothermal energy
program might raise the heat content
of the atmosphere to unacceptable
levels in centuries. The desire to reg
ulate certain kinds of "unsafe" scien
tific research might strengthen the
hold of regulatory interests over
other segments of society. The ac
quisition of heavy industry by a de
veloping nation might improve its
economy; it might also decrease en
vironmental quality, increase the
crime rate and decrease the quality
of services such as education, hous
ing and health care.
In our hasty run for civilization, we
may destroy the very qualities of the
state of human being that are implicit
components of the web, and that
gave us the ability to become
civilized.
And all this from our preoccupa
tion with the Now, our love affair
with technology, our unbalanced
dependence on reductionism and
reason, on divide and conquer. So
cial probelms can be solved, but only
if we temper reductionist perception
and reason with a perception of the
web and of the indirect consequ
ences of our actions.

If contemporary society can be de
scribed in one word, that word
would probably be "technological."
Past ages have been ages of gold,
darkness, rebirth and reason, but
past ages did not have the blessing
and curse of high technology. Both
blessings and curses, the direct con
sequences of technology, have been
debated an uncountable number of
times, and doubtless they will be in
the future.
Rarely, if ever, do we think about
the subtle, indirect effects of our
technological worldview of ourse
lves. The reductionist philosophy
most overt in scientists and en
gineers is latent in all of us; it is this
latency that we would do well to be
wary of.
Governments which try to solve
specific social problems through
separate, piecemeal efforts are
guilty of lack of foresight from
technological reductionism. They
seek to divide and conquer social
problems by instituting shoddy,
poorly thought out reforms. Uncon
nected, conflicting federal programs
and policies proliferate like dandil
ions, and are about as useful too.
Business, labor, the academic
community and thousands of other
groups seek to promote their own
welfare. But the battle seems uphill
to everyone, including the more
powerful, richer groups, because the
overwhelming majority of these in
terest groups see themselves as mar
tyrs fighting for their own just cause
in an unjust world. We fail to realize
that life does not work that way, that
we are guilty of oversimplifying and
reducing our worldview.
We are all enmeshed in an intricate
web of individuals and collectives,
ideas and events, and conditions and
constraints. Ironically, it is in some of
the science courses themselves that
we learn of this other, non
reductionist worldview. The first
abstraction that sparkles through the
murk of our mind's eye in geology
and biology courses is the nature of
the web; earth systems and living

systems change in ways that depend
on all parts of the system, not just a
localized area. To generalize, the
non-living and living worlds them
selves are part of a larger system
which includes the human subsys
tem and ultimately, the system of the
physical universe.

If contemporary society can be de
scribed in one word, that word
would probably be "technological."
Past ages have been ages of gold,
darkness, rebirth and reason, but
past ages did not have the blessing
and curse of high technology. Both
blessings and curses, the direct con
sequences of technology, have been
debated an uncountable number of
times, and doubtless they will be in
the future.
Rarely, if ever, do we think about
the subtle, indirect effects of our
technological worldview of ourse
lves. The reductionist philosophy
most overt in scientists and en
gineers is latent in all of us; it is this
latency that we would do well to be
wary of.
Governments which try to solve
specific social problems through
separate, piecemeal efforts are
guilty of lack of foresight from
technological reductionism. They
seek to divide and conquer social
problems by instituting shoddy,
poorly thought out reforms. Uncon
nected, conflicting federal programs
and policies proliferate like dandil
ions, and are about as useful too.
Business, labor, the academic
community and thousands of other
groups seek to promote their own
welfare. But the battle seems uphill
to everyone, including the more
powerful, richer groups, because the
overwhelming majority of these in
terest groups see themselves as mar
tyrs fighting for their own just cause
in an unjust world. We fail to realize
that life does not work that way, that
we are guilty of oversimplifying and
reducing our worldview.
We are all enmeshed in an intricate
web of individuals and collectives,
ideas and events, and conditions and
constraints. Ironically, it is in some of
the science courses themselves that
we learn of this other, non
reductionist worldview. The first
abstraction that sparkles through the
murk of our mind's eye in geology
and biology courses is the nature of
the web; earth systems and living

systems change in ways that depend
on all parts of the system, not just a
localized area. To generalize, the
non-living and living worlds them
selves are part of a larger system
which includes the human subsys
tem and ultimately, the system of the
physical universe.
Why does this abstruse notion of
reality have anything to do with the
"real world?" Simply this: there is no
real world. There is only a collection
of segments which we can't perceive
all at once but which we know are
there. And why should this be of any
use to us? Any decision that we as
individuals or as a collective group
(i.e. the Stanford community) may
make is bound to have indirect,
perhaps counterintuitive effects that
we should be aware of.
For example, would divestiture of
Stanford's investment in South Africa
be worth it? The monetary impact
would be small and not worth the
trouble. The mental impact would be
vast; it might even have a nation
wide effect on others' thinking. It
would certainly raise consciousness
everywhere. But these are direct ef
fects.
Divestiture would also have a chil
ling effect on support from "estab
lishment" sources such as business
and alumni. It might compromise the
quality of education here, and clamp
down intellectual freedom. Of
course if Stanford is indeed a training
ground for the future powerholders
of big business, the military and the
government, perhaps it would be a
good thing to throw a wrench into
the works.
Then, too, in our university-wide
efforts to be socially responsible, we
might find other doors closed to us
by vengeful powers-that-be. Are we
willing to face the longer term con
sequences of our short-term, im
mediate, highly moralistic concern
with the present?
The investment responsibility
question has ramifications that are
far deeper than the explicit moral

questions. This is true of everything,
with no exception.
A long term geothermal energy
program might raise the heat content
of the atmosphere to unacceptable
levels in centuries. The desire to reg
ulate certain kinds of "unsafe" scien
tific research might strengthen the
hold of regulatory interests over
other segments of society. The ac
quisition of heavy industry by a de
veloping nation might improve its
economy; it might also decrease en
vironmental quality, increase the
crime rate and decrease the quality
of services such as education, hous
ing and health care.
In our hasty run for civilization, we
may destroy the very qualities of the
state of human being that are implicit
components of the web, and that
gave us the ability to become
civilized.
And all this from our preoccupa
tion with the Now, our love affair
with technology, our unbalanced
dependence on reductionism and
reason, on divide and conquer. So
cial probelms can be solved, but only
if we temper reductionist perception
and reason with a perception of the
web and of the indirect consequ
ences of our actions.
