# South Africa from the inside

I spent the last academic year lec
turing in France. I was not entirely
deprived of press reports about Stan
ford. As editor of the World Affairs
Report I read the Soviet press as
siduously, and our beloved univer
sity had the rare distinction of mak
ing it twice.
The first story was that Angela
Davis,after lecturingat Stanford, had
gone to Paris to make a film showing
how horribly the blacks are treated in
the United States.
The second was that 300 peaceful
demonstrators had occupied the Old
Union whence, on orders from the
ruthless administration, they were
evicted by the police.
The two stories were not uncon
nected. Angela Davis is a member of
the Central Committee of the Com
munist part of the United States,
which, unlike some European
Communist parties, follows the
Kremlin line slavishly.
Kremlin aims
Among the aims of the Kremlin it is
relevant to note: an untiring plan to
promote confrontation between the
West and blacks wherever possible
and to sabotage peaceful solutions in
Rhodesia and South Africa, as it did
in Angola and Mozambique; to inter
rupt Western communications
routes around Africa; to deprive the
West as far as possible of vital raw
materials such as those we receive
from South Africa; to undermine in
every possible way in the Third
World those very U.S. corporations
with which Moscow seeks to prom
ote business.
This does not mean that the Stan
ford demonstrators were a bunch of
Commies. Most of them are hostile
to Moscow, and more would be
sympathetic to Peking. Yet they fol
low the Moscow line, not the Peking
line. When one reads the Soviet
press as carefully as I am obliged to,
one sees the Kremlin's aims and then
waits for the other shoe to drop:

trouble on our campuses.
Peking does not have in this coun
try a small disciplined machine as
Moscow does. At dinner recently I
found myself next to a mature activist
born in Eastern Europe who started
conversation with a blast at South Af
rica. It was the usual pattern; he was
pretty ignorant. Then he told me he
was a Marxist and an atheist, so I
asked him what he thought about
Amin, about whose atrocities his
Moscow friends never say a word. He
replied, Kremlin-style, that Amin was
a fine person; when I pressed him,
he finally said painfully: "I suppose
we should condemn both South Af
rica and Amin."
Our idealistic students are being
used. They are filled with one-sided
"information" contained in free "lit
erature"; as editor of a hard-pressed
journal, I wish I had the printing
funds available for these causes,
some worthwhile.
As a political independent who
studies issues carefully and then
makes up his own mind, I took ad
vantage of invitations from South Af
rican universities to lecture and in
the process to visit the country from
one end to the other. On the way
home I visited Rhodesia briefly and
then stopped off in black Africa.
Both Western and Soviet sources
had filled me with a strong dislike for
both the South African and Rhode
sian governments; I returned realiz
ing the issues are much more com
plex and that our picture of South
Africa is about as one-sided as the
Soviet picture of the United States.
For example, the debate about the
death of one man, Biko, would be
unthinkable in most countries of
black Africa.
I visited not only white, but also
black, colored and Indian com
munities. Most blacks live in shacks,
but there is also a lot of middle-class
housing, and the blacks in South Af
rica are far better off than those in

most of "liberated" Africa. The col
ored live better, and in the Indian
communities there are houses which
would look well in Atherton. Of
course this does not justify apar
theid.
We should give the South African
government credit for its efforts to
build up the educational facilities of
the non-white population. I visited
two black universities (the University
of the North and the University of
Zululand), the colored university
near Capetown, and the Indian uni
versity in Durban; the government
has spent enormous sums building
campuses comparable to our state
colleges.
Among both principal white
groups one finds a great variety of
opinion. The hard-line Boers have an
old-fashioned sense of responsibil
ity; they have indeed built a beauti
ful, well-organized country. I found
it very hard to talk to them, especially
when they speak Afrikaans, a lan
guage they alone know.
vorster is actually trying to ease
the apartheid policy he inherited.
People his age, however, abhor the
tendencies of younger Boers; one
young government official told me
multiracial Brazil offered a model for
South Africa. It was a surprise that
the keenest university audiences I
had were at the Afrikaans univer
sities. At the English-speaking uni
versities I found people frustrated
and confused.
At the University of Capetown
(which has some fine departments) I
sat in on a sociology seminar at which
long-haired youths drank wine and
stabbed.the air while they engaged in
verbalism. At Witwatersrand I asked
a young instructor who was very bit
ter about the regime what precisely
he proposed. He said he was going to
Berkeley and try to get a job in this
country.
Much as they dislike and resent the
Boers, the English-speakers realize
that they are in the same boat with
them. They are in general more prog
ressive, but they do not want to see
their country wrecked as Angola and
Mozambique have been; if our cam
pus demonstrators lived there, they
would have the same concern. I saw
many black refugees from Angola
and Mozambique both in South Af
rica (on their way to Brazil) and in
Lisbon â€” a pathetic sight. Hell is
paved with the good intentions of
idealists and the tricks of those who
use them.
Finally, I came away with the con
viction that the whole U.S. presence
in South Africa is a force for the
good. We are trying to use whatever
influence we have to transform the
society without wrecking it and pro
ducing untold misery. Those who
talk glibly about revolution have
usually never seen one. I have seen
several, and they are horrible. There
is a better way of solving problems.
