# Medical school eliminates student grouping system
## 
### Andrea James 
After more than 100 medical stu
dents protested the use of a group
ing system in this year's dean's letter,
the Office of Student Affairs at the
medical school has revised the final
paragraph of the letter, thus remov
ing the student classification.
The letters, used as recommenda
tions to hospitals for internship
placement, originally contained a
final paragraph that grouped
graduating students in the categories
of extraordinary, outstanding, very
good or good.
Dr. Ken Vosti, associate dean of
student affairs, said most of the let
ters were retrieved from the mail
room Wednesday night after more
than 100 students voted that the final
paragraph should not divide the stu
dents into comparative groups.
He added that those letters which
had already been mailed and were
irretrievable are now being accom
panied by amended letters.
New paragraph
The final paragraph of the dean's
letters now reads: "On the basis of
the above report of this student's
performance, we encourage you to
consider )ohn Doe for a house of
ficer position in your postgraduate
training program. It is important that
you appreciate that no attempt is
being made to suggest any overall
grouping or ranking of this year's
graduating students, since this con
cluding paragraph is the same on
each dean's letter."
"This amended paragraph is the
best solution to the problem under
the circumstances," said Rick Stead,
a third year medical student. "It is
not a model final paragraph; it
doesn't have any substance to it
whatsoever."
Stead said he thinks a final parag
raph of a dean's letter should sum
marize the student's strengths and
weaknesses and project the stu
dent's performance in the residency
program.
Big people
Vosti said about the decision to re
vise the paragraph, "I'm comfortable
in that they (students) feel comforta

ble. The fact that their medical
school didn't rank them upon gradu
ation could compromise their suc
cess in the medical programs they
select. But they're big people and
should be willing to take the respon
sibility for the outcome."
Vosti added, "I know if I were
selecting students for a residency
program I couldn't accept someone
who had never been evaluated by a
peer faculty. I'm certain some stu
dents won't do as well in selection
committees because the committee
won't know where the students
stand."
Dr. William Creger, who served as

associate dean for student affairs
from 1968 to 1976, said he believes
that wanting to rank the students is a
change in philosophy of the Office of
Student Affairs.
Violation
"I wrote a great majority of the let
ters in those nine years and I never
used a grading, ranking or adjectival
classification system in my letters,"
Creger said. "The change to include
some kind of covert or disguised
grouping system is a palpable viola
tion of the policies widely under
stood between the students and the
dean's office."

"I can understand how Vosti could
have changed the policy since he
hasn't been in direct contact with the
students. He just entered the office
in September and he's new to the
business. But there are others in the
office who are much more familiar
with the commitment to the stu
dents. Persons who have been in the
office for eight or 10 years should be
familiar with the process. I don't see
how the ranking of students into four
groups could have been conceived
and done without input from the
students." Creger said.
He added he hopes stude <ts and
the OSA will "come to an under
standing and agreement in principle
well before the dean's letter is writ
ten next year."

dents. Persons who have been in the
office for eight or 10 years should be
familiar with the process. I don't see
how the ranking of students into four
groups could have been conceived
and done without input from the
students." Creger said.
He added he hopes stude <ts and
the OSA will "come to an under
standing and agreement in principle
well before the dean's letter is writ
ten next year."
After more than 100 medical stu
dents protested the use of a group
ing system in this year's dean's letter,
the Office of Student Affairs at the
medical school has revised the final
paragraph of the letter, thus remov
ing the student classification.
The letters, used as recommenda
tions to hospitals for internship
placement, originally contained a
final paragraph that grouped
graduating students in the categories
of extraordinary, outstanding, very
good or good.
Dr. Ken Vosti, associate dean of
student affairs, said most of the let
ters were retrieved from the mail
room Wednesday night after more
than 100 students voted that the final
paragraph should not divide the stu
dents into comparative groups.
He added that those letters which
had already been mailed and were
irretrievable are now being accom
panied by amended letters.
New paragraph
The final paragraph of the dean's
letters now reads: "On the basis of
the above report of this student's
performance, we encourage you to
consider )ohn Doe for a house of
ficer position in your postgraduate
training program. It is important that
you appreciate that no attempt is
being made to suggest any overall
grouping or ranking of this year's
graduating students, since this con
cluding paragraph is the same on
each dean's letter."
"This amended paragraph is the
best solution to the problem under
the circumstances," said Rick Stead,
a third year medical student. "It is
not a model final paragraph; it
doesn't have any substance to it
whatsoever."
Stead said he thinks a final parag
raph of a dean's letter should sum
marize the student's strengths and
weaknesses and project the stu
dent's performance in the residency
program.
Big people
Vosti said about the decision to re
vise the paragraph, "I'm comfortable
in that they (students) feel comforta

ble. The fact that their medical
school didn't rank them upon gradu
ation could compromise their suc
cess in the medical programs they
select. But they're big people and
should be willing to take the respon
sibility for the outcome."
Vosti added, "I know if I were
selecting students for a residency
program I couldn't accept someone
who had never been evaluated by a
peer faculty. I'm certain some stu
dents won't do as well in selection
committees because the committee
won't know where the students
stand."
Dr. William Creger, who served as

associate dean for student affairs
from 1968 to 1976, said he believes
that wanting to rank the students is a
change in philosophy of the Office of
Student Affairs.
Violation
"I wrote a great majority of the let
ters in those nine years and I never
used a grading, ranking or adjectival
classification system in my letters,"
Creger said. "The change to include
some kind of covert or disguised
grouping system is a palpable viola
tion of the policies widely under
stood between the students and the
dean's office."

business. But there are others in the
office who are much more familiar
