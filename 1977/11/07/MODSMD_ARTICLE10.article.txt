# Feminism brings collectivity

Women's Week was five days
packed with workshops, lectures
and special events geared towards
making women and men in and
around Stanford more aware of is
sues crucial to the rise of women as
equal participators and contributors
in our society. Anything you wanted
to find out about related to women
and feminism was discussed: health
care, self-defense, farm-workers,

lesbian mothers, sexism in language,
women's sexuality, education and
careers, just to mention a few of the
topics taken up in the course of Wo
men's Week.
I attended as many workshops and
lectures as I could, yes, even to the
detriment of one of my courses. It
was well worth it. I emerged from the
hectic week with a new understand
ing of what feminism means. I felt
enthusiastic about devoting my time
and effort to seeing some of the
changes that feminism demands of
our society.
From Rita Mae Brown's call to
women to band together our energy,
time and money, to Margie Adams'
so"gs of women in love, in pain and
in anger, I grew to feel that I, we can
do something at Stanford. We have
the resources, the fine minds and
even the time when each of us
realizes how important it is to give it,
even a little bit.
And yet, many women I have
talked to did not, and often could not
take advantage of Women's Week.
Many more felt alienated by the term
feminism and its radical, anti-male,
even lesbian implications. There is
no right or wrong or absolute defini
tion of feminism.
To me feminism is a realization of
women's domination by men in all
spheres of societal interaction: the
family, the church, government and
the professional and labor forces.
We have been socialized — men to
view women, women to view them
selves — as weak (not just physically)
and passive. Our potentially positive
qualities of sensitivity receptivity are
used against us in relationships with
the stereotypical aggressive, acquisi
tive male.
Feminism in a woman's life is the
desire to overcome the socialization

of sex roles, and its consequences, in
her own life and that of women
around her. Each of us in this private
university already have the advan
tage of an opportunity to enter the
male-dominated world as an equal in
education and skills. It is easy to
forget that millions of women have
no such enlightened atmosphere in
which to live and work.
I speak to the whole community of
Stanford and its environs to try to see
feminism as a positive social change,
bringing qualities of temperance and
collectivity to a competitive, hierar
chical society. I encourage every
woman to look into all possibilities of
finding out more about feminism
and issues involving women in our
society today.
On campus we have Half the Sky, a
collective of various women's
groups, banding together to form a
cohesive vehicle for action and input
into social and political causes. The
organization is run by rotating re
sponsibilities, and decisions are ag
reed on by consensus. Every meeting
practices self-criticism and small
group interaction.
There is no fixed membership: if
you are a woman, you belong. The
Center for Research on Women, the
Women's Center, and the YWCA are
also valuable and active resources. A
newspaper for and by women is pre
sently being organized through Half
the Sky and the Women's Center.
We can no longer just sit back and
let others do the work of important
social change for us. With a little un
derstanding and energy, we can help
our sisters and brothers become
whole persons, both strong and sen
sitive, receptive and responsible.
