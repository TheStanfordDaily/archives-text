Daily's yellow journalism
I would like to comment on the Daily editorial,
"It's perfectly clear" (Nov. 1). I think the editorial
smacked of yellow journalism. That type of sen
sationalist appeal only served to heighten the ten
sion surrounding this issue and make the resolu
tion of the problem that much more difficult.
Specifically, I find the whole analogy to Water
gate and Nixon a bit melodramatic. I think it is time
for the Daily to stop fantasizing about being
Woodward and Bernstein and try to get their facts
straight. There has not been an attempt to cover
up the SOC slate's involvement in matters pertain
ing to the yellow leaflet. I think the fact that SOC
slate member Marvin Anderson brought forth the
motion calling for the creation of an Election Re
view Board at the second senate meeting as well as
the fact that its passage was not opposed by one
SOC member points this out.
One of the chief reasons that the ERB proposed
at the first meeting was opposed by not only SOC
members, but also their political opposites such as
Dan Livingston, was that it was not clearly spelled
out what the powers and responsibilities of that
board would be. The Daily even quoted me to that
effect. Anderson's proposal addressed those
questions quite explicitly and received over
whelming endorsement from the senate.
I would also like to say that the Daily editorial
was in line with their consistently negative attitude
toward the SOC slate from the beginning. The
Daily has chosen to ignore the issues put forth in
our campaign platform. I, as a SOC slate member,
am anxious to get on with those issues â€”"issues
such as working toward a more democratic Stan
ford and elimination of the racism, elitism and
sexism that pervade this institution. The Daily, I
suppose, deems these issues unimportant as evi
denced by their focus thus far. For example, the

Daily has not examined the fact that with the elec
tion of the SOC slate members, women and
minority representatives on the senate have in
creased from one last year to nine this year.
The SOC slate is looking forward to laying out
the facts concerning their campaign activities be
fore the constitutionally proper body it has set up
to review the election, and ultimately the entire
Stanford community. Only then will we be able to
leave all these ridiculous issues drummed up in
large part by the irresponsible journalistic prac
tices of the Daily behind. Only then will we be able
to focus on the real political issues the voters
elected us to deal with.

Photo oppressive
I have spent the day asking what people thought
of the picture printed on the front page of Wed
nesday's Daily (Nov. 1). The reaction was the same
from gay and straight people alike: that it was a
gross misrepresentation, exhibited with malicious
intent, and demonstrating repulsive taste on the
part of the Daily.
The portrait of gay people fostered around us is
not merely false. It is oppressive. A concept of gay
men as decadent and dirty pollutes the Stanford
mentality. We are not weird, tongue-panting
butches and dykes. We are the normal crop of
students with varied interests, living in the frater
naties, houses and dorms.
Over 95 per cent of gay undergraduates are un
able to come out. We are unable to examine ourse
lves, let alone our environment, because of the
threatening pictures we have been forced to iden
tify with. Since childhood we have been bom
barded by descriptions of gay life designed to

keep us from living honest lives. We cannot un
derstand why that picture was in the Daily, let
alone on the front page.
The photograph on the front page/s oppressive.
It is no different than pictures of Jews as greedy
bankers, or pictures of blacks as lazy butlers and
parlor maids. It is dangerous, antiquated, hardhat
mentality.

Angell Field
One of the most important forms of recreational
athletics on the Stanford campus is running, as
everyone who has traveled the campus in daylight
is aware. Angell Field, across Campus Drive from
Encina Gym, is the traditional center for campus
runners and is used every week by hundreds of
students, faculty, and staff.
Unfortunately, there has been no maintenance
of Angell Field for the past five years. The track is
falling into ruin from weeds and lack of grading,
and the infield is being destroyed by gophers. This
facility, on which national records have been set
and which was in excellent condition a few years
ago, is being lost by neglect. A few hours of
maintenance each month would be sufficient. If
the deterioration is permitted to continue, expen
sive reconstruction will be needed. Routine
maintenance is cheaper.
The Angell Field Ancients, a faculty-staff running
group of which I am part, has been alerting the
Department of Athletics since 1973 that Angell
Field needs help. I hope very much that remedial
steps will be taken before the damage is irrepara
ble.
