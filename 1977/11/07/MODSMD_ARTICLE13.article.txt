# Soviets unsure of Eurocommunism

Moscow (AP) â€” Soviet offi
cials seem unsure whether to
continue attacking indepen
dent-minded "Eurocom
munists" or to placate them in
hopes of maintaining Com
munist unity.
"I think the Russians just
don't know what to do," a
Western diplomat in Moscow
said.
Eurocommunism developed
in the past two years as Com
munist parties in France,
Spain, Italy and other West
European countries declared
independence from Moscow.
They questioned basic
tenets of Communist theory,

criticized the Russians for limit
ing human rights and pledged
to seek power through democ
ratic elections.
The Kremlin's response has
ranged from a bitter speech by
its chief ideologist, Mikhail
Suslov, to conciliatory appeals
in Soviet publications for
Communists to stay loyal to
each other.
The latest public squabble
over Eurocommunism sur
faced at a gala public meeting
here last week in honor of the
60th anniversary of the Bol
shevik revolution. The Soviets
invited delegates from more
than 25 foreign Communist

parties to speak.
Most speakers praised the
Soviets, but Eurocommunists
also seized the opportunity to
restate their views to Soviet
leaders. Italian Communist
leader Enrico Berlinguer de
clared there "can be no 'lead
ing' or 'led' parties" in the
world communist movement.
British Communist leader
Gordon McLennan said that if
socialism triumphed in Britain,
political parties favoring a re
turn to capitalism could still
exist.
The biggest conflict involved
Spanish Communist leader
Santiago Carrillo, who told re

porters he had been banned
from speaking after turning in a
copy of his speech, which he
said was no stronger than Ber
linguer's, for translation.
The incident suggested a
dispute within the Soviet lead
ership, because Viktor Afan
siev, sent to Spain as a special
Soviet envoy last month, had
reportedly told Carrillo that he
could address the meeting.
Soviet officials said yester
day that Carrillo's account
"distorts the true state of af
fairs." A rebuttal by the editor
of the Communist party daily
Pravda, carried by the news
agency Tass, said Carrillo ar
rived in Moscow too late to
speak at the public meeting,
was given an opportunity to
speak at other gatherings
marking the anniversary, but
declined it.
The Kremlin has given other
indications of disagreements
over how to handle Eurocom
munism.
Suslov, in a strongly-worded
speech in March 1976, called
Eurocommunists "oppor
tunists" and said their "reg
ional or national versions of
Marxism have nothing in
common with revolutionary
theory and do harm to the
cause of the working people."
Three months later Com
munist party boss Leonid
Brezhnev made conciliatory
remarks to a world Communist
conference, denying the
Soviets wanted to create an
"organizational center" to
police world Communist think
ing.
