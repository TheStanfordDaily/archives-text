# Russia calls for arms limit
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The
Soviet Union is prepared to
seek an agreement with the
United States drastically limit
ing the arms flow to the Middle
East after a peace settlement is
reached, according to Soviet
Ambassador Anatoly Dobry
nin.
Dobrynin also said the two
countries are close to a
strategic arms limitation ac
cord. "My guesswill be in a few
— I shall say by the end of this
year," he said.
However, Defense Secretary
Harold Brown took a more
cautious view about the pros
pects for an imminent agree
ment.
"I would say there are old
stumbling blocks not yet sur
mounted. It will take some

time to work those out,"
Brown said yesterday.
His comments came during
an interview on ABC televi
sion's "Issues and Answers."
Dobrynin made his remarks
in an interview taped for
broadcast today on NBC
television's "Today" show.
President Carter told the
U.N. General Assembly early
last month that a new arms ag
reement with the Soviets was
"within sight." However, the
president subsequently has
moderated his optimimsm.
Speaking of the Mideast,
Dobrynin said, "We're pre
pared to have agreement with
you that will drastically limit
our selling of arms or giving
arms to that area."
He added that a summit
meeting between the U.S. and

Soviet presidents might be
possible after settlement on a
new strategic arms limitation
pact.
"We consider that a summit
meeting is a very important
event in the relationship bet
ween two countries," he said.
"So it should be really a
crown to a certain kind of
achievement in order to give a
certain push for the further de
velopment of relations.
"So I think it will be quite
possible that if this agreement
is reached, that it will be really
crowned with a summit meet
ing. But we don't discuss it. I
have to make it clear. There
was no discussion between the
two governments of this possi
bility. Of course, first we have
an agreement. Then we could
discuss this," Dobrynin said.
