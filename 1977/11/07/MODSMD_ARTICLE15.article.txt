# Advocates 'disarmament for development'
## Palme raps arms race 
### David Holley 
The arms race and the widen
ing gap between rich and poor
nations are two trends which
are eroding humanity's pros
pects for a future of peace and
justice, said Olof Palme,
former prime minister of Swe
den, in a speech Thursday
night at Kresge Auditorium.
"The quantities" of weapons
in the world, said Palme, "are
increasing without any rational
motives. The qualities of the
weapons are improved all the
time, if one can use such a
word in this context. And fi
nally, the arms race seems to
have gotten out of the control
of the politicians."
"New weapons are pro
duced not because they are
needed," Palme declared,
"but because they are possi
ble. And if there is no strategy
for their use, a strategy is in
vented."
Referring to the neutron
bomb, Palme said, "To any or
dinary man it must seem
grotesque that a decision to
use a nuclear weapon is consi
dered easier to take because it
spares buildings and capital as
sets, although this might un
derpin the communist suspi

cion that capitalists are more
interested in preserving capital
than in saving lives.
"Nuclear weapons are the
weapons that pose the greatest
potential threat to mankind,"
Palme continued, "but all
those millions of human be
ings who have been killed after
the second world war have
been killed with ordinary
weapons. Nearly all of these
conflicts took place in poor
countries, but the weapons
used came from the rich coun
tries.
"That rich nations grow
richer while poor nations be
come poorer is intolerable
from the point of view of sol
idarity and justice," Palme
said. "But it is also intolerable
because of the danger that is
inherent in such a situation,"
he added.
"It is imperative to start a
process of disarmament for
development," Palme de
clared.
"The fundamental problem
is political," he said.
"One of the greatest obsta
cles" to disarmament, Palme
said, "is the widespread mis
conception that disarmament
will lead to widespread un

employment and a lower stan
dard of living."
This is not true, he said, cit
ing the Marshall Plan as an
example of a successful rede
ployment of resources. He also
pointed out that most workers
released from weapons indus
tries would be highly skilled
people who would be in de
mand in other sectors of the
economy.
"The instinctive reaction in
some quarters," to what he is
urging, Palme said, may be that
" 'All this talk of disarmament
is either naive, or worse, prop
aganda inspired by the enemy.
And if there are poor peoples
in the world, it's their own
fault. Why should we bother,
as long as we're the richest and
the strongest?'
"Such reactions are tragic,"
he declared, "but one can
never let them become obsta
cles to progress."
In an affirmation of hope,
Palme quoted )ohn Milton,
who wrote, "Peace, no less
than war, hath her victories."
Palme's speech was his sec
ond and final one as the first
recipient of the Jackson H.
Ralston Prize in International
Law. \

"The instinctive reaction in
some quarters," to what he is
urging, Palme said, may be that
" 'All this talk of disarmament
is either naive, or worse, prop
aganda inspired by the enemy.
And if there are poor peoples
in the world, it's their own
fault. Why should we bother,
as long as we're the richest and
the strongest?'
"Such reactions are tragic,"
he declared, "but one can
never let them become obsta
cles to progress."
In an affirmation of hope,
Palme quoted )ohn Milton,
who wrote, "Peace, no less
than war, hath her victories."
Palme's speech was his sec
ond and final one as the first
recipient of the Jackson H.
Ralston Prize in International
Law. \
The arms race and the widen
ing gap between rich and poor
nations are two trends which
are eroding humanity's pros
pects for a future of peace and
justice, said Olof Palme,
former prime minister of Swe
den, in a speech Thursday
night at Kresge Auditorium.
"The quantities" of weapons
in the world, said Palme, "are
increasing without any rational
motives. The qualities of the
weapons are improved all the
time, if one can use such a
word in this context. And fi
nally, the arms race seems to
have gotten out of the control
of the politicians."
"New weapons are pro
duced not because they are
needed," Palme declared,
"but because they are possi
ble. And if there is no strategy
for their use, a strategy is in
vented."
Referring to the neutron
bomb, Palme said, "To any or
dinary man it must seem
grotesque that a decision to
use a nuclear weapon is consi
dered easier to take because it
spares buildings and capital as
sets, although this might un
derpin the communist suspi

cion that capitalists are more
interested in preserving capital
than in saving lives.
"Nuclear weapons are the
weapons that pose the greatest
potential threat to mankind,"
Palme continued, "but all
those millions of human be
ings who have been killed after
the second world war have
been killed with ordinary
weapons. Nearly all of these
conflicts took place in poor
countries, but the weapons
used came from the rich coun
tries.
"That rich nations grow
richer while poor nations be
come poorer is intolerable
from the point of view of sol
idarity and justice," Palme
said. "But it is also intolerable
because of the danger that is
inherent in such a situation,"
he added.
"It is imperative to start a
process of disarmament for
development," Palme de
clared.
"The fundamental problem
is political," he said.
"One of the greatest obsta
cles" to disarmament, Palme
said, "is the widespread mis
conception that disarmament
will lead to widespread un

employment and a lower stan
dard of living."
This is not true, he said, cit
ing the Marshall Plan as an
example of a successful rede
ployment of resources. He also
pointed out that most workers
released from weapons indus
tries would be highly skilled
people who would be in de
mand in other sectors of the
economy.
