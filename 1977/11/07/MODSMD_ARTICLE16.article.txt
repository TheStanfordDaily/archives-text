# Mastermind fans vie for chance at nationals

It's true, master minds live at
Stanford.
Yesterday two "masters" of
Mastermind were selected to
represent Stanford in a play-off
with UC-Berkeley Nov. 19.
In an effort to make Master
mind a world-class brain game,
its manufacturer and the Tre
sidder Program Board spon
sored the first annual Stanford
Mastermind Championship at
Tresidder Large Lounge.
"It's possible that Master
mind could gain the status of
chess or backgammon. Mas
termind is being played in
other countries, too. As far as a
modern game invented in the
last hundred years, it's one of
the most brain-involving
games," said Scott Rutherford,
a participant and member of
the Tresidder Program Board.
The object of Mastermind is
to have a person figure out, in
the least number of moves, the
order and colors of four pegs
placed in an ordered "code"
by his opponent.
Codebreaking
The "codebreaker" has to fi
gure out which of 2401 possible
arrangements stands behind a
brown plastic wall on the foot

long, rectangular game board.
The "codemaker" gives him
clues by placing small black
and white markers on the ta
ble. Black markers mean the
codebreaker has placed a cor
rectly colored peg in its correct
space. A white marker means
the codebreaker has placed a
correctly colored peg in a
wrong place.
The winners of the three
hour tournament were
freshman Matthew Petitt with a
low score of 24 moves in five
games and first-year law stu
dent John Hackmann, who
won a play-off for the second
position.
Hackmann and sophomore
Jim Isaacs were both tied with
25 moves in five games. The
play-off required them to
break identical codes in the
fewest moves.
Psychology
"He's done it in four," cried
one spectator as Hackmann
beamed happily at the resolved
code — blue, black, no peg
and yellow.
Isaacs (about to make his
fourth move), was still bent in
tently over his board. He broke
the code on his fourth move
but disqualified himself from

the running because he said he
had picked up psychological
clues from the audience and
had changed his strategy at the
last moment.
"I had my fourth move all set
out, people looked at it and
simply walked away. I knew it
had to be wrong, so I changed
my strategy and guessed the
correct code," Isaacs
explained.
The tricks to figuring out
codes vary from player to
player.
"I play best against people I
know really well because I
know which colors they'll
pick," said participant Kelly
Corthell. She learned the game
from a friend who had gotten a
Mastermind game last Christ
mas.
'Pure skill'
"You really read the code in
your opponent's glasses,"
joked Isaacs. "It's a lot of intui
tion and in the long haul, it's
pure skill."
"It's a fairly simple game. I
mean, 2000 possible moves,
that's nothing compared to
chess or bridge which has 10 to
the 28th possible hands," said
participant Gary Jackoway.
"One reaches a plateau

rather quickly where a strategy
doesn't help. You've just got to
be able to avoid getting into a
situation where you have to
make a lot of guesses," said
Corthell.
Petitt and Hackmann will
challenge the Cal champs at
Macy's in San Francisco. The
winner then flies to the na
tional play-offs in New York
later in the month. The na
tional champion then goes to
the international games in Eng
land in December.
The game was first manufac
tured five years ago and has
been a tournament game in
England and Europe since
then.
The game is also made in
braille form for the blind and
comes in a Super Mastermind
form with 59,049 possible
codes and a Grand Mastermind
form with over 390,000 possi
ble codes.
The secret to successful
tournament play? Petitt said
that he is sometimes a "com
petitive" person and
Hackmann practices the
"pounce" play where he dives
in with a wild guess and either
wins the game in three moves
or "blows it."

participant Gary Jackoway.
"One reaches a plateau

rather quickly where a strategy
doesn't help. You've just got to
be able to avoid getting into a
situation where you have to
make a lot of guesses," said
Corthell.
Petitt and Hackmann will
challenge the Cal champs at
Macy's in San Francisco. The
winner then flies to the na
tional play-offs in New York
later in the month. The na
tional champion then goes to
the international games in Eng
land in December.
The game was first manufac
tured five years ago and has
been a tournament game in
England and Europe since
then.
The game is also made in
braille form for the blind and
comes in a Super Mastermind
form with 59,049 possible
codes and a Grand Mastermind
form with over 390,000 possi
ble codes.
The secret to successful
tournament play? Petitt said
that he is sometimes a "com
petitive" person and
Hackmann practices the
"pounce" play where he dives
in with a wild guess and either
wins the game in three moves
or "blows it."

John Hackmann (I.) and Ann Withrow were two of a dozen persons letting the mental sparks fly in
yesterday's first annual Stanford Mastermind tournament.


Jim Isaacs (I.) contemplates a move while Bruce Deas decides that a little yellow peg might break the code
for him.
It's true, master minds live at
Stanford.
Yesterday two "masters" of
Mastermind were selected to
represent Stanford in a play-off
with UC-Berkeley Nov. 19.
In an effort to make Master
mind a world-class brain game,
its manufacturer and the Tre
sidder Program Board spon
sored the first annual Stanford
Mastermind Championship at
Tresidder Large Lounge.
"It's possible that Master
mind could gain the status of
chess or backgammon. Mas
termind is being played in
other countries, too. As far as a
modern game invented in the
last hundred years, it's one of
the most brain-involving
games," said Scott Rutherford,
a participant and member of
the Tresidder Program Board.
The object of Mastermind is
to have a person figure out, in
the least number of moves, the
order and colors of four pegs
placed in an ordered "code"
by his opponent.
Codebreaking
The "codebreaker" has to fi
gure out which of 2401 possible
arrangements stands behind a
brown plastic wall on the foot

long, rectangular game board.
The "codemaker" gives him
clues by placing small black
and white markers on the ta
ble. Black markers mean the
codebreaker has placed a cor
rectly colored peg in its correct
space. A white marker means
the codebreaker has placed a
correctly colored peg in a
wrong place.
The winners of the three
hour tournament were
freshman Matthew Petitt with a
low score of 24 moves in five
games and first-year law stu
dent John Hackmann, who
won a play-off for the second
position.
Hackmann and sophomore
Jim Isaacs were both tied with
25 moves in five games. The
play-off required them to
break identical codes in the
fewest moves.
Psychology
"He's done it in four," cried
one spectator as Hackmann
beamed happily at the resolved
code — blue, black, no peg
and yellow.
Isaacs (about to make his
fourth move), was still bent in
tently over his board. He broke
the code on his fourth move
but disqualified himself from

the running because he said he
had picked up psychological
clues from the audience and
had changed his strategy at the
last moment.
"I had my fourth move all set
out, people looked at it and
simply walked away. I knew it
had to be wrong, so I changed
my strategy and guessed the
correct code," Isaacs
explained.
The tricks to figuring out
codes vary from player to
player.
"I play best against people I
know really well because I
know which colors they'll
pick," said participant Kelly
Corthell. She learned the game
from a friend who had gotten a
Mastermind game last Christ
mas.
'Pure skill'
"You really read the code in
your opponent's glasses,"
joked Isaacs. "It's a lot of intui
tion and in the long haul, it's
pure skill."
"It's a fairly simple game. I
mean, 2000 possible moves,
that's nothing compared to
chess or bridge which has 10 to
the 28th possible hands," said
participant Gary Jackoway.
"One reaches a plateau

break identical codes in the
fewest moves.
Psychology
"He's done it in four," cried
one spectator as Hackmann
beamed happily at the resolved
code — blue, black, no peg
and yellow.
Isaacs (about to make his
fourth move), was still bent in
tently over his board. He broke
the code on his fourth move
but disqualified himself from

the running because he said he
had picked up psychological
clues from the audience and
had changed his strategy at the
last moment.
"I had my fourth move all set
out, people looked at it and
simply walked away. I knew it
had to be wrong, so I changed
my strategy and guessed the
correct code," Isaacs
explained.
The tricks to figuring out
codes vary from player to
player.
"I play best against people I
know really well because I
know which colors they'll
pick," said participant Kelly
Corthell. She learned the game
from a friend who had gotten a
Mastermind game last Christ
mas.
'Pure skill'
"You really read the code in
your opponent's glasses,"
joked Isaacs. "It's a lot of intui
tion and in the long haul, it's
pure skill."
"It's a fairly simple game. I
mean, 2000 possible moves,
that's nothing compared to
chess or bridge which has 10 to
the 28th possible hands," said
participant Gary Jackoway.
"One reaches a plateau

rather quickly where a strategy
doesn't help. You've just got to
be able to avoid getting into a
situation where you have to
make a lot of guesses," said
Corthell.
Petitt and Hackmann will
challenge the Cal champs at
Macy's in San Francisco. The
winner then flies to the na
tional play-offs in New York
later in the month. The na
tional champion then goes to
the international games in Eng
land in December.
The game was first manufac
tured five years ago and has
been a tournament game in
England and Europe since
then.
The game is also made in
braille form for the blind and
comes in a Super Mastermind
form with 59,049 possible
codes and a Grand Mastermind
form with over 390,000 possi
ble codes.
The secret to successful
tournament play? Petitt said
that he is sometimes a "com
petitive" person and
Hackmann practices the
"pounce" play where he dives
in with a wild guess and either
wins the game in three moves
or "blows it."
