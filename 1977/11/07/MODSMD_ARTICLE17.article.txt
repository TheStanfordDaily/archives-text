I thought the use of libraries here was
free once a student paid registration fees.
Why does one have to pay a fee to use the
Chicano Library?
The primary reason is because the
Chicano Reference Library is not a Stan
ford University Library. It is an indepen
dent, student-run library.
According to Junita Villalobos, co
director of the library, the funds for the
library come from the Chicano Fellows
Program. She said the Chicano Fellows
Program annually receives about $5000
from the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. The fees charged for library use
help defray printing costs for the various
check-out cards.

Please help us settle a matter of grave
importance. If a senior can turn a girl into a
Stanford Woman by kissing her once in the

Quad, could a sophomorexJo it by kissing
her twice? Or how about a junior or a
freshman?

Forthose ofyou who are unfamiliarwith
the Stanford tradition, it was described in
the Daily (Sept. 25, 1964) in this way:
"No Stanford undergraduate woman is
considered a true Stanford Woman until
she has been kissed by a Stanford senior,
at twelve midnight, under a full moon, in
the middle of the Quad."
An article concerning this tradition ap
peared in Bug Me (Daily, April 17, 1975):
"One October night in 1961 the tradi
tion got a little out of hand, and the ensu
ing uproar occupied the Daily's editorial
pages for over a week. The controversy
began when an irate senior named Bill
Griffin wrote a lengthy, vituperous col
umn describing what he called 'one of the

most appalling acts of pure crudeness and
stupidity that I have encountered since
coming to Stanford.'
"The whole thing began, according to
Griffin, when almost 250 freshmen
showed up at the Quad.
"Screaming obscenities, they sur
rounded the Circle, trying to snatch fledgl
ing women from their dates, and running
down those who tried to escape with bicy
cles and electric carts. . . .
"The 'full moon incident' finally cameto
a resolution several days later when 76
freshmen turned themselves in and were
fined 70 cents apiece to pay for damage io
Quad flower beds."
By tradition, only a Stanford senior man
can make a woman a Stanford Woman.
The ritual has specific qualifications, and
not one "can be missed; unless all are
fulfilled, the ritual is meaningless."
