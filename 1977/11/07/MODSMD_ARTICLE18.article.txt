# Saturday postal service debated
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The
Postal Service is facing conflict
ing results from a series of na
tional polls designed to show if
the public really wants to con
tinue getting mail on Saturday.
So far, three public opinion
surveys have been taken and
each has shown about 80 per
cent of those polled as saying
they could do without Saturday
delivery.
But two of the three polls in
dicated many Americans dis
approve of the proposed ter
mination of service. Less than
half of those questioned in the
two polls said they support
such a service cutback.
"We are still studying the re
sults and we have not made up
our minds one way or the
other," Deputy Postmaster
General William Bolger said in
an interview.
Willing
Bolger repeated the Postal
Service position that it is wil
ling to provide any service the
public wants and is willing to
pay for.
Ending Saturday delivery
would save the mail agency an
estimated $412 million per
year.
The debate over Saturday de
livery was triggered by a report
issued in April by the Commis
sion on Postal Service, a study
group created by Congress to
make recommendations about
the nation's mail service.
One recommendation was
to cut back deliveries from the
present six days per week to
five days.
The suggestion found im-

mediate favor with the Postal
Service, which has been
searching for ways to reduce its
costs.
Postmaster General Benja
min Bailar greeted the com
mission's report by saying the
Postal Service was giving "seri
ous consideration" to abolish
ing Saturday deliveries.
The study group's recom
mendation was based on a poll
it commissioned by the A.C.
Nielsen organization. Nielsen
asked a random sampling of
Americans if they would be wil
ling to forego the sixth day of
deliveries if it would help hold
down postal rates. Some 79 per
cent answered yes.
The poll and the recommen
dation based on it were im
mediately attacked in Con
gress and by postal unions
which maintained the move
would throw some 20,000 per
sons out of work.
Resolution
In September, the House
passed a non-binding resolu
tion urging the Postal Service
to continue six delivery days.
Legislation that would re
quire continuation of current
deliveries has received com
mittee approval and is ex
pected to reach the House
floor early next year.
In the Senate, a similar re
solution was added to an ap
propriation bill by voice vote
but then dropped in a confer
ence committee.
Faced with the controversy,
the Postal Service decided to
pay for more surveys before
reaching a decision.
