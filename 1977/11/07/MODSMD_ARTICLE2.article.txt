## Retirement topic of new study 
### Heidi Hedlund 
The effect on the academic com
munity of raising the age of mandat
ory retirement to 70 is the subject of a
new national survey released today
in the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, an independent weekly news
paper.
The study found that, overall,
withdrawal from university and col
lege teaching seems to be viewed in a
far from negative light.
"Colleges and universities are
hardly helpless to influence retire
ment plans, whatever state and fed
eral legislation may be enacted," the
authors said.
"It does seem possible, with the
requisite funds, to extend individual
discretion as to retirement age and to
get large numbers of academics to
step down earlier."
Two groups
The study, conducted by Profes
sors Everett Carll Ladd and David
Palmer of the University of Connec
ticut and Political Science Prof.
Seymour Lipset of the Hoover In
stitution, sampled two large groups
of the nation's professors. The first
included instructors at institutions
with a mandatory retirement age of
65; the second group polled taught
at schools with a compulsory retire
ment age of 70.
Among faculty age 55 to 62 years
old at the nation'stop universities, 36
percent said they plan to retire at age
67 or later, compared with only nine
per cent wanting to work that long at
the lowest-tier institutions.
The authors of "Mandatory Re
tirement: The American Profes
soriate" found "an exceptionally
strong association between a vigor
ous research commitment 2nd a
commitment to late retirement. . .It
is emphatically not the 'deadwood'

who wish to retire late," they de
clare.
Faculty bulge
Some see the result of legislation
raising the mandatory retirement age
to 70 or eliminating it altogether (as
California has done) as aggravating
the "bulge" of faculty still two to
three decades away from retirement
started in the 1960s and early '70s.
The number of places for new, young
faculty would, perhaps inevitably, be
reduced still further, according to
the study.
Many professors, however, indi
cated that they would consider retir
ing earlier than they had first planned
if suitable incentives were provided.
Two-thirds of those surveyed said
they would retire sooner if they were
"assured of pension benefits equal
to what they would be at the man
datory retirement age," no matter at
what age they had originally planned
to retire.
Part-time
Similarly, 48 per cent of the entire
faculty would step down earlier if
they received "part-time employ
ment with a proportionate decrease
in salary (for example one half of the
normal teaching load at one half
normal salary)."
Among those responding posi
tively to the part-time work plan, 42
per cent who had planned to step
down between the ages of 64 and 66
stated that they would plan to retire
seven or more years earlier; of those
contemplating retirement at 70, 38
per cent said they might retire at least
seven years sooner.
Imminence also plays an important
part in the retirement plans of the
academic community, the report
said. Young professors tend to view
the question of retirement as

"academic" and tend to set their re
tirement date earlier than older fa
culty, who see the day drawing near
and sometimes "find themselves
wanting to postpone it."
Enjoyable life
Because professorships are "in
trinsically interesting" careers,
boredom is not usually a factor in
fluencing retirement. Thus, the posi
tive or negative attitude of the faculty
toward retirement is a vital consider
ation.
Some 81 per cent saw retirement
"as an enjoyable period of. . . life,"
while only 19 per cent viewed it nega
tively.
Avoidance of boredom was cited
as an anticipated problem during re
tirement by 28 per cent of those sur
veyed. However, 78 per cent didn't
foresee any such difficulty.

The effect on the academic com
munity of raising the age of mandat
ory retirement to 70 is the subject of a
new national survey released today
in the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, an independent weekly news
paper.
The study found that, overall,
withdrawal from university and col
lege teaching seems to be viewed in a
far from negative light.
"Colleges and universities are
hardly helpless to influence retire
ment plans, whatever state and fed
eral legislation may be enacted," the
authors said.
"It does seem possible, with the
requisite funds, to extend individual
discretion as to retirement age and to
get large numbers of academics to
step down earlier."
Two groups
The study, conducted by Profes
sors Everett Carll Ladd and David
Palmer of the University of Connec
ticut and Political Science Prof.
Seymour Lipset of the Hoover In
stitution, sampled two large groups
of the nation's professors. The first
included instructors at institutions
with a mandatory retirement age of
65; the second group polled taught
at schools with a compulsory retire
ment age of 70.
Among faculty age 55 to 62 years
old at the nation'stop universities, 36
percent said they plan to retire at age
67 or later, compared with only nine
per cent wanting to work that long at
the lowest-tier institutions.
The authors of "Mandatory Re
tirement: The American Profes
soriate" found "an exceptionally
strong association between a vigor
ous research commitment 2nd a
commitment to late retirement. . .It
is emphatically not the 'deadwood'

who wish to retire late," they de
clare.
Faculty bulge
Some see the result of legislation
raising the mandatory retirement age
to 70 or eliminating it altogether (as
California has done) as aggravating
the "bulge" of faculty still two to
three decades away from retirement
started in the 1960s and early '70s.
The number of places for new, young
faculty would, perhaps inevitably, be
reduced still further, according to
the study.
Many professors, however, indi
cated that they would consider retir
ing earlier than they had first planned
if suitable incentives were provided.
Two-thirds of those surveyed said
they would retire sooner if they were
"assured of pension benefits equal
to what they would be at the man
datory retirement age," no matter at
what age they had originally planned
to retire.
Part-time
Similarly, 48 per cent of the entire
faculty would step down earlier if
they received "part-time employ
ment with a proportionate decrease
in salary (for example one half of the
normal teaching load at one half
normal salary)."
Among those responding posi
tively to the part-time work plan, 42
per cent who had planned to step
down between the ages of 64 and 66
stated that they would plan to retire
seven or more years earlier; of those
contemplating retirement at 70, 38
per cent said they might retire at least
seven years sooner.
Imminence also plays an important
part in the retirement plans of the
academic community, the report
said. Young professors tend to view
the question of retirement as

"academic" and tend to set their re
tirement date earlier than older fa
culty, who see the day drawing near
and sometimes "find themselves
wanting to postpone it."
Enjoyable life
Because professorships are "in
trinsically interesting" careers,
boredom is not usually a factor in
fluencing retirement. Thus, the posi
tive or negative attitude of the faculty
toward retirement is a vital consider
ation.
Some 81 per cent saw retirement
"as an enjoyable period of. . . life,"
while only 19 per cent viewed it nega
tively.
Avoidance of boredom was cited
as an anticipated problem during re
tirement by 28 per cent of those sur
veyed. However, 78 per cent didn't
foresee any such difficulty.
