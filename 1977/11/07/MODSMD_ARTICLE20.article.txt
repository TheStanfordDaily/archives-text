# UFW to boycott growers
## 
### Juan Zuniga 
Although many state farm
workers have voted to be rep
resented by the United Farm
Workers Union (UFW), six
major Delano, Calif, grape
growers have "obstinately re
fused" to negotiate "in good
faith," a UFW official said here
Thursday.
"Our hope is to put
economic pressure on the
growers so they will have to
face the law," said UFW Na
tional Director Larry Tramutt.
Tramutt spoke to a crowd of
75 at a meeting organized by
the UFW Support Committee
here.
Tramutt told the group that
the UFW won over 200 of 300

unionization elections, yet
only 75 growers have since
signed contracts with the
workers.
Tramutt said the UFW must
negotiate decent working
conditions plus hospital, edu
cational and retirement be
nefits so the farm worker may
gain more stability in society.
Tramutt joined other UFW of
ficials in urging local boycott
efforts, including leafleting
and picketing of stores which
refuse to remove grapes grown
by the six growers from their
shelves.
The six growers being
boycotted are Tex-Cal, Jack
Radovich, Jake Cesare, M. Car
tan, Nick Bozanich and Sam
Barbie.
Mike Johnson, Bay Area Di
rector, told the group that his
figures show that about 80 per
cent of the stores in the Bay

Area are not buying these
grapes in order to avoid pickets
and leafleters.
He said some store mana
gers usually sell some non
union grapes from growers
other than the six, but no pres
sure is exerted if the managers
agree not to buy any grapes
from the six key growers.
Johnson called the situation
"sort of a trade-off."
Tramutt also told the group
of a new UFW program
whereby people are trained to
work at field camps as union
organizers.
He said most of the union's
recruitment efforts are with
farm workers so they can run
their own program.
The union is developing the
first collective bargaining
school of its kind in the nation
in order to teach farm workers
how to do their own collective
bargaining.


United Farm Workers National Director Larry
Tramutt called for boycotts of local grocerers who
sell grapes grown by six Delano vineyards which

the union.
