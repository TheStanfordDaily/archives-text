# Guy Lombardo mourned at 75
## 
### 
New York (AP) — There'll still
be a New Year's Eve this year,
but it won't be the same for
tens of millions of Americans
and Canadians — for the first
time since 1929 Guy Lombardo
won't lead his Royal Canadians
in "Auld Lang Syne."
The creator of "the sweetest
music this side of heaven" died
Saturday night in Houston's
Methodist Hospital of a brea
thing problem associated with
the pulmonary artery trouble
for which he was admitted Oct.
27.
His wife, the former Lillibelle
Glenn of Cleveland, Ohio,
whom he married 51 years ago,
was at his bedside.
The bandleader lived in
Freeport, Long Island. Funeral
services will be held Wednes
day in Garden City, also on the
island.
Lombardo was 75 and had
led a band for 63 of those years.
He started at 12 with four other
youngsters playing for wo
men's clubs in London, On
tario, his birthplace. He was
named Gaetano after his
father, an immigrant Italian
tailor.
On to Cleveland
Lombardo and his brothers,
Carmen and Lebert, moved
their band to Cleveland in 1925
and Chicago in 1927. Ayounger
brother, Victor, and a sister,
Rosemarie, also were with the
orchestra.
The Lombardo orchestra
proved to be an unbroken suc
cess story for more than half a
century, and for many people
his New Year's Eve telecast was
a traditional part of the holiday.
Lombardo sold more than 400
million phonograph records
and for the past 40 years never
made less than $1 million a
year.

This past summer, his revival
of the Broadway show "Fi
nian's Rainbow" at Jones
Beach on Long Island took in
$1.55 million, sparking what
was rapidly becoming a record
financial year even for the most
successful big band in musical
history.
Asked the reason for his pe
rennial popularity, Lombardo
once said: "It's simple. People
like to dance."
Bland
The Royal Canadians had a
bland, soothing style, which
infuriated lovers of pure jazz
and most critics of popular
music.
Nevertheless, in 1965, dur
ing the height of the Beatles'
popularity, Lombardo beat the
English group at the box office,
drawing larger audiences on
one tour than the pop group
had in the same facilities.
Lombardo admitted that not
all the people loved his music
all the time.
"We lose 'em in their teens,
but we catch 'em up later," he
once said. "Sooner or later we
get 'em all and when we get
'em, we keep 'em."
More inquiries
A CBS official said yesterday
the network received more
telephoned inquiries about
Lombado's death than it did
about those of Elvis Presley ear
lier this year or Bing Crosby a
few weeks ago.
The Royal Canadians played
every New Year's Eve at the
Roosevelt for year after year
and, when the hotel an
nounced his departure for the
Waldorf-Astoria 13 years ago,
Time magazine commented,
"Itwas like Athensannouncing
the departure of the Ac
ropolis."

The Royal Canadians had a
bland, soothing style, which
infuriated lovers of pure jazz
and most critics of popular
music.
Nevertheless, in 1965, dur
ing the height of the Beatles'
popularity, Lombardo beat the
English group at the box office,
drawing larger audiences on
one tour than the pop group
had in the same facilities.
Lombardo admitted that not
all the people loved his music
all the time.
"We lose 'em in their teens,
but we catch 'em up later," he
once said. "Sooner or later we
get 'em all and when we get
'em, we keep 'em."
More inquiries
A CBS official said yesterday
the network received more
telephoned inquiries about
Lombado's death than it did
about those of Elvis Presley ear
lier this year or Bing Crosby a
few weeks ago.
The Royal Canadians played
every New Year's Eve at the
Roosevelt for year after year
and, when the hotel an
nounced his departure for the
Waldorf-Astoria 13 years ago,
Time magazine commented,
"Itwas like Athensannouncing
the departure of the Ac
ropolis."
New York (AP) — There'll still
be a New Year's Eve this year,
but it won't be the same for
tens of millions of Americans
and Canadians — for the first
time since 1929 Guy Lombardo
won't lead his Royal Canadians
in "Auld Lang Syne."
The creator of "the sweetest
music this side of heaven" died

Methodist Hospital of a brea
thing problem associated with
the pulmonary artery trouble

His wife, the former Lillibelle

tario, his birthplace. He was
named Gaetano after his
father, an immigrant Italian
tailor.
On to Cleveland
Lombardo and his brothers,
Carmen and Lebert, moved
their band to Cleveland in 1925
and Chicago in 1927. Ayounger
brother, Victor, and a sister,
Rosemarie, also were with the
orchestra.
The Lombardo orchestra
proved to be an unbroken suc
cess story for more than half a
century, and for many people
his New Year's Eve telecast was
a traditional part of the holiday.
Lombardo sold more than 400
million phonograph records
and for the past 40 years never
made less than $1 million a
year.
