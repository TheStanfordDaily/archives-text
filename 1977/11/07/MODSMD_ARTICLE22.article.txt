# Hydrogen fueled plane researched
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — By the end of the
century, people might be whizzing around
the world in hydrogen-powered planes
that could get from New York to London in
one hour and 56 minutes.
The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration last week gave Lockheed-
California Co. a contract to study a liquid
hydrogen fueled aircraft capable of carry
ing 200 passengers up to 6000 miles at a
cruise speed of 4000 miles per hour.
That pleases Willis Hawkins,
Lockheed-California president, a one
time biplane riveter who long has
dreamed of building a hydrogen aircraft.
The purpose of the 15-month, $270,000
study is to determine how to design a
hypersonic aircraft with two diverse en
gine systems, he said. It would use five
conventional turbojet engines for takeoff

and five supersonic combustion ramjet
engines for cruising.
The contract calls only for a design con
cept, with no actual construction planned.
But Hawkins hopes the nation soon will
begin experimenting with a hypersonic
test vehicle. NASA and the Air Force are
looking into that possibility.
He feels American airlines should be fly
ing hydrogen planes by the end of the
century, that it makes sense from the
standpoints of speed, saving energy, pre
venting air pollution and reducing noise.
Hawkins said the time is fast coming
when Americans are going to have to find
alternate means of fueling their au
tomobiles, their homes, their buildings
and their airplanes.
"My candidate for the airplane is hydro
gen," he said. "It's clean, it's energetic,

provides about 2Vi times the miles per
pound than the fuel we're using today,
and the engines are pretty easy to design
for, because the stuff burns very beauti
fully when it's converted to a gaseous
state."
Hawkins said hydrogen can be pro
duced from the nation's abundant supply
of coal.
The world's fastest commercial jetliner
is the 1300-mile-an-hour British-French
Concorde. But it is restricted to half that
speed when flying over most land areas
because of the potentially damaging ef
fects of its sonic boom on the ground.
The concept being studied by Lockheed
would have no such restriction because it
would cruise at altitudes of 110,000 to
120,000 feet — compared to about 60,000
feet for Concorde.

dreamed of building a hydrogen aircraft.
The purpose of the 15-month, $270,000
study is to determine how to design a
hypersonic aircraft with two diverse en
gine systems, he said. It would use five
conventional turbojet engines for takeoff

and five supersonic combustion ramjet
engines for cruising.
The contract calls only for a design con
cept, with no actual construction planned.
But Hawkins hopes the nation soon will
begin experimenting with a hypersonic
test vehicle. NASA and the Air Force are
looking into that possibility.
He feels American airlines should be fly
ing hydrogen planes by the end of the
century, that it makes sense from the
standpoints of speed, saving energy, pre
venting air pollution and reducing noise.
Hawkins said the time is fast coming
when Americans are going to have to find
alternate means of fueling their au
tomobiles, their homes, their buildings
and their airplanes.
"My candidate for the airplane is hydro
gen," he said. "It's clean, it's energetic,

provides about 2Vi times the miles per
pound than the fuel we're using today,
and the engines are pretty easy to design
for, because the stuff burns very beauti
fully when it's converted to a gaseous
state."
Hawkins said hydrogen can be pro
duced from the nation's abundant supply
of coal.
The world's fastest commercial jetliner
is the 1300-mile-an-hour British-French
Concorde. But it is restricted to half that
speed when flying over most land areas
because of the potentially damaging ef
fects of its sonic boom on the ground.
The concept being studied by Lockheed
would have no such restriction because it
would cruise at altitudes of 110,000 to
120,000 feet — compared to about 60,000
feet for Concorde.
