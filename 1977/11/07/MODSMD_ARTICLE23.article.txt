Los Angeles — The storm that
poured on the Los Angeles Col
iseum before Saturday's USC-
Stanford football game only
foreshadowed the deluge that
followed as the Trojans
drenched the Cardinals, 49-0.
Running at will against an
overwhelmed Stanford de
fense, USC rushed for five
touchdowns and 453 yards and
moved into a three-team tie for
first place in the scrambled
Pacific-8 Conference race.
USC (4-1 in the Pac-8, 6-3
overall) rebounded from con
secutive losses to Notre Dame
and California to annihilate
Stanford (4-2 in conference, 6-3
overall) and enter a tie with
UCLA and Washington for the
conference lead.
"We knew we were con
fronted with a dramatically
bigger and faster team today,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"At the beginning of the sea
son they were ranked the top
team in the United States and
we were ranked no better than
No. 5 in the conference."
Mellowed Trojans
"This was one of our best
games all around," said
second-year SC coach John
Robinson. "We just have to
learn to relax. We were so up
tight last week and we couldn't
execute.
"We know we have a good
football team and good
players. We have had our prob
lems in the area of defeating
ourselves."
Saturday there was no ques

tion of who was beating whom.
"They beat us," said Stan
ford middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino. "That's the word.
Theybeaf us. We didn't give it
to them.
"They just played SC foot
ball. They blasted up the mid
dle, ran the SC trap up the
middle and the student body
sweep around the ends. And
we just had one of those days
where everything goes
wrong."
Everything.
First of many
Before most of the 65,101
rain-soaked fans had even
taken their seats, USC took the
opening kickoff and drove 67
yards with the initial score
coming on a Rob Hertel pass to
Dan Burns with fourth-and
goal from the 6-yard line.
Hertel faked a handoff to
tailback Lynn Cain and most of
the Card defense went after
Cain who hurtled himself high
over the middle of the line. But
Hertel kept the "ball, rolled to
the right and then lofted a pass
to Burns who was alone in the
end zone.
It was a scene repeated often
that afternoon: an SC player
scoring, the home crowd roar
ing and the crimson-and-gold
clad Trojan band blaring
"Conquest."
Can't get it in
Trailing 14-0 in the second
quarter, the Cards had their
one chance to get back in the
game when an 8-yard pass from
Guy Benjamin to James Lofton
gave Stanford a first down on

the Trojan 5-yard line.
On first down, USC
linebacker Ed Gutierrez skirted
around end untouched and
dropped Benjamin for a 10-
yard loss. A 7-yard hook-up
from Benjamin to Bill Kellar
and a holding penalty against
the Trojans on the following
play gave Stanford third-and
goal from the 1.
Benjamin sent John Finley on
a dive behind left tackle Gor
don King but the Trojans stop
ped the Card fullback for no
gain.
On fourth down, Benjamin
flung a pass to Lofton on the
right side of the end zone. But
the double-teamed Lofton
couldn't grab the pass and the
Trojans took over on their 1.
"We couldn't connect when
it was important, when it was
crucial," Benjamin said.
White washed
The Trojans carried a 21-0
advantage into the locker room
at halftime after Charles White
took a short pass from Hertel
on the Stanford 20, broke three
tackles and crashed into the
end zone with the first of his
three touchdowns against the
Cardinals.
USC continued its field day
unabated in the second half
with White scoring on 14- and
2-yard runs, third-string tail
back Dwight Ford racing 63
yards for a TD and fourth-team
tailback Rod Connors busting 5
yards for the final Trojan tally.
Troy had three runners gain
more than 100 yards Saturday
with White leading the barrage

with 126 yards, followed by
Ford with 124 and fullback
Mosi Tatupu with 101.
Stanford's offense, on the
other hand, continued a pat
tern of inconsistency in the
second stanza.
Lack of continuity
"We were stopping our
selves a lot," said Kellar, who
was the one bright spot in the
Card offense with six recep
tions for 97 yards. "We'd run a
good play but then have a let
down. It was the same story, a
good play then a breakdown,
like a bad pattern or some
thing."
Both coaches seemed sur
prised by Stanford's inability to
score against the Trojans.
"All year we've moved the
ball beautifully," Walsh said.
"Physically they just stopped
us today."
"I'm amazed we shut Stan
ford out," USC's Robinson
said. "Obviously it was not
Stanford's best day. And of
course we made all the inter
ceptions today that we drop
ped last week."
Killing turnovers
In all, the SC defense
hijacked four Benjamin passes,
twice as many as the Stanford
Ail-American has yielded in any
other game this season. And al
though Benjamin hit 19 of 38
passes for 208 yards, it was the
four turnovers that helped
keep Stanford out of the end
zone.
Southern Cal also extin
guished Stanford's other big
offensive weapon — freshman
running back Darrin Nelson.
The Trojans held Nelson to 22
yards on nine carries.
"Southern Cal had their big
loss against Notre Dame and
they came back today," Walsh
said. "We've had our big loss
now and it's up to us to come
back."
Cardinal notes . . . Tight end
Mitch Pleis suffered a shoulder
separation against the Trojans
and will be operated on today.
Darrin Nelson broke the
conference freshman rushing
record set last year by USC's
Charles White. Nelson has
now gained 764 yards on the
ground this season. In the
same game White surpassed
the Pacific-8 sophomore rush
ing record now having gained
1114 yards on 217 carries.
White broke the record of 1034
yards set by Southern Cal's An
thony Davis in 1972.
Saturday's margin of victory
was the greatest ever by USC
over Stanford. The previous
largest margin was a 54-7 drub
bing of the Cards in 1952.
The last time Stanford was
shut out was in last season's
contest with Michigan when
the Wolverines blanked the
Cards 51-0.

rain-soaked fans had even
taken their seats, USC took the
opening kickoff and drove 67
yards with the initial score
coming on a Rob Hertel pass to
Dan Burns with fourth-and
goal from the 6-yard line.
Hertel faked a handoff to
tailback Lynn Cain and most of
the Card defense went after
Cain who hurtled himself high
over the middle of the line. But
Hertel kept the "ball, rolled to
the right and then lofted a pass
to Burns who was alone in the
end zone.
It was a scene repeated often
that afternoon: an SC player
scoring, the home crowd roar
ing and the crimson-and-gold
clad Trojan band blaring
"Conquest."
Can't get it in
Trailing 14-0 in the second
quarter, the Cards had their
one chance to get back in the
game when an 8-yard pass from
Guy Benjamin to James Lofton
gave Stanford a first down on

the Trojan 5-yard line.
On first down, USC
linebacker Ed Gutierrez skirted
around end untouched and
dropped Benjamin for a 10-
yard loss. A 7-yard hook-up
from Benjamin to Bill Kellar
and a holding penalty against
the Trojans on the following
play gave Stanford third-and
goal from the 1.
Benjamin sent John Finley on
a dive behind left tackle Gor
don King but the Trojans stop
ped the Card fullback for no
gain.
On fourth down, Benjamin
flung a pass to Lofton on the
right side of the end zone. But
the double-teamed Lofton
couldn't grab the pass and the
Trojans took over on their 1.
"We couldn't connect when
it was important, when it was
crucial," Benjamin said.
White washed
The Trojans carried a 21-0
advantage into the locker room
at halftime after Charles White
took a short pass from Hertel
on the Stanford 20, broke three
tackles and crashed into the
end zone with the first of his
three touchdowns against the
Cardinals.
USC continued its field day
unabated in the second half
with White scoring on 14- and
2-yard runs, third-string tail
back Dwight Ford racing 63
yards for a TD and fourth-team
tailback Rod Connors busting 5
yards for the final Trojan tally.
Troy had three runners gain
more than 100 yards Saturday
with White leading the barrage

with 126 yards, followed by
Ford with 124 and fullback
Mosi Tatupu with 101.
Stanford's offense, on the
other hand, continued a pat
tern of inconsistency in the
second stanza.
Lack of continuity
"We were stopping our
selves a lot," said Kellar, who
was the one bright spot in the
Card offense with six recep
tions for 97 yards. "We'd run a
good play but then have a let
down. It was the same story, a
good play then a breakdown,
like a bad pattern or some
thing."
Both coaches seemed sur
prised by Stanford's inability to
score against the Trojans.
"All year we've moved the
ball beautifully," Walsh said.
"Physically they just stopped
us today."
"I'm amazed we shut Stan
ford out," USC's Robinson
said. "Obviously it was not
Stanford's best day. And of
course we made all the inter
ceptions today that we drop
ped last week."
Killing turnovers
In all, the SC defense
hijacked four Benjamin passes,
twice as many as the Stanford
Ail-American has yielded in any
other game this season. And al
though Benjamin hit 19 of 38
passes for 208 yards, it was the
four turnovers that helped
keep Stanford out of the end
zone.
Southern Cal also extin
guished Stanford's other big
offensive weapon — freshman
running back Darrin Nelson.
The Trojans held Nelson to 22
yards on nine carries.
"Southern Cal had their big
loss against Notre Dame and
they came back today," Walsh
said. "We've had our big loss
now and it's up to us to come
back."
Cardinal notes . . . Tight end
Mitch Pleis suffered a shoulder
separation against the Trojans
and will be operated on today.
Darrin Nelson broke the
conference freshman rushing
record set last year by USC's
Charles White. Nelson has
now gained 764 yards on the
ground this season. In the
same game White surpassed
the Pacific-8 sophomore rush
ing record now having gained
1114 yards on 217 carries.
White broke the record of 1034
yards set by Southern Cal's An
thony Davis in 1972.
Saturday's margin of victory
was the greatest ever by USC
over Stanford. The previous
largest margin was a 54-7 drub
bing of the Cards in 1952.
The last time Stanford was
shut out was in last season's
contest with Michigan when
the Wolverines blanked the
Cards 51-0.

Los Angeles — The storm that
poured on the Los Angeles Col
iseum before Saturday's USC-
Stanford football game only
foreshadowed the deluge that
followed as the Trojans
drenched the Cardinals, 49-0.
Running at will against an
overwhelmed Stanford de
fense, USC rushed for five
touchdowns and 453 yards and
moved into a three-team tie for
first place in the scrambled
Pacific-8 Conference race.
USC (4-1 in the Pac-8, 6-3
overall) rebounded from con
secutive losses to Notre Dame
and California to annihilate
Stanford (4-2 in conference, 6-3
overall) and enter a tie with
UCLA and Washington for the
conference lead.
"We knew we were con
fronted with a dramatically
bigger and faster team today,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"At the beginning of the sea
son they were ranked the top
team in the United States and
we were ranked no better than
No. 5 in the conference."
Mellowed Trojans
"This was one of our best
games all around," said
second-year SC coach John
Robinson. "We just have to
learn to relax. We were so up
tight last week and we couldn't
execute.
"We know we have a good

Saturday there was no ques

"They beat us," said Stan
ford middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino. "That's the word.
Theybeaf us. We didn't give it
to them.
"They just played SC foot

end zone with the first of his
three touchdowns against the
Cardinals.
USC continued its field day
unabated in the second half
with White scoring on 14- and
2-yard runs, third-string tail
back Dwight Ford racing 63
yards for a TD and fourth-team
tailback Rod Connors busting 5
yards for the final Trojan tally.
Troy had three runners gain
more than 100 yards Saturday
with White leading the barrage

with 126 yards, followed by
Ford with 124 and fullback
Mosi Tatupu with 101.
Stanford's offense, on the
other hand, continued a pat
tern of inconsistency in the
second stanza.
Lack of continuity
"We were stopping our
selves a lot," said Kellar, who
was the one bright spot in the
Card offense with six recep
tions for 97 yards. "We'd run a
good play but then have a let
down. It was the same story, a
good play then a breakdown,
like a bad pattern or some
thing."
Both coaches seemed sur
prised by Stanford's inability to
score against the Trojans.
"All year we've moved the
ball beautifully," Walsh said.
"Physically they just stopped
us today."
"I'm amazed we shut Stan
ford out," USC's Robinson
said. "Obviously it was not
Stanford's best day. And of
course we made all the inter
ceptions today that we drop
ped last week."
Killing turnovers
In all, the SC defense
hijacked four Benjamin passes,
twice as many as the Stanford
Ail-American has yielded in any
other game this season. And al
though Benjamin hit 19 of 38
passes for 208 yards, it was the
four turnovers that helped
keep Stanford out of the end
zone.
Southern Cal also extin
guished Stanford's other big
offensive weapon — freshman
running back Darrin Nelson.
The Trojans held Nelson to 22
yards on nine carries.
"Southern Cal had their big
loss against Notre Dame and
they came back today," Walsh
said. "We've had our big loss
now and it's up to us to come
back."
Cardinal notes . . . Tight end
Mitch Pleis suffered a shoulder
separation against the Trojans
and will be operated on today.
Darrin Nelson broke the
conference freshman rushing
record set last year by USC's
Charles White. Nelson has
now gained 764 yards on the
ground this season. In the
same game White surpassed
the Pacific-8 sophomore rush
ing record now having gained
1114 yards on 217 carries.
White broke the record of 1034
yards set by Southern Cal's An
thony Davis in 1972.
Saturday's margin of victory
was the greatest ever by USC
over Stanford. The previous
largest margin was a 54-7 drub
bing of the Cards in 1952.
The last time Stanford was
shut out was in last season's
contest with Michigan when
the Wolverines blanked the
Cards 51-0.

Los Angeles — The storm that
poured on the Los Angeles Col
iseum before Saturday's USC-
Stanford football game only
foreshadowed the deluge that
followed as the Trojans
drenched the Cardinals, 49-0.
Running at will against an
overwhelmed Stanford de
fense, USC rushed for five
touchdowns and 453 yards and
moved into a three-team tie for
first place in the scrambled
Pacific-8 Conference race.
USC (4-1 in the Pac-8, 6-3
overall) rebounded from con
secutive losses to Notre Dame
and California to annihilate
Stanford (4-2 in conference, 6-3
overall) and enter a tie with
UCLA and Washington for the
conference lead.
"We knew we were con
fronted with a dramatically
bigger and faster team today,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"At the beginning of the sea
son they were ranked the top
team in the United States and
we were ranked no better than
No. 5 in the conference."
Mellowed Trojans
"This was one of our best
games all around," said
second-year SC coach John
Robinson. "We just have to
learn to relax. We were so up
tight last week and we couldn't
execute.
"We know we have a good
football team and good
players. We have had our prob
lems in the area of defeating
ourselves."
Saturday there was no ques

tion of who was beating whom.
"They beat us," said Stan
ford middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino. "That's the word.
Theybeaf us. We didn't give it
to them.
"They just played SC foot
ball. They blasted up the mid
dle, ran the SC trap up the
middle and the student body
sweep around the ends. And
we just had one of those days
where everything goes
wrong."
Everything.
First of many
Before most of the 65,101
rain-soaked fans had even
taken their seats, USC took the
opening kickoff and drove 67
yards with the initial score
coming on a Rob Hertel pass to
Dan Burns with fourth-and
goal from the 6-yard line.
Hertel faked a handoff to
tailback Lynn Cain and most of
the Card defense went after
Cain who hurtled himself high
over the middle of the line. But
Hertel kept the "ball, rolled to
the right and then lofted a pass
to Burns who was alone in the
end zone.
It was a scene repeated often
that afternoon: an SC player
scoring, the home crowd roar
ing and the crimson-and-gold
clad Trojan band blaring
"Conquest."
Can't get it in
Trailing 14-0 in the second
quarter, the Cards had their
one chance to get back in the
game when an 8-yard pass from
Guy Benjamin to James Lofton
gave Stanford a first down on

the Trojan 5-yard line.
On first down, USC
linebacker Ed Gutierrez skirted
around end untouched and
dropped Benjamin for a 10-
yard loss. A 7-yard hook-up
from Benjamin to Bill Kellar
and a holding penalty against
the Trojans on the following
play gave Stanford third-and
goal from the 1.
Benjamin sent John Finley on
a dive behind left tackle Gor
don King but the Trojans stop
ped the Card fullback for no
gain.
On fourth down, Benjamin
flung a pass to Lofton on the
right side of the end zone. But
the double-teamed Lofton
couldn't grab the pass and the
Trojans took over on their 1.
"We couldn't connect when
it was important, when it was
crucial," Benjamin said.

The Trojans held Nelson to 22
yards on nine carries.
"Southern Cal had their big
loss against Notre Dame and
they came back today," Walsh
said. "We've had our big loss
now and it's up to us to come
back."
Cardinal notes . . . Tight end
Mitch Pleis suffered a shoulder
separation against the Trojans
and will be operated on today.
Darrin Nelson broke the
conference freshman rushing
record set last year by USC's
Charles White. Nelson has
now gained 764 yards on the
ground this season. In the
same game White surpassed
the Pacific-8 sophomore rush
ing record now having gained
1114 yards on 217 carries.
White broke the record of 1034
yards set by Southern Cal's An
thony Davis in 1972.
Saturday's margin of victory
was the greatest ever by USC
over Stanford. The previous
largest margin was a 54-7 drub
bing of the Cards in 1952.
The last time Stanford was
shut out was in last season's
contest with Michigan when
the Wolverines blanked the
Cards 51-0.

Los Angeles — The storm that
poured on the Los Angeles Col
iseum before Saturday's USC-
Stanford football game only
foreshadowed the deluge that
followed as the Trojans
drenched the Cardinals, 49-0.
Running at will against an
overwhelmed Stanford de
fense, USC rushed for five
touchdowns and 453 yards and
moved into a three-team tie for
first place in the scrambled
Pacific-8 Conference race.
USC (4-1 in the Pac-8, 6-3
overall) rebounded from con
secutive losses to Notre Dame
and California to annihilate
Stanford (4-2 in conference, 6-3
overall) and enter a tie with
UCLA and Washington for the
conference lead.
"We knew we were con
fronted with a dramatically
bigger and faster team today,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"At the beginning of the sea
son they were ranked the top
team in the United States and
we were ranked no better than
No. 5 in the conference."
Mellowed Trojans
"This was one of our best
games all around," said
second-year SC coach John
Robinson. "We just have to
learn to relax. We were so up
tight last week and we couldn't
execute.
"We know we have a good
football team and good
players. We have had our prob
lems in the area of defeating
ourselves."
Saturday there was no ques

tion of who was beating whom.
"They beat us," said Stan
ford middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino. "That's the word.
Theybeaf us. We didn't give it
to them.
"They just played SC foot
ball. They blasted up the mid
dle, ran the SC trap up the
middle and the student body
sweep around the ends. And
we just had one of those days
where everything goes
wrong."
Everything.
First of many
Before most of the 65,101
rain-soaked fans had even
taken their seats, USC took the
opening kickoff and drove 67
yards with the initial score
coming on a Rob Hertel pass to
Dan Burns with fourth-and
goal from the 6-yard line.
Hertel faked a handoff to
tailback Lynn Cain and most of
the Card defense went after
Cain who hurtled himself high
over the middle of the line. But
Hertel kept the "ball, rolled to
the right and then lofted a pass
to Burns who was alone in the
end zone.
It was a scene repeated often
that afternoon: an SC player
scoring, the home crowd roar
ing and the crimson-and-gold
clad Trojan band blaring
"Conquest."
Can't get it in
Trailing 14-0 in the second
quarter, the Cards had their
one chance to get back in the
game when an 8-yard pass from
Guy Benjamin to James Lofton
gave Stanford a first down on

the Trojan 5-yard line.
On first down, USC
linebacker Ed Gutierrez skirted
around end untouched and
dropped Benjamin for a 10-
yard loss. A 7-yard hook-up
from Benjamin to Bill Kellar
and a holding penalty against
the Trojans on the following
play gave Stanford third-and
goal from the 1.
Benjamin sent John Finley on
a dive behind left tackle Gor
don King but the Trojans stop
ped the Card fullback for no
gain.
On fourth down, Benjamin
flung a pass to Lofton on the
right side of the end zone. But
the double-teamed Lofton
couldn't grab the pass and the
Trojans took over on their 1.
"We couldn't connect when
it was important, when it was
crucial," Benjamin said.
White washed
The Trojans carried a 21-0
advantage into the locker room
at halftime after Charles White
took a short pass from Hertel
on the Stanford 20, broke three
tackles and crashed into the
end zone with the first of his
three touchdowns against the
Cardinals.
USC continued its field day
unabated in the second half
with White scoring on 14- and
2-yard runs, third-string tail
back Dwight Ford racing 63
yards for a TD and fourth-team
tailback Rod Connors busting 5
yards for the final Trojan tally.
Troy had three runners gain
more than 100 yards Saturday
with White leading the barrage

with 126 yards, followed by
Ford with 124 and fullback
Mosi Tatupu with 101.
Stanford's offense, on the
other hand, continued a pat
tern of inconsistency in the
second stanza.
Lack of continuity
"We were stopping our
selves a lot," said Kellar, who
was the one bright spot in the
Card offense with six recep
tions for 97 yards. "We'd run a
good play but then have a let
down. It was the same story, a
good play then a breakdown,
like a bad pattern or some
thing."
Both coaches seemed sur
prised by Stanford's inability to
score against the Trojans.
"All year we've moved the
ball beautifully," Walsh said.
"Physically they just stopped
us today."
"I'm amazed we shut Stan
ford out," USC's Robinson
said. "Obviously it was not
Stanford's best day. And of
course we made all the inter
ceptions today that we drop
ped last week."
Killing turnovers
In all, the SC defense
hijacked four Benjamin passes,
twice as many as the Stanford
Ail-American has yielded in any
other game this season. And al
though Benjamin hit 19 of 38
passes for 208 yards, it was the
four turnovers that helped
keep Stanford out of the end
zone.
Southern Cal also extin
guished Stanford's other big
offensive weapon — freshman
running back Darrin Nelson.
The Trojans held Nelson to 22
yards on nine carries.
"Southern Cal had their big
loss against Notre Dame and
they came back today," Walsh
said. "We've had our big loss
now and it's up to us to come
back."
