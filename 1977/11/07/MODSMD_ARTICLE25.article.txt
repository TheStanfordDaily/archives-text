Thewomen'svolleyball team
lost in the quarterfinals of the
UCLA Invitational Volleyball
Tournament this weekend
when they dropped two out of
three games to Pepperdine
5-15,15-13 and 10-15. USC cap
tured first place in the tourna
ment by defeating UCLA 15-4,
15-6 in the finals Saturday
night.
After playing each of the
teams in its pool twice, Stan
ford reached the quarterfinals
with a 7-3 record, placing sec
ond behind UCLA in pool I.
Out of the 24 national teams
competing in the tournament
— which included Brigham
Young University, Texas-
Austin, Nebraska, and Michi
gan State — seven of the eight
quarterfinalists were California
teams.
On their way to the quarter
finals, the Cardinals defeated
Michigan State 15-4, 15-4, and
split with Southwest Missouri
12-15, 15-3 Friday night. Satur
day morning Stanford
trounced Arizona 15-4, 15-10,
UC-Riverside 15-13, 15-10; but
then lost to UCLA 12-15, 6-15.
Saturday afternoon Stanford
met Pepperdine in a competi
tive three-game set.
"It was one hell of a set,"
said Stanford coach Art Lam
bert. Though Stanford made a
lot of errors in the first game
and ended up losing 15-5, they
didn't give up. "We came back
and played really well," said
Lambert. "No one over
whelmed us . . . the way they
(Stanford) came back against
Pepperdine showed it's
there," Lambert said.
In the first game against
Pepperdine, Stanford lost 15-5
playing a very inconsistent

game. The team had a tough
time getting going and made a
lot of errors. The Cards came
right back at them in the sec
ond game, however, and pul
led out a tight 15-13 victory
after a struggle.
In the third game of the quar
terfinal match, Stanford beat
itself. The Cards started with a
three point edge, and main
tained that lead until late in the
game. Then numerous service
errors and bad passing plagued
the offense and trouble de
fensing the "dink" spoiled the
Cardinals' chances at the fi
nals.
USC, who defeated Stanford
15-6,15-3,15-3, earlier this sea
son, went on to win the tour
nament easily. "USC has got to
be the favorite in the AIAW
tournament," said Lambert.

playing a very inconsistent

game. The team had a tough
time getting going and made a
lot of errors. The Cards came
right back at them in the sec
ond game, however, and pul

after a struggle.
In the third game of the quar
terfinal match, Stanford beat
itself. The Cards started with a
three point edge, and main
tained that lead until late in the
game. Then numerous service
errors and bad passing plagued
the offense and trouble de
fensing the "dink" spoiled the
Cardinals' chances at the fi
nals.
USC, who defeated Stanford
15-6,15-3,15-3, earlier this sea
son, went on to win the tour
nament easily. "USC has got to
be the favorite in the AIAW
tournament," said Lambert.
