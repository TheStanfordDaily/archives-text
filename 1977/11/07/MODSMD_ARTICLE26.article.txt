# Card offense throttled
## Southern Cal's Robinson; 'I'm amazed we shut Stanford out' 
### David Georgette 
The irresistable force lost its
acceleration and as a result
Stanford was shut out by USC
for the first time since the Tro
jans blanked the Cards 14-0 in
1947.
"They give you the feeling
they'll score whenever they get
the ball," said USC head coach
John Robinson. "I'm amazed
we shut Stanford out."
But last week Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh had said it was
possible that the Card offense
could be stopped by the Tro
jans.
Sure, it was possible, but not
probable. Afterall, no team had
held the Cards to less than 20
points this season.
But Walsh's warning, just
like others he's made this sea

son, turned out to be accurate.
The Cards were limited to 250
net yards, and only 42 of those
came on the ground.
"We were physically stop
ped," Walsh said. "They were
bigger and faster at virtually
every position."
The Trojans' physical
superiority wasn't the only
thing that stopped Stanford —
the Cardinals' own inconsis
tencies did too.
"We were stopping ourse
lves today," said wide receiver
Bill Kellar. "We had surges, but
then we'd have a letdown. We
just couldn't find the right
combination to get into the
end zone."
Stanford's best chance to
score came on its third posses
sion when, aided by a pass in

terference call and three com
pletions by quarterback Guy
Benjamin, the Cards had first
and-goal from the Trojan
5-yard line.
Benjamin was sacked for a
10-yard loss by blitzing Ed
Gutierrez, but then a comple
tion to Kellar, a quarterback
run and another SC penalty
moved the ball to the Trojan 1.
A Stanford touchdown
would have cut the USC advan
tage to 14-7, but the Cards
came up short on a third-down
run and then a fourth-down
pass was incomplete, leaving
Stanford without a score. After
that, the closest the Cards
came to the Trojan goal line
was the USC 23.
"There was a lot of pressure
on the offense after we got be
hind," said James Lofton, the
Pacific-B's leading receiver,
who was held to two recep
tions. "We couldn't keep it to
gether. We'd have a few good
plays but then we'd break
down."
The defensive strategy USC
used didn't catch the Cards
unprepared. "They played bas
ically what we thought they
would," said Lofton.
"There were certain plays we
thought we'd go for," said Kel
lar. "They let us run our routes,
but they prevented us from
catching the ball in the mid
dle."
For the most part, the offen
sive line gave Benjamin the
needed time to throw, but the
Trojan pass defenders were
almost always near the pass re
ceivers.
"They had good coverage
and we didn't make good deci
sions at times," said Walsh.
"We were trying to make the
big play because we had to
have some."
Benjamin called the offen
sive problems "ineptitude on
our part in crucial situations."
For instance, on two occa
sions where Gutierrez sacked
Benjamin on the blitz, the Stan
ford quarterback said he called
the wrong formation. In the
third quarter, the Cards had a
drive blunted on an offensive
pass interference call. The next
time Stanford got the ball, a
30-yard drive ended when a
pass went off halfback Darrin
Nelson's hands and was inter
cepted.
On the first Stanford play of
the game, it was evident that
USC was paying a lot of atten
tion to Nelson. A pass to the
flat was incomplete but the
Trojan defender gave Nelson a
good hit anyways.
"I tried to release on pass
patterns," said Nelson, "but
someone was always on me."
His longest gain of the day
came on a run of 12 yards.
But what if the Cards had
scored from the 1-yard line in
the second quarter? Would
that have made a difference in
the outcome?
Walsh said, "Sure it was dis
appointing not to score, but
49-7 wouldn't have made that
much difference to me."

third quarter, the Cards had a
drive blunted on an offensive
pass interference call. The next
time Stanford got the ball, a
30-yard drive ended when a
pass went off halfback Darrin
Nelson's hands and was inter
cepted.
On the first Stanford play of
the game, it was evident that
USC was paying a lot of atten
tion to Nelson. A pass to the
flat was incomplete but the
Trojan defender gave Nelson a
good hit anyways.
"I tried to release on pass
patterns," said Nelson, "but
someone was always on me."
His longest gain of the day
came on a run of 12 yards.
But what if the Cards had
scored from the 1-yard line in
the second quarter? Would
that have made a difference in
the outcome?
Walsh said, "Sure it was dis
appointing not to score, but
49-7 wouldn't have made that
much difference to me."

Trojan cornerback Ricky Odom pirates a Guy Benjamin pass to Ken
(28) in the fourth quarter of USC's 49-0 route of Stanford.
The interception, with 2:22 left in the game, was the fourth Benjamin
pass hijacked by the Trojans.
The irresistable force lost its
acceleration and as a result
Stanford was shut out by USC
for the first time since the Tro
jans blanked the Cards 14-0 in
1947.
"They give you the feeling
they'll score whenever they get
the ball," said USC head coach
John Robinson. "I'm amazed
we shut Stanford out."
But last week Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh had said it was
possible that the Card offense
could be stopped by the Tro
jans.
Sure, it was possible, but not
probable. Afterall, no team had
held the Cards to less than 20
points this season.
But Walsh's warning, just
like others he's made this sea

son, turned out to be accurate.
The Cards were limited to 250
net yards, and only 42 of those
came on the ground.
"We were physically stop
ped," Walsh said. "They were
bigger and faster at virtually
every position."
The Trojans' physical
superiority wasn't the only
thing that stopped Stanford —
the Cardinals' own inconsis
tencies did too.
"We were stopping ourse
lves today," said wide receiver
Bill Kellar. "We had surges, but
then we'd have a letdown. We
just couldn't find the right
combination to get into the
end zone."
Stanford's best chance to
score came on its third posses
sion when, aided by a pass in

terference call and three com
pletions by quarterback Guy
Benjamin, the Cards had first
and-goal from the Trojan
5-yard line.
Benjamin was sacked for a
10-yard loss by blitzing Ed
Gutierrez, but then a comple
tion to Kellar, a quarterback
run and another SC penalty
moved the ball to the Trojan 1.
A Stanford touchdown
would have cut the USC advan
tage to 14-7, but the Cards
came up short on a third-down
run and then a fourth-down
pass was incomplete, leaving
Stanford without a score. After
that, the closest the Cards
came to the Trojan goal line
was the USC 23.
"There was a lot of pressure
on the offense after we got be
hind," said James Lofton, the
Pacific-B's leading receiver,
who was held to two recep
tions. "We couldn't keep it to
gether. We'd have a few good
plays but then we'd break
down."
The defensive strategy USC
used didn't catch the Cards
unprepared. "They played bas
ically what we thought they
would," said Lofton.
"There were certain plays we
thought we'd go for," said Kel
lar. "They let us run our routes,
but they prevented us from
catching the ball in the mid
dle."
For the most part, the offen
sive line gave Benjamin the
needed time to throw, but the
Trojan pass defenders were
almost always near the pass re
ceivers.
"They had good coverage
and we didn't make good deci
sions at times," said Walsh.
"We were trying to make the
big play because we had to
have some."
Benjamin called the offen
sive problems "ineptitude on
our part in crucial situations."
For instance, on two occa
sions where Gutierrez sacked
Benjamin on the blitz, the Stan
ford quarterback said he called
the wrong formation. In the
third quarter, the Cards had a
drive blunted on an offensive
pass interference call. The next
time Stanford got the ball, a
30-yard drive ended when a
pass went off halfback Darrin

hind," said James Lofton, the
Pacific-B's leading receiver,
who was held to two recep
tions. "We couldn't keep it to
gether. We'd have a few good
plays but then we'd break
down."
The defensive strategy USC
used didn't catch the Cards
unprepared. "They played bas
ically what we thought they
would," said Lofton.
"There were certain plays we
thought we'd go for," said Kel
lar. "They let us run our routes,
but they prevented us from
catching the ball in the mid
dle."
For the most part, the offen
sive line gave Benjamin the
needed time to throw, but the
Trojan pass defenders were
almost always near the pass re
ceivers.
"They had good coverage
and we didn't make good deci
sions at times," said Walsh.
"We were trying to make the
big play because we had to
have some."
Benjamin called the offen
sive problems "ineptitude on
our part in crucial situations."
For instance, on two occa
sions where Gutierrez sacked
Benjamin on the blitz, the Stan
ford quarterback said he called
the wrong formation. In the
third quarter, the Cards had a
drive blunted on an offensive
pass interference call. The next
time Stanford got the ball, a
30-yard drive ended when a
pass went off halfback Darrin
Nelson's hands and was inter
cepted.
On the first Stanford play of
the game, it was evident that
USC was paying a lot of atten
tion to Nelson. A pass to the
flat was incomplete but the
Trojan defender gave Nelson a
good hit anyways.
"I tried to release on pass
patterns," said Nelson, "but
someone was always on me."
His longest gain of the day
came on a run of 12 yards.
But what if the Cards had
scored from the 1-yard line in
the second quarter? Would
that have made a difference in
the outcome?
Walsh said, "Sure it was dis
appointing not to score, but
49-7 wouldn't have made that
much difference to me."

(28) in the fourth quarter of USC's 49-0 route of Stanford.
The interception, with 2:22 left in the game, was the fourth Benjamin
pass hijacked by the Trojans.
