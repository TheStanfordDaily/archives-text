The Pacific-8 Conference provides its football champion
as its representative in the Rose Bowl. If a tie for the champ
ionship occurs, all tied teams are declared conference
champions, and the following procedures determine the
Pac-8 representative in the Rose Bowl.
a. If one champion has defeated the other champion(s),
that victorious team shall be the Rose Bowl representative.
b. If one champion has not defeated the other champ-
the team with the best overall season percentage will
be the representative.
c. If one champion has not defeated the other champ-
and the teams have identical overall season percen
tages, the team which has not appeared in the Rose Bowl
for the longest period of time will be the representative.
For Stanford to qualify as the Pac-8 representative in the
Rose Bowl, the following would have to occur: Washington
defeats USC this Saturday, Stanford beats California in the
Big Game and Washington State upsets Washington on
Nov. 19 and USC defeats UCLA on Nov. 25.
