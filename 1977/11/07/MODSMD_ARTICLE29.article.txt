# Cards crush UCLA, USC
## Poloists secure berth in nationals 
### Brad Brockbank 
The Stanford water polo
team assured itself of a berth in
the NCAA championships this
year by trouncing UCLA, 15-6,
Friday at UCLA and following
up with a 14-5 drowning of USC
Saturday morning at the Tro
jans' pool.
The victories clinched at
least a second-place finish in
the Pacific-8 for the Cardinals,
which qualifies them for the
post-season championships
held in Providence, R.I.
Stanford coach Dante De
ttamanti, who said he went into
Friday's game a little scared,
exclaimed that he was as sur
prised as anyone else hy the
Bruins' poor showing, particu
larly after UCLA had taken
California into overtime just
two weeks before.
"I think what happened was
that (Stanford junior) Doug

Burke scored an early shot that
surprised their goalie and he
let down a little," Dettamanti
said. "After that happened, ev
erything started going in."
The Cards led the game from
that first minute and by
halftime had amassed a 10-0
advantage. During the third
quarter, Dettamanti pulled his
starters, letting his second
string finish the game.
Burke and junior Robby Ar
nold each scored three goals to
lead the team. In addition, Ar
nold also had four steals and
one assist.
As Stanford expected,
Saturday's game was a rough
one. Before the final gun, three
Tro/an players had left the
game because of fouls. The
Cards lost only Burke to kick
outs and, unlike USC, main
tained emotional control dur
ing the contest.

"The difference was that
they wanted to fight and we
wanted to play water polo,"
said senior Rick Johannsen.
"USC has a lot of potential
but they're just a gross team,"
junior Tom Angelo saidV'They
could be a very good team but
they'll never get anywhere if
they keep playing the way they
do now."
In the middle of the melee,
Arnold paced the Cards with
five goals. He also continued
his strong all-around play by
recording a steal and two as
sists.
Though Dettamanti was
complimentary of Arnold's
achievements, he was espe
cially impressed by the per
formance of the team as a
whole.
"It was a total team effort,"
the coach said. "Everything
was working and every guy out
there was doing his job."

Perhaps the brightest point
of the weekend was the play of
senior Marty Davis. His six
goals and five assists in the two
games marked the return ot
the Cardinal captain's offen
sive abilities.
"I've been in a shooting
slump tor most ot this year but
my arm is coming around
now," Davis said. "My arm is
really feeling good so I should
be able to shoot stronger and
quicker for the rest of the sea
son."
The Cardinal poloists have
three more games before the
NCAAs. Friday, they travel to
play Santa Barbara, then return
home to face San Jose State
Saturday. One week later, the
California Bears invade de-
Cuerre for the water polo Big
Came. The winner will fly to
Providence as the No. 1-ranked
team in the nation.
