# Burke speaks for individual initiative

To solve the unemployment prob
lem, "a coalition of individuals with
initiative is needed," U.S. Rep.
Yvonne Burke (D-Los Angeles) told
the annual meeting of the Stanford
Midpeninsula Urban Coalition Friday
night at the Cabana Hyatt House.
People have to say to themselves,
"We will not tolerate five per cent
unemployment," urged Burke. The
federal administration presently is
occupied with what have been called
the great problems â€” energy,
Panama, and human rights. But the
"problems of the economy are the
most elusive to deal with," she said.
In strong support of the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, Burke cal
led for full employment and ba
lanced growth of the economy. She
asserted that this could be achieved
through direct tax incentives to the
production of jobs.
She said a federal policy must be
drafted to produce more jobs in the
private sector and to help stop indus
tries from relocating in the suburbs
and the sun-belt states. Aid of minor
ity business must be an essential part
of the government's action.

Burke told the audience of over
200 people that the unemployment
rate for blacks is still increasing.
The publicity of the Bakke case and
the widespread use of the term "re
verse discrimination" is tending to
expand a regressive attitude, accord
ing to Burke, "because it implies that
a preference is given to women and
minorities in the job market."
In reality, though, the distribution
of jobs is terribly uneven and
minorities occupy the lowest jobs
throughout the job structure, she
said.
Burke said she thought a similar
attitude has become common in the
academic community as well, saying
students who are rejected from in
stitutions now feel it was due to pre
ferential admissions of minorities
and women.
She called the situation "the great
tragedy of our times."
Burke's speech came two weeks
after her announcement of her can
didacy for the office of state attorney
general. In that office, she said, she
feels she could have more effect in
government and be able to utilize
her law background.
