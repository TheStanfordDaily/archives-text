Kentfield — The Stanford
soccer team lost to two-time
NCAA defending champion
USF 4-0 yesterday at the Col
lege of Marin.
The loss, the first in 10 games
for the Cardinals, dropped
their season record to 9-7-2.
The score was not represen
tative of the whole match, as
Stanford trailed by only one
goal for almost a full hour. The
Card defensive play deserves
credit for holding the Dons to a
single first-period goal.
Both teams were hampered
by gusty winds and a terrible
playing surface throughout the
game.
Down 1-0 at the half on a goal
by USF's Tony Gray, Stanford
held its own until Brendon
FJennessey dribbled at the
Card goal and got off a shot
which rolled on the ground in
front of goalkeeper Craig Ue
land and then hit a rough spot
in the turf, sending the ball two
feet up in the air and into the
net.
The break hurt the Cards

psychologically, and they were
slow in recovering.
Twenty-eight seconds after
the second San Francisco
score, the Dons were again
knocking on the door of the
shell-shocked Cards. John
Anton assisted Alex Mwosu to
give the home team a 3-0 lead.
Stanford threatened several
times on corner kicks, sideline
passes and breakaways, but
was unable to put the ball in
the net. The Cards shut out San
Francisco for the next half an
hour before Dag Olavsen
scored an unassisted goal with
Vh minutes remaining in the
game.
USF coach Steve Nogoesco
showed respect for Stanford's
program. "Stantord played a
pretty good game — we
learned a lesson from last year
when we were tied 4-4 and
played cautious," he said.
The Cards fly to San Diego
Friday for their last two games
of the season, facing UC-San
Diego at 7:30 p.m. Friday and
US-International at 2 p.m.
Saturday.
