# Scotchers tie UC-Davis
## 
### 
In its final preparation game
before this weekend's regional
qualifying tournament, the
Stanford field hockey team
played to a 2-2 tie against UC-
Davis Friday at Davis.
"We've done the same thing
repeatedly in the past," said
seniorMandy Read. "We playa
team that we should easily beat
and enter.the game with a
casual air about the whole
thing. We're there physically,
but not mentally."
The tie gives the Cardinal

scotchers a 9-2-2 record for the
season and a 3-2-1 conference
mark. The important record,
however, is the one the Cards
produce in this weekend's reg
ional competition at Cal Poly-
Pomona.
Stanford plays Friday and
Saturday in Pomona, vying for
the berth in the nationals that
goes to the winner of the reg
ional tournament.
"We proved to ourselves last
weekend (when Stanford won
two games and tied one) that
we can win the regionals,"
Read said.
But Stanford's play will have
to be improved over Friday's
showing if the Cards are to
earn a spot in the AIAW nation
als in Denver Nov. 23-26.
Davis tallied first against the
Cards but junior forward
Read knotted the score with a
first-half goal. Jesse Cerrard
gave Stanford the go-ahead
with a goal in the second half
but with time dwindling away
the host Aggies scored again to
even the score at 2-all.
Despite the balanced score,
the Cards led in penetration
time with 13 minutes inside of
the Aggies' 25-yard line while
Davis had three minutes of
penetration time.
Stanford's junior varsity, dis
regarding the tempo set by the

varsity, dominated Davis in a
3-0 victory. The fired-up JVs
controlled the Aggies
throughout the contest.
Connie Wright, Christi
Johnson and Liz Maxwell
supplied Stanford with its scor
ing output, each netting a goal.
The JVs return toaction Nov. 18
and 19 in the Nor-Cal Invita
tional Tournament in Sac
ramento.
