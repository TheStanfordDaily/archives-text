37 die in Georgia dam break
Toccoa, Ca. — At least 37 persons, most of
them students and their families asleep at a
small Bible college, died early yesterday when
an earthen dam burst and sent a 30-foot wall of
water smashing through the college campus.
The breakup of the dam at about 1:30 a.m.
sent tons of water over 186-foot-high Toccoa
Falls onto the lower campus of Toccoa Falls
Bible College, where some 250 people lived in
dormitories, houses and mobile homes at the
foot of the falls.
Authorities said two persons still were mis
sing Sunday night. More than 40 had been
injured.
Rosalynn Carter, who was informed of the
Georgia disaster when she and President
Jimmy Carter attended church services in
Washington, flew by government jet and
helicopter to Toccoa.
Gov. George Busbee said he sent a telegram
to Carter Sunday night asking that Toccoa and
surrounding Stephens County be formally de
clared a major disaster area because of damage
to private and public property and expected
expenses of cleaning up and rebuilding.
The breakup of the dam came after two days
of torrential rains and Busbee said the forecast
for the Toccoa area and most of north Georgia
was for more rain Sunday night. He also said
that "every dam in north Georgia is being mon
itored tonight by the federal Soil Conservation
Service."
The dam was among 84 in Georgia that had
been classified "highly hazardous" by the
Army Corps of Engineers, and Busbee said the
state would begin monitoring the other 83 "as
of this moment" because of the heavy rainfall.
He said the state would investigate the dam
break, but "this is no time to start blaming
anyone."
Two convicted in Bolles case
Phoenix, Ariz. — Plumber )ames Robison and
contractor Max Dunlap were convicted yes
terday of first-degree murder and conspiracy
in the bomb-slaying of investigative reporter
Don Bolles, and the prosecution said it would
pursue "several others" in the case.
The defendants also were convicted of con
spiracy for plotting to murder state Attorney
General Bruce Babbitt and Al Lizanetz, a

former advertising man. They could be sen
tenced to death in the gas chamber.
Sentencing was set for Dec. 6. At a news
conference after the verdict, Babbitt said the
prosecution would press for the death penalty
because the murder was "heinous, cruel and
depraved."
Defense lawyers said they would appeal.
The special prosecutor, Assistant Attorney
General William Schafer, said the case is not
closed.
"We don't have all the conspirators, but we
will," he said.
"Two more went down yesterday," Babbitt
said. He said "several others" were in on the
plot but declined to name them. "The murder
file remains open," he said.
Detective jon Fellers, the Phoenix police
department's chief investigator of the murder,
said, "We've got some new information as a
result of the trial" that "gives us more avenues
of investigation leading toward more con
spirators."
Palestine for Arabs: Arafat
Sidon, Lebanon — Palestinian leader Yasir
Arafat declared yesterday that peace will re
turn to the Middle East "when Palestine be
comes Arab again, this is the only thing that
can bring peace."
He also vowed that his guerrilla forces will
not withdraw from southern Lebanon, where
they are allied with left-wing Lebanese Mos
lems against rightist Lebanese Christians.
"We cannot, we will not withdraw one step
from the south," Arafat said "Even a single
step of withdrawal will be over our dead
bodies and blood."
He made the statements in an emotional
speech to a graduating parade of Palestinian
army officers at the Ein el Hilweh refugee camp
on the outskirts of Sidon.
In Israel, two Israeli civilians were killed yes
terday when rockets fired from southern
Lebanon hit the coastal town of Nahariya, an
army spokesman said. Nahariya, a popular
Mediterranean resort, is about eight miles
south of the Israeli-Lebanese frontier.
Earlier reports had said two persons were
wounded in the attack.
An Israeli army spokesman also reported
that an Israeli patrol boat shot at and sank a
fishing boat with three persons aboard that

approached the frontier town of Rosh Haniqra.
The fate of the boat's three occupants was not
given.
Israelis release archbishop
Rome — Israel freed Creek Catholic Ar
chbishop Hilarion Capudji from prison and
deported him to Italy yesterday following a
plea by Pope Paul VI for release of the con
victed weapons smuggler.
He had served nearly three years of a 12-year
sentence after being convicted of running
weapons, explosives and ammunition across
the Lebanese border in his limousine to Pales
tinian guerrillas in Israel.
Apparently weak from hunger strikes staged
to protest his imprisonment, Capudji was
helped aboard an Alitalia jumbo jet by two
Israeli security agents who had accompanied
him from Tel Aviv's Ramleh Prison in a police
car.
The archbishop was met at Rome's Leonardo
da Vinci Airport by a Palestine Liberation Or
ganization delegation and Shafiq al Hut, a rep
resentative sent by PLO chief Yasir Arafat.
Capudji, who declined to talk to reporters,
drove from the airport with Patriach Hakim.
Church sources said the prelate will spend
about three months in a Rome clinic recuperat
ing from his imprisonment.
Girl survives fall from bridge
San Francisco — A young girl who leaped
from the Golden Gate Bridge and lived, joining
only 10 others who have plunged and survived
falls from America's favorite suicide spot, was
in stable condition yesterday.
A spokesman for the Army's Letterman Gen
eral Hospital identified the 17-year-old girl as
Kathy Schoenstein of San Francisco, suffering
unspecified internal injuries and a fracture.
She underwent surgery Saturday night.
In the 40 years since the suspension bridge
opened between San Francisco and Marin
County, the beautiful span, like a wicked
lorelei luring souls to their destruction, has
claimed 630 lives.
The hospital source said that although
Schoenstein was not considered in serious
condition, she was under constant observa
tion in the hospital's intensive care unit. She

was visited there by her father, he said.
Aero Mexico workers strike
Mexico City — The government-owned air
line Aero Mexico suspended all flights Sunday
after groundworkers demanding higher wages
went on strike.
A Mexico City airport spokesman said the
airport was calm. It was not known how many
passengers were stranded, but some would-be
travelers aware of the planned strike had can
celed their trips.
Service to Mexico by four other airlines —
Eastern, Nicaraguan, Pan American and Varig
— already was shut down by striking
groundworkers.
Flights to and from the United States con
tinued on Braniff, American, Western and
Texas International airlines. A spokesman for
Braniff in New York said flights from Mexico
City were heavily booked but there was no
plan to add extra flights.

average of 15,000 passengers to 30 cities in
Mexico and to New York, Miami, Los Angeles,
