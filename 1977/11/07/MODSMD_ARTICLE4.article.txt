# Two states elect governors tomorrow

Voters in Virginia and New Jersey will elect gov
ernors tomorrow, while 35 cities with populations
over 100,000 choose mayors, in elections that have
focused on the need for jobs, crime control and
more federal money.
Major cities holding mayoral elections include
New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Seattle, Min
neapolis, Buffalo, Pittsburgh and Houston.
The main question in New Jersey is whether
incumbent Democrat Brendan Byrne can win a
second term after pushing through the state's first
income tax. Polls show him running neck-to-neck
with state Sen. Raymond Bateman, a Republican.
Rebate votes
Bryne, 53, may have been helped by the prop
erty tax rebates that were mailed to homeowners
in the two weeks prior to the election, as they were
before the June primary.
Bateman, 50, sold his public relations firm to
enter the race. He is trying to capitalize on an

easy-going style that contrasts with Byrne's some
what stodgy demeanor.
President Jimmy Carter has campaigned for
Byrne, and former President Gerald Ford, who
carried New Jersey last year, was in the state for
Bateman.
Carter campaign
Carter also has campaigned in Virginia for
Democrat Henry Howell in what has been perhaps
the costliest and most bitterly contested race of
modern times in that state.
The most recent polls give Republican Jt>hn Dal
ton a slight lead, but the outcome is still rated a
tossup.
Howell, 57, was defeated for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination in 1969. Both candidates
have served in the Virginia House and Senate.
Dalton succeeded Howell as lieutenant governor
in 1973.
Also at stake in Virginia are the offices of

lieutenant governor and attorney general. Demo
crat Charles "Chuck" Robb, son-in-law of the late
president Lyndon ]ohnson, is favored for lieuten
ant governor over Republican state Sen. Joe
Canada Jr.
The gubernatorial winner succeeds Mills God
win, Virginia's only two-term governor in this cen
tury.
In New York City, Democrat Edward Koch, a
five-term congressman who has been 15 to 24
points ahead in the opinion polls, is seeking to go
into office "with a mandate" to keep the city, with
its $14 billion budget deficit, from going bankrupt.
Koch edged Abraham Beame, the one-term in
cumbent, in the September primary in which U.S.
Rep. Bella Abzug also was defeated.
Facing Koch tomorrow are Liberal party candi
date Mario Cuomo and Republican Roy Goodman,
a state senator from Manhattan's East Side "Silk
Stocking" district.
