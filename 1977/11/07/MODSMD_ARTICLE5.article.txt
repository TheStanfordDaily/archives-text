# LOTS terminal access major problem
## 
### Randy David 
Terminal access is a big problem for LOTS
(Low Overhead Time Sharing), the University's
free interactive computing system, according
to LOTS Manager Ralph Corin.
A survey of LOTS users showed that students
must wait up to three hours to use the compu
ter during peak operating times.
One reason for the long wait is the delay in
the installation of 32 new terminals in the Ter
man engineering building. There are currently
48 terminals on campus with 4l in the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford building.
Gorin said he had hoped the terminals would
be installed before the beginning of this quar
ter. Because of the delay, it will be "well into
November" before they are installed.
The delay in installation of the terminals is
due to a delay in the delivery of a special piece
of hardware used to plug the terminals into the
computer, Corin said.
"The hardware took longer to design and
build than expected," Corin said.
Aim for completion
"We are aiming for Terman this quarter to
ease the crunch at the end of the quarter. We
are committed to satisfying the needs of the
Engineering department," Gorin said.
There is no guarantee that the addition of
new terminals will alleviate the problem of ter
minal access. Prof. John McCarthy, director of
LOTS, said, "I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that the new terminals will help."
Another reason for the terminal access prob
lem is that almost all classes that use computers
are using LOTS, McCarthy said. Many of the

classes that formerly used SCIP (Stanford
Center for Information Processing), the Uni
versity's main computer, are now using LOTS.
LOTS easier
Using LOTS is much more convenient than
using SCIP, Prof. Robert Floyd, chairman of the
Computer Science Department, said. "Making
corrections in large programs is much easier."
A printout of completed assignments is not
necessary because assignments can be put in
memory and checked on the computer by the
instructor.
Most of the classes using LOTS are from the
Computer Science and Engineering Depart
ments, although many classes from the educa
tion and science departments make use of the
facility.
however, Floyd said, it is more efficient to
use SCIP if LOTS cannot meet the load of the
students. Enrollment in introductory computer
science courses was limited severely this quar
ter "to play it safe." Only half of those who
signed theclass lists were admitted, Floyd said.
No user priorities
Currently there are no efforts being made to
give priority to students using the computer for
course work, Corin said. "We are thinking of a
variety of resource allocation schemes . . . but
we would prefer not to use them."
Activities such as playing games on the com
puter are discriminated against when others are
waiting to use the computer, Corin said.
The peak time for computer use is the 16-
hour period beginning at 9 a.m. "If you want to
be sure to get a terminal, come in at 7 or 8 in the
morning," Gorin said.

LOTS, open to all Stanford students and fa
cujty, has many uses beyond course-related
work.
Free time
Cathy Marshall, a graduate student and
teaching assistant in psychology, uses LOTS to
prepare material for her class, edit papers, and
to work on data for her own research. Many
other students also use the computer for un
sponsored research, since computer time is
free.
As an undergraduate, Marshall said she took
one introductory computer science course.
She said she has taught herself many different
computer languages on the LOTS system.
John Fitzgerald, a freshman, said he uses the
computer to do optional work assigned in one
of his classes. He said he does the optional
work because it's "fun." He also said he enjoys
playing monopoly on the computer.
In another year, LOTS is intending to sell
about 50 of their terminals, McCarthy said.
"They will be going for around $300. The termi
nals won't be obsolete by then, but we like a
shiny new system," McCarthy said.
The LOTS computer facility, opened last
January, is funded by an allocation from the
provost's funds for academic computing, Gorin
said. This money was formerly distributed to
departments. Academic computing is defined
as computer use directed by course work or
unsponsored research.
The initial investment was $440,000 for the
computer plus another $235,000 to set up the
facility. LOTS is allocated about $270,000 »year,
Gorin said.

access have been common at CERAS due to a delay in the location of
additional terminals in the new Terman engineering center.

nals won't be obsolete by then, but we like a
shiny new system," McCarthy said.
The LOTS computer facility, opened last
January, is funded by an allocation from the
provost's funds for academic computing, Gorin
said. This money was formerly distributed to
departments. Academic computing is defined
as computer use directed by course work or
unsponsored research.
The initial investment was $440,000 for the
computer plus another $235,000 to set up the
facility. LOTS is allocated about $270,000 »year,
Gorin said.

These students are using the LOTS terminals located in the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford (CER AS). Up to three hour waits for LOTS
access have been common at CERAS due to a delay in the location of
additional terminals in the new Terman engineering center.
Terminal access is a big problem for LOTS
(Low Overhead Time Sharing), the University's
free interactive computing system, according
to LOTS Manager Ralph Corin.
A survey of LOTS users showed that students
must wait up to three hours to use the compu
ter during peak operating times.
One reason for the long wait is the delay in
the installation of 32 new terminals in the Ter
man engineering building. There are currently
48 terminals on campus with 4l in the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford building.
Gorin said he had hoped the terminals would
be installed before the beginning of this quar
ter. Because of the delay, it will be "well into
November" before they are installed.
The delay in installation of the terminals is
due to a delay in the delivery of a special piece
of hardware used to plug the terminals into the
computer, Corin said.
"The hardware took longer to design and
build than expected," Corin said.
Aim for completion
"We are aiming for Terman this quarter to
ease the crunch at the end of the quarter. We
are committed to satisfying the needs of the
Engineering department," Gorin said.
There is no guarantee that the addition of
new terminals will alleviate the problem of ter
minal access. Prof. John McCarthy, director of
LOTS, said, "I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that the new terminals will help."
Another reason for the terminal access prob
lem is that almost all classes that use computers
are using LOTS, McCarthy said. Many of the

classes that formerly used SCIP (Stanford
Center for Information Processing), the Uni
versity's main computer, are now using LOTS.
LOTS easier
Using LOTS is much more convenient than
using SCIP, Prof. Robert Floyd, chairman of the
Computer Science Department, said. "Making
corrections in large programs is much easier."
A printout of completed assignments is not
necessary because assignments can be put in
memory and checked on the computer by the
instructor.
Most of the classes using LOTS are from the
Computer Science and Engineering Depart
ments, although many classes from the educa
tion and science departments make use of the
facility.
however, Floyd said, it is more efficient to
use SCIP if LOTS cannot meet the load of the
students. Enrollment in introductory computer
science courses was limited severely this quar
ter "to play it safe." Only half of those who
signed theclass lists were admitted, Floyd said.
No user priorities
Currently there are no efforts being made to
give priority to students using the computer for
course work, Corin said. "We are thinking of a
variety of resource allocation schemes . . . but
we would prefer not to use them."
Activities such as playing games on the com
puter are discriminated against when others are
waiting to use the computer, Corin said.
The peak time for computer use is the 16-
hour period beginning at 9 a.m. "If you want to
be sure to get a terminal, come in at 7 or 8 in the
morning," Gorin said.

LOTS, open to all Stanford students and fa
cujty, has many uses beyond course-related
work.
Free time
Cathy Marshall, a graduate student and
teaching assistant in psychology, uses LOTS to
prepare material for her class, edit papers, and
to work on data for her own research. Many
other students also use the computer for un
sponsored research, since computer time is
free.
As an undergraduate, Marshall said she took
one introductory computer science course.
She said she has taught herself many different
computer languages on the LOTS system.
John Fitzgerald, a freshman, said he uses the
computer to do optional work assigned in one
of his classes. He said he does the optional
work because it's "fun." He also said he enjoys
playing monopoly on the computer.
In another year, LOTS is intending to sell
about 50 of their terminals, McCarthy said.

nals won't be obsolete by then, but we like a

cujty, has many uses beyond course-related
work.
Free time
Cathy Marshall, a graduate student and
teaching assistant in psychology, uses LOTS to
prepare material for her class, edit papers, and
to work on data for her own research. Many
other students also use the computer for un
sponsored research, since computer time is
free.
As an undergraduate, Marshall said she took
one introductory computer science course.
She said she has taught herself many different
computer languages on the LOTS system.
John Fitzgerald, a freshman, said he uses the
computer to do optional work assigned in one
of his classes. He said he does the optional
work because it's "fun." He also said he enjoys
playing monopoly on the computer.
In another year, LOTS is intending to sell
about 50 of their terminals, McCarthy said.
"They will be going for around $300. The termi
nals won't be obsolete by then, but we like a
shiny new system," McCarthy said.
The LOTS computer facility, opened last
January, is funded by an allocation from the
provost's funds for academic computing, Gorin
said. This money was formerly distributed to
departments. Academic computing is defined
as computer use directed by course work or
unsponsored research.
The initial investment was $440,000 for the
computer plus another $235,000 to set up the
facility. LOTS is allocated about $270,000 »year,
Gorin said.

These students are using the LOTS terminals located in the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford (CER AS). Up to three hour waits for LOTS
access have been common at CERAS due to a delay in the location of
additional terminals in the new Terman engineering center.
