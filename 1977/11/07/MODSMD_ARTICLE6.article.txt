Today the Board of Trustees' Committee on
Investments will meet, and tomorrow the en
tire board will meet. Among other items, the
trustees will hear a report on the consequ
ences of Stanford divesting itself of all its stock
in U.S. corporations which do business in
South Africa.
The trustees have received the recommen
dation of Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy that, because of the
grave effects such divestment will have on the
University, the trustees not sell their shares of
stock in these corporations.
The University's report on possible divest
ment wasn't surprising, and it acknowledges
the hard fiscal realities of managing a major
university. We agree that the trustees should
not divest these stocks, but see reasons in
addition to the financial havoc which divest
ment would wreak on the University.
Our major argument against divestment is
that such action will deny the University the
opportunity to take an activist role in improv
ing conditions within the Republic of South
Africa.
If Stanford were to divest itself of all stock in
these corporations, then it would leave the
fate of South Africans in the hands of their
government and several U.S. corporations.
Indeed, by keeping its stock, Stanford now
has a moral responsibility to be an aggressive
leader in improving conditions of South Afri
cans through these corporations, of which
Stanford is a part owner.
The protests here last spring involved Stan
ford's voting on proxy resolutions which
other stockholders put forward. We said then
and we reiterate now that the trustees must
put forth their own proxy resolutions which
would compel corporations to bring their
South African policies in line with the equal
employment opportunity polices which they
— and Stanford — practice in the United
States. Certainly it can not be detrimental to
Stanford for it to request that others follow the
same policies of racial equality to which Stan
ford is unequivocally committed.
Such proxy resolutions should be pre
sented to as many corporations as possible,
and particularly to the leading corporations in

each industry. Action on the part of trustees
could well lead these corporations to create
real equal opportunity programs in South Af
rica.
These resolutions, and the programs which
they will create, will lead to one of the results
which various people favor. Either the South
Arican government will consider these prog
rams illegal and throw out these corporations
— which some want — or (he government will
acquiesce and the corporations will be able to
significantly improve the black South
Africans — which even more people would
like to see happen.
Such results can only occur it corporations
make the effort to upgrade their equal oppor
tunity programs, and corporations will only
make such efforts if major stockholders such
as Stanford actively campaign for such
policies, through methods including proxy
resolutions.
The trustees have committed themselves,
by their continued investment, to assisting
corporations in improving their South African
policies. We note that some universities, in
cluding the University of California, have de
cided not to divest their stock in corporations
doing business in South Africa. Yet these uni
versities and Stanford cannot shirk moral ob
ligations by citing financial considerations and
then letting the matter drop. The problems in
South Africa will not disappear, and our trus
tees can not sit still, claiming they are power
less, and watch what is happening every day in
South Africa.
Just as the trustees must take an active role
in this matter, so should students continue to
express their views and work toward having
the trustees take action.
We believe the South Africa investment
issue can be a means of unifying, rather than
dividing, the University. All members of the
University can and should use their talents in
improving the lives of the South African
people — something tremendously more im
portant than confrontations in San Francisco
or Palo Alto.
We hope that South Africa will be the be
ginning and not the end of discussion and
cooperation toward creating an investment
policy of which this University can be proud.

States. Certainly it can not be detrimental to
Stanford for it to request that others follow the
same policies of racial equality to which Stan
ford is unequivocally committed.
Such proxy resolutions should be pre
sented to as many corporations as possible,
and particularly to the leading corporations in

each industry. Action on the part of trustees
could well lead these corporations to create
real equal opportunity programs in South Af
rica.
These resolutions, and the programs which
they will create, will lead to one of the results
which various people favor. Either the South
Arican government will consider these prog
rams illegal and throw out these corporations
— which some want — or (he government will
acquiesce and the corporations will be able to
significantly improve the black South
Africans — which even more people would
like to see happen.
Such results can only occur it corporations
make the effort to upgrade their equal oppor
tunity programs, and corporations will only
make such efforts if major stockholders such
as Stanford actively campaign for such
policies, through methods including proxy
resolutions.
The trustees have committed themselves,
by their continued investment, to assisting
corporations in improving their South African
policies. We note that some universities, in
cluding the University of California, have de
cided not to divest their stock in corporations
doing business in South Africa. Yet these uni
versities and Stanford cannot shirk moral ob
ligations by citing financial considerations and
then letting the matter drop. The problems in
South Africa will not disappear, and our trus
tees can not sit still, claiming they are power
less, and watch what is happening every day in
South Africa.
Just as the trustees must take an active role
in this matter, so should students continue to
express their views and work toward having
the trustees take action.
We believe the South Africa investment
issue can be a means of unifying, rather than
dividing, the University. All members of the
University can and should use their talents in
improving the lives of the South African
people — something tremendously more im
portant than confrontations in San Francisco
or Palo Alto.
We hope that South Africa will be the be
ginning and not the end of discussion and
cooperation toward creating an investment
policy of which this University can be proud.
Today the Board of Trustees' Committee on
Investments will meet, and tomorrow the en
tire board will meet. Among other items, the
trustees will hear a report on the consequ
ences of Stanford divesting itself of all its stock
in U.S. corporations which do business in
South Africa.
The trustees have received the recommen
dation of Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy that, because of the
grave effects such divestment will have on the
University, the trustees not sell their shares of
stock in these corporations.
The University's report on possible divest
ment wasn't surprising, and it acknowledges
the hard fiscal realities of managing a major
university. We agree that the trustees should
not divest these stocks, but see reasons in
addition to the financial havoc which divest
ment would wreak on the University.
Our major argument against divestment is
that such action will deny the University the
opportunity to take an activist role in improv
ing conditions within the Republic of South
Africa.
If Stanford were to divest itself of all stock in
these corporations, then it would leave the
fate of South Africans in the hands of their
government and several U.S. corporations.
Indeed, by keeping its stock, Stanford now
has a moral responsibility to be an aggressive
leader in improving conditions of South Afri
cans through these corporations, of which
Stanford is a part owner.
The protests here last spring involved Stan
ford's voting on proxy resolutions which
other stockholders put forward. We said then
and we reiterate now that the trustees must
put forth their own proxy resolutions which
would compel corporations to bring their
South African policies in line with the equal
employment opportunity polices which they
— and Stanford — practice in the United
States. Certainly it can not be detrimental to
Stanford for it to request that others follow the
same policies of racial equality to which Stan
ford is unequivocally committed.
