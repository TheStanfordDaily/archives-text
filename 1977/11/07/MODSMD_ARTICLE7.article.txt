# Palestinians' rights denied
## Israel and Palestine: views and facts 
### 
Yaqub Abu-Helu

First of two parts
I found the articles written by
Susan Keleman (Daily, Oct. 20 and
Oct. 27) extremely distorting of the
facts and events in that most unfor
tunate place of the world, Palestine,
and also deliberately or negligently
misleading.
There can be more than one view
butthe reality will always be the same
— a Palestinian people divided by in
ternational plots and religious hat
reds into two groups: one surviving
in refugee camps living on interna
tional charity, bringing its children
into a foreign land, having to, some
times, learn a foreign language, hav
ing to study the history of another
people, and worrying every day
about their surviving tomorrow's
local oppression or Israeli raids.
The other group, the one that is
"so happy," according to Keleman, is
living as a second class people in a
land that has been its own for »he
whole length of recorded history
under the oppression of a people
that believes down in its heart, con
stitution, education, religious books
and every aspect of its life that it is the
chosen people of Cod.
As late as 1918, the Jewish com
munity of Palestine constituted only
eight per cent of the whole popula
tion. They owned 2.5 per cent of the
land. Even in 1948, following the ex
tensive Jewish immigration drive en
couraged by the propaganda of the
Jewish Agency and other Zionist or
ganizations which made use of the
paranoia caused by World War II
among European Jews, the Jewish
ratio increased to 33 per cent of the
total population with a 5.67 per cent
share of the land.
Today, Jews make up 85 per cent of
the population of what has become
Israel. They directly own or indirectly

control'all of the land. What, then,
happened to the Palestinians?
In 1947, the Palestinians rejected
the partition plan put forth by the
United Nations. As well put in the
Daily Oct. 13, "The Palestinians, feel
ing like the real mother watching
King Solomon divide her child, de
cided to reject the plan." They
fought a very unequal battle: they
were poor, untrained, and practically
unarmed. The Zionists on the other
side were well trained, excessively
armed, and financially backed by the
U.S. and Western European gov
ernments as well as international
Jewish organizations.
The Palestinians lost the war and
lost Palestine. They were forced to
flee massacres like the one planned
and executed by the present Israeli
Prime Minister Menahem Begin at
Deir Yassin where hundreds of chil
dren, women and old people were
butchered deliberately in order to
plant horror among the Palestinians
so that they would evacuate the land
which would then be used to ac
comodate more Jewish immigrants.
The Palestinian refugee problem
was created by the establishment of
Israel. It was never reported in his
tory that the Palestinians had ever
fled their land prior to 1948.
Israel created problem
What Keleman calls the problem of
Jews from Arab countries was actu
ally created by Israel itself through
the Zionist organizations which
spread propaganda among Arab Jews
promising "freedom, money, honey,
and milk." Arab Jews had never been
a second class in Arab countries.
They lived in their own communities
but had equal rights.
Driven by hopes of a better life,
many Arab Jews fled their countries
toward Palestine only to find that

they were being used in a dirty inter
national conspiracy. After almost 30
years of residency in "Israel," Arab
Jews and Oriental Jews are still a
somewhat second class in that state.
During the last two years, more than
1500 Arab Jews have come back
home to Morocco, Sudan, Egypt and
Iraq.
The Palestinians refuse to be ab
sorbed by the different Arab and
non-Arab communities where they
happen to have taken refuge . . .
simply because there is nothing like
home and we want to go home. The
Palestinians are denied the sacred
right to fight for the liberation of
their country. Their liberation fight
ers are called terrorists. Worse,
even, they are denied the right to
exist. Those who survived Zionist
and Lebanese massacres do not exist
or "should not exist." As if it were
not their own life that Geneva should
mess with, they are not allowed to go
there as an independent group.
Colda Meir once said, "The Palesti
nians? Who are the Palestinians?

They do not exist." Well, they do.
Physically, at least, there are three
million of them.
Humanitarian measures?
What, then, are the "humanitarian
measures" that Israel has taken to
ward the Palestinians of the West
Bank and the Palestinians who re
mained in Palestine proper since
1948, which Keleman has enough
courage to talk about? Let an Israeli
citizen answer for me. Felicia Langer,
an Israeli lawyer of Polish Jewish
background, wrote a book "With My
Own Eyes" on the thousands of Is
raeli violations of basic human rights.
She documented such common Is
raeli practices against the Palesti
nians as arrests with no cause, tor
ture and demolishing homes. The
"humanitarian" Israel has destroyed
completely thousands of Palestinian
villages. Israel burned the holy mos
que of al-Aqsa.

ward the Palestinians of the West
Bank and the Palestinians who re
mained in Palestine proper since
1948, which Keleman has enough
courage to talk about? Let an Israeli
citizen answer for me. Felicia Langer,
an Israeli lawyer of Polish Jewish
background, wrote a book "With My
Own Eyes" on the thousands of Is
raeli violations of basic human rights.
She documented such common Is
raeli practices against the Palesti
nians as arrests with no cause, tor
ture and demolishing homes. The
"humanitarian" Israel has destroyed
completely thousands of Palestinian
villages. Israel burned the holy mos
que of al-Aqsa.

First of two parts
I found the articles written by
Susan Keleman (Daily, Oct. 20 and
Oct. 27) extremely distorting of the
facts and events in that most unfor
tunate place of the world, Palestine,
and also deliberately or negligently
misleading.
There can be more than one view
butthe reality will always be the same
— a Palestinian people divided by in
ternational plots and religious hat
reds into two groups: one surviving
in refugee camps living on interna
tional charity, bringing its children
into a foreign land, having to, some
times, learn a foreign language, hav
ing to study the history of another
people, and worrying every day
about their surviving tomorrow's
local oppression or Israeli raids.
The other group, the one that is
"so happy," according to Keleman, is
living as a second class people in a
land that has been its own for »he
whole length of recorded history
under the oppression of a people
that believes down in its heart, con
stitution, education, religious books
and every aspect of its life that it is the
chosen people of Cod.
As late as 1918, the Jewish com
munity of Palestine constituted only
eight per cent of the whole popula
tion. They owned 2.5 per cent of the
land. Even in 1948, following the ex
tensive Jewish immigration drive en
couraged by the propaganda of the
Jewish Agency and other Zionist or
ganizations which made use of the
paranoia caused by World War II
among European Jews, the Jewish
ratio increased to 33 per cent of the
total population with a 5.67 per cent
share of the land.
Today, Jews make up 85 per cent of
the population of what has become
Israel. They directly own or indirectly

control'all of the land. What, then,
happened to the Palestinians?
In 1947, the Palestinians rejected
the partition plan put forth by the
United Nations. As well put in the
Daily Oct. 13, "The Palestinians, feel
ing like the real mother watching
King Solomon divide her child, de
cided to reject the plan." They
fought a very unequal battle: they
were poor, untrained, and practically
unarmed. The Zionists on the other
side were well trained, excessively
armed, and financially backed by the
U.S. and Western European gov
ernments as well as international
Jewish organizations.
The Palestinians lost the war and
lost Palestine. They were forced to
flee massacres like the one planned
and executed by the present Israeli
Prime Minister Menahem Begin at
Deir Yassin where hundreds of chil
dren, women and old people were
butchered deliberately in order to
plant horror among the Palestinians
so that they would evacuate the land
which would then be used to ac
comodate more Jewish immigrants.
The Palestinian refugee problem
was created by the establishment of
Israel. It was never reported in his
tory that the Palestinians had ever
fled their land prior to 1948.
Israel created problem
What Keleman calls the problem of
Jews from Arab countries was actu
ally created by Israel itself through
the Zionist organizations which
spread propaganda among Arab Jews
promising "freedom, money, honey,
and milk." Arab Jews had never been
a second class in Arab countries.
They lived in their own communities
but had equal rights.
Driven by hopes of a better life,
many Arab Jews fled their countries
toward Palestine only to find that

they were being used in a dirty inter
national conspiracy. After almost 30
years of residency in "Israel," Arab
Jews and Oriental Jews are still a
somewhat second class in that state.
During the last two years, more than
1500 Arab Jews have come back
home to Morocco, Sudan, Egypt and
Iraq.
The Palestinians refuse to be ab
sorbed by the different Arab and
non-Arab communities where they
happen to have taken refuge . . .
simply because there is nothing like
home and we want to go home. The
Palestinians are denied the sacred
right to fight for the liberation of
their country. Their liberation fight
ers are called terrorists. Worse,
even, they are denied the right to
exist. Those who survived Zionist
and Lebanese massacres do not exist
or "should not exist." As if it were
not their own life that Geneva should
mess with, they are not allowed to go
there as an independent group.
Colda Meir once said, "The Palesti
nians? Who are the Palestinians?

They do not exist." Well, they do.
Physically, at least, there are three
million of them.
Humanitarian measures?

simply because there is nothing like
home and we want to go home. The
Palestinians are denied the sacred
right to fight for the liberation of
their country. Their liberation fight
ers are called terrorists. Worse,
even, they are denied the right to
exist. Those who survived Zionist
and Lebanese massacres do not exist
or "should not exist." As if it were
not their own life that Geneva should
mess with, they are not allowed to go
there as an independent group.
Colda Meir once said, "The Palesti
nians? Who are the Palestinians?

They do not exist." Well, they do.
Physically, at least, there are three
million of them.
Humanitarian measures?
What, then, are the "humanitarian
measures" that Israel has taken to
ward the Palestinians of the West
Bank and the Palestinians who re
mained in Palestine proper since
1948, which Keleman has enough
courage to talk about? Let an Israeli
citizen answer for me. Felicia Langer,
an Israeli lawyer of Polish Jewish
background, wrote a book "With My
Own Eyes" on the thousands of Is
raeli violations of basic human rights.
She documented such common Is
raeli practices against the Palesti
nians as arrests with no cause, tor
ture and demolishing homes. The
"humanitarian" Israel has destroyed
completely thousands of Palestinian
villages. Israel burned the holy mos
que of al-Aqsa.

Yaqub Abu-Helu

First of two parts
I found the articles written by
Susan Keleman (Daily, Oct. 20 and
Oct. 27) extremely distorting of the
facts and events in that most unfor
tunate place of the world, Palestine,
and also deliberately or negligently
misleading.
There can be more than one view
butthe reality will always be the same
— a Palestinian people divided by in
ternational plots and religious hat
reds into two groups: one surviving
in refugee camps living on interna
tional charity, bringing its children
into a foreign land, having to, some
times, learn a foreign language, hav
ing to study the history of another
people, and worrying every day
about their surviving tomorrow's
local oppression or Israeli raids.
The other group, the one that is
"so happy," according to Keleman, is
living as a second class people in a
land that has been its own for »he
whole length of recorded history
under the oppression of a people
that believes down in its heart, con
stitution, education, religious books
and every aspect of its life that it is the
chosen people of Cod.
As late as 1918, the Jewish com
munity of Palestine constituted only
eight per cent of the whole popula
tion. They owned 2.5 per cent of the
land. Even in 1948, following the ex
tensive Jewish immigration drive en
couraged by the propaganda of the
Jewish Agency and other Zionist or
ganizations which made use of the
paranoia caused by World War II
among European Jews, the Jewish
ratio increased to 33 per cent of the
total population with a 5.67 per cent
share of the land.
Today, Jews make up 85 per cent of
the population of what has become
Israel. They directly own or indirectly

control'all of the land. What, then,
happened to the Palestinians?
In 1947, the Palestinians rejected
the partition plan put forth by the
United Nations. As well put in the
Daily Oct. 13, "The Palestinians, feel
ing like the real mother watching
King Solomon divide her child, de
cided to reject the plan." They
fought a very unequal battle: they
were poor, untrained, and practically
unarmed. The Zionists on the other
side were well trained, excessively
armed, and financially backed by the
U.S. and Western European gov
ernments as well as international
Jewish organizations.
The Palestinians lost the war and
lost Palestine. They were forced to
flee massacres like the one planned
and executed by the present Israeli
Prime Minister Menahem Begin at
Deir Yassin where hundreds of chil
dren, women and old people were
butchered deliberately in order to
plant horror among the Palestinians
so that they would evacuate the land
which would then be used to ac
comodate more Jewish immigrants.
The Palestinian refugee problem
was created by the establishment of
Israel. It was never reported in his
tory that the Palestinians had ever
fled their land prior to 1948.
Israel created problem
What Keleman calls the problem of
Jews from Arab countries was actu
ally created by Israel itself through
the Zionist organizations which
spread propaganda among Arab Jews
promising "freedom, money, honey,
and milk." Arab Jews had never been
a second class in Arab countries.
They lived in their own communities
but had equal rights.
Driven by hopes of a better life,
many Arab Jews fled their countries
toward Palestine only to find that

they were being used in a dirty inter
national conspiracy. After almost 30
years of residency in "Israel," Arab
Jews and Oriental Jews are still a
somewhat second class in that state.
During the last two years, more than
1500 Arab Jews have come back
home to Morocco, Sudan, Egypt and
Iraq.
The Palestinians refuse to be ab
sorbed by the different Arab and
non-Arab communities where they
happen to have taken refuge . . .
simply because there is nothing like
home and we want to go home. The
Palestinians are denied the sacred
right to fight for the liberation of
their country. Their liberation fight
ers are called terrorists. Worse,
even, they are denied the right to
exist. Those who survived Zionist
and Lebanese massacres do not exist
or "should not exist." As if it were
