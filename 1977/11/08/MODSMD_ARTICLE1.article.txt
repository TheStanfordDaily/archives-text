# Med Center surgical facilities suffer from serious crowding
## 
### Andrea lames 
The crowded situation in surgery
at the Medical Center has become
"pretty severe" and there is no sign
of immediate relief, according to
)ohn Collins, professor and chair
man of the department of surgery at
the hospital.
The 12 operating rooms in the
hospital complex are being used ap
proximately 10 hours per day, ac
cording to a hospital study con
ducted in September. Two smaller
surgical facilities in Hoover Pavilion,
are being used about five hours
daily.
"It's not unusual to have elective
(scheduled) operations going on in
the evening," said Collins. "This re
ally causes inconvenience and
psychological disadvantage to the
patient."
He added, "Right now patients are
on waiting lists for specialized
surgery. Sometimes surgery has to
be canceled because the rooms are
full or because there aren't any more
intensive care units available."
New not enough
The hospital recently opened 25
new intensive care units, "but that
hasn't solved the problem," Collins
said. "We have a high need for inten
sive care because we do a lot of com
plex surgery."
Collins attributes changes in
medicine and a greater demand for
operations as the reasons for the
heavy surgery schedules.
"Coronary artery bypass opera

tions, joint replacements and organ
transplants weren't around 15 or 20
years ago," he said. "The situation
has been building up for several
years and we have made past re
commendations for new operating
rooms, but there were other
priorities. Now it's pretty severe."
Committee report
A committee of faculty and com
munity members, headed by Collins,
is working on a report of the surgical
situation at the hospital. Collins said
results should be published in about
two months.
"It looks like we need about four
more operating rooms im
mediately," Collins said. "We'd like
to have them within the year, but it's
more likely it will be about two years.
Until then, we just have to make the
best of what we have."
He said engineering consultants
for the hospital are also looking into
the surgical situation.
New building
Collins added, "It's possible the
extra room left over from the Phase I
expansion project might be usable
for operating rooms. We're not sure
though; we may need a new build
ing."
Phase I construction began in 1973
and was completed last year. It
added 170,000 square feet to the
medical complex, but only 85,000
square feet of the project is func
tional today.
Most of the basement and third
floor of the medical complex are

empty shells, according to Jim Mc-
Nally, director of facilities.
The committee is also looking for
better ways to apportion operating
room time and more efficient or
ganization of operating assignments.
Collins said he thought appor
tionment of surgery rooms to faculty
and non-faculty members is being
handled evenly and fairly.
"The short supply naturally contri
butes to friction between the faculty
and non-faculty members," Collins
said.

He said engineering consultants
for the hospital are also looking into
the surgical situation.
New building
Collins added, "It's possible the
extra room left over from the Phase I
expansion project might be usable
for operating rooms. We're not sure
though; we may need a new build
ing."
Phase I construction began in 1973
and was completed last year. It
added 170,000 square feet to the
medical complex, but only 85,000
square feet of the project is func
tional today.
Most of the basement and third
floor of the medical complex are

empty shells, according to Jim Mc-
Nally, director of facilities.
The committee is also looking for
better ways to apportion operating
room time and more efficient or
ganization of operating assignments.
Collins said he thought appor
tionment of surgery rooms to faculty
and non-faculty members is being
handled evenly and fairly.
"The short supply naturally contri
butes to friction between the faculty
and non-faculty members," Collins
said.

irregularities with senators and senate candidates at an
informal public meeting last night.
The crowded situation in surgery
at the Medical Center has become
"pretty severe" and there is no sign
of immediate relief, according to
)ohn Collins, professor and chair
man of the department of surgery at
the hospital.
The 12 operating rooms in the
hospital complex are being used ap
proximately 10 hours per day, ac
cording to a hospital study con
ducted in September. Two smaller
surgical facilities in Hoover Pavilion,
are being used about five hours
daily.
"It's not unusual to have elective
(scheduled) operations going on in
the evening," said Collins. "This re
ally causes inconvenience and
psychological disadvantage to the
patient."
He added, "Right now patients are
on waiting lists for specialized
surgery. Sometimes surgery has to
be canceled because the rooms are
full or because there aren't any more
intensive care units available."
New not enough
The hospital recently opened 25
new intensive care units, "but that
hasn't solved the problem," Collins
said. "We have a high need for inten
sive care because we do a lot of com
plex surgery."
Collins attributes changes in
medicine and a greater demand for
operations as the reasons for the
heavy surgery schedules.
"Coronary artery bypass opera

tions, joint replacements and organ
transplants weren't around 15 or 20
years ago," he said. "The situation
has been building up for several
years and we have made past re
commendations for new operating
rooms, but there were other
priorities. Now it's pretty severe."
Committee report
A committee of faculty and com
munity members, headed by Collins,
is working on a report of the surgical
situation at the hospital. Collins said
results should be published in about
two months.
"It looks like we need about four
more operating rooms im
mediately," Collins said. "We'd like
to have them within the year, but it's
more likely it will be about two years.
Until then, we just have to make the
best of what we have."
He said engineering consultants
for the hospital are also looking into
the surgical situation.
