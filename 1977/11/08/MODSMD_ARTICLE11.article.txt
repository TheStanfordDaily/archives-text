# Palestinians have right to go back home
## 
### 
(Second of two parts)
In Jerusalem, Israel exiled, mas
sacred or jailed thousands of the
Palestinians who opposed the idea of
unifying and judaizing the city under
military Israeli rule. Only recently the
villagers of the two Arab Christian
villages, "Iqrit" and "Kufr Burum"
were forced to flee their villages for

ever. Israel confiscated millions of
acres of good Palestinian land. Israel
is establishing Zionist enclaves deep
in the West Bank in violation of all
agreements and treaties on the
treatment of occupied land much to
the displeasure of even its closest
ally, the U.S. government, which has
made its disapproval of the Israeli
measures known to the Israeli gov
ernment.
And by its own very roots Israel is
racist. In testimony before a Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on refugees,
Hebrew University's Prof. Israel
Shahak said his government's ac
tions were "almost worse than those
practiced by South Africa's leaders.
The military government of the oc
cupied territories has devoted this
land, in principle and in fact, to the
uses of the Israeli settlements only,
without any regard to the fact that it
has served the existing population
(i.e., the Palestinians) of the con
quered territories from time im
memorial."
Zionism racist
The U.N. ruling that "Zionism is a
form of racism," which was voted on
positively by the great majority of the
world countries, is too famous to
mention. Zionism is the philosophy
upon which Israel was established
almost 30 years ago.
The Israeli government, or organi
zations protected by that govern
ment, have tried more than once to
flood bookstores with distorted
copies of the Koran, the holy book
of Muslims. Last year, the Israeli gov
ernment burned dozens of this holy
book in Hebron (al-Khalil), a tradi
tional center for Islamic thought.

Education was not left out. Cur
ricula have been twisted in such a
way as to serve Israeli oppression,
imperialism and superiority. Citizen
ship education has been completely
demolished. History textbooks have
been distorted in such a way as to
present an inferior image of the Arab
and Islamic civilization and achieve
ments. All books dealing with the
Palestinian problem have been de
molished.
Teaching periods previously as
signed to Islamic culture and ethics
have been reduced under the Israeli
rule in the recently occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to such a
ridiculous minimum that they have
lost any practical value.
Teacher training programs.for the
Arabs have been cancelled. In
service programs have been
abolished too. And, as hard to be
lieve as this may be, Palestinians are
not allowed to get A's and B's in the
subjects required for admission to
the institutes of higher education.
Even the names of villages and
towns have been changed from the
Arabic ones that they have carried for
thousands of years into Hebrew.
Israel winner
What's all the talk about the Israeli
policy of "open bridges" (i.e., bet
ween Occupied Palestine and Jor
dan)? Despite all the propaganda Is
rael has put into the issue, the facts
are: Israel is the principal winner in
the case. It is estimated that the tax
money the Israeli government gets
from the bridges is equal to the
money the Egyptian government
gets from taxing the ships that go
through the Suez Canal. Moreover,

Yaqub Abu-Helu

the bridges have an undeniable value
as a propaganda resource, the type
of propaganda that would fool (or be
used by) people like Keleman.
Keleman says,"The oil billions of
the Arab countries should be more
than sufficient to provide for the re
settlement and rehabilitation of all
Arab refugees." This is extremely
misleading. For one thing, the re
fugees are Palestinians in the first
place. To call them Arab, which they
are, is to miss the point; they have
been expelled from Palestine where
their ancestors have resided for
eternity â€” not from Jordan, Syria or
Saudi Arabia. Besides, why should
Palestinians be denied the right to go
home and live at home in order that
Russians, Poles, Americans and
whoever else would, in the name of
human rights, replace them?
If Jews have been mistreated in
Russia, Germany, Berkeley or any
where else, this is bad, extremely
bad, a crime that has to be fought and
stopped .. .but it is not sufficient
reason for these same Jews to go to
Palestine and kill Palestinians or exile
them and, then, to ask the oil rich
Arabs to rehabilitate them.
But this is what Israel is all about:
an archaic religious whim built on
paranoia and hatred, supported by
the actions of Western civilization's
religious and nationalistic eccen
tricities and deformed secretions.
As a Palestinian, I know and be
lieve that I and my children have
more right to go back home than any
Russian, Pole, American or what
ever.
