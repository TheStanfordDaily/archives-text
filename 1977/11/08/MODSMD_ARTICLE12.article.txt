# 'Exhibitionism' reaches artistic heights through mime
## 
### Debbie Walker 
"Now...pretend you are an
exhibitionist," said Stella Ben
sadon as she dynamically
threw her arms wide.
The small dark woman in a
black leotard regarded her
students. Only in a mime class
could such an order be obeyed
without severe repurcussions.
The students laughed and to
tally got into their assignment
realizing they weren't prepar
ing for a kinky career.
Bensadon has been offering
mime classes here for the past
two years with admirable re
sults. Members of her class
joined to form "Pianomime"
which has staged benefit per
formances since 1975.
Bensadon, the group's direc
tor, decided "two hours in si
lence was too long for the au

dience" so they hired a piano
player to accompany the mime
acts.
"Pianomime" is presently in
a state of transition as students
have graduated and faculty
members have found other
jobs, so Bensadon is "search
ing for new blood."
For those interested, it is
doubtful one could fine a more
qualified teacher. Bensadon
has studied in France underthe
direction of Ella Jaroszewic, the
ex-wife of reknowned mime
Marcel Marceau, and also
under Marceau's instructor.
Bensadon's classes are not as
intensive as those she received
in France.
"Now we must all live —
there are papers to turn in and
jobs to go to — we cannot do
mime all the time as I did.

"I used to be so disap
piontedwhen students missed
a lesson because they had to
study for a test. I hope to find
students who are interested in
mime and become serious
about it," she said.
Bensadon first discovered
mime when she was at a fair on
the Israeli kibbutz where she
lived. Her first imitation was of
a cow — needless to say her
repertoire has greatly in
creased since then.
Bensadon's class holds ap
peal for those who enjoy per
forming in front of a group and

are interested in exploring new
means of expressing them
selves without saying a word.
At the end of class, each stu
dent presents an innovative
idea that he or she has trans
lated into pantomime.
Ideas include everything
from the sun moving across the
sky to a graphic description of
the early morning blahs. As the
grand finale, Bensadon did a
cosmic and hilarious presenta
tion of astronauts floating in
outer space.
One surprising aspect of the
class is the wide variety of age

groups represented. There
were students as well as a
sexagenarian enjoying the pan
tomime.
"I like it — this difference of
age. When people want to ex
press themselves like this it
makes me very happy. I think
also that in California you find
more people with open minds
and maybe this is why there is
such a large age group," Ben
sadon said with a smile.
Lessons are held 6:30 to 8:30
Wednesday evenings in the
Clubhouse.

The fine art of showing and expressing without uttering a sound is
demonstrated by mime instructor Stella Bensadon (above). At right,
students perform using their bodies and lots of imagination.
