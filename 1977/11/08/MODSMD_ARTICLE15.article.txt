# Rouse, Wycherly and a legitimate 'Country Wife'
## 
### 
William Wycherly's "The
Country Wife" is probably the
most widely produced Restora
tion comedy extant. It deals
with etiquette, society, sex and
the various permutations
thereof; it sets itself in a
specific historical niche and
still manages to maintain con
siderable present-day potency.
It is dirty, in short — a real mas
terpiece of prurience.
Admittedly that might not be
a completely accurate account.
"Wife" is also a beautifully
written, complex work with
staunchly moral undertones.
Dirty, as they say, but good.
In any case, it has not always
been thus. According to John
Rouse, director of the Drama
Department's set-to-open
tomorrow production, past
audiences have from time to
time been less than receptive
to Wycherly's wit. "The play
has a great history," says
Rouse. "It was a real favorite at
first, but then audiences began
to get a little less salubrious, a
little less ready to listen to off
color jokes. In fact, there was a
major reversal of feeling — for
a long time the play just wasn't
done, or when it was done it
was done in an emasculated
version, one that omitted ev
erything objectionable. That
version was called 'The Coun
try Girl,' and it was practically
the only version seen until the
late 19405. The original has
since then become very popu
lar, but for hundreds of years it
was effectively banned."
Even now, says Rouse, many
productions do not play
"Wife" for all that it is worth.
"There is a tendency to play
down the satiric end — satire
tends to point, and say, 'That's
no mysterious off-stage room,
that's the bedroom, and
they're going in there to have it
off.' Instead, we often get a
kind of situation comedy. The
sexual stuff is very lightly dealt
with, and, as a result, we can
laugh without really having to
deal with what's actually going
on in those conversations, and

after them. That softens the
impact, and prevents Wycherly
from getting at the grossly dis
torted examples of 'normal'
behavior in the way that he in
tended to get at them. It's actu
ally a tougher play than you'd
think. It's not the kind of play
that flits across the stage. It's
very funny — funnier, I think,
when tough — but it doesn't
flit."
Rouse intends to avoid
caricature in his production
— to that end considerable ef
fort is being made to create an
historically accurate atmos
phere. "We've been careful,"
he says, "to research in detail
what the clothing looked like
and what kinds of spaces

people felt at home in. The re
sult has been clothing that is
both extremely beautiful to
look at, and representative of
the characters inside it. It is
carefully designed, and care
fully made. It is class stuff.
"The set, for the same
reasons, will be an open one,
angled toward the audience. It
will be brightly lit and rfieticul
ously color coordinated — the
idea is to create that world right
there, and to create it with all
the energy and verve, and real
pizzazz that was genuinely a
part of the era.
"It will be spectacular then,
but intimate. As was the case in
Wycherly's time, the audience
will not be ignored, and we will

not try to create a monster
opera house effect. Wycherly
wrote this play for people who
were close in on the action, for
people who enjoyed the in
terplay. We've attempted to re
tain that — we hope to have the
audience aware of every bit of
this play, right there, very close
very welcome."
Needless to say, though
Rouse is enthusiastic about his
production, he is aware of the
difficulties that accrue from the
staging of such plays. "Specifi
cally, Restoration comedies
have a different kind of syntax
— characters tend to go for
long sentences with many
semi-colons. They say some
thing and build upon it dialec

tically, using complex passages
where we might use a single
phrase. 'Wife' is easier to deal
with than some of the later
plays of the era, in that it ba
lances the humor fairly nicely
back and forth between the
lines and the action, but it is
definitely not contemporary, if
that phrase has meaning.
"Our special problem is one
of acquisition, one of adopting
a foreign vocabulary of ges
ture, and posture and vocal in
tonation without losing touch
with the human values of the
action. Restoration comedies,

like all 'period plays/ involve
patterns of behavior different
from those of our own — we've
tried to assimilate those pat
terns into the performance in
such a way as to make this
more than a technical exercise.
"That's kind of the great
danger, but it's also our big
opportunity. If it doesn't work,
you get a bunch of people who
walk very well, who use han
kerchiefs very well, speak with
a nice lilt and convince no one;
if it does work you get a sense
of the real life of another time.
As the actors learn to take their

action and interactions
through the behavior of the
era, you get something that is
historically real, and funny, but
also something with real live
human beings. It will be an
open, moving, physical play,
one that was designed, with
only a few exceptions to show
the kinds of nastiness that
people do to each other viv
idly, in an unselfconscious
manner. Not stagey arch
humor, but truthful, felt com
edy, often felt far too deeply."

Rouse intends to avoid
caricature in his production
— to that end considerable ef

he says, "to research in detail
what the clothing looked like

"It will be spectacular then,

people who enjoyed the in

Needless to say, though

difficulties that accrue from the
staging of such plays. "Specifi

have a different kind of syntax

long sentences with many
semi-colons. They say some
thing and build upon it dialec

tically, using complex passages

phrase. 'Wife' is easier to deal
with than some of the later
plays of the era, in that it ba

definitely not contemporary, if

more than a technical exercise.
"That's kind of the great
danger, but it's also our big
opportunity. If it doesn't work,
you get a bunch of people who
walk very well, who use han
kerchiefs very well, speak with
a nice lilt and convince no one;
if it does work you get a sense
of the real life of another time.
As the actors learn to take their

action and interactions
through the behavior of the
era, you get something that is

William Wycherly's "The
Country Wife" is probably the
most widely produced Restora
tion comedy extant. It deals
with etiquette, society, sex and
the various permutations
thereof; it sets itself in a
specific historical niche and
still manages to maintain con
siderable present-day potency.
It is dirty, in short — a real mas
terpiece of prurience.
Admittedly that might not be
a completely accurate account.
"Wife" is also a beautifully
written, complex work with
staunchly moral undertones.
Dirty, as they say, but good.
In any case, it has not always
been thus. According to John
Rouse, director of the Drama
Department's set-to-open
tomorrow production, past
audiences have from time to
time been less than receptive
to Wycherly's wit. "The play
has a great history," says
Rouse. "It was a real favorite at
first, but then audiences began
to get a little less salubrious, a
little less ready to listen to off
color jokes. In fact, there was a
major reversal of feeling — for
a long time the play just wasn't
done, or when it was done it
was done in an emasculated
version, one that omitted ev
erything objectionable. That
version was called 'The Coun
try Girl,' and it was practically
the only version seen until the
late 19405. The original has
since then become very popu
lar, but for hundreds of years it
was effectively banned."
Even now, says Rouse, many
productions do not play
"Wife" for all that it is worth.
"There is a tendency to play
down the satiric end — satire
tends to point, and say, 'That's
no mysterious off-stage room,
that's the bedroom, and
they're going in there to have it
off.' Instead, we often get a
kind of situation comedy. The
sexual stuff is very lightly dealt
with, and, as a result, we can
laugh without really having to
deal with what's actually going
on in those conversations, and

after them. That softens the
impact, and prevents Wycherly
from getting at the grossly dis
torted examples of 'normal'
behavior in the way that he in
tended to get at them. It's actu
ally a tougher play than you'd
think. It's not the kind of play

William Wycherly's "The
Country Wife" is probably the
most widely produced Restora
tion comedy extant. It deals
with etiquette, society, sex and
the various permutations
thereof; it sets itself in a
specific historical niche and
still manages to maintain con
siderable present-day potency.
It is dirty, in short — a real mas
terpiece of prurience.
Admittedly that might not be
a completely accurate account.
"Wife" is also a beautifully
written, complex work with
staunchly moral undertones.
Dirty, as they say, but good.
In any case, it has not always
been thus. According to John
Rouse, director of the Drama
Department's set-to-open
tomorrow production, past
audiences have from time to
time been less than receptive
to Wycherly's wit. "The play
has a great history," says
Rouse. "It was a real favorite at
first, but then audiences began
to get a little less salubrious, a
little less ready to listen to off
color jokes. In fact, there was a
major reversal of feeling — for
a long time the play just wasn't
done, or when it was done it
was done in an emasculated
version, one that omitted ev
erything objectionable. That
version was called 'The Coun
try Girl,' and it was practically
the only version seen until the
late 19405. The original has
since then become very popu
lar, but for hundreds of years it
was effectively banned."
Even now, says Rouse, many
productions do not play
"Wife" for all that it is worth.
"There is a tendency to play
down the satiric end — satire
tends to point, and say, 'That's
no mysterious off-stage room,
that's the bedroom, and
they're going in there to have it
off.' Instead, we often get a
kind of situation comedy. The
sexual stuff is very lightly dealt
with, and, as a result, we can
laugh without really having to
deal with what's actually going
on in those conversations, and

after them. That softens the
impact, and prevents Wycherly
from getting at the grossly dis
torted examples of 'normal'
behavior in the way that he in
tended to get at them. It's actu
ally a tougher play than you'd
think. It's not the kind of play
that flits across the stage. It's
very funny — funnier, I think,
when tough — but it doesn't
flit."
Rouse intends to avoid
caricature in his production
— to that end considerable ef
fort is being made to create an
historically accurate atmos
phere. "We've been careful,"
he says, "to research in detail
what the clothing looked like
and what kinds of spaces

people felt at home in. The re
sult has been clothing that is
both extremely beautiful to
look at, and representative of
the characters inside it. It is
carefully designed, and care
fully made. It is class stuff.
"The set, for the same
reasons, will be an open one,
angled toward the audience. It
will be brightly lit and rfieticul
ously color coordinated — the
idea is to create that world right
there, and to create it with all
the energy and verve, and real
pizzazz that was genuinely a
part of the era.
"It will be spectacular then,
but intimate. As was the case in
Wycherly's time, the audience
will not be ignored, and we will

not try to create a monster
opera house effect. Wycherly
wrote this play for people who
were close in on the action, for
people who enjoyed the in
terplay. We've attempted to re
tain that — we hope to have the
audience aware of every bit of
this play, right there, very close
very welcome."
Needless to say, though
Rouse is enthusiastic about his
production, he is aware of the
difficulties that accrue from the
staging of such plays. "Specifi
cally, Restoration comedies
have a different kind of syntax
— characters tend to go for
long sentences with many
semi-colons. They say some
thing and build upon it dialec

tically, using complex passages
where we might use a single
phrase. 'Wife' is easier to deal
with than some of the later
plays of the era, in that it ba
lances the humor fairly nicely
back and forth between the
lines and the action, but it is
definitely not contemporary, if
that phrase has meaning.
"Our special problem is one
of acquisition, one of adopting
a foreign vocabulary of ges
ture, and posture and vocal in
tonation without losing touch
with the human values of the
action. Restoration comedies,

like all 'period plays/ involve
