# Guarneri Quartet
## Excellent, diverse program 
### 
The Guarneri Quartet
opened its three concert en
gagement here Sunday to a
packed Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The quartet, Arnold
Steinhardt and John Dalley,
violins; Michael Tree, viola;
and David Soyer, cello; played
with the purity of intonation,
cleanliness and cohesiveness
which one expects of the
Guarneri. Even more impres
sive was the versatility the
quartet displayed in its prog
ram.
The concert opened with the
"Quartet in F major, Opus 77,
number 2" by Haydn. The per
formance was highlighted by
the excellent playing of
Steinhardt. His marvelous

bowing and musical sensitivity
combined to produce the deli
cate, graceful air which makes
Haydn's music so delightful.
Unfortunately, at the begin
ning of the first movement, an
Allegro moderato, the quartet
had a little difficulty finding the
proper balance. It seemed that
the viola and cello were a bit
heavy during their accompan
iment of Steinhardt. However,
this problem disappeared by
the Menuetto, the trio of which
was exquisite. The fourth
movement, Vivace assai, pro
vided a light, energetic ending
to the piece.
The program moved on to
the "Quartet, Opus 3," by
Alben Berg. Here the Guarneri

displayed marvelous precision
in bringing out the various
motifs in the work. Each
member brought out his part
and faded into the background
again as necessary.
The Guarneri also did an ex
cellent job with the various
tone colors Berg demanded,
using the ponticello (on the
bridge) bowings particularly
effectively.
The high point of the concert
was the closing number, the
"Quartet number 2 in D major"
by Alexander Borodin. The
piece, composed during Boro
din's summer vacation in 1881,
provided the Guarneri with the
perfect vehicle for exhibiting
all of its skills at once. The

Cuarneri performed with the
same precision it did in the
Berg, but at the same time each
member of the quartet contri
buted his own individuality
when it became his turn to ex
press one of the many wonder
fully romantic themes in the
piece. Particularly to be com
mended is second violinist Dal
ley, who performed his part
with a warmth of feeling and
tone seldom exhibited by the
second violinist in a string
quartet.
The Cuarneri Quartet con
cludes its engagement here
with concerts Nov. 8 and Nov.
11. Both concerts are at 8 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
