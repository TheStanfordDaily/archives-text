## Following two pioneers 
### 
Two pioneer artists have been featured in re
cent San Francisco gallery shows. The late Im
ogen Cunningham was represented by an ex
tensive retrospective of her photographs at the
Focus Gallery. The show included prints from
her final project, portraits for a book titled "Af
ter Ninety." Nineteenth century French land
scapist Camille Corot (1796-1875) is the main
figure in a show of chiches-verre at Thackrey-
Robertson Gallery.
Cunningham's career spanned 75 years in the
history of photography. She began correspon
dence courses in the medium in 1901 when she
was 18, despite her father's reservations. He
begrudgingiy built her first darkroom on their
Seattle farm. Imogen supported herself as a por
trait photographer after completing a chemistry
degree at the University of Washington, and a
year's study abroad. After her marriage to etcher
Roi Partridge, she moved to California where
she lived under her death at 93 in 1976.
The Focus show was a two-fold presentation.
Rare prints from the 1910s and a series of origi
nals and reprints (from the Cunningham Trust
Fund) from every phase of the artist's career
made up at least half of the show. They provided
eloquent testimony to the range and impor
tance of Cunningham's contribution to photo
graphy.
The "After Ninety" prints, shown for the first
time, proved Imogen, primarily a portraitest,
easily shifted to still life abstractions, and pur
sued throughout her life a split interest in the
romantic soft-focus views and the straight,
purist photograph. From the 1930s on, after her
involvement with the f64 group of purist photo
graphers, Imogen stayed with sharp-focus
work, but eagerly embraced chemical or
mechanical flukes if they enhanced the image —
solarization and double exposure, for example.
The recent portraits showed her awesome
ability to grasp the essence of the person (or
object) portrayed. Each image was highly per
sonal in the sense that it reflects the person
portrayed more than any characteristic of the
artist. Her portraits of Partridge from the 1915-18
period and the 1975 study showed her ability to
shift from the mystical or nostalgic to the
abstract but purist image; in this case, she fol
lowed both antithetical approaches simultane
ously. The lyrical studies of Partridge in the
landscape were taken in the same period as her
study of him at the etching press, a fine abstract
composition. The 1975 print is emblematic and
eerie — he gazes to the side, with his hand on a
white horse's skull. The background is deep
black, and Partridge's white hair and face, and
the skull seem to float, as if in a dream.
Other highlights of the portraits include
"Maria Kalisch" (1973) and "Mrs. Asawa" (1966).
Cunningham agreed to portray Kalisch because
"she didn't care if she looked old, and she didn't
hate her face." In both portraits, the women are
quite beautiful because their faces are virtual
records of their life experiences, and their
maturing personalities.
Cunningham admired those fellow
nonagenarians who retained vitality, humor and
courage in the face of ill health and death. As a
portraitest, she never idealized people. These
late studies are particularly moving because of
her ability to come to terms with her own old age
as well as that of the sitter with a directness and
freshness as well as insight into the individual.
In all of her work, we witness a minor revelation
of the essence of the person or object por
trayed.
The consistency with which Imogen captured
the individual, the intimate, and the personal

throughout her life is remarkable. In many ways,
her vision of old age in our society, from her
own experience and her work with the "After
Ninety" people, stands as a challenge to us as
well as a testament to her own powerful artistic
vision and personality.
Camille Corot, in contrast, sought the highly
personal of the natural world. His work set the
tone for much of the painting from the Barbizon
school as well as the impressionists in France.
Unlike his better known colleagues at Barbizon
(a small town near the Fontainebleau Forest out
side Paris), Corot led an unspectacular but pro
ductive life, painting in a realistic, fresh and
clear manner, generally ignored by art histo
rians, and little known to Americans.
Even more obscure, perhaps, is one medium
he used, the cliche-verre. This refers to the use
of a glass plate to generate etching-like images
on photographic paper. The process was first
tried as early as 1790, and was invented and
re-invented as often as photography itself. The
irony of the cliche-verre is that it was quickly
forgotten by the experimenters during the up
roar over the photographic processes that it had
helped advance.
A cliche-verre looks like an etching, but is on
silver paper, so the tonality can range from
sharp black and white to brown or purple tones.
Unlike an etching, the surface stays flat and
slick, so that it is neither a true etching nor a
photograph, but has a unique print quality. The
line quality can vary, and appear similar to those
achieved by complex etching processes, but the
advantage of the medium is that it is much easier
to produce the plate. One can either scratch
away at an opaque glass where one desires black
lines, or paint onto a clear glass in those areas
where one desires white — it is thus an additive
or subtractive process, or both.
The medium has been used extensively only
by Corot, as far as is known. He produced nearly
70 cliches-verre in the 1850-70 period, primarily
as a favor to some friends who sold them or used
them for book illustrations. The show consists
of landscapes, mostly by Corot, but including
rare examples of Theodore Rousseau, Charles
Daubigny and other Barbizon painters whom
Corot convinced to use the medium.
These landscapes seem nostalgic and pas
torale to modern viewers, although the Barbi
zon realists shunned sentimentality and roman
ticism; in rejecting the growing industrial cities
as their subject, they appear to us as idealizers of
rural life.
Corot's work has a particular touch, both in
line and composition. While all of the artists
shared a common interest in the truthful render
ing of this particular area, each work reveals
both the personality of the artist and the land,
underscoring the ambiguity of the term
"realism" in art movements.
The cliche-verre show is of particular interest
to the Stanford community as it gave impetus to
the introduction of the medium to printmaking
classes on campus. Instructor Nathan Oliveira
hope? to foster the medium, which, like the
monotype, has been used infrequently by pain
ters, usually as an exploratory medium. The
possibilities for this "primitive" photo process,
combined with modern papers and techniques
is challenging.
The chiches-verre remain through Nov. 31 at
Thackrey-Robertson, 2266 Union St. Both gal
leries are open Tuesday through Saturday, from
11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
