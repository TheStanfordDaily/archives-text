# Escaping into a garden of dreams
## 
### 
"I Never Promised You a
Rose Garden" is a touching
tilm about an adolescent girl
who has created an inner world
to escape the disagreeable
realities of life. Kathleen Quin
lan plays Debbie, the girl, and
Bibi Anderson portrays Dr.
Freed, her psychiatrist at the
psychiatric hospital.
Debbie, who is brought to
the hospital by her under
standably apprehensive pa
rents, has been through some
unpleasant experiences as a
child. Tins has colored her per
ception of the world, causing
her to create an escape into her
fantasies.
Dr. Freed is a personable
psychiatrist who is both de
voted and attached to her pa
tients. Her concerned interest
impresses Debbit*, who grudg
ingly comes to trust the doctor.
Thus, begins a long therapeu
tic struggle for Debbie's men
tal health.
Quinlan is especially impre
ssive in a most difficult role as a
psychiatric patient. She is out
standing and highlights the
tilm. Anderson is also ex
tremely convincing and fits
well into her part as the
psychiatrist. Another highlight
is the humane atmosphere of
the hospital. This aspect is ac
curate from many psychiatric
hospitals, in contrast to the
stereotyped preconception ot
a horribly inhumane setting.
Rather than the depressing
experience expected by most
from a film with such a setting,
"I Never Promised You a Rose
Garden" is enjoyable and up
lifting. There are comic mo
ments as well as touching emo
tional scenes. While done on a
serious level, the film is also
good entertainment and is well
worth seeing for both facets.

Women as women. That's the theme of many of this season's bin movies, from Diane Keaton's neurotic
schoolteacher ("Looking for Mr. Goodbar") to lane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave (above — in the Lillian
Hellman adaptation "Julia") to Anne Bancroft and Shirley Maclaine (above left — in the dance drama
"The Turning Point") — the big studio filmmakers are finally exploring one half of the world long left to
foreign and independent directors: the psychology and struggles of women outside of mistress-wife
whore roles. Of course, there's always room for the good ol' love stories, too. Among these conventional
boy-meets-girl tales are "First Love" (left — a bittersweet college romance with William Katt and Susan
Dey), and "Heroes" (Flenry Winkler and Sally Field).
