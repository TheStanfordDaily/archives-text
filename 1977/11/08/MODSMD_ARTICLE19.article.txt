# At the Surf
## Premieres & classics

At 31, Rainier Werner Fassbinder is emerg
ing as one of the most fascinating and prolific
of Europe's filmmakers. Innovation is his
trademark. With his personal ensemble and
technical staff he has created over 30 movies
since 1969 with as many as seven releases in a
year.
Fassbinder combines Brecht's didactic
alienation techniques with Andy Warhol's
pop-camp-gross. Cutting to the pus of every
sore, he is not an arty artist nor a crafty
craftsman. He shoots from the ground up
and never betrays his one motto: "Be sub
versive."
The Surf Theater is showcasing Fassbinder
in 10 features, including four premieres.

In "Katzelmacher" (Nov. 8) Fassbinder
plays a confused Greek immigrant accused of
rape and radicalism by a group of youths, left
directionless by economic prosperity.
A working class woman is exploited by the
media, the government and her family in
"Mother Kusters Goes to Heaven" (Nov. 8).
Fassbinder chisels his own gaudy-elegant
version of Lolita in "Jail Bail" (Nov. 9-12) and
settles into a collage of gangsters and film
cliches for "The American Soldier" (Nov.
9-12).
