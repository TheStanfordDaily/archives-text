# Senators, candidates discuss campaign practices with ERB
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
The Elections Review Board (ERB)
heard several ASSU senator's and
candidate's statements concerning
alleged campaign irregularities in an
informal meeting last night.
The board, created by the senate
Nov. 1, has the power to disqualify
senators it finds guilty of election
rules violations.
Senator Dan Livingston, Alternate
Senator Kevin Childress, candidate
John Hart and Conservative Students
Union (CSU) president Don Barton
all reiterated that they felt they had
done nothing "illegal" or "wrong" in
distributing an anonymous blue leaf
let attacking the SOC slate.
Four members of the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee (SOC) slate said
they read an anonymous yellow leaf
let the night before it was illegally
"stuffed" into the Daily and attemp
ted to dissuade the admitted author,
Chris Grey, from distributing it.
Grey had originally refused to
show the leaflet to the four, and in
sisted on its distribution, saying that
the SOC candidates had nothing to
do with it, that it was "out of their
hands," and that it was entirely his
responsibility, according to the four.
Grey was in Columbae, where the
four are residents, attempting to re
cruit people to help him distribute it
the first day of voting, the four said.
"There was very little we could
have done to stop Chris," said Mike
Veiluva.
Veiluva, along with Senators Mary
Bateson, David Catanzarite and Rick
Levy, were the four SOC members
who read the leaflet.
Grey was determined to distribute
the leaflet and knew a large number
of people who might help him distri
bute the leaflet, Veiluva said.
Grey felt strongly that a response
should be made to SOC's posters
and literature being ripped down, to
"inaccuracies" about SOC in the
Robert Dorters slate literature and
the failure of the Elections Commis
sioner or the Daily to act on, or re

port these incidents, according to
Senator Marvin Anderson.
Several SOC members had met
earlier and decided not to issue any
response to the Docters' inac
curacies, Anderson said.
During the meeting Docters
apologized to the SOC senators for
identifying the SOC slate in his litera
ture with the senate of two years ago,
when in fact it had not come into
being until last year.
Docters said he stood by all other
statements in his literature as factu
ally correct.
The major issue immediately after

the election was whether the SOC
slate had exceeded their spending
limit not previous knowledge of the
leaflet, Council of Presidpnts (COP)
member Glenn Jordan said.
Various SOC senators said that
when questioned later about forek
nowledge of the leaflet, they hesi
tated, fearing Daily accusations of
collaboration if they admitted forek
nowledge.
Livingston flatly denied any at
tempt was made by his slate to
evade the campaign spending limit.
Livingston said the blue leaflet was
