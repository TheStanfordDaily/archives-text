# A 						love story without the love in it
## 
### 
It's supposed to be one of
those college love stories with
the guy finding the girl of his
idealistic dreams. He wants to
marry her, or at least get her to
promise she'll be loyal to him.
But she won't because "that's
not the way life is, man." And
with that kind of profound
reasoning and that much sin
cerity, "First Love" plunges
into the all-too-familiar ruts of
"gee, see what it's like the first
time."
Our hero, a shy soccer
player/Dante worshipper,
won't indulge in the rampant
decadence of college in the
'70s. (He refuses, for instance,
to go to bed with a girl, who
jumps naked into his room
when his neighbor's girlfriend
interrupts his neighbor and her

in their lovemaking.) William
Katt (the unfortunate escort to
"Carrie") is bright and noble,
but he sounds too much like a
bubbleheaded philosopher or
a swooning poet. Yes, he even
tually abandons the no-touch
morality and beds the girl-of
his-dreams (Susan Dey) in all
kinds of strange ways and
places . . . and he does show
us some barefaced anguish
over "what the hell love is . . .
or isn't." But there's no way he
can make us believe he is any
thing more than two
dimensional.
Susan Dey, in her first movie
role, also suffers with a
weakly-drawn character. She is
Caroline, in love with a married
"older man" but attracted to
Katt anyway. Her past is scarred
by mysterious tragedies, in

eluding her father's suicide.
Her present life is a cat and
mouse game of lovemaking.
Dey is beautiful and sharp
and yet she lacks warmth
needed for our compassion.
Stealing our hearts, instead, is
Beverly D'Angelo, as the
neighbor's girl, an ardent if
luckless suitor of Katt's. Robert
Loggia is a stiff and bland
"older man" but Tom Lacy
spices up his character part as
Professor Oxtan.
Director loan Darling has
taken her actors well in hand
and keeps them from looking
completely ridiculous. The
screenplay, by lane Hitchcock
and David Freeman, is too
much for even the extremely
talented Darling (better known
as the television director of

"MASH," "Mary Hartman,
Mary Hartman" and"The Mary
Tyler Moore Show").
Producers Lawrence Tui man
and David Foster also backed
"Heroes," the Henry
Winkler-Sally Field love story
(which is a little better than
this) while Turman alone pro
duced "The Graduate" (no
comparison possible).
This is not to say "First Love"
is a terrible movie. College is
corny. Love is corny. Maybe
this is how it really is ... or
how it's supposed to be. After
all, if you're in the mood for
lovemaking in the soccer hut
after the Big Game . . . hurry
and buy a ticket.

reasoning and that much sin
cerity, "First Love" plunges
into the all-too-familiar ruts of
"gee, see what it's like the first
time."
Our hero, a shy soccer
player/Dante worshipper,
won't indulge in the rampant
decadence of college in the
'70s. (He refuses, for instance,
to go to bed with a girl, who
jumps naked into his room
when his neighbor's girlfriend
interrupts his neighbor and her

in their lovemaking.) William
Katt (the unfortunate escort to
"Carrie") is bright and noble,
but he sounds too much like a
bubbleheaded philosopher or
a swooning poet. Yes, he even
tually abandons the no-touch
morality and beds the girl-of
his-dreams (Susan Dey) in all
kinds of strange ways and
places . . . and he does show
us some barefaced anguish
over "what the hell love is . . .
or isn't." But there's no way he
can make us believe he is any
thing more than two
dimensional.
Susan Dey, in her first movie
role, also suffers with a
weakly-drawn character. She is
Caroline, in love with a married
"older man" but attracted to
Katt anyway. Her past is scarred
by mysterious tragedies, in

eluding her father's suicide.
Her present life is a cat and
mouse game of lovemaking.
Dey is beautiful and sharp
and yet she lacks warmth
needed for our compassion.
Stealing our hearts, instead, is
Beverly D'Angelo, as the
neighbor's girl, an ardent if
luckless suitor of Katt's. Robert
Loggia is a stiff and bland
"older man" but Tom Lacy
spices up his character part as
Professor Oxtan.
Director loan Darling has
taken her actors well in hand
and keeps them from looking
completely ridiculous. The
screenplay, by lane Hitchcock
and David Freeman, is too
much for even the extremely
talented Darling (better known
as the television director of

"MASH," "Mary Hartman,
Mary Hartman" and"The Mary
Tyler Moore Show").
Producers Lawrence Tui man
and David Foster also backed
"Heroes," the Henry
Winkler-Sally Field love story
(which is a little better than
this) while Turman alone pro
duced "The Graduate" (no
comparison possible).
This is not to say "First Love"
is a terrible movie. College is
corny. Love is corny. Maybe
this is how it really is ... or
how it's supposed to be. After
all, if you're in the mood for
lovemaking in the soccer hut
after the Big Game . . . hurry
and buy a ticket.

It's supposed to be one of
those college love stories with
the guy finding the girl of his
idealistic dreams. He wants to
marry her, or at least get her to
promise she'll be loyal to him.
But she won't because "that's
not the way life is, man." And
with that kind of profound
reasoning and that much sin
