Breeder decision still open
Washington — Congress is likely to sustain
President Jimmy Carter's veto of a bill authoriz
ing $80 million for the Clinch River breeder
reactor, congressional sources said yesterday.
But the veto, Carter's first veto since taking
office, may not be sufficient to kill the multi
billion dollar project at Oak Ridge, Tenn., its
backers claimed.
The president may have to take further ac
tion, possibly including a veto of a second bill,
to scuttle the program entirely.
Congress is expected to send Carter another
bill later this month appropriating the $80 mill
ion for the breeder along with nearly $7 billion
for a variety of other major federal programs.
Critics of the breeder have urged Carter to
veto this bill, too. But to do so would jeopar
dize the many other programs in the bill, in
cluding a measure carrying out the president's
decision to halt production of the B1 bomber.
In his Saturday veto message, Carterclaimed
the Clinch River project, on which ground has
yet to be broken, went against his administra
tion's intention to curb the spread of nuclear
weapons technology.
Breeder reactors transform small quantities
of conventional nuclear fuels — usually
uranium — into large amounts of plutonium.
This plutonium then can be used in other reac
tors to produce electricity, but may be used to
fashion crude nuclear weapons.
Breeder supporters acknowledged yester
day that it appears unlikely they can muster the
two-thirds vote in both House and Senate
needed to overturn Carter's veto.
Thirty eight senators and 162 House mem
bers voted previously against the project — a
big enough margin to sustain the veto in either
chamber.
High hazard dam fails, 37 die
Taccoa, Ga. — Thirty-seven people were kil
led when a dam which had been labelled "high
hazard" by army inspectors failed under
weight of heavy rains in northeast Georgia.
President Jimmy Carter responded yesterday
by declaring Georgia a major disaster area,
making federal assistance available to flood
victims.
Five years ago, Congress approved an in
spection program aimed at averting similar

disasters. But only enough funds were made
available to inventory the nation's dams and
none have been inspected, a spokesman for
the corps said in Washington.
That inventory, completed in 1975, estimates
it would cost $367.5 million for the inspections.
Only $15 million is authorized for the program
this fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1, and no
decision has been made so far on how to
spend it.
Rep. Leo J. Ryan (D-Calif.), chairman of the
House environment subcommittee, said the
collapse could have been avoided "totally,
completely, absolutely" if the inspection prog
ram had been followed.
Carter postpones foreign trip
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
officially postponed his planned foreign trip to
devote himself to energy legislation. He will
also be busy "planning for 1978" during his
stay-at-home time, aides said yesterday.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance announced
the postponement, saying Carter informed
heads of the nine countries on his intended
route that he hopes "a mutually convenient
date could be found for a later visit in the near
future."
Vance said the president's message em
phasized a conviction that "his personal in
volvement was vital to the development of
sound energy legislation."
OPEC price hikes foreseen
Vienna, Austria — The economic commis
sion of the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries (OPEC) met here yesterday to
prepare for a ministerial meeting next month
at which the cartel is expected to again raise
the price of oil, probably by five per cent.
OPEC spokesman Hamid Zaheri said current
oil prices would be reviewed and discussed at
the week-long preparatory meeting here. The
meeting is being held behind closed doors.
A five per cent increase in the price of crude
would mean an increase of about IV2 cents a
gallon at American pumps. The United States
imports about 40 per cent of its oil from OPEC
members.
The meeting opened as the authoritative
"Middle East Economic Survey" has reported
that "there is no hope" that the oil exporters

will heed U.S. calls for an oil price freeze
through 1978.
The oil newsletter said that even Saudi
Arabia, "the most moderate of the moder
ates," has declared that some increase is jus
tified. The Saudis have led efforts to keep
down the price of oil at recent OPEC confer
ences.
Reds parade for anniversary
Moscow — Hundreds of tanks and rockets
rumbled through Red Square yesterday as the
Soviet Union celebrated the 60th anniversary
of the Bolshevik revolution with its biggest
military parade in years.
President Leonid Brezhnev and other lead
ers remained throughout the two-hour
parade, which included more than 100,000
cheering, chanting Muscovites.
At the Kremlin reception, Brezhnev declared
"peace and socialism are inseparable. We will
do everything in our power for easing the
threat of war, for strengthening peaceful
cooperation among states."
He noted that "Soviet people live better
today than ever before both in spiritual and
material respects. At the same time, can
clearly see what still needs polishing up and
improvement and know how it shall be and will
be done."
About 330 military vehicles raced through
the square, a much bigger display than the 151
vehicles that were included in the last two
parades. Western observers saw this increase
as part of the major celebrations that have
been building up throughout the year to mark
the 60th anniversary.
Lost masterpiece uncovered
Florence, Italy — An American-financed re
search team, using sound and heat for the first
time to look for art, has concluded that a lost
masterpiece by Leonard da Vinci is probably
under another fresco in Florence's Great
Council Hall.
Now it's up to Italian authorities to decide
whether to look under the vast wall painting by
Giorgio Vasari, who remodeled the room four
centuries ago, and see if the researchers are
right.
"We've passed the ball to them at this

point," said Maurizio Seracini, scientific direc
tor of the year-long project that used ul
trasonic and infrared equipment.
Some art historians believe Leonardo used
an untried fresco technique and the colors
faded away. Others believe the fresco was co
vered up because it glorified the republic.
In an interview in Rome, Seracini said the
team zeroed in on the Vasari painting after
reconstructing a picture of the hall as it was in
the early 16th century and determining the
layers of material beneath the surface.
Ugandan pilots train in U.S.
Washington — Up to a dozen Uganda police
helicopter pilots are taking a "refresher
course" in Texas on visas obtained from the
United States, the State Department con
firmed yesterday.
The training is at the Bell Helicopter Co.
school at Fort Worth for pilots using civilian
models sold to Uganda up to 1971.
While the pilots will be permitted to com
plete the course, a department spokesman,
john Trattner, said, "We are tightening up
procedures" on visas for Ugandans.
Boy given life imprisonment
Miami — Ronny Zamora, 15, convicted of
murder last month despite his claim that tele
vision drove him to violence, was sentenced to
life in prison yesterday with no possibility of
parole for 25 years.
Circuit Judge Paul Baker, overruling defense
motions to upset the conviction or at least be
lenient, also sentenced Zamora to 53 years on
companion charges of burglary and assault.
Zamora, a Miami Beach high school student,
admitted killing his 83-year-old neighbor,
Elinor Haggart, when she surprised him and a
pal as they ransacked her home last spring.

to scuttle the program entirely.
Congress is expected to send Carter another
bill later this month appropriating the $80 mill
ion for the breeder along with nearly $7 billion
for a variety of other major federal programs.
Critics of the breeder have urged Carter to
veto this bill, too. But to do so would jeopar

cluding a measure carrying out the president's
decision to halt production of the B1 bomber.
In his Saturday veto message, Carterclaimed
the Clinch River project, on which ground has

weapons technology.
Breeder reactors transform small quantities
of conventional nuclear fuels — usually
uranium — into large amounts of plutonium.
This plutonium then can be used in other reac
tors to produce electricity, but may be used to
fashion crude nuclear weapons.
Breeder supporters acknowledged yester
day that it appears unlikely they can muster the
two-thirds vote in both House and Senate
needed to overturn Carter's veto.
Thirty eight senators and 162 House mem
bers voted previously against the project — a
big enough margin to sustain the veto in either

High hazard dam fails, 37 die
Taccoa, Ga. — Thirty-seven people were kil
led when a dam which had been labelled "high
hazard" by army inspectors failed under
weight of heavy rains in northeast Georgia.
President Jimmy Carter responded yesterday
by declaring Georgia a major disaster area,
making federal assistance available to flood
victims.
Five years ago, Congress approved an in
spection program aimed at averting similar

disasters. But only enough funds were made
available to inventory the nation's dams and
none have been inspected, a spokesman for
the corps said in Washington.
That inventory, completed in 1975, estimates
it would cost $367.5 million for the inspections.
Only $15 million is authorized for the program
this fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1, and no
decision has been made so far on how to
spend it.
Rep. Leo J. Ryan (D-Calif.), chairman of the
House environment subcommittee, said the
collapse could have been avoided "totally,
completely, absolutely" if the inspection prog
ram had been followed.
Carter postpones foreign trip
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
officially postponed his planned foreign trip to
devote himself to energy legislation. He will
also be busy "planning for 1978" during his
stay-at-home time, aides said yesterday.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance announced
the postponement, saying Carter informed
heads of the nine countries on his intended
route that he hopes "a mutually convenient
date could be found for a later visit in the near
future."
Vance said the president's message em
phasized a conviction that "his personal in
volvement was vital to the development of
sound energy legislation."
OPEC price hikes foreseen
Vienna, Austria — The economic commis
sion of the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries (OPEC) met here yesterday to
prepare for a ministerial meeting next month
at which the cartel is expected to again raise
the price of oil, probably by five per cent.
OPEC spokesman Hamid Zaheri said current
oil prices would be reviewed and discussed at
the week-long preparatory meeting here. The
meeting is being held behind closed doors.
A five per cent increase in the price of crude
would mean an increase of about IV2 cents a
gallon at American pumps. The United States
imports about 40 per cent of its oil from OPEC
members.
The meeting opened as the authoritative
"Middle East Economic Survey" has reported
that "there is no hope" that the oil exporters

will heed U.S. calls for an oil price freeze
through 1978.
The oil newsletter said that even Saudi
Arabia, "the most moderate of the moder
ates," has declared that some increase is jus
tified. The Saudis have led efforts to keep
down the price of oil at recent OPEC confer
ences.
Reds parade for anniversary
Moscow — Hundreds of tanks and rockets
rumbled through Red Square yesterday as the
Soviet Union celebrated the 60th anniversary
of the Bolshevik revolution with its biggest
military parade in years.
President Leonid Brezhnev and other lead
ers remained throughout the two-hour
parade, which included more than 100,000
cheering, chanting Muscovites.
At the Kremlin reception, Brezhnev declared
"peace and socialism are inseparable. We will
do everything in our power for easing the
threat of war, for strengthening peaceful
cooperation among states."
He noted that "Soviet people live better
today than ever before both in spiritual and
material respects. At the same time, can
clearly see what still needs polishing up and
improvement and know how it shall be and will
be done."
About 330 military vehicles raced through
the square, a much bigger display than the 151
vehicles that were included in the last two
parades. Western observers saw this increase
as part of the major celebrations that have
been building up throughout the year to mark
the 60th anniversary.
Lost masterpiece uncovered
Florence, Italy — An American-financed re
search team, using sound and heat for the first
time to look for art, has concluded that a lost
masterpiece by Leonard da Vinci is probably
under another fresco in Florence's Great
Council Hall.
Now it's up to Italian authorities to decide
whether to look under the vast wall painting by
Giorgio Vasari, who remodeled the room four
centuries ago, and see if the researchers are
right.
"We've passed the ball to them at this

point," said Maurizio Seracini, scientific direc
tor of the year-long project that used ul
trasonic and infrared equipment.
Some art historians believe Leonardo used
an untried fresco technique and the colors
faded away. Others believe the fresco was co
vered up because it glorified the republic.
In an interview in Rome, Seracini said the
team zeroed in on the Vasari painting after
reconstructing a picture of the hall as it was in
the early 16th century and determining the
layers of material beneath the surface.
Ugandan pilots train in U.S.
Washington — Up to a dozen Uganda police
helicopter pilots are taking a "refresher
course" in Texas on visas obtained from the
United States, the State Department con
firmed yesterday.
The training is at the Bell Helicopter Co.
school at Fort Worth for pilots using civilian
models sold to Uganda up to 1971.
While the pilots will be permitted to com
plete the course, a department spokesman,
john Trattner, said, "We are tightening up
procedures" on visas for Ugandans.
Boy given life imprisonment
Miami — Ronny Zamora, 15, convicted of
murder last month despite his claim that tele
vision drove him to violence, was sentenced to
life in prison yesterday with no possibility of
parole for 25 years.
Circuit Judge Paul Baker, overruling defense
motions to upset the conviction or at least be
lenient, also sentenced Zamora to 53 years on
companion charges of burglary and assault.
Zamora, a Miami Beach high school student,
admitted killing his 83-year-old neighbor,
Elinor Haggart, when she surprised him and a
pal as they ransacked her home last spring.

In his Saturday veto message, Carterclaimed
the Clinch River project, on which ground has
yet to be broken, went against his administra

weapons technology.
Breeder reactors transform small quantities
of conventional nuclear fuels — usually
uranium — into large amounts of plutonium.
This plutonium then can be used in other reac
tors to produce electricity, but may be used to
fashion crude nuclear weapons.
Breeder supporters acknowledged yester
day that it appears unlikely they can muster the
two-thirds vote in both House and Senate
needed to overturn Carter's veto.
Thirty eight senators and 162 House mem
bers voted previously against the project — a
big enough margin to sustain the veto in either
chamber.
High hazard dam fails, 37 die
Taccoa, Ga. — Thirty-seven people were kil
led when a dam which had been labelled "high
hazard" by army inspectors failed under
weight of heavy rains in northeast Georgia.
President Jimmy Carter responded yesterday
by declaring Georgia a major disaster area,
making federal assistance available to flood
victims.
Five years ago, Congress approved an in
spection program aimed at averting similar

disasters. But only enough funds were made
available to inventory the nation's dams and
none have been inspected, a spokesman for
the corps said in Washington.
That inventory, completed in 1975, estimates
it would cost $367.5 million for the inspections.
Only $15 million is authorized for the program
this fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1, and no
decision has been made so far on how to
spend it.
Rep. Leo J. Ryan (D-Calif.), chairman of the
House environment subcommittee, said the
collapse could have been avoided "totally,
completely, absolutely" if the inspection prog
ram had been followed.
Carter postpones foreign trip
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
officially postponed his planned foreign trip to
devote himself to energy legislation. He will
also be busy "planning for 1978" during his
stay-at-home time, aides said yesterday.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance announced
the postponement, saying Carter informed
heads of the nine countries on his intended
route that he hopes "a mutually convenient
date could be found for a later visit in the near
future."
Vance said the president's message em
phasized a conviction that "his personal in
volvement was vital to the development of
sound energy legislation."
OPEC price hikes foreseen
Vienna, Austria — The economic commis
sion of the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries (OPEC) met here yesterday to
prepare for a ministerial meeting next month
at which the cartel is expected to again raise
the price of oil, probably by five per cent.
OPEC spokesman Hamid Zaheri said current
oil prices would be reviewed and discussed at
the week-long preparatory meeting here. The
meeting is being held behind closed doors.
A five per cent increase in the price of crude
would mean an increase of about IV2 cents a
gallon at American pumps. The United States
imports about 40 per cent of its oil from OPEC
members.
The meeting opened as the authoritative
"Middle East Economic Survey" has reported
that "there is no hope" that the oil exporters

will heed U.S. calls for an oil price freeze
through 1978.
The oil newsletter said that even Saudi
Arabia, "the most moderate of the moder
ates," has declared that some increase is jus
tified. The Saudis have led efforts to keep
down the price of oil at recent OPEC confer
ences.
Reds parade for anniversary
Moscow — Hundreds of tanks and rockets
rumbled through Red Square yesterday as the
Soviet Union celebrated the 60th anniversary
of the Bolshevik revolution with its biggest
military parade in years.
President Leonid Brezhnev and other lead
ers remained throughout the two-hour
parade, which included more than 100,000
cheering, chanting Muscovites.
At the Kremlin reception, Brezhnev declared
"peace and socialism are inseparable. We will
do everything in our power for easing the
threat of war, for strengthening peaceful
cooperation among states."
He noted that "Soviet people live better
today than ever before both in spiritual and
material respects. At the same time, can
clearly see what still needs polishing up and
improvement and know how it shall be and will
be done."
About 330 military vehicles raced through
the square, a much bigger display than the 151
vehicles that were included in the last two
parades. Western observers saw this increase
as part of the major celebrations that have
been building up throughout the year to mark
the 60th anniversary.
Lost masterpiece uncovered
Florence, Italy — An American-financed re
search team, using sound and heat for the first
time to look for art, has concluded that a lost
masterpiece by Leonard da Vinci is probably
under another fresco in Florence's Great
Council Hall.
Now it's up to Italian authorities to decide
whether to look under the vast wall painting by
Giorgio Vasari, who remodeled the room four
centuries ago, and see if the researchers are
right.
"We've passed the ball to them at this

point," said Maurizio Seracini, scientific direc
tor of the year-long project that used ul
trasonic and infrared equipment.
Some art historians believe Leonardo used
an untried fresco technique and the colors
faded away. Others believe the fresco was co
vered up because it glorified the republic.
In an interview in Rome, Seracini said the
team zeroed in on the Vasari painting after
reconstructing a picture of the hall as it was in
the early 16th century and determining the
layers of material beneath the surface.
Ugandan pilots train in U.S.
Washington — Up to a dozen Uganda police
helicopter pilots are taking a "refresher
course" in Texas on visas obtained from the
United States, the State Department con
firmed yesterday.
The training is at the Bell Helicopter Co.
school at Fort Worth for pilots using civilian
models sold to Uganda up to 1971.
While the pilots will be permitted to com
plete the course, a department spokesman,
john Trattner, said, "We are tightening up
procedures" on visas for Ugandans.
Boy given life imprisonment
Miami — Ronny Zamora, 15, convicted of
murder last month despite his claim that tele

life in prison yesterday with no possibility of
parole for 25 years.
Circuit Judge Paul Baker, overruling defense
motions to upset the conviction or at least be
lenient, also sentenced Zamora to 53 years on
companion charges of burglary and assault.
Zamora, a Miami Beach high school student,
admitted killing his 83-year-old neighbor,
Elinor Haggart, when she surprised him and a
pal as they ransacked her home last spring.

Washington — Congress is likely to sustain

But the veto, Carter's first veto since taking

The president may have to take further ac

This plutonium then can be used in other reac
tors to produce electricity, but may be used to
fashion crude nuclear weapons.
Breeder supporters acknowledged yester
day that it appears unlikely they can muster the
two-thirds vote in both House and Senate
needed to overturn Carter's veto.
Thirty eight senators and 162 House mem
bers voted previously against the project — a
big enough margin to sustain the veto in either
chamber.
High hazard dam fails, 37 die
Taccoa, Ga. — Thirty-seven people were kil
led when a dam which had been labelled "high
hazard" by army inspectors failed under
weight of heavy rains in northeast Georgia.
President Jimmy Carter responded yesterday
by declaring Georgia a major disaster area,
making federal assistance available to flood
victims.
Five years ago, Congress approved an in
spection program aimed at averting similar

disasters. But only enough funds were made
available to inventory the nation's dams and
none have been inspected, a spokesman for
the corps said in Washington.
That inventory, completed in 1975, estimates
it would cost $367.5 million for the inspections.
Only $15 million is authorized for the program
this fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1, and no
decision has been made so far on how to
spend it.
Rep. Leo J. Ryan (D-Calif.), chairman of the
House environment subcommittee, said the
collapse could have been avoided "totally,
completely, absolutely" if the inspection prog
ram had been followed.
Carter postpones foreign trip
Washington — President Jimmy Carter has
officially postponed his planned foreign trip to
devote himself to energy legislation. He will
also be busy "planning for 1978" during his
stay-at-home time, aides said yesterday.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance announced
the postponement, saying Carter informed
heads of the nine countries on his intended
route that he hopes "a mutually convenient
date could be found for a later visit in the near
future."
Vance said the president's message em
phasized a conviction that "his personal in
volvement was vital to the development of
sound energy legislation."
OPEC price hikes foreseen
Vienna, Austria — The economic commis
sion of the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries (OPEC) met here yesterday to
prepare for a ministerial meeting next month
at which the cartel is expected to again raise
the price of oil, probably by five per cent.
OPEC spokesman Hamid Zaheri said current
oil prices would be reviewed and discussed at
the week-long preparatory meeting here. The
meeting is being held behind closed doors.
A five per cent increase in the price of crude
would mean an increase of about IV2 cents a
gallon at American pumps. The United States
imports about 40 per cent of its oil from OPEC
members.
The meeting opened as the authoritative
"Middle East Economic Survey" has reported
that "there is no hope" that the oil exporters

will heed U.S. calls for an oil price freeze
through 1978.
The oil newsletter said that even Saudi
Arabia, "the most moderate of the moder
ates," has declared that some increase is jus
tified. The Saudis have led efforts to keep
down the price of oil at recent OPEC confer
ences.
Reds parade for anniversary
Moscow — Hundreds of tanks and rockets
rumbled through Red Square yesterday as the
Soviet Union celebrated the 60th anniversary
of the Bolshevik revolution with its biggest
military parade in years.
President Leonid Brezhnev and other lead
ers remained throughout the two-hour
parade, which included more than 100,000
cheering, chanting Muscovites.
At the Kremlin reception, Brezhnev declared
"peace and socialism are inseparable. We will
do everything in our power for easing the
threat of war, for strengthening peaceful
cooperation among states."
He noted that "Soviet people live better
today than ever before both in spiritual and
material respects. At the same time, can
clearly see what still needs polishing up and
improvement and know how it shall be and will
be done."
About 330 military vehicles raced through
the square, a much bigger display than the 151
vehicles that were included in the last two
parades. Western observers saw this increase
as part of the major celebrations that have
been building up throughout the year to mark
the 60th anniversary.
Lost masterpiece uncovered
Florence, Italy — An American-financed re
search team, using sound and heat for the first
time to look for art, has concluded that a lost
masterpiece by Leonard da Vinci is probably
under another fresco in Florence's Great
Council Hall.
Now it's up to Italian authorities to decide
whether to look under the vast wall painting by
Giorgio Vasari, who remodeled the room four
centuries ago, and see if the researchers are
right.
"We've passed the ball to them at this

point," said Maurizio Seracini, scientific direc
tor of the year-long project that used ul
trasonic and infrared equipment.
Some art historians believe Leonardo used
an untried fresco technique and the colors
faded away. Others believe the fresco was co
vered up because it glorified the republic.
In an interview in Rome, Seracini said the
team zeroed in on the Vasari painting after
reconstructing a picture of the hall as it was in
the early 16th century and determining the
layers of material beneath the surface.
Ugandan pilots train in U.S.
Washington — Up to a dozen Uganda police
helicopter pilots are taking a "refresher
course" in Texas on visas obtained from the
United States, the State Department con
firmed yesterday.
The training is at the Bell Helicopter Co.
school at Fort Worth for pilots using civilian
models sold to Uganda up to 1971.
While the pilots will be permitted to com
plete the course, a department spokesman,
john Trattner, said, "We are tightening up
procedures" on visas for Ugandans.
Boy given life imprisonment
Miami — Ronny Zamora, 15, convicted of
murder last month despite his claim that tele
vision drove him to violence, was sentenced to
life in prison yesterday with no possibility of
parole for 25 years.
Circuit Judge Paul Baker, overruling defense
motions to upset the conviction or at least be
lenient, also sentenced Zamora to 53 years on
companion charges of burglary and assault.
Zamora, a Miami Beach high school student,
admitted killing his 83-year-old neighbor,
Elinor Haggart, when she surprised him and a
pal as they ransacked her home last spring.

Breeder decision still open
Washington — Congress is likely to sustain
President Jimmy Carter's veto of a bill authoriz
ing $80 million for the Clinch River breeder
reactor, congressional sources said yesterday.
But the veto, Carter's first veto since taking
office, may not be sufficient to kill the multi
billion dollar project at Oak Ridge, Tenn., its
backers claimed.
The president may have to take further ac
tion, possibly including a veto of a second bill,
to scuttle the program entirely.
Congress is expected to send Carter another
bill later this month appropriating the $80 mill
ion for the breeder along with nearly $7 billion
for a variety of other major federal programs.
Critics of the breeder have urged Carter to
veto this bill, too. But to do so would jeopar
dize the many other programs in the bill, in
cluding a measure carrying out the president's
decision to halt production of the B1 bomber.
In his Saturday veto message, Carterclaimed
the Clinch River project, on which ground has
yet to be broken, went against his administra
tion's intention to curb the spread of nuclear
weapons technology.
Breeder reactors transform small quantities
of conventional nuclear fuels — usually
uranium — into large amounts of plutonium.
This plutonium then can be used in other reac
tors to produce electricity, but may be used to
fashion crude nuclear weapons.
Breeder supporters acknowledged yester
day that it appears unlikely they can muster the
two-thirds vote in both House and Senate
needed to overturn Carter's veto.
Thirty eight senators and 162 House mem
bers voted previously against the project — a
big enough margin to sustain the veto in either
