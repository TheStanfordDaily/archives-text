# Trustees consider lifting sorority ban
## 
### 
The 33-year ban on sororities here
may be rescinded today when the
board of trustees considers the mat
ter at its regular November meeting
in San Francisco.
Reports on divestment from cor
porations with South African in
terests and final operating budget
expenditures from last fiscal year,
plus initial consideration of a prop
osal to build a new campus comput
ing center head a thin board agenda.
The Academic Affairs Committee is
slated to consider rescission of the
April 1944 ban on sororities. Lengthy
discussion on the matter was held
during the October board meeting,
according to Robert Hamrdla, assis
tant to the president for trustee af
fairs.
Dual system
The 1944 decision was one re
commended by a special committee
of the board which was based on its
conclusion "that a dual system of
sorority and University housing was
causing serious disruption among
women students, thus impairing the
University's ability to fulfill its educa

tional goals," a background report to
the board states.
"Over the past decade the Univer
sity has become increasingly alert to
our practices in light of our own pol
icy of non-discrimination," the re
port states.
Hamrdla said Title IX regulations
have been a major consideration in
the issue.
Divestment report
The Finance Committee in its
meeting yesterday, heard the report
on divestment and exclusion of in
vestment securities of corporations
with assets in South Africa.
The report, released Oct. 26 by
Rodney Adams, director of finance,
was requested by the board last
spring after members of the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy demanded the Uni
versity perform a cost-benefit
analysis of divestiture.
The report's conclusion was that
divestiture would have a negative
impact here. Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massy re
commended that the board not di
vest based on the report in a letter to
the trustees distributed with the re
port.
Computer move
A plan to consolidate the various
facilities of the Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP) will
also be considered by the board.
The proposal, still in the prelimi
nary stages, would consolidate all
SCIP facilities into the Jordan Quad,
which will become vacant when the
Computer Science and Communica
tion Departments relocate upon
completion of renovation projects in
the Outer Quad.
A site immediately south of Polya
Hall has been recommended for the
new building. In addition various
Jordan Quad buildings will be as
signed to SCIP.
Plans are for a 10- to 12- month
construction period commencing in
early summer 1978 with completion
slated for the end of fall quarter 1979.
The total cost estimate is $3.6 million.

Hamrdla said Title IX regulations
have been a major consideration in
the issue.
Divestment report
The Finance Committee in its
meeting yesterday, heard the report
on divestment and exclusion of in
vestment securities of corporations
with assets in South Africa.
The report, released Oct. 26 by
Rodney Adams, director of finance,
was requested by the board last
spring after members of the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy demanded the Uni
versity perform a cost-benefit
analysis of divestiture.
The report's conclusion was that
divestiture would have a negative
impact here. Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massy re
commended that the board not di
vest based on the report in a letter to
the trustees distributed with the re
port.
Computer move
A plan to consolidate the various
facilities of the Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP) will
also be considered by the board.
The proposal, still in the prelimi
nary stages, would consolidate all
SCIP facilities into the Jordan Quad,
which will become vacant when the
Computer Science and Communica
tion Departments relocate upon
completion of renovation projects in
the Outer Quad.
A site immediately south of Polya
Hall has been recommended for the
new building. In addition various
Jordan Quad buildings will be as
signed to SCIP.
Plans are for a 10- to 12- month
construction period commencing in
early summer 1978 with completion
slated for the end of fall quarter 1979.
The total cost estimate is $3.6 million.
The 33-year ban on sororities here
may be rescinded today when the
board of trustees considers the mat
ter at its regular November meeting
in San Francisco.
Reports on divestment from cor
porations with South African in
terests and final operating budget
expenditures from last fiscal year,
plus initial consideration of a prop
osal to build a new campus comput
ing center head a thin board agenda.
The Academic Affairs Committee is
slated to consider rescission of the
April 1944 ban on sororities. Lengthy
discussion on the matter was held
during the October board meeting,
according to Robert Hamrdla, assis
tant to the president for trustee af
fairs.
Dual system
The 1944 decision was one re
commended by a special committee
of the board which was based on its
conclusion "that a dual system of
sorority and University housing was
causing serious disruption among
women students, thus impairing the
University's ability to fulfill its educa

tional goals," a background report to
the board states.
"Over the past decade the Univer
sity has become increasingly alert to
our practices in light of our own pol
icy of non-discrimination," the re
port states.
Hamrdla said Title IX regulations
