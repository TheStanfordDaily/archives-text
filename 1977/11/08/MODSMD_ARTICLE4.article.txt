# Energy expenditures increase

### Erik Cleage 
Last year Stanford spent nearly $3.8 million on energy
compared to $1.4 million in 1971-72, according to a new
report by Robert McKnight, manager of utilities at Plant
Services.
The increase in cost came despite a reduction in usage
of nearly 20 per cent over the same five-year period.
During the past year alone, Pacific Gas & Electric rates for
electricity have nearly doubled, increasing from 2.29
cents to 4.38 cents per kilowatt hour.
The University's expenditures for electricity alone
rose from $867,840 in 1971-72 to $2,080,613 last year,
according to the report.
Natural gas costs to the University increased nearly
300 per cent, rising from $579,905 to $1,704,589 during
the same period.
New buildings
Electrical use was cut 17 per cent and natural gas use 20
per cent despite the addition of several new buildings to
the University's total plant, McKnight said.
Stanford's conservation efforts began in the fall of

1973 when the energy crisis first hit, McKnight said. At
that time Plant Services initiated weekend shut-downs
and automation of heating and lighting facilities.
Lighting uses which were not absolutely essential
were terminated and lower wattage bulbs were substi
tuted where possible.
New temperatures
In addition, the University has cut heating and cooling
costs considerably by maintaining temperatures at 68
degrees in the winter instead of 75 degrees and 75 de
grees in the summer instead of 68 degrees.
McKnight said this practice saves approximately 10 per
cent in costs each year, amounting to several hundred
thousands of dollars.
Despite strong efforts by Plant Services and the Uni
versity as a whole, McKnight concedes that energy con
servation efforts are not at their maximum and feels that
there is still further need for increased energy savings.
Currently, the University is maintaining close to a 26
per cent cutback from last year's energy consumption,
McKnight said.
