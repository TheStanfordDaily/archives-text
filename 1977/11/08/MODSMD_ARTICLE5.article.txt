## Possible return of sororities hinges on Trustees' decision 
### Bruce Charonnat 
The 33-year-old ban of sororities
here may end today.
The Board of Trustees, meeting in
San Francisco, will decide whether to
allow sororities to return to campus.
The board approved the ban in
1944 after a lengthy study concluded
that sororities "tend to divide Stan
ford women into two competitive
groups . . . the women students are
so tense and tired (during rush) that
their college work suffers unmistak
ably."
According to the Report of the
President for the academic year end
ing Aug. 31, 1944, "During the year
the University took steps to solve a
difficult social and housing problem
for women students by abolishing
sororities."
Small group
For many years, the report said,
nine active chapters of national
sororities existed on campus. How
ever, they "provided for only a small
percentage of the women students,"
with most women living in
University-operated residences.
In February 1943, the report said,
the Board of Trustees created a
committee to consider the problem
of "differences which arose between
sorority and non-sorority groups."
For 14 months, the committee held
hearings with students, alumnae and
sorority representatives.
The committee noted two interest
ing facts; first, that both sorority and

non-sorority women had raised the
issue, and second, that "women stu
dents themselves agreed upon the
existence of serious defects in the
sorority system at Stanford."
Three conclusions
The committee, according to the
report, reported the following con
clusions to the Board of Trustees:
"1) The dual system of responsi
bility for the housing and social prog
ram now in effect is not in the best
interests of the women students at
Stanford.
"2) This system has caused serious
disunity among Stanford women,
impairing the University's ability to
meet its imperative obligations and
responsibilities in respect of women
students.
"3) Remedies heretofore prop
osed, including changes in rushing
rules, will not eliminate the funda
mental causes of the disunity."
The committee went on to re
commend that the Board of Trustees
authorize the "discontinuance of
sororities" and the "unification of
women's housing under University
ownership and supervision."
The committee's recommenda
tions, the report said, were adopted
unanimously at a special meeting
held on April 20, 1944.
Title IX
Interest in the sorority issue was
renewed with the emergence of Title
IX of the Fligher Education Amend
ments of 1972. Title IX states that no

one shall be subjected to discrimina
tion on the basis of sex "under any
education program or activity receiv
ing Federal financial assistance."
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of students, Title IX
made the University examine its pol
icy of non-discrimination on the
basis of sex. In doing so, Robinson
said, the University saw that its policy
was contradicted by the presence of
fraternities and the absence of
sororities.
Discussion and studies of the issue
were initiated last spring, and at their
Oct. 11 meeting, the Board of Trus
tees considered both administration
and student viewpoints.
Students' choice
In a paper circulated among board
members, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons pointed out, "For many
years, the University has fostered an
egalitarian housing system, one
based on the premise that students
should choose their houses rather
than houses choosing students."
The dean has "sought a housing
policy that has maintained the Uni
versity's long-standing commitment
to the currently existing fraternities
while trying to minimize the amount
of additional housing that is filled by
subjectively selective methods."
This housing policy, however,
conflicts with Title IX and the Univer
sity's policy of non-discrimination on
the basis of sex, and the administra
tion's stand on the issue is in favor of

ending the ban, Robinson said.
Also presented at the board's Oc
tober meeting were the views of 40
women undergraduates, outlined in
a paper calling for the return of
sororities.
The group, headed by seniors
Bonnie McColl, Marian Stephenson,
and Terry Elms, claims that "the ac
tual purpose of establishing a soror
ity on campus is not only to satisfy
Title IX, or give women an alternative
to single-sex University housing.
"We see a clear desire for women
to be able to unite with others of
common interests and to hold meet
ings or other events that . . . have
previously been hampered."
The group said that "many wo
men, given the choice, would inves
tigate the sorority option, and would
seek to join."
Sorority requests
If the ban is rescinded by the
board, according to the University
News Service, Stanford would "fairly
evaluate requests to return to cam
pus on their individual merits."
The evaluation would take into
consideration such factors as "stu
dent interest and demand for soior
ity membership, ability to finance a
new residence, temporary housing
for a colonizing group, and the pre
sence of informed and supportive
advisers, alumae and others."

Lyons added that "Stanford frater

to campus, we would want these
conditions to exist in them as well."

1944 after a lengthy study concluded
that sororities "tend to divide Stan
ford women into two competitive
groups . . . the women students are
so tense and tired (during rush) that
their college work suffers unmistak
ably."
According to the Report of the
President for the academic year end
ing Aug. 31, 1944, "During the year
the University took steps to solve a
difficult social and housing problem
for women students by abolishing
sororities."
Small group
For many years, the report said,
nine active chapters of national
sororities existed on campus. How
ever, they "provided for only a small
percentage of the women students,"
with most women living in
University-operated residences.
In February 1943, the report said,
the Board of Trustees created a
committee to consider the problem
of "differences which arose between
sorority and non-sorority groups."
For 14 months, the committee held
hearings with students, alumnae and
sorority representatives.
The committee noted two interest
ing facts; first, that both sorority and

non-sorority women had raised the
issue, and second, that "women stu
dents themselves agreed upon the
existence of serious defects in the
sorority system at Stanford."
Three conclusions
The committee, according to the
report, reported the following con
clusions to the Board of Trustees:
"1) The dual system of responsi
bility for the housing and social prog
ram now in effect is not in the best
interests of the women students at
Stanford.
"2) This system has caused serious
disunity among Stanford women,
impairing the University's ability to
meet its imperative obligations and
responsibilities in respect of women
students.
"3) Remedies heretofore prop
osed, including changes in rushing
rules, will not eliminate the funda
mental causes of the disunity."
The committee went on to re
commend that the Board of Trustees
authorize the "discontinuance of
sororities" and the "unification of
women's housing under University
ownership and supervision."
The committee's recommenda
tions, the report said, were adopted
unanimously at a special meeting
held on April 20, 1944.
Title IX
Interest in the sorority issue was
renewed with the emergence of Title
IX of the Fligher Education Amend
ments of 1972. Title IX states that no

one shall be subjected to discrimina
tion on the basis of sex "under any
education program or activity receiv
ing Federal financial assistance."
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of students, Title IX
made the University examine its pol
icy of non-discrimination on the
basis of sex. In doing so, Robinson
said, the University saw that its policy
was contradicted by the presence of
fraternities and the absence of
sororities.
Discussion and studies of the issue
were initiated last spring, and at their
Oct. 11 meeting, the Board of Trus
tees considered both administration
and student viewpoints.
Students' choice
In a paper circulated among board
members, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons pointed out, "For many
years, the University has fostered an
egalitarian housing system, one
based on the premise that students
should choose their houses rather
than houses choosing students."
The dean has "sought a housing
policy that has maintained the Uni
versity's long-standing commitment
to the currently existing fraternities
while trying to minimize the amount
of additional housing that is filled by
subjectively selective methods."
This housing policy, however,
conflicts with Title IX and the Univer
sity's policy of non-discrimination on
the basis of sex, and the administra
tion's stand on the issue is in favor of

ending the ban, Robinson said.
Also presented at the board's Oc
tober meeting were the views of 40
women undergraduates, outlined in
a paper calling for the return of
sororities.
The group, headed by seniors
Bonnie McColl, Marian Stephenson,
and Terry Elms, claims that "the ac
tual purpose of establishing a soror
ity on campus is not only to satisfy
Title IX, or give women an alternative
to single-sex University housing.
"We see a clear desire for women
to be able to unite with others of
common interests and to hold meet
ings or other events that . . . have
previously been hampered."
The group said that "many wo
men, given the choice, would inves
tigate the sorority option, and would
seek to join."
Sorority requests
If the ban is rescinded by the
board, according to the University
News Service, Stanford would "fairly
evaluate requests to return to cam
pus on their individual merits."
The evaluation would take into
consideration such factors as "stu
dent interest and demand for soior
ity membership, ability to finance a
new residence, temporary housing
for a colonizing group, and the pre
sence of informed and supportive
advisers, alumae and others."

said. The dean will "respond to and
cooperate with groups of Stanford
women undergraduates who are in
terested in establishing selective all
women's housing.
The administration is wary,
though, of national sororities. Ac
cording to Lyons, sorority advisers
and deans were contacted at other
institutions, and they pointed out
that "fraternities tend to have much
more autonomy from their nation
als" than sororities; fraternities are
"less bound by rules, regulations
and traditions."
Lyons added that "Stanford frater
nities could certainly be described in
those terms," and that "if selective
all-women's housing were to return
to campus, we would want these
conditions to exist in them as well."
The 33-year-old ban of sororities
here may end today.
The Board of Trustees, meeting in

ing Aug. 31, 1944, "During the year
the University took steps to solve a
difficult social and housing problem
for women students by abolishing
sororities."
Small group
For many years, the report said,
nine active chapters of national
sororities existed on campus. How
ever, they "provided for only a small
percentage of the women students,"
with most women living in
University-operated residences.
In February 1943, the report said,
the Board of Trustees created a
committee to consider the problem
of "differences which arose between
sorority and non-sorority groups."
For 14 months, the committee held
hearings with students, alumnae and
sorority representatives.
The committee noted two interest
ing facts; first, that both sorority and

non-sorority women had raised the
issue, and second, that "women stu
dents themselves agreed upon the
existence of serious defects in the
sorority system at Stanford."
Three conclusions
The committee, according to the
report, reported the following con
clusions to the Board of Trustees:
"1) The dual system of responsi
bility for the housing and social prog
ram now in effect is not in the best
interests of the women students at
Stanford.
"2) This system has caused serious
disunity among Stanford women,
impairing the University's ability to
meet its imperative obligations and
responsibilities in respect of women
students.
"3) Remedies heretofore prop
osed, including changes in rushing
rules, will not eliminate the funda
mental causes of the disunity."
The committee went on to re
commend that the Board of Trustees
authorize the "discontinuance of
sororities" and the "unification of
women's housing under University
ownership and supervision."
The committee's recommenda
tions, the report said, were adopted
unanimously at a special meeting
held on April 20, 1944.
Title IX
Interest in the sorority issue was
renewed with the emergence of Title
IX of the Fligher Education Amend
ments of 1972. Title IX states that no

one shall be subjected to discrimina
tion on the basis of sex "under any
education program or activity receiv
ing Federal financial assistance."
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of students, Title IX
made the University examine its pol
icy of non-discrimination on the
basis of sex. In doing so, Robinson
said, the University saw that its policy
was contradicted by the presence of
fraternities and the absence of
sororities.
Discussion and studies of the issue
were initiated last spring, and at their
Oct. 11 meeting, the Board of Trus
tees considered both administration
and student viewpoints.
Students' choice
In a paper circulated among board
members, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons pointed out, "For many
years, the University has fostered an
egalitarian housing system, one
based on the premise that students
should choose their houses rather
than houses choosing students."
The dean has "sought a housing
policy that has maintained the Uni
versity's long-standing commitment
to the currently existing fraternities
while trying to minimize the amount
of additional housing that is filled by
subjectively selective methods."
This housing policy, however,
conflicts with Title IX and the Univer
sity's policy of non-discrimination on
the basis of sex, and the administra
tion's stand on the issue is in favor of

ending the ban, Robinson said.
Also presented at the board's Oc
tober meeting were the views of 40
women undergraduates, outlined in
a paper calling for the return of
sororities.
The group, headed by seniors
Bonnie McColl, Marian Stephenson,
and Terry Elms, claims that "the ac
tual purpose of establishing a soror
ity on campus is not only to satisfy
Title IX, or give women an alternative
to single-sex University housing.
"We see a clear desire for women
to be able to unite with others of
common interests and to hold meet
ings or other events that . . . have
previously been hampered."
The group said that "many wo
men, given the choice, would inves
tigate the sorority option, and would
seek to join."
Sorority requests
If the ban is rescinded by the
board, according to the University
News Service, Stanford would "fairly
evaluate requests to return to cam
pus on their individual merits."
The evaluation would take into
consideration such factors as "stu
dent interest and demand for soior
ity membership, ability to finance a
new residence, temporary housing
for a colonizing group, and the pre
sence of informed and supportive
advisers, alumae and others."
"The possibility of selective all
women's housing does not necessar

ily mean national sororities," Lyons
said. The dean will "respond to and
cooperate with groups of Stanford
women undergraduates who are in
terested in establishing selective all
women's housing.
The administration is wary,
though, of national sororities. Ac
cording to Lyons, sorority advisers
and deans were contacted at other
institutions, and they pointed out
that "fraternities tend to have much
more autonomy from their nation
als" than sororities; fraternities are
"less bound by rules, regulations
and traditions."
Lyons added that "Stanford frater
nities could certainly be described in
those terms," and that "if selective
all-women's housing were to return
to campus, we would want these
conditions to exist in them as well."
The 33-year-old ban of sororities
here may end today.
The Board of Trustees, meeting in
San Francisco, will decide whether to
allow sororities to return to campus.
The board approved the ban in
1944 after a lengthy study concluded
that sororities "tend to divide Stan
ford women into two competitive
groups . . . the women students are
so tense and tired (during rush) that
their college work suffers unmistak
ably."
