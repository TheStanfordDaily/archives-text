# Nuclear power dangerous
## 
### 
Thursday evening, two of the na
tion's foremost energy policy thin
kers will address students in Kresge
Auditorium. Physicist Amory Lovins
and biologist Barry Commoner un
doubtedly will castigate the Carter
administration for its continued sup
port of nuclear power. For those who
still retain their indefatigable faith in
this high technology, I would like to
elaborate upon a key component of
their theses: The spread of nuclear
power will ultimately spread nuclear
weapons to dozens of nations and
terrorists. Fanatical pessimism, you
say?
First consider that a nuclear
weapon is not difficult to huild. De
signs have already entered the com
mon literature (e.g. London Times).
Students at the Massachusetts Insti-•
tute of Technology and Princeton
have designed nuclear bombs for
homework assignments. The only
real impediment to bomb-building is
the relative scarcity of highly en
riched uranium and plutonium, the
substances used in nuclear reactors.
Nuclear proponents assure us that
our security systems are sufficiently
tight to prevent the theft of the 45 lbs.
of highly enriched uranium or 12 lbs.
of plutonium needed to yield an exp
losive nuclear reaction. Unfortu
nately, history does not inspire such
confidence.
The Government Accounting Of
fice has reported that, as of 1977, the
U.S. has been unable to account for
J4OO lbs. of plutonium and 4800 lbs.
of enriched uranium. Though losses
were attributed to sloppy accounting
methods, one Nuclear Regulatory
Commission member conceded, "I
can't swear that there (was) never any
theft." The ambiguity of whether a
"missing" pound of plutonium is cl
inging to a remote pipe or actually
stolen is one of the inherent prob
lems of nuclear power.
If no nuclear materials have been
stolen, the reason is mostly luck.
Consider some worldwide examples
of "foolproof" anti-theft security sys
tems:
In the early 19605, the U.S. mafia

helped divert trainloads of uranium
from India to Chinese or Pakistani
agents in Nepal. In 1966, 20 fuel rods
were stolen from a British power
plant and only recovered when a
truck was routinely checked in Lon
don. In March, 1969, a container of a
highly enriched uranium compound
was "lost" en route from Ohio to
Missouri and eventually found in
Boston by the FBI. Literally hundreds
of examples of "exceptional" sec
urity breaches exist, implying that
even our best efforts to prevent nuc
lear theft may not be good enough.
One particularly noteworthy
anomoly occurred at a nuclear fabri
cation plant in Apollo, Pennsylvania.
In the mid-19605, it had lost track of
nearly 400 lbs. of processed uranium.
Where did Apollo's uranium go?
This summer, ClAofficials stated that
they were # "convinced" that Israel
had successfully executed a smuggl
ing operation there. Now Rolling
Stone is about to publish a report
confirming Israeli complicity. Repor
ters Howard Kohn and Barbara
Newman assert that when the opera
tions were exposed in 1966, Presi
dent Lyndon johnson ordered CIA
director Richard Helms to keep the
incident hushed and to cancel all
further investigations. Faced with a
curtailed supply of uranium, Israel
then executed some of the most in
credible heists in history.
In 1968, a freighter ship arrived in
Genoa, Italy with a new registry,
name and crew, but missing its origi
nal cargo— 220 tons of uranium. Paul
Leventhal, a former counsel to the
Senate Government Operations
Committee, and other sources are
convinced that the stolen material
ended up in Israel.
Kohn and Newman allege that Is
rael has also hijacked trucks in Fr
ance and Britain and staged a truck
robbery in West Germany, where the
Bonn government was given $3.7
million and "scientific secrets" in ex
change for the "stolen" uranium.
Thanks to these uranium acquisi
tions and a "peaceful" reactor in the
Negev Desert, Israel has now

Mike Shuman

stockpiled from 15 (CIA estimate) to
150 nuclear weapons.
To skeptics of nuclear power, .the
Israeli fiasco is no surprise. India
misused a Canadian reactor (using
U.S. heavy water) to obtain
plutonium for its first nuclear
weapons test in 1974. France and
West Germany are now forging
ahead with their sales of nuclear re
processing plants to Pakistan and
Brazil, respectively, giving each a
technology that extracts weapons
grade plutonium from nuclear reac
tor waste.
All in all, global nuclear power de
velopment, according to the Stoc
kholm International Peace Research
Institute, has paved the way for some
30 nations to become nuclear
weapons states by 1980, nudging the
world closer to cataclysmic nuclear
wars.
Ted Taylor, one of the leading ad
vocates of stringent safeguards
against nuclear theft, espouses the
government's sanguine belief that an
adequate security system can be de
vised to facilitate cautious nuclear
power expansion. Asked to define
"adequate," Taylor responded, "If a
nuclear bomb went off every now
and then, I would consider that
adequate."

Thursday evening, two of the na
tion's foremost energy policy thin
kers will address students in Kresge
Auditorium. Physicist Amory Lovins
and biologist Barry Commoner un
doubtedly will castigate the Carter
administration for its continued sup
port of nuclear power. For those who
still retain their indefatigable faith in
this high technology, I would like to
elaborate upon a key component of
their theses: The spread of nuclear
power will ultimately spread nuclear
weapons to dozens of nations and
terrorists. Fanatical pessimism, you
say?
First consider that a nuclear
weapon is not difficult to huild. De
signs have already entered the com
mon literature (e.g. London Times).
Students at the Massachusetts Insti-•
tute of Technology and Princeton
have designed nuclear bombs for
homework assignments. The only
real impediment to bomb-building is
the relative scarcity of highly en
riched uranium and plutonium, the
substances used in nuclear reactors.
Nuclear proponents assure us that
our security systems are sufficiently
tight to prevent the theft of the 45 lbs.
of highly enriched uranium or 12 lbs.
of plutonium needed to yield an exp
losive nuclear reaction. Unfortu
nately, history does not inspire such
confidence.
The Government Accounting Of
fice has reported that, as of 1977, the
U.S. has been unable to account for
J4OO lbs. of plutonium and 4800 lbs.
of enriched uranium. Though losses
were attributed to sloppy accounting
methods, one Nuclear Regulatory
Commission member conceded, "I
can't swear that there (was) never any
theft." The ambiguity of whether a
"missing" pound of plutonium is cl
inging to a remote pipe or actually
stolen is one of the inherent prob
lems of nuclear power.
If no nuclear materials have been
stolen, the reason is mostly luck.
Consider some worldwide examples
of "foolproof" anti-theft security sys
tems:
In the early 19605, the U.S. mafia

helped divert trainloads of uranium
from India to Chinese or Pakistani
agents in Nepal. In 1966, 20 fuel rods
were stolen from a British power
plant and only recovered when a
truck was routinely checked in Lon
don. In March, 1969, a container of a
highly enriched uranium compound
was "lost" en route from Ohio to
Missouri and eventually found in
Boston by the FBI. Literally hundreds
of examples of "exceptional" sec
urity breaches exist, implying that
even our best efforts to prevent nuc
lear theft may not be good enough.
One particularly noteworthy
anomoly occurred at a nuclear fabri
cation plant in Apollo, Pennsylvania.
In the mid-19605, it had lost track of
nearly 400 lbs. of processed uranium.
Where did Apollo's uranium go?
This summer, ClAofficials stated that
they were # "convinced" that Israel
had successfully executed a smuggl
ing operation there. Now Rolling
Stone is about to publish a report
confirming Israeli complicity. Repor
ters Howard Kohn and Barbara
Newman assert that when the opera
tions were exposed in 1966, Presi
dent Lyndon johnson ordered CIA
director Richard Helms to keep the
incident hushed and to cancel all
further investigations. Faced with a
curtailed supply of uranium, Israel
then executed some of the most in
credible heists in history.
In 1968, a freighter ship arrived in
Genoa, Italy with a new registry,
name and crew, but missing its origi
nal cargo— 220 tons of uranium. Paul
Leventhal, a former counsel to the
Senate Government Operations
Committee, and other sources are
convinced that the stolen material
ended up in Israel.
Kohn and Newman allege that Is
rael has also hijacked trucks in Fr
ance and Britain and staged a truck
robbery in West Germany, where the
Bonn government was given $3.7
million and "scientific secrets" in ex
change for the "stolen" uranium.
Thanks to these uranium acquisi
tions and a "peaceful" reactor in the
Negev Desert, Israel has now

Mike Shuman

stockpiled from 15 (CIA estimate) to
150 nuclear weapons.
To skeptics of nuclear power, .the
Israeli fiasco is no surprise. India
misused a Canadian reactor (using
U.S. heavy water) to obtain
plutonium for its first nuclear
weapons test in 1974. France and
West Germany are now forging
ahead with their sales of nuclear re
processing plants to Pakistan and
Brazil, respectively, giving each a
technology that extracts weapons
grade plutonium from nuclear reac
tor waste.
All in all, global nuclear power de
velopment, according to the Stoc
kholm International Peace Research
Institute, has paved the way for some
30 nations to become nuclear
weapons states by 1980, nudging the
world closer to cataclysmic nuclear
wars.
Ted Taylor, one of the leading ad
vocates of stringent safeguards
against nuclear theft, espouses the
government's sanguine belief that an
adequate security system can be de
vised to facilitate cautious nuclear
power expansion. Asked to define
"adequate," Taylor responded, "If a
nuclear bomb went off every now

against nuclear theft, espouses the
government's sanguine belief that an
adequate security system can be de
vised to facilitate cautious nuclear
power expansion. Asked to define
"adequate," Taylor responded, "If a
nuclear bomb went off every now
and then, I would consider that
adequate."

Thursday evening, two of the na
tion's foremost energy policy thin
kers will address students in Kresge
Auditorium. Physicist Amory Lovins
and biologist Barry Commoner un
doubtedly will castigate the Carter
administration for its continued sup
port of nuclear power. For those who
still retain their indefatigable faith in
this high technology, I would like to
elaborate upon a key component of
their theses: The spread of nuclear
power will ultimately spread nuclear
weapons to dozens of nations and
terrorists. Fanatical pessimism, you
say?
First consider that a nuclear
weapon is not difficult to huild. De
signs have already entered the com
mon literature (e.g. London Times).
Students at the Massachusetts Insti-•
tute of Technology and Princeton
have designed nuclear bombs for
homework assignments. The only
real impediment to bomb-building is
the relative scarcity of highly en
riched uranium and plutonium, the
substances used in nuclear reactors.
Nuclear proponents assure us that
our security systems are sufficiently
tight to prevent the theft of the 45 lbs.
of highly enriched uranium or 12 lbs.
of plutonium needed to yield an exp
losive nuclear reaction. Unfortu
nately, history does not inspire such
confidence.
The Government Accounting Of
fice has reported that, as of 1977, the
U.S. has been unable to account for
J4OO lbs. of plutonium and 4800 lbs.
of enriched uranium. Though losses
were attributed to sloppy accounting
methods, one Nuclear Regulatory
Commission member conceded, "I
can't swear that there (was) never any
theft." The ambiguity of whether a
"missing" pound of plutonium is cl
inging to a remote pipe or actually
stolen is one of the inherent prob
lems of nuclear power.
If no nuclear materials have been
stolen, the reason is mostly luck.
Consider some worldwide examples
of "foolproof" anti-theft security sys
tems:
In the early 19605, the U.S. mafia

helped divert trainloads of uranium
from India to Chinese or Pakistani
agents in Nepal. In 1966, 20 fuel rods
were stolen from a British power
plant and only recovered when a
truck was routinely checked in Lon
don. In March, 1969, a container of a
highly enriched uranium compound
was "lost" en route from Ohio to
Missouri and eventually found in
Boston by the FBI. Literally hundreds
of examples of "exceptional" sec
urity breaches exist, implying that
even our best efforts to prevent nuc
lear theft may not be good enough.
One particularly noteworthy
anomoly occurred at a nuclear fabri
cation plant in Apollo, Pennsylvania.
In the mid-19605, it had lost track of
nearly 400 lbs. of processed uranium.
Where did Apollo's uranium go?
This summer, ClAofficials stated that
they were # "convinced" that Israel
had successfully executed a smuggl
ing operation there. Now Rolling
Stone is about to publish a report
confirming Israeli complicity. Repor
ters Howard Kohn and Barbara
Newman assert that when the opera
tions were exposed in 1966, Presi
dent Lyndon johnson ordered CIA
director Richard Helms to keep the
incident hushed and to cancel all
further investigations. Faced with a
curtailed supply of uranium, Israel
then executed some of the most in
credible heists in history.
In 1968, a freighter ship arrived in
Genoa, Italy with a new registry,
name and crew, but missing its origi
nal cargo— 220 tons of uranium. Paul
Leventhal, a former counsel to the
Senate Government Operations
Committee, and other sources are
convinced that the stolen material
ended up in Israel.
Kohn and Newman allege that Is
rael has also hijacked trucks in Fr
ance and Britain and staged a truck
robbery in West Germany, where the
Bonn government was given $3.7
million and "scientific secrets" in ex
change for the "stolen" uranium.
Thanks to these uranium acquisi
tions and a "peaceful" reactor in the
Negev Desert, Israel has now

Mike Shuman

stockpiled from 15 (CIA estimate) to
150 nuclear weapons.
To skeptics of nuclear power, .the
Israeli fiasco is no surprise. India
misused a Canadian reactor (using
U.S. heavy water) to obtain
plutonium for its first nuclear
weapons test in 1974. France and
West Germany are now forging
ahead with their sales of nuclear re
processing plants to Pakistan and
Brazil, respectively, giving each a
technology that extracts weapons
grade plutonium from nuclear reac
tor waste.
All in all, global nuclear power de
velopment, according to the Stoc
kholm International Peace Research
Institute, has paved the way for some
30 nations to become nuclear
weapons states by 1980, nudging the
world closer to cataclysmic nuclear
wars.
