# Powersats fill energy needs

As Moshe Aelion suggested (Daily, Oct. 28), space
does offer solutions to most of our resource shortages. I
hasten to add that the uses of space technology Aelion
offered are by no means the most efficient nor desirable.
If appropriate steps are taken, the world's energy
needs could be supplied by Satellite Solar Power Sta
tions (SSPS or powersats) either built out of terrestial or
extra-terrestial (Moon or Asteroid) materials.
Powersats would collect sunlight, convert it to elec
tricity using a variety of proven methods, and finally
beam the energy to earth via microwaves.
SSPS offers many advantages over all other traditional
earth-based power generation schemes. Powersats do
not have the toxic waste associated with nuclear power
and do not produce the poisoning smoke associated
with a coal based economy.
Additionally, all power generation schemes produce
waste heat; SSPS is no better than nuclear or coal power
plants, but SSPS dumps its waste heat into space. Thus
the threat of disturbing the delicate thermal balance of
the planet, and causing the melting of the pole caps and
other disastrous climatic effects, is postponed. Hope
fully long enough for us to more effectively manage our
energy use!
There are several questionable aspects of the power
sat scheme. One area receiving much thought and study

is the beaming of microwaves through the atmosphere.
The current consensus of opinion being that as long as
the beam is made diffuse by using a large collector, no
potential health hazards will result.
While we're on the subject of health hazards, let's ask
ourselves about the safety implications of Aelion's
suggestion of lifting hundreds of tons of plutonium
through the atmosphere and off into space. Numerous
studies have been made of this proposal and most con
clude that even though the idea is technologically feasi
ble, there are environmental hazards no one is willing to
risk. Consider the consequences of a launch pad explo
sion, an in-flight explosion, or even sabotage. Such oc
currences are indeed remote, but why live with the
threat of such a potential disaster when powersats offer
such an attractive alternative?
Moshe claims nuclear waste dumping in space is "so
attractive" it's worth at least 10 per cent of the U.S.
defense budget annually. Current studies indicate that
the first SSPS could be delivering power, to an energy
hungry earth, at the same cost as nuclear or coal power,
by the year 1995.
All that for at most one per cent of the U.S. defense
budget annually!
