# Merit criterion of employment: analysis of the arguments

(First of three parts)
What are the proper criteria for
employing people? Until recently, it
was taken for granted that the only
proper criterion was the ability to do
a particular job. For example, it
would have been assumed that the
criterion for employing someone as
an engineer was his ability as an en
gineer.
Practice that did not conform to
this ideal was continually criticized.
Such practices as denying blacks jobs
because of their race were criticized
by reference to this ideal, that is,
these practices were criticized be

cause a person's race is not a criter
ion of his ability to do a job. As a
result of such criticism, legislation
such as the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964 was passed to prohibit some of
the practices that did not conform to
this ideal, such as using criteria of
race or sex for employment.
In recent years, however, in the
course of apparently criticizing prac
tices that did not conform to this
ideal, such practices have been ad
vocated. There has been a plethora
of arguments to justify appoint
ments on the basis of race, ethnic
group, and sex. I propose here to

examine several of these arguments:
the compensation argument, the
quota argument, and the biased
judgment argument.
The compensation argument is
that members of a given racial,
ethnic, or sexual group X should be
given preference in employment be
cause members of group X in the past
were denied such employment in the
past because of their membership in
group X. This is supposed to be com
pensation to members of group X for
the past wrongs done to members of
group X in denying them employ
ment because of this membership.
For example, the argument is that
if in the past qualified women were
not employed as engineers solely
because they were women, there
fore, now, in compensation, qual
ified women should be hired as en
gineers because they are women.
Several defects
This argument suffers from sev
eral related defects. It is based on a
confused notion of compensation; it
implies an endless retributive feud
principle; and it is inconsistent.
a) Compensation: I can compen
sate someone, for example, Bill)., if I
have done him some wrong and can
make up that wrong. Suppose, for
example, that I dislike redheads, and
I have refused to employ Bill J. to
tune my piano because he is a red
head. One can then argue that I have
denied him employment for a bad
reason and so have treated him un
fairly (and have thereby lost the ser
vices of a piano tuner!). In this case, I
could compensate Bill J. for this un
fair treatment by hiring him, or

perhaps by some other means.
The wrong to be compensated for
is the wrong done to the individual
wronged. Bill J. receives no compen
sation if I hire another redhead, Tom
S., and Tom S. cannot receive com
pensation for the wrong done to Bill
j., because the wrong was not done
to him; that is, Tom 5. was not de
nied employment because of his red
hair.
Elementary mistake
' The current compensation argu
ments, however, make this elemen
tary mistake. It is argued, for exam
ple, that blacks should be hired be
cause they are blacks, in compensa
tion for past unfair, racially dis
criminatory practices. But John P., a
black, who suffered from such prac
tices in the past, is in no way com
pensated by the present hiring of
Paul R., also a black. And Paul R. de
serves no compensation now, since
he was not previously wronged by
being denied employment because
of his race.
b)lnfinite Retributive Redress: The
compensation argument depends on
the assumption that one does wrong
to someone else if one refuses to
employ a person because of his
membership in some particular ra
cial, ethnic, or sexual group. Hiring
Paul R. now, because he is black,
rather than hiring nonblack S be
cause he is not black, is doing wrong
to nonblack S, according to this as
sumption. So, according to the com
pensation argument, he or other
nonblacks deserve compensation.
Thus, in compensation, members of
this group should be hired because

they are nonblacks. This, in turn, will
wrong blacks, who will then deserve
compensation, and so on ad in
finitum. Thus, the attempted com
pensation will not right wrongs but
will continue the wrongdoing
forever.
Inconsistency
c) Inconsistency: The compensa
tion argument is inconsistent. It as
sumes both that it is wrong to hire
people because of their membership
in a given racial, ethnic, or sexual
group and that it is right to do so.
Employing members of group X now,
because of such membership, in pre
ference to members of group non-X,
is to do precisely what is con
demned.
Using the word positive or affirma
tive, as in "positive (racial, ethnic, or
sexual) discrimination" or "affirma
tive action," changes the fact not one
iota. The condemned past policy
could just as well have been termed
positive discrimination or affirmative
action, and the discriminatory policy
presently advocated is just as "nega
tive" against members of group X.
If policies of hiring people accord
ing to racial, ethnic or sexual criteria
were bad in the past, they are bad
now. If they are not bad now, they
were not bad in the past.
In summary: the compensation
argument is confused about who
gets compensated for what. It entails
an infinite redress of wrongdoing
and subsequent compensation. And
it contradicts the principle of proper
employment practices, whose viola
tion is supposed to be compensated

for.
The percentage-quota argument is
that a quota of K per cent of any given
kind of job should be given to mem
bers of a given racial, ethnic, or sex
ual group X because members of
group X make up K per cent of the
total population. If everyone were
treated fairly, according to this ar
gument, then the percentage of
people in any sub-group of
employed, such as engineers or
mathematicians, would be the same
as in the population as a whole.
For example, approximately 50 per
cent of the population are women.
Therefore, if people were treated
fairly, according to the argument, 50
per cent of engineers and
mathematicians would be women.
The percentage argument is that if 50
per cent of engineers and
mathematicians are not women, it
must be made to be the case by hir
ing on the basis of sex, so that 50 per
cent of engineers and mathemati
cians are women.
This argument assumes that what
would have been is known, that
theories of what would have been
are a sounder basis for practice than
knowledge of what is, and that it is
fairer to treat people according to
what they might have been rather
than according to what they are.
