# Judging individuals on own merits

(Second of three parts)
Assumptions
a) What would have been: The
percentage argument assumes that
fair employment policies are those
that allow for the hiring of individuals
according to their merits. The argu
ment is that, if in the past all indi
viduals had been hired according to
their merits, then the percentages of
people of different racial, ethnic, and
sexual groups in any particular kind
of employment would be the same as
in the population as a whole. This is
not, however, self-evident.
There may be differences in in
terest, talent, education, and train
ing in population subgroups, so that
hiring by merit will not result in such
percentages. For any or all of these
reasons the percentage of
mathematicians or engineers, tor
example, from a given racial, ethnic,
or sexual subgroup may differ from
the percentage of the population
composed of members of that sub
group.
If this assumption were correct, of
course, then the predicted percen
tages would occur within whatever
span of time would be necessary for a
policy of hiring by merit to take ef
fect. But then, in order to get these
percentages, it would not be neces
sary to hire according to percentages
but only according to merit. Since
the percentage argument advocates
a policy that is intended to rectify
policies of not hiring according to
merit, it actually assumes that people

should be hired only on the basis of
their merit.
Examination required
Whatever method could be used
to find out about the distribution ot
interest in and talent for a particular
kind of activity would require exa
mining individuals, individual by in
dividual. That is, trie
evidence of distributions of charac
teristics in a given population de
pends on the evidence about indi
viduals of that population. Evidence
of distributions derived from evi
dence of distributions in random
samples of the population still ulti
mately depends on evidence about
individuals, namely, the individuals
in the random samples.
The evidence about the interests
and talents of individuals is thus
stronger and more certain than the
evidence about distributions of
these interests and talents in the
population and population sub
groups to which these individuals be
long, since the latter evidence is de
pendent on the former. It follows,
then, that the policy ot hiring peop'e
according to the pe r centage assump
tion is more dubious than that of hir
ing people according to their indi
vidual merits, since the evidence for
the percentage assumption is weaker
and more dubious than that about
the individual merits of people.
The percentage argument, in other
words, begs the question. Its validity
depends on the assumption that
people can be evaluated individu

ally. To argue that the results of judg
ing people individually must be
wrong because these results do not
conform to the hypothesized per
centages is to reject the only possible
basis for knowing these percentages.
Thus the percentage argument re
futes itself, for the only reason to ac
cept the view that, for example, 50
per cent of mathematicians should
be women because 50 per cent of
those with the greatest interest in
and talent for mathematics are
women is that it has been disco
vered, by examining individuals, that
50 per cent of those with the greatest
interest in and talent for mathematics
are women. It could be discovered
only by examining individuals. The
percentage argument thus presup
poses that the most accurate way to
judge individuals is to judge each in
dividually.
In summary: The percentage ar
gument depends on the verv ability
to judge individuals on their own
merits whose use it rejects. It advo
cates hiring people without regard
for their qualifications and solely be
cause of their membership in some
racial, ethnic, or sexual group X, be
cause these individuals would have
been qualified, given different edu
cation.
But the argument itsel'
on the assumption that there are
qualifications that these individuals
would have had,given different edu
cation. And the justification of the
percentage assumption must ulti-

mately depend on the ability to judge
the qualifications of individuals, the
kind of judgment the percentage ar
gument rejects.
Biased-judgment argument
It has been argued that evaluating
individuals on the basis of merit,
without regard to their racial, ethnic,
or sexual characteristics, is impossi
ble because only members of any
such group X are capable of evaluat
ing other members of group X and
because present criteria of evalua
tion are biased in favor of members
of group non-X. Therefore, members
of group X must be chosen in order
to hire other members of group X,
and members of group X must be
hired in order to compensate for the
bias of present criteria for evaluating
merit.
a) Who evaluates? The argument
that only members of racial, ethnic,
or sexual group X should evaluate
other members of group X is that
only they can understand members
of group X, by which is meant that
only they can understand the think
ing of members of group X. How can
the policy based on this argument be
implemented and how can the ar
gument itself be justified?

Assumptions
a) What would have been: The
percentage argument assumes that
fair employment policies are those
that allow for the hiring of individuals
according to their merits. The argu
ment is that, if in the past all indi
viduals had been hired according to
their merits, then the percentages of
people of different racial, ethnic, and
sexual groups in any particular kind
of employment would be the same as
in the population as a whole. This is
not, however, self-evident.
There may be differences in in
terest, talent, education, and train
ing in population subgroups, so that
hiring by merit will not result in such
percentages. For any or all of these
reasons the percentage of
mathematicians or engineers, tor
example, from a given racial, ethnic,
or sexual subgroup may differ from
the percentage of the population
composed of members of that sub
group.
If this assumption were correct, of
course, then the predicted percen
tages would occur within whatever
span of time would be necessary for a
policy of hiring by merit to take ef
fect. But then, in order to get these
percentages, it would not be neces
sary to hire according to percentages
but only according to merit. Since
the percentage argument advocates
a policy that is intended to rectify
policies of not hiring according to
merit, it actually assumes that people

should be hired only on the basis of
their merit.
Examination required
Whatever method could be used
to find out about the distribution ot
interest in and talent for a particular
kind of activity would require exa
mining individuals, individual by in
dividual. That is, trie
evidence of distributions of charac
teristics in a given population de
pends on the evidence about indi
viduals of that population. Evidence
of distributions derived from evi
dence of distributions in random
samples of the population still ulti
mately depends on evidence about
individuals, namely, the individuals
in the random samples.
The evidence about the interests
and talents of individuals is thus
stronger and more certain than the
evidence about distributions of
these interests and talents in the
population and population sub
groups to which these individuals be
long, since the latter evidence is de
pendent on the former. It follows,
then, that the policy ot hiring peop'e
according to the pe r centage assump
tion is more dubious than that of hir
ing people according to their indi
vidual merits, since the evidence for
the percentage assumption is weaker
and more dubious than that about
the individual merits of people.
The percentage argument, in other
words, begs the question. Its validity
depends on the assumption that
people can be evaluated individu

ally. To argue that the results of judg
ing people individually must be
wrong because these results do not
conform to the hypothesized per
centages is to reject the only possible
basis for knowing these percentages.
Thus the percentage argument re
futes itself, for the only reason to ac
cept the view that, for example, 50
per cent of mathematicians should
be women because 50 per cent of
those with the greatest interest in
and talent for mathematics are
women is that it has been disco
vered, by examining individuals, that
50 per cent of those with the greatest
interest in and talent for mathematics
are women. It could be discovered
only by examining individuals. The
percentage argument thus presup
poses that the most accurate way to
judge individuals is to judge each in
dividually.
In summary: The percentage ar
gument depends on the verv ability
to judge individuals on their own
merits whose use it rejects. It advo
cates hiring people without regard
for their qualifications and solely be
cause of their membership in some
racial, ethnic, or sexual group X, be
cause these individuals would have
been qualified, given different edu
cation.
But the argument itsel'
on the assumption that there are
qualifications that these individuals
would have had,given different edu
cation. And the justification of the
percentage assumption must ulti-

mately depend on the ability to judge
the qualifications of individuals, the
kind of judgment the percentage ar
gument rejects.
Biased-judgment argument
It has been argued that evaluating
individuals on the basis of merit,
without regard to their racial, ethnic,
or sexual characteristics, is impossi
ble because only members of any
such group X are capable of evaluat
ing other members of group X and
because present criteria of evalua
tion are biased in favor of members
of group non-X. Therefore, members
of group X must be chosen in order
to hire other members of group X,
and members of group X must be
hired in order to compensate for the
bias of present criteria for evaluating
merit.
a) Who evaluates? The argument
that only members of racial, ethnic,
or sexual group X should evaluate
other members of group X is that
only they can understand members
of group X, by which is meant that
only they can understand the think
ing of members of group X. How can
the policy based on this argument be
implemented and how can the ar
gument itself be justified?

Assumptions
a) What would have been: The
percentage argument assumes that
fair employment policies are those
that allow for the hiring of individuals
according to their merits. The argu
ment is that, if in the past all indi
viduals had been hired according to
their merits, then the percentages of
people of different racial, ethnic, and
sexual groups in any particular kind
of employment would be the same as
in the population as a whole. This is
not, however, self-evident.
There may be differences in in
terest, talent, education, and train
ing in population subgroups, so that
hiring by merit will not result in such
percentages. For any or all of these
reasons the percentage of
mathematicians or engineers, tor
example, from a given racial, ethnic,
or sexual subgroup may differ from
the percentage of the population
composed of members of that sub
group.
If this assumption were correct, of
course, then the predicted percen
tages would occur within whatever
span of time would be necessary for a
policy of hiring by merit to take ef
fect. But then, in order to get these
percentages, it would not be neces
sary to hire according to percentages
but only according to merit. Since
the percentage argument advocates
a policy that is intended to rectify
policies of not hiring according to
merit, it actually assumes that people

should be hired only on the basis of
their merit.
Examination required
Whatever method could be used
to find out about the distribution ot
interest in and talent for a particular
kind of activity would require exa
mining individuals, individual by in
dividual. That is, trie
evidence of distributions of charac
teristics in a given population de
pends on the evidence about indi
viduals of that population. Evidence
of distributions derived from evi
dence of distributions in random
samples of the population still ulti
mately depends on evidence about
individuals, namely, the individuals
in the random samples.
The evidence about the interests
and talents of individuals is thus
stronger and more certain than the
evidence about distributions of
these interests and talents in the
population and population sub
groups to which these individuals be
long, since the latter evidence is de
pendent on the former. It follows,
then, that the policy ot hiring peop'e
according to the pe r centage assump
tion is more dubious than that of hir
ing people according to their indi
vidual merits, since the evidence for
the percentage assumption is weaker
and more dubious than that about
the individual merits of people.
The percentage argument, in other
words, begs the question. Its validity
depends on the assumption that
people can be evaluated individu

ally. To argue that the results of judg
ing people individually must be
wrong because these results do not
conform to the hypothesized per
centages is to reject the only possible
basis for knowing these percentages.
Thus the percentage argument re
futes itself, for the only reason to ac
cept the view that, for example, 50
per cent of mathematicians should
be women because 50 per cent of
those with the greatest interest in
and talent for mathematics are
women is that it has been disco
vered, by examining individuals, that
50 per cent of those with the greatest
interest in and talent for mathematics
are women. It could be discovered
only by examining individuals. The
percentage argument thus presup
poses that the most accurate way to
judge individuals is to judge each in
dividually.
In summary: The percentage ar
gument depends on the verv ability
to judge individuals on their own
merits whose use it rejects. It advo
cates hiring people without regard
for their qualifications and solely be
cause of their membership in some
racial, ethnic, or sexual group X, be
cause these individuals would have
been qualified, given different edu
cation.
But the argument itsel'
on the assumption that there are
qualifications that these individuals
would have had,given different edu
cation. And the justification of the
percentage assumption must ulti-

mately depend on the ability to judge
the qualifications of individuals, the
kind of judgment the percentage ar
gument rejects.
Biased-judgment argument
It has been argued that evaluating
individuals on the basis of merit,
without regard to their racial, ethnic,
or sexual characteristics, is impossi
ble because only members of any
such group X are capable of evaluat
ing other members of group X and
because present criteria of evalua
tion are biased in favor of members
of group non-X. Therefore, members
of group X must be chosen in order
to hire other members of group X,
and members of group X must be
hired in order to compensate for the
bias of present criteria for evaluating
merit.
a) Who evaluates? The argument
that only members of racial, ethnic,
or sexual group X should evaluate
other members of group X is that
only they can understand members
of group X, by which is meant that
only they can understand the think
ing of members of group X. How can
the policy based on this argument be
implemented and how can the ar
gument itself be justified?
