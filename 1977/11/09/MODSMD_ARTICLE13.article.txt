# Visiting professor says oil market future is 'pessimistic'

A pessimistic outlook is fore
seen for the world oil market
by Dr. Oystein Noreng of the
Oslo Institute of Business Ad
ministration.
Noreng, visiting the United
States from Norway to study
this country's energy prob
lems, spoke yesterday after
noon in the Terman Au
ditorium about problems in
world oil production and con
sumption as it affects the U.S.,
OECD, and OPEC countries.
The Organization for
Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) coun
tries, including Japan and the
industrial areas of Western
Europe, are in an "uncomfort
able situation" at the present
time according to Noreng.
The past 20 years have shown
an increased dependence on
imported oil as there has been
a decline in domestic produc
tion, he said.
The U.S. need for oil imports
is of marginal importance
compared to that of the OECD
he said. A cutback on oil in the
U.S. might necessitate more
car-pooling whereas the same
cutback could spell "economic
disaster for Western Europe
and Japan," he added.
Meanwhile, opposing fac

tions have been forming within
the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC),
he said. These Middle East and
South American countries,
such as Saudia Arabia, Iran and
Ecuador, are currently in
volved in a conflict of interests
over the price and production
of oil, Noreng added.
The cost of oil, and the dis
tribution of its production are
resulting income for OPEC will
depend on the demand for
OPEC oil in the near future.
High demand will drive prices
up and put pressure on oil re
serves. Moderate demand
could cause a "double mar
ket," resulting in cheap oil for
North America but economi
cally damaging prices for
OECD imported oil, Noreng
said.
Saudi Arabia, a controlling
factor in this conflict resulting
from its large oil reserves, has
political aspirations at stake in
the oil game which could affect
the entire world oil market, he
added. Noreng credits Saudi

Arabia with the "Midas
touch;" regardless of the out
come of OPEC conflicts, Saudi
Arabia will prosper.
Noreng said he sees the
world oil trade concentrated in
North America as its energy
consumption is 50 per cent
higher than in Western
Europe. "The potential for
conservation is (therefore)
much larger in North America
than in Western Europe or Ja
pan," he added.
"The U.S. energy policy will
determine how much oil is av
ailable for the rest of the
world," stated Noreng in stres
sing the importance of greater
energy conservation in the Un
ited States.

the oil game which could affect
the entire world oil market, he
added. Noreng credits Saudi

Arabia with the "Midas
touch;" regardless of the out
come of OPEC conflicts, Saudi
Arabia will prosper.
Noreng said he sees the
world oil trade concentrated in
North America as its energy
consumption is 50 per cent
higher than in Western
Europe. "The potential for
conservation is (therefore)
much larger in North America
than in Western Europe or Ja
pan," he added.
"The U.S. energy policy will
determine how much oil is av
ailable for the rest of the
world," stated Noreng in stres
sing the importance of greater
energy conservation in the Un
ited States.
A pessimistic outlook is fore
seen for the world oil market
by Dr. Oystein Noreng of the
Oslo Institute of Business Ad
ministration.
Noreng, visiting the United
States from Norway to study
this country's energy prob
lems, spoke yesterday after
noon in the Terman Au
ditorium about problems in
world oil production and con
sumption as it affects the U.S.,
OECD, and OPEC countries.
The Organization for
Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) coun
tries, including Japan and the
industrial areas of Western
Europe, are in an "uncomfort
able situation" at the present
time according to Noreng.
The past 20 years have shown
an increased dependence on
imported oil as there has been
a decline in domestic produc
tion, he said.
The U.S. need for oil imports
is of marginal importance
compared to that of the OECD
he said. A cutback on oil in the
U.S. might necessitate more
car-pooling whereas the same
cutback could spell "economic
disaster for Western Europe
and Japan," he added.
Meanwhile, opposing fac

tions have been forming within
the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC),
he said. These Middle East and
South American countries,
such as Saudia Arabia, Iran and
Ecuador, are currently in
volved in a conflict of interests
over the price and production
of oil, Noreng added.
The cost of oil, and the dis
tribution of its production are
resulting income for OPEC will
depend on the demand for
OPEC oil in the near future.
High demand will drive prices
up and put pressure on oil re
serves. Moderate demand
could cause a "double mar
ket," resulting in cheap oil for
North America but economi
cally damaging prices for
OECD imported oil, Noreng
said.
Saudi Arabia, a controlling
factor in this conflict resulting
from its large oil reserves, has
political aspirations at stake in
the oil game which could affect
the entire world oil market, he
added. Noreng credits Saudi

Arabia with the "Midas
touch;" regardless of the out
come of OPEC conflicts, Saudi
Arabia will prosper.
