# Miss Indian Nevada enjoys ambassador role
## 
### Caryn Coulter 
Being an educated and ar
ticulate goodwill ambassador
of the Indian nation can pre
sent a positive image of native
Americans to the American
public, according to Miss In
dian Nevada.
The titleholder, Sharon
Malotte, a senior and an active
member of the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO), decided to compete in
the Miss Indian Nevada contest
held at the Fallon All-Indian

Rodeo Stampede and Pioneer
Days this summer because "it
was just something I knew I
could get if I wanted to do it.
"I've had more college than
the other girls and was more
articulate and more self confi
dent," she said.
Malotte is thus eligible to
enter the Miss Indian America
contest next August in Wyom
ing.
Education is necessary for
the younger people of our
tribes because without educa

tion you can't get anywhere,"
said the biology major.
Credentials
"College gives you creden
tials and you can't get past your
nose without credentials. Edu
cation helps you to know
there's a world off the reserva
tion."
After graduation, Malotte
said she would like to earn a
master's degree in public
health and work at the Public
Health Service hospital located
120 miles from her South Fork
Indian Rese'vation in north
eastern Nevada.
The six contestants were
judged on the basis of their In
dian tribal costume, poise, ta
lent and ability to express
themselves in a five-minute
personal interview.
Malotte, who is nearly all
Shoshone with 1/16 th Washoe
Indian ancestry, was able to
thoroughly reacquaint herself
with Shoshone customs in
preparation for the contest.
"I kind of got burned out
about my heritage," she said.
Songs
But her research appears to
have paid off. For her talent,
Malotte recited an Indian
prayer in Shoshone and sang
two Indian songs — one ac
companied by a Comanche
hand game, a tribute to the
Comanche portion of the
Shoshone tribe, she said. She
also made her tribal costume.
"My purpose was to let
everyone know I was very
proud to represent the Indians
of Nevada," she said.
The purpose of Miss Indian
America is "not to make
waves," Malotte said.
"People don't want to hear
about how the Indians were
deprived of their land or about

the Indian political movement.
People do want to listen to
someone who is an articulate
goodwill ambassador and see
the traditional costumes," she
said.
"For the woman selected
Miss Indian America, there is
the opportunity to travel and
see the country," Malotte ad
ded.
"The reason why I entered
the contest was for the oppor
tunity to travel and meet other
women through the contest."
Duties
Malotte's duties as Miss In
dian Nevada include speaking
and appearing at various
parades and rodeos. She was
also selected Miss Nevada In
dian Rodeo Association.
The national winner will
travel nationwide for a year
with possible trips to Europe
and Africa.
Malotte was active two years
ago in SAIO's fight to abolish
the Indian mascot. Fellow
SAIO member Willie Reid said
Malotte's accepting the Miss
Indian Nevada title "really
shocked" some members.
"The mascot was a
stereotype and the title Miss
Indian America is the same
thing," said Reid.
"It just doesn't come across
as something traditionally In
dian. A Miss Indian America
can educate and expose
people to the Indian move
ment but I don't think they're
doing that," Reid said. "They
are not selected on the basis of
whether they'll do that or not."
Not authentic
"They say the contest is to
'help express the Indian way of
life' but what is shown is not
really a part of the Indian way
of life," Reid said.

Indian awareness, which re
ally began developing in the
'60s, came about when native
Americans began to realize the
injustices incurred by the
Europeans upon the natives of
the Western Hemisphere, Reid
said.
"This was our homeland. We

have to become aware that our
land was ripped off, our society
and culture destroyed.
"We have to tie this in with
the awareness of what will
happen to us in the future,"
Reid said.
"The title (Miss Indian
America) itself was never a part

of our language. It evolved
after contact with the white
man. It doesn't have a place in
our traditions," Reid said.
Malotte said she and Reid
have their differences of opin
ion, but said she believes an
articulate speaker can show
others that "Indians are
people, not stereotypes."
