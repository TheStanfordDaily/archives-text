New York (AP) — Cincin
nati's George Foster, who hit
more home runs than any Na
tional League player in 12
years, was named the NL's
Most Valuable Player for 1977
yesterday, edging Philadelphia
slugger Greg Luzinski.
Foster, the good-field, all-hit
slugger of the Reds, received
15 of a possible 24 first-place
votes and 291 points in ballot
ing by members of the Baseball
Writers Association of
America. Luzinski, whose
powerful bat carried the Phil
lies to the NL East title, was
awarded the other nine first
place votes and wound up with
255 points.
Outfielder Dave Parker of

Pittsburgh finished third with
156 points, followed by out
fielder Reggie Smith of the NL
champion Los Angeles Dod
gers, 112 points, Philadelphia
pitcher Steve Carlton, 100, and
first baseman Steve Garvey of
Los Angeles, 98.
Foster, nicknamed "The
Launcher" by his manager,
Sparky Anderson, was the
most dangerous hitter in the
league. He slugged 52 homers,
drove in 149 runs and scored
124 runs — all league highs
for 1977. He also batted .320,
fourth in the NL.
Only Foster, Luzinski and
Parker were named on all 24
ballots — two from each NL
city. A first-place vote was

worth 14 points, second place
was nine, third was eight, with
lower places receiving fewer
points.
The Reds, who failed in their
bid for a third straight World
Series title by finishing second
to Los Angeles in the NL West,
gained their third straight MVP
award and fifth in the last six
years.
In the 47 years since the
BBWAA instituted the MVP
Award, 16 winners have come
from non-pennant winning
teams.
Luzinski, the bull-strongout
fielder of the Phillies, also had
a super season. He slammed 39
homers, drove in 130 runs and
batted .309.
