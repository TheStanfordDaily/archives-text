# Cardinal sins
## Stanford coach a realist 
### Bruce Anderson 
A postmortem of Saturday's foot
ball game between USC and Stanford
reveals among other things that Stan
ford's surprise position atop the
Pacific-8 did not lead Bill Walsh to
make rash statements about the Car
dinals' bowl futures.
It would have been easy for the
first-year Stanford coach to get
washed away by the same wave of
emotion that had the rest of the cam
pus talking about New Year's plane re
servations to Pasadena.
But Walsh stuck by his preseason
assessment that Stanford's role in the
Pac-8 was to help determine the Rose
Bowl representative, not to be it.
"We're still not thinking about
being a bowl team," Walsh said during
the week before the SC contest. "To
be honest, you're not a bowl team
until someone invites you."
Prior to the meeting with the Tro
jans, Walsh maintained that SC "is still
the No. 1 Rose Bowl contender . . .
capable of beating anyone in the coun
try by a big score."
Stanford hires a coach and gets a
prophet. 49-0 was a big score.
Walsh hasn't got himself into a posi
tion where he has to sing to a different
tune after the games than he sings to
all week.
"We shouldn't be propped up as
some football giant that USC has
beaten because that's just not what we
are," Walsh said after Saturday's
whitewash. "In the situation we were
in, against a physically superior team,
you can be fortunate and make it
close, or you can simply get mur

dered."
The low profile maintained by Walsh
during the season has not been an at
tempt to lull opposing teams into a
false sense of confidence but an hon
est reflection of his feeling that while
the '77 Cards are a good team, they are
not a great team.
♦ ♦ »
"I don't measure our success by just
one game," Walsh said Saturday. "I'll
look at the season as a whole. If we can
come back to beat San Jose and
California I'll consider it a fine year,
one of the best in Stanford's recent
history."
An 8-3 record would be as good as
any the Cards have produced during
the regular season since 1951 when
Stanford went 9-1 before losing 40-7 to
Illinois in the Rose Bowl.
A Big Game win and the 8-3 mark
would very likely also get Stanford an
invitation to either the Fiesta Bowl
(Dec. 25 in Phoenix) or the Sun Bowl
(Dec. 31 in El Paso).
But as Walsh said, "You're not a
bowl team until someone invites you."

Heisman blues. Last week Gary
Cavalli, Stanford's sports information
director, mailed a polished four-page
pamphlet to sportswriters around the
country.
The front page of the slick two-color
publication reads: "Guy Benjamin,
Stanford University's Heisman Trophy
Nominee." Underneath was a photo
graph of Stanford's quarterback get
ting ready to do what he does best —

throw a football.
For Benjamin, who definitely merits
consideration for the award, the tim
ing of the Heisman campaign could
not have been worse.
Saturday, Guy threw four intercep
tions and to the astonishment of
everyone, USC held Stanford score
less.
And while one mediocre game
should not hamper Benjamin's
chances at being named an Ail-
American or getting selected in the
first round of the January draft, any
Heisman hopes were washed away by
the Trojans in the southern California
rain.

Tears came to the eyes of all who

former USC football mentor was still
winless in the NFL after 22 games.
The Bucs have been shut out three

be honest, you're not a bowl team
until someone invites you."
Prior to the meeting with the Tro
jans, Walsh maintained that SC "is still
the No. 1 Rose Bowl contender . . .
capable of beating anyone in the coun
try by a big score."
Stanford hires a coach and gets a
prophet. 49-0 was a big score.
Walsh hasn't got himself into a posi
tion where he has to sing to a different
tune after the games than he sings to
all week.
"We shouldn't be propped up as
some football giant that USC has
beaten because that's just not what we
are," Walsh said after Saturday's
whitewash. "In the situation we were
in, against a physically superior team,
you can be fortunate and make it
close, or you can simply get mur

dered."
The low profile maintained by Walsh
during the season has not been an at
tempt to lull opposing teams into a
false sense of confidence but an hon
est reflection of his feeling that while
the '77 Cards are a good team, they are
not a great team.

"I don't measure our success by just
one game," Walsh said Saturday. "I'll
look at the season as a whole. If we can
come back to beat San Jose and
California I'll consider it a fine year,
one of the best in Stanford's recent
history."
An 8-3 record would be as good as
any the Cards have produced during
the regular season since 1951 when
Stanford went 9-1 before losing 40-7 to
Illinois in the Rose Bowl.
A Big Game win and the 8-3 mark
would very likely also get Stanford an
invitation to either the Fiesta Bowl
(Dec. 25 in Phoenix) or the Sun Bowl
(Dec. 31 in El Paso).
But as Walsh said, "You're not a
bowl team until someone invites you."

Heisman blues. Last week Gary
Cavalli, Stanford's sports information
director, mailed a polished four-page
pamphlet to sportswriters around the
country.
The front page of the slick two-color
publication reads: "Guy Benjamin,
Stanford University's Heisman Trophy
Nominee." Underneath was a photo
graph of Stanford's quarterback get
ting ready to do what he does best —

throw a football.
For Benjamin, who definitely merits
consideration for the award, the tim
ing of the Heisman campaign could
not have been worse.
Saturday, Guy threw four intercep
tions and to the astonishment of
everyone, USC held Stanford score
less.
And while one mediocre game
should not hamper Benjamin's
chances at being named an Ail-
American or getting selected in the
first round of the January draft, any
Heisman hopes were washed away by
the Trojans in the southern California
