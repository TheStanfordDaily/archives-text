# For med schools
## Senate repeals admit guides 
### Andrea James 
After a "dramatic" debate Friday
night, the U.S. Senate voted 57-2 to
repeal a provision of a 1976 law re
quiring U.S. medical schools to ac
cept American students now study
ing in medical schools abroad.
"This is a major victory in terms of
academic freedom for universities,"
said Larry Horton, a University gov
ernment relations official who wit
nessed the debate.
The Health Manpower Act has
been a source of controversy since
former President Cerald Ford signed
it last year. The law requires medical
schools to waive their own admission
standards when admitting students
formerly enrolled in foreign schools.
The Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare assigns students to
medical schools and those schools
must accept the students or be re
fused federal capitation grants, Hor
ton said.
Refusals
He added that six of the eight med
ical schools in California (the five UC
medical schools and Stanford) have

said they wili not participate in the
capitation grant program because
they refuse to accept students who
do not meet their academic require
ments.
Two weeks ago, the House passed
a bill amending the Manpower Act to
require that schools expand their
third year classes by six per cent for
the next two years.
That bill, authored by Rep. Paul
Rogers (D-Fla.), no longer requires
schools to take the students assigned
by HEW.
"The medical schools can now
choose the students," Horton said,
"but they still have to choose from a
very limited pool."
The Senate and House must now
meet in conference to compromise
Rogers' bill with the Senate repeal.
The compromise bill then goes back
to both houses before being sent to
President Jimmy Carter for his signa
ture.
Law may remain
"The houses don't have to meet in
conference," Horton said. "If they
don't come to a decision, the law re

mains as it is today."
The Senate Friday night also pas
sed a bill by Sen. S.I. Hayakawa (R-
Calif.) to separate a new student loan
program from capitation require
ments.
The Manpower Act states that only
students attending schools sup
ported by capitation grants are eligi
ble for a new Health Professions
Guaranteed Student Loan Program.
"If schools are eligible for the capi
tation, the students are eligible for
the new loan program," Horton
explained. "But one of the basic
qualifications for schools to be eligi
ble for capitation is to accept the
HEW-assigned foreign medical
school students."
