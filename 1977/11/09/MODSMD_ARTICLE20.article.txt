Truce broken in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli and Palestinian
gunners dueled across the Lebanese border
yesterday in the worst breach of their Sept. 26
truce. Officials said one Israeli and six
Lebanese civilians were killed.
Each side accused the other of starting the
shelling, which pounded the Israeli coastal re
sort of Nahariya and at least a dozen Lebanese
towns, villages and refugee camps along the
border from the Mediterranean to the moun
tains in the southwest.
Lt. Gen. Mordecai Gur, the Israeli chief of
staff, said his forces had "bombarded sources
of the rocket fire" in Lebanon. Lebanese offi
cials said the Israeli shelling continued past
dark, seven hours after it started.
In an attempt to keep the fighting from es
calating, Foreign Minister Fuad Butros confer
red separately with the U.S. and Soviet ambas
sadors, Richard Parker and Alexander Sol
datov.
"My government believes the threat of an
invasion of south Lebanon is very grave," Sol
datov told reporters afterward.
A State Department spokesman in
Washington said the United States has urged
both sides "to show restraint" and was work
ing to reinstate the ceasefire.
Carter promotes energy plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, say
ing Congress must "resist pressures from a few
for special favors," threatened yesterday night
to veto any energy legislation that fails to meet
his test for fairness.
In his first nationwide television-radio ad
dress in more than six months, Carter ap
pealed for Americans to urge Congress to act
on his energy program.
The energy blueprint he outlined for Con
gress was fair both to consumers and produc
ers and would promote energy conservation
while protecting the federal budget"from any
unreasonable financial burden," he said.
"These are the three standards by which the
final legislation will be judged," Carter said in
his prepared text. "I will sign the energy bills
only if they meet these tests."
Carter said "We should reward individuals
and companies who discover and produce

new oil and gas, but we must not give them
huge windfall profits on their existing wells at
the expense of the American people."
Nixon tape release argued
Washington — Richard Nixon will suffer
"mental anguish" and embarrassment if the
public is allowed to hear 30 White House tape
recordings used to convict his closest aides,
Nixon's lawyers said yesterday.
But attorney Edward Bennett Williams, argu
ing for the release of the Watergate tapes, told
the Supreme Court:"I don't know of any
common law right not to be embarrassed by
one's inculpatory words."
At issue before the court's nine justices are
the tapes played during the 1974 Watergate
cover-up trial of Nixon's closest advisers.
A federal appeals court ruled more than a
year ago that the tapes "are no longer confi
dential."
"A tape is different than a trial transcript.
Tapes are susceptible to uses that are far more
offensive to persons whose voices are on
them," William Jeffress argued for Nixon.
Transcripts of the tapes were widely pub
licized during the trial of former Attorney
General John Mitchell and ex-White House
aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.
Except for the 12-member jury and those
persons who sat through all or portions of the
trial, the public has never heard the actual voi
ces of Nixon and his aides discussing the scan
dal that forced him from office.
Williams told the court that "the best rep
resentation of oral conversations is not in a
written document." Williams illustrated his
point by changing the tone of his voice several
times to give differing meanings to this recur
ring Nixon quote from the Watergate tape
transcripts: "uh uh."
Nixon contends that releasing the tapes
would invade his privacy and cause him em
barrassment, but Justice Thurgood Marshall
asked the ex-president's lawyer if Nixon had
not lost all privacy claims when the tapes were
played in open court.
The networks, public broadcasting and the
news directors group want to air portions of
the tapes while Warner wants to reproduce
them for sale as records and tape cassettes.
Jeffress argued that the courts lack the au

thority to release trial exhibits obtained
through use of subpoenas. But Justice William
Rehnquist said a constitutional problem of pri
vacy could develop in a specific use of the
tapes after they are made public, but not over
the authority of a court to release the tapes.
The court will decide the case sometime be
fore next June.
Kowal discovers mini-planet
Pasadena — The Earth has another neighbor
in the solar system, a tiny "mini-planet" that, if
placed on the Earth, wouldn't cover the dis
tance between Los Angeles and San Francisco,
an astronomer said yesterday.
The object, which may be our solar system's
10th planet, was found by astronomer Charles
Kowal, a California Institute of Technology sci
entist who is engaged in a project of "map
ping" the heavens with a 48-inch telescope.
The object, located between the sixth and
seventh planets, Saturn and Uranus, "has a
perfectly planetary orbit" Kowal told a Caltech
news conference. He said the object's orbit
and location suggest that it is a planet.
"It's too big to be a comet," Kowal said, "so
for the time being, we're just calling it a mini
planet."
If it is deemed the 10th planet in the system,
Kowal will be allowed to name it.
Blood mystery hits embassy
Moscow — Medical tests show that one of
every 29 adults at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
suffers from a mysterious blood condition re
sulting in abnormally high levels of white
blood cells, embassy sources said yesterday.
Washington has accused Soviet authorities
of bombarding the embassy with microwave
radiation, but embassy officials have said the
radiation has nothing to do with the blood
counts. Some scientists dispute this and say
such radiation could affect blood cells.
Moscow has denied beaming radiation at
the embassy, contending the microwaves are
part of the normal background radiation found
in any major city. Common uses of microwave
beams are radar and the transmission of televi
sion and long-distance telephone calls.
The 233 adults given medical tests represent
virtually all embassy staff members and their

spouses.
Comparative figures for the frequency of the
same high levels of white cells in the United
States do not exist, but the sources said there
was no question that an abnormality has been
found in Moscow.
The cause of the blood condition remains
unknown, the sources said, despite a
stepped-up program of special tests and de
tailed analysis of the health histories of Mos
cow embassy personnel and their families.
For the past year Moscow has been officially
designated as an "unhealthful post," entitling
Americans serving here to a higher hardship
pay differential or increased retirementcredit.
Kidnap guards protect rich
Rome — The rich in Europe are increasingly
being forced to live with bodyguards and take
other safety measures as the idea behind Italy's
"Kidnapping, Inc."spreadstoothercountries.
The number of Italian kidnappings for ran
som in 1977 reached a record 63 yesterday
when three armed men seized Pietro Fiocci, a
munitions factory owner and town official in
Lecco. They pushed him into a waiting car as
he left work in the northern Italian town and
drove away.
Monday an armed gang grabbed Duke Mas
similiano Crazioli as he toured his estate near
Rome. The abductors demanded a $12 million
ransom for the duke, who police said failed to
follow the cardinal rule of kidnap prevention
— vary your daily routine.
More significant than the number of Italian
kidnappings, now one more than the one-year
record set in 1975, is the fact that the crime has
spread elsewhere.
A few of the kidnappers in other countries
had political motives, but most of them de
manded, and got, high ransoms of the order
that has netted Italian abductors millions of
dollars a year.
