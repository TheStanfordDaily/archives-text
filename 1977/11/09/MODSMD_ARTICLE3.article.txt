# Bill seeks an end to age bias in housing
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Students will be one step closer to
receiving legal protection against
housing discrimination if a bill by As
semblyman Howard Berman (D-Los
Angeles) passes the state senate's Fi
nance Committee in January.
Assembly Bill 1032 extends the
Rumford Fair Housing Act prohibi
tion against housing discrimination
on the basis of race, sex, religion,
marital status, nationality or ances
try, to age for persons 18 or older.
The bill passed the senate Local
Government Committee in August
by a vote of five to two. The victory
was an "unexpected surprise" for
the lobbyists, said Felicity Bensch,
director of the Berkeley annex of the
UC Student Lobby, which supports
the bill.
'Watered down'
Opponents of the bill claim that
"the act is becoming too watered
down" by taking in too many types of
discrimination, said Brett Hewitt,
co-director of the UC Student Lobby.
Hewitt said the lobby argues "if
there's discrimination being prac
ticed against any group, then there's
need for the law."
"Our argument is that we do have
evidence of students being discrimi
nated against solely because of their
student status," said Bensch.
Last year the UC Student Lobby
surveyed six UC campuses and
found that at least 34 per cent of the
students surveyed had been "denied
housing solely on student status,"
Bensch said.
UC-Berkeley and UCLA recorded
the highest proportion of student
housing discrimination, with 49 and
45 per cent of surveyed students re
porting discrimination, respectively,
Bensch added.
The survey results were presented
in a testimony before the Senate
Local Government Committee last
year.
Drumming support
According to Hewitt, the lobby is
now "trying to get a hold of schools
up and down the state, talking to
students and administrators who

might be inclined to support the bill
to urge them to contact their state
senators."
ASSU Co-president Anne Henkels
said the Council of Presidents has
heard about the bill but has not be
come actively involved.
The bill is "less applicable to Stan
ford than many other campuses be
cause three-fourths of the students
live on campus here," Henkels
commented.
Henkels said she felt students
seeking housing in the Palo Alto
community experience "discrimina
tion of a different type. They are dis
criminated against by rent hikes, not
by ability to rent a place."
According to Hewitt, the bill will
go before the full senate in February
if it passes the finance committee,
but added, "we're trying to go one
step at a time."
