# Trustees table proposal to end ban on sororities
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
tabled a proposal to rescind the 33-
year ban on sororities until its Dec. 13
meeting.
Meanwhile, students interested in
bringing sororities back to campus
expressed disappointment in the
board's decision.
The board's Academic Affairs
Committee decided to table the
proposal after a 75-minute debate on
the issue, Robert Hamrdla, assistant
to the president for trustee affairs,
said.
The proposal was also tabled when
first presented to the body last June.
At that time, action was deferred to
the November meeting.
Hamrdla said hours of discussion
on the issue took place at the Oc
tober meeting.
'Undesirable effects'
"The discussion centered on the
desire of board members to assure
that the University's housing policies
are non-discriminatory while at the
same time guarding against the un
desirable aspects of sororities that
led to their elimination at Stanford in
1944," Robert Rosenzweig, vice pres
ident for public affairs, said in a pre
pared statement.
"The board wanted another month
to consider the best way of stating a
policy that will accomplish both of
those goals," Rosenzweig's state
ment said.
He said board members raised
concerns about effects sororities had
when they were here. A "kind of
caste system" existed at that time,
Rosenzweig said. "If you made it
(into a sorority), you were great; if
you didn't you were nothing."
He said the board was also con
cerned about potential inconsis
tency between policies of some na
tional sororities and the University.
Brad Krevoy, a student member of
the academic affairs committee, said
board members were saying "Let's

make sure that when we rescind the
ban the problems which caused the
ban in the first place are taken care
of."
Krevoy said the rescission would
have passed yesterday."It was as
sumed during the discussion." He
said he felt the delay would allow
time for consideration of an amend
ment to the proposal requiring all
potential sororities to comply with
University educational goals.
Discouraging
The amendment, by Robert Minge
Brown, would essentially discourage
national sororities, Krevoy said.
"Brown's amendment was an ef
fort to deal with the concerns raised
by those who felt sororities could
have a detrimental effect on Stanford
University," Krevoy said.
But some students on campus who
favor the return of sororities said
they were "disappointed but not de
feated" after the board's action.
"It leaves us in a position of not
being able to do anything," said
Janice Kimball, an Alpha Phi
member.
She said she thought many ad
ministrators and board members are
not realizing that a sorority here
doesn't necessarily mean housing.
"We're talking about a fraternal
organization of women," Kimball

said. The members are "united by a
desire to work together on service
projects, on social functions and
other things. It doesn't mean they
want to live in a house together."
She said Alpha Phi's national or
ganization would "clear the forma
tion of a group" with the University.
She said that while the sorority was
part of national organization, "they
follow the dictates of the university."
Kimball said, however, she could
not comment on the practices of
other national groups.
'Quite aware'
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said, however, he is "quite
aware" that sororities do not neces
sarily imply housing.
Lyons said if the ban is rescinded,
the LJniversity would not recruit
sororities and would not deal with
national organizations. "We'll deal
with students," Lyons said.
He said rescission of the ban would
only be "taking the padlock off the
door" for sororities.
Terry Elms, a leader of a group of 40
undergraduate women who last
month urged rescission of the soror
ity ban, said she "didn't understand
why" another delay occurred.
"I don't see what the issue is," she
said. "University lawyers have said it
