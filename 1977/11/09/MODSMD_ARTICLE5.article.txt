# Students sought for fraudulent sex study
## 
### Randy Keith 
An apparently fraudulent letter has
been mailed to a number of students
here asking them to participate in an
experiment on the "relationship be
tween the sexual habits and the egos
of Stanford students," according to
Maxine Aiken, psychology depart
ment administrative officer.
The letter, dated Nov. 1, states
"You and 300 other students have
been chosen, through special ag
reement with the admissions office
that allowed us to privately screen
your application forms to Stanford."
It goes on to say that a test will be
held at 9 a.m. Nov. 12 in Jordan Hall
and that students who complete the
experiment will be paid $10 for their
time.
The letter is signed by a Maurice
Krahl, identified as acting chairman
of the Psychology Department.
Krahl, when contacted last night at
his home in Richmond, Va., said that
he knew nothing about the letter and
said he left the University Sept. 1.
Krahl said he had never been offi
cially associated with the Psychology
Department but added that he had
been acting chairman of the Medical
School's Physiology Department.

According to Registrar Sally
Mahoney her office receives all of a
student's admissions file except for
letters of recommendation, and that
the files are only open to faculty on a
"need to know basis."
She said that in order for a faculty
member to use student files on a re
search project the research proposal
must first be approved by the Uni
versity's committee on human sub
jects and that her office must also
determine that the University will
benefit by the research.
Then, she said, students who meet
the researcher's criteria are con
tacted by the registrar's office and
asked if they want to participate in
the experiment. The researcher
never is given access to the files un
less the student agrees to participate,
she said.
This procedure for access is a long
standing policy, she said, and is in
accordance with the Buckley
Amendment which protects the pri
vacy of student's files.
She added that neither Krahl nor
any other person has been granted
access to large numbers of admis
sions files in at least the last three
years.
