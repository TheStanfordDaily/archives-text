# SOC members view yellow leaflet issue
## 
### George Anders 
Shortly after dawn four weeks ago,
several persons were stuffing an
anonymous yellow leaflet pertaining
to the ASSU Senate election into the
Daily.
Two days ago, the 10 under
graduate members of the Stanford
Organizing Committee (SOC) slate
were explaining to the Elections Re
view Board (ERB) what they knew
about the leaflet.
And tomorrow, the ERB will rule on
whether sanctions are to be taken
against any of those senators (or
against other senators facing other
charges).
Monday, four SOC members said
they read the leaflet the night before
it was stuffed without authorization
into the Daily, and attempted to dis
suade the author, alumnus Chris
Gray, from distributing it.
Gray was not available for com
ment, but had earlier claimed "full
responsibility" for the leaflet.
Yesterday, several other under
graduate SOC members told the
Daily they had heard word of the leaf
let before it was distributed, and
were told distribution could not be
stopped.
ASSU Senator Mary Bateson, one
of the four SOC members who talked
to Gray before he distributed the
leaflet, recalled that Gray told the
four that the leaflet was "None of
your business," and "out of your
hands."
"Chris is a very stubborn person,"
she said. She added that efforts to
convince people not to help Gray
stuff the Daily would have been
futile, because "Chris knew so many
people."
SOC members had given the Daily
and Elections Commissioner Sean
Murphy little indication of their
foreknowledge of the leaflet, with
most such information first being re

vealed at Monday's ERB meeting.
In retrospect, Bateson said,
"maybe we should have just told him
(Murphy) right away, or right away
called the Daily. But hindsight is bet
ter than foresight."
Meriel Bertie, also an SOC
member, said she "really wanted to
say what was going on," but said
since each slate member had a diffe
rent level of foreknowledge about
the leaflet, she "didn't want to be
held responsible for the rest," while
only speaking for herself.
Senate Chairperson Fred Grethel,
also an SOC member, said the SOC's
silence was partly motivated by un
certainty over what standards Mur
phy would use to recommend dis
qualification.
Grethel termed "too harsh" a re
commendation by Murphy that "Th
ose members of the SOC slate who
had knowledge of the yellow leaflet
prior to its distribution, as well as any
members who may have contributed
to a subsequent coverup of this fact,
will be allowed to set a very danger
ous precedent if they are allowed to
serve on the Senate."
SOC member Carlyle Kinnison cal
led the suggestion "totally absurd."
Murphy declined comment, say
ing "I don't want to second guess the
ERB."
Murphy had also recommended
that SOC members be disqualified if
they had "any involvement in the
idea, preparation, or distribution of
the yellow sheet."
SOC members had all signed a
statement prior to the first senate
meeting, saying they had no such in
volvement. Grethel said he stood by
that statement, saying Gray was re
sponsible for the idea, preparation
and distribution.
The ERB will hold its final meeting
at 7 p.m. today in Room 268 of the
Quad.
