# South Africa blowup predicted
## 
### Lane Webster 
The present situation in South Af
rica "will eventually blow up,"
Wilfred Burchett, long time foreign
correspondent, told some 60 per
sons in the Meyer Forum Room last
night.
"With the writing on the wall, why
on earth should it be recommended
to double investment when it is in
evitable that it will be lost," he said.
Revolutionary leaders, are "confi
dent that they will win out," the re
porter for the Marxist newsweekly
Guardian declared.
"What is happening is that the
political infrastructure is being built
up," he said. "There is a great deal of
solidarity between white students
and black students. For the first
time," he said, "they are demonstrat
ing shoulder to shoulder in the
streets."
Burchett also said he spied traces
of dissension in South Africa bet
ween reactionary whites of British
origin and the more moderate Boors.

"It may not be important, but it is
symptomatic of the situation," he
said. It indicates "coming solidarity
between the black community and
the more realistic part of the white
minority."
"Hard core racists, for whom
(South African Prime Minister )ohn)
Vorster is the chief spokesman," he
said, "will make armed struggle and
their defeat inevitable."
Burchett said he liked President
Jimmy Carter's recent support of an
arms embargo against South Africa.
"It is objectively speaking a positive
thing for it isolates the Vorster re
gime; it tells the white elite around
him that the regime is regarded with
such disgust that the U.S. has to sup
port the arms embargo," he said.
"This does have important
psychological effects, not only on
peonle like Vorster, but it stimulates
the hopes of the black population.
That's quite important," Burchett
said.
Other countries' revolutionary vic
tories greatly strengthen the libera

tion movement in South Africa, he
maintained. "There has been African
solidarity which has cut across cul
tural and ideological boundaries,"
he said. Liberated countries, he said,
habitually place their territories at
the disposal of other liberation
struggles.
"Algeria really pulled in its belt to
supply arms for other national libera
tion struggles," he said.
"These are enormously important
acts with international solidarity with
very practical consequences," he
said. "They changed the balance of
forces and gave hopes which could
not have been aroused in any other
way."
U.S. policy, Burchett said, is ca
reening toward another costly mis
take. He cited "the continuing inabil
ity of U.S. policymakers to face up to
the real facts. They've learned no
thing from the wrong decisions
which led to what is called 'the loss of
China' and 10 years later, the loss of
Indochina."

and black students. For the first
time," he said, "they are demonstrat
ing shoulder to shoulder in the
streets."
Burchett also said he spied traces
of dissension in South Africa bet
ween reactionary whites of British
origin and the more moderate Boors.

"It may not be important, but it is
symptomatic of the situation," he
said. It indicates "coming solidarity
between the black community and
the more realistic part of the white
minority."
"Hard core racists, for whom
(South African Prime Minister )ohn)
Vorster is the chief spokesman," he
said, "will make armed struggle and
their defeat inevitable."
Burchett said he liked President
Jimmy Carter's recent support of an
arms embargo against South Africa.
"It is objectively speaking a positive
thing for it isolates the Vorster re
gime; it tells the white elite around
him that the regime is regarded with
such disgust that the U.S. has to sup
port the arms embargo," he said.
"This does have important
psychological effects, not only on
peonle like Vorster, but it stimulates
the hopes of the black population.
That's quite important," Burchett
said.
Other countries' revolutionary vic
tories greatly strengthen the libera

tion movement in South Africa, he
maintained. "There has been African
solidarity which has cut across cul
tural and ideological boundaries,"
he said. Liberated countries, he said,
habitually place their territories at
the disposal of other liberation
struggles.
"Algeria really pulled in its belt to
supply arms for other national libera
tion struggles," he said.
"These are enormously important
acts with international solidarity with
very practical consequences," he
said. "They changed the balance of
forces and gave hopes which could
not have been aroused in any other
way."
U.S. policy, Burchett said, is ca
reening toward another costly mis
take. He cited "the continuing inabil
ity of U.S. policymakers to face up to
the real facts. They've learned no
thing from the wrong decisions
which led to what is called 'the loss of
China' and 10 years later, the loss of
Indochina."

The present situation in South Af
rica "will eventually blow up,"
Wilfred Burchett, long time foreign
correspondent, told some 60 per
sons in the Meyer Forum Room last
night.
"With the writing on the wall, why
on earth should it be recommended
to double investment when it is in
evitable that it will be lost," he said.
Revolutionary leaders, are "confi
dent that they will win out," the re
porter for the Marxist newsweekly
Guardian declared.
"What is happening is that the
political infrastructure is being built
up," he said. "There is a great deal of
solidarity between white students
and black students. For the first
time," he said, "they are demonstrat
ing shoulder to shoulder in the
streets."
