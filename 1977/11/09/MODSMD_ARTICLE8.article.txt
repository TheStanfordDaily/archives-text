# S. Africa: time running out

Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons takes a moral stand against the
Big-Game Bonfire, while Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massy says we can't give up our
stocks in firms with investments in
South Africa because it will cost too
much.
Massy, like the University's trus
tees, says he is appalled by South
Africa's racist government. They all
say they would like apartheid to go
away, but apparently not at Stan
ford's expense.
If Stanford is not careful, it will
soon have the image of being an im
potent institution filled with men
(I'm not being sexist — women don't
run (his place) paralyzed by ignor
ance, and lacking in both moral and
intestinal fortitude.
Both Stanford and our own gov
ernment have shown their wishy
washy sides with regards to South
Africa. Both institutions claim to be
against apartheid, but neither has
been able to come up with anything
more than lip service.
The time has come for concrete,
positive action, because time is run
ning out on South Africa's minority
government.
In South Africa, human equality is
denied by constitution, by law, and
in practice. The doctrineof apartheid
is the official philosophy of the state,
and is enforced upon everyone. The
South African government even now
is trying to pretend that the people of
African descent are not even Africans
at all. Recently the South African
government cracked down on even
moderate organizations and indi
viduals opposed to apartheid in that
country.
The organizations, newspapers
and individuals who were banned all
have stood for reconciliation. And
quite ironically the racist regime in
Pretoria, which stands for polariza
tion, is now accusing them of what
the National Party regime has been
doing in South Africa for 29 years,
which is destroying the country's
peace and security.
Not surprisingly, these political
and economic structures are re
jected by the majority of the people

in that country. There is in South Af
rica a long history of political protest,
of petitions, demonstrations and ap
peals for justice. The African Na
tional Congress of South Africa was
formed in 1912 to fight apartheid. But
all peaceful agitation has been
ruthlessly smashed, while the op
pression has gotten greater.
Finally, even the extreme patience
of Africans has been exhausted. And
when other means fail, men are so
constituted that they are willing to
die for freedom. A war is now being
waged in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia); it
has begun in Namibia (Southwest Af
rica). In South Africa, the people of
Soweto and other areas rise in spon
taneous revolt.
The conflict in Southern Africa is
not a capitalist versus communist
struggle at all. It is a nationalist strug
gle for political freedom and human
equality. The final result is therefore
certain. What is yet to be determined
is the means by which nationalism
will triumph, the human suffering
which will be involved in the struggle
and the extent to which the rest of
the world will be militarily involved.
Yet foreign trade and investment
helps apartheid; they do not hinder
it. Apartheid has become more rep
ressive as South Africa has become
richer.
Direct U.S. investment in South
Africa has been increasing very fast in
recent years. In 1966, its estimated
total value was $490 million; by 1976
it was $1.6 billion. The National
Council of Churches has estimated
thai 75 per cent of total U.S. assets in
South Africa are accounted for by 13
American firms, including General
Motors, Mobil, Exxon, Ford, General
Electric, Chrysler, Firestone,
Goodyear and IBM.
Stanford owns stock in all of these
companies. In fact, Stanford owns
securities in 59 U.S. companies ac
tive in South Africa.
Meanwhile, Stanford's Board of
Trustees still listens to top level offi
cials who say that divesting will cost
too much and others who say that
investments are a force for change.
There could be a little time left for
peaceful change in South Africa. A

straightforward race war, with terri
ble implications for the world, could
still be avoided if the need for fun
damental change were accepted,
and the process for change begun.
Cosmetic changes in apartheid are
only insulting.
South African whites must talk to
the Africans of South Africa.
The U.S. must continue to pres
sure the South African government
with more than words.
We could start by halting all
Export-Import Bank guarantees of
commercial loans to South Africa,
banning further investments in
South Africa and denying U.S. milit
ary, economic or other aid to any
country that provides arms or atomic
weapons technology to South Africa
(such as France, West Germany and
Israel).
Here at Stanford we must continue
to examine this institution's invest
ments in companies making profits
off the cheap black South African
labor. Just being against apartheid in
principle is not enough.
Hopefully, Stanford will indeed
use its great influence, and a little of
its power, to support those who
struggle against great odds for justice
— and therefore for ultimate peace
— in South Africa.
