## Dick Shawn and a ploy in two acts 
### 
From amidst the heap of
crumpled Chronicles rises the
comedian pondering the
merits of his favorite fruit, the
banana.
Stick around, there's much
more to come in Dick Shawn's
hilarious one-man show, "The
Second Greatest Entertainer in
the Whole Wide World" now
at the Alcazar Theatre in San
Francisco.
The show, described as a
"ploy in two acts," is written
directed and conceived by
Shawn. It depicts a down-on
his-luck comedian in a sleazy
backstage dressing room, fpst
ing material for h's act. The
comedian becomes a dynamic
La Vegas nightclubber, Mister
Fabulously Fantastic Junior
(Fabby Fanty Jew for short), but
discovers it to be only a dream
as he awakens and is pushed
onstage, only to "die" in an in
evitably stock act at the sleazy
club.
Shawn, noted for his night
club and stage appearances as
well as films including Mel
Brooks' "The Producers" and
"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad
World," flings his mirthful ar
rows at everything from Jac
queline Kennedy Onassis to
the National Football League.
Commenting on the purity of
bananas, he notes, "You can't
can a banana." Thanksgiving
he decides is an excuse to rid
the world of turkeys,
pumpkins, and mince pies
(they add crust to keep them
moist).
The Vegas act mirrors the
flightiness of its real life model.
Shawn, by saying, "Now I'd
like to change the pace a little,"
moves from an opening of "Si
lent Night" — Vegas Style to
the death -scene from
"Othello," a Gilbert and Sulli
van number, even a selection
from the opera "Pagliacci." For
the latter, in lieu of the Met
ropolitan Opera chorus, he
uses the audience to support
him chanting "suck on a shoe"
in rotation.
A great deal of Shawn's suc
cess comes from his ability to
twist major problems of the
world around, exposing their
lighter side. A poem on the
three ring circus of Watergate
with Nixon himself treading
the tenuous tightrope is espe
cially amusing, despite its
heavy overtones.
In addition, Shawn is adept
at both keeping his audience as
well as manipulating it to
achieve the desired reactions.
He cleverly overworks a few of
his jokes, and later combining
them with a lackluster delivery,
evokes a deep sympathy from
the audience for the comedian
in the final act in the run-down

club.

After the show, with a dixie
cup of champagne (Setrakiaen)
in one hand, Shawn remarked
on comedy today, television,
Steve Martin and the fact that
even people in lowa know
what a schmuck is — they just
don't know how to pronounce
it.
His serious, intelligent side
surfaced in his comments.
"The changes in comedy
through the years reflect the
changes in society," he said.
"The funniest comic is the one
that appeals to the shifts in soc
iety's taste. That's why Don
Rickles is so popular at this
time."
Of Steve Martin he said,
"The funny thing about Martin
is his attitude. Attitude de
stroys you after awhile. It be
comes too repetitious. People
will begin to say 'not that
again'." Chevy Chase has a
similar problem, Shawn feels.
"His return to slapstick, with
the situation comedy and the
pratfalls,will kill him."
Shawn said it's hard to be
funny, "especially if you don't
know how." A comedian looks
at situations in a Hjfferent
perspective. "He bends
awareness. People are una
ware of things that are univer
sally funny. The comedian
heightens that awareness."
Shawn felt the balance of a
performer is crucial to his suc
cess on stage. "A challenge
exists to balance the person
and the performer. The true ar
tist has control and spon
taneity. An example of being
unbalanced is saying dirty
words just to be in. I'm not
shocking with words. I'd rather
appeal to an audience's intelli
gence. The dirtiest thing I said
out there tonight was
'horny.' "
On TV in general, the amiable
comedian commented, "It's,
opened everybody's heads.
They all want a piece of the ac
tion now. That's why every
body plays tennis." This is a
logical, sequential occurrence
in Shawn's comic perception.
"It also depends on how
much money I need at the
time," he added. "A live audi
ence makes me work harder
not to embarrass myself."
Intellectual and "genuine,"
Shawn combines just the right
amount of off-the-wall comedy
with Yiddish comments to
heighten and warp his audi
ence's perception to the point
of hilarity.
That's a show you can't af
ford to miss.
