# At the ballet: from pale pink to color frenzy
## 
### 
Schizophrenia is the out
standing characteristic of the
Pacific Ballet's opening fall per
formance. The first half of its
program concentrates on bal
letic sweetness and light, while
the second half pulsates with
conflict and sensuality.
"La Primavera," choreog
raphed by Henry Berg to music
by Antonio Vivaldi, starts the
evening with gentle lyricism.
Three women in pale pink twirl
and intertwine in complicated
patterns, but with uncompli
cated emotions. The ballet's
the thing, the mood alternately
tranquil and upbeat.
Vivaldi's playful, entergetic
music is the fourth star of the
piece. The other three (Susan
Alleluia, Deborah Frates and
Alyce Taylor) are competent,
graceful and attractive. An oc
casional misstep, however,
makes one somewhat uneasy,
as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.
Next comes "Intermezzo,"
also by Berg, also lyrical, grace
ful and neo-classical, set to
piano music by Brahms. Gay
Wallstrom and Michael Brad
shaw move well together, not
to be taken for granted in a pas
de deux, where the focus is on
a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,
but Bradshaw clearly is not a
strong dancer in the most basic
sense. The last few lifts are a
strain, and his heavy, close
mouthed breathing can be
heard all over the small au
ditorium.
The ballet itself is pleasant
but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
the empathy of their move
ments.
The lack of emotional con
tent in the first half of the prog
ram is more than compensated
for in the second half, with two
pieces by John Pasqualetti,
who like Berg is an artistic di
rector of the Pacific Ballet
Company.
"Daphne of the Dunes" fea
tures two men and a woman in
a bisexual menage a trois that

leaves nothing to the imagina
tion. Coming after the delicate
pink-and-white aesthetic of
Berg, "Daphne" is a jolt,
graphically portraying a long
series of couplings and thric
ings of the indecisive, some
what savage lovers.
Nancy Henderson is superb
as a sort of cat-woman with a
four-foot mane of synthetic
hair that moves and dances
with a wildness and gay aban
don that seem to be the
mainsprings of the piece. Cay
abandon is the best way to de
scribe the roles of John Los
chmann and Jeffrey Sherwood.
To say that they are as happy
with each other as with the
woman is not quite right. Hap
piness has nothing to do with
it. The point of the action
seems to be the action itself:
driven, animalistic, uncom
mited and absolutely compel
ling.
The second Pasqualetti
piece, "The Gospel According
t0..." is a world premiere,
treated to a standing ovation. A
complicated piece for five men
and five women set to several
gospels sung by Aretha
Franklin (recorded, of course),
it spends the energy and
rhythm so crucial to "Daphne"
on the more recognizable
framework of biblical charac
ters, loosely outlining the life
of Christ.
Yet even here, sexual am
biguity is evident. The men and
women wear identical dresses,
more reminiscent of Balen
ciaga gowns than tunics of the
first century A.D. The effect of
the color and movement of the
costumes is beautiful, how
ever, as the dancers, John Los
chmann in particular, dance
themselves into a frenzy. Sex
ual role hang-ups aside, it is an
exciting experience.
The program will be re
peated on November 20, 7:30
p.m. at Marines' Memorial
Theatre, San Francisco.
