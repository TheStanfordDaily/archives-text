# At the ballet: from pale pink to color frenzy
## 
### 
Schizophrenia is the out
standing characteristic of the
Pacific Ballet's opening fall per
formance. The first half of its
program concentrates on bal
letic sweetness and light, while
the second half pulsates with
conflict and sensuality.
"La Primavera," choreog
raphed by Henry Berg to music
by Antonio Vivaldi, starts the
evening with gentle lyricism.
Three women in pale pink twirl
and intertwine in complicated
patterns, but with uncompli
cated emotions. The ballet's
the thing, the mood alternately
tranquil and upbeat.
Vivaldi's playful, entergetic
music is the fourth star of the
piece. The other three (Susan
Alleluia, Deborah Frates and
Alyce Taylor) are competent,
graceful and attractive. An oc
casional misstep, however,
makes one somewhat uneasy,
as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.
Next comes "Intermezzo,"
also by Berg, also lyrical, grace
ful and neo-classical, set to
piano music by Brahms. Gay
Wallstrom and Michael Brad
shaw move well together, not
to be taken for granted in a pas
de deux, where the focus is on
a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,
but Bradshaw clearly is not a
strong dancer in the most basic
sense. The last few lifts are a
strain, and his heavy, close
mouthed breathing can be
heard all over the small au
ditorium.
The ballet itself is pleasant
but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
the empathy of their move
ments.
The lack of emotional con
tent in the first half of the prog
ram is more than compensated
for in the second half, with two
pieces by John Pasqualetti,
who like Berg is an artistic di
rector of the Pacific Ballet
Company.
"Daphne of the Dunes" fea
tures two men and a woman in
a bisexual menage a trois that

leaves nothing to the imagina
tion. Coming after the delicate
pink-and-white aesthetic of
Berg, "Daphne" is a jolt,
graphically portraying a long
series of couplings and thric
ings of the indecisive, some
what savage lovers.
Nancy Henderson is superb
as a sort of cat-woman with a
four-foot mane of synthetic
hair that moves and dances
with a wildness and gay aban
don that seem to be the
mainsprings of the piece. Cay
abandon is the best way to de
scribe the roles of John Los
chmann and Jeffrey Sherwood.
To say that they are as happy
with each other as with the
woman is not quite right. Hap
piness has nothing to do with
it. The point of the action
seems to be the action itself:
driven, animalistic, uncom
mited and absolutely compel
ling.
The second Pasqualetti
piece, "The Gospel According
t0..." is a world premiere,
treated to a standing ovation. A
complicated piece for five men
and five women set to several
gospels sung by Aretha
Franklin (recorded, of course),
it spends the energy and
rhythm so crucial to "Daphne"
on the more recognizable
framework of biblical charac
ters, loosely outlining the life
of Christ.
Yet even here, sexual am
biguity is evident. The men and
women wear identical dresses,
more reminiscent of Balen
ciaga gowns than tunics of the
first century A.D. The effect of
the color and movement of the
costumes is beautiful, how
ever, as the dancers, John Los
chmann in particular, dance
themselves into a frenzy. Sex
ual role hang-ups aside, it is an
exciting experience.
The program will be re
peated on November 20, 7:30
p.m. at Marines' Memorial
Theatre, San Francisco.

Herbie Hancock's recent return to
acoustic jazz has been seen by some as
a long needed rebirth of jazz, and by
others as a resurrection of dead and
outdated music. In either case, Han
cock's new work with the V.S.O.P.
Quintet is undoubtedly the most im
portant event in jazz this year.
The V.S.O.P. Quintet is a collection
of five of the most important musical
voices today: Hancock, Freddie Hub
bard, Ron Carter, Wayne Shorter and
Tony Williams. For the past several
years, these artists have been as
sociated with the jazz-rock fusion, but
now they have gathered to perform the
acoustic music they played during the
'60s. The Quintet first gathered two
years ago at the Newport jazz Festival,
when it was featured during a salute to
Hancock. Originally planned as a one
time affair (V.S.O.P. stands for Very
Special One-time Performance) its suc
cess led to an album, a concert tour and
now a second album, "The Quintet."
This album features cuts recorded dur-"
ing the Quintet's two California con
certs this summer.
Although the music must seem mys
tifying to fans of Hancock's more recent
work, it is the most rewarding album
which any of these artists (Ron Carter
excepted) has produced in the last five
years. When one looks at the artists in
dividually, the album's importance be
comes undeniable.
Freddie Hubbard: throughout the
late '60s and early '70s, Hubbard's work
for CTI was of generally high quality.
Albums such as "Red Clay" and
"Straight Life" featured consistently
good playing and excellent supporting
musicians. Pressured by his record
company, Hubbard's last two albums
have been disco-oriented jazz, de
signed to sell, not to please musical
purists.
Wayne Shorter: Shorter's work with
Weather Report has been interesting
but certainly not as challenging as the

Quintet's music. Wayne, during his
V.S.O.P. work, has been stretching
out, using longer phrases and more
elaborate solos than his Weather Re
port albums have revealed.
Tony Williams: Williams' re
emergence as a jazz drummer is
perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the
Quintet's work. Having started his big
time career at age 17 with Miles Davis,
Williams proved himself a great of jazz
drummers while still a teenager. Yet his
work during the '70s has been largely
ignored, while his stylistic followers,

Billy Cobham, for example, reaped the
recognition. His work on V.S.O.P.
combined with his recent album with
McCoy Tyner has heralded William's
re-entry as an important jazz figure.
Herbie Hancock's return to acoustic
music was the most surprising of all the
V.S.O.P. artists. Since his very popular
"Headhunters" album, he has rarely
played the acoustic piano. For the
Quintet album, however, he plays only
acoustic. He has also just recorded a
trio album on acoustic and will possibly
be playing solo recitals early next year.
Compared with his funk work of the
past few years Hancock's new man
euver is an astonishing reversal. In

deed, the acoustic albums which Han
cock recorded during the late '60s and
early '70s are among the best of that
period. Yet with his first jazz-funk
album, "Headhunters," Hancock sold
more albums than with all his previous
records combined. His shift towards
jazz-rock was not a complete surprise.
Hancock frequently talked of the
necessity of appealing to his audience.
His "Headhunters" album was not, as
some claim, only to make money, but
rather to find acceptance among the
music-listening public. With

"Headhunters" and the albums that fol
lowed it, Hancock gained this accep
tance.
On the "Quintet" album Hancock
shows that his playing has changed dur
ing his electric work. The hard-bop
style of his early work has been re
placed by a more orchestraF approach
to the piano. He is much more adept at
accompanying his sidemen than ever
before. On cuts such as "Dolores" or
"Jessica" this is particularly evident.
His playing is unfortunately not as
crisp as it was in the past, as even Han
cock admits. Vet with time, his ability
on the acoustic will return and perhaps
surpass his old work. (It should be

pointed out that it takes considerably
less finger strength and agility to play
electric keyboards, consequently it is
not surprising that Hancock should bea
bit rusty.)
The playing on the "Quintet" album
makes it evident that the group does
not play together regularly. But the ex
citement which the musicians generate
more than makes up for any looseness
in ensemble passages.
It is too soon to predict future
V.S.O.P albums and tours, but the op
portunity is undeniably there. From a
financial point of view, it is quite feasi
ble. Ironically, the V.S.O.P. musicians
were forced into more commercial
musical ventures, but there recent
reunion has been a smashing success.
The same music which couldn't find an
audience in the '60s is selling out large
auditoriums today.
Thus the V.S.O.P. musicians are pre
sent with the opportunity of playing
challenging music which is also com
mercially successful. It would be dif
ficult to imagine them turning this
down. Freddie Hubbard, for example,
has been openly critical of the music
which he is forced to play to earn a
living.
With his early work, Hubbard proved
that he is one of the top three of four
trumpeters around; yet at which
should be the peak of his career, he is
playing his most uninteresting music.
Not surprisingly, Hubbard takes advan
tage of the Quintet to showcase his ta
lents; his solos are consistently excel
lent throughout the album.
It is too early to say what influence
the Quintet will have on the jazz world.
It is unlikely that artists like Wayne
Shorter or Herbie Hancock will return
completely to acoustic music, yet it has
become clear that musicians no longer
must play "electric" to be successful. In
this regard, the Quintet's importance
cannot be undervalued.

and intertwine in complicated
patterns, but with uncompli
cated emotions. The ballet's
the thing, the mood alternately
tranquil and upbeat.
Vivaldi's playful, entergetic
music is the fourth star of the
piece. The other three (Susan
Alleluia, Deborah Frates and
Alyce Taylor) are competent,
graceful and attractive. An oc
casional misstep, however,
makes one somewhat uneasy,
as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.
Next comes "Intermezzo,"
also by Berg, also lyrical, grace
ful and neo-classical, set to
piano music by Brahms. Gay
Wallstrom and Michael Brad
shaw move well together, not
to be taken for granted in a pas
de deux, where the focus is on
a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,
but Bradshaw clearly is not a
strong dancer in the most basic
sense. The last few lifts are a
strain, and his heavy, close
mouthed breathing can be
heard all over the small au
ditorium.
The ballet itself is pleasant
but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
the empathy of their move
ments.
The lack of emotional con
tent in the first half of the prog
ram is more than compensated
for in the second half, with two
pieces by John Pasqualetti,
who like Berg is an artistic di
rector of the Pacific Ballet
Company.
"Daphne of the Dunes" fea
tures two men and a woman in
a bisexual menage a trois that

leaves nothing to the imagina
tion. Coming after the delicate
pink-and-white aesthetic of
Berg, "Daphne" is a jolt,
graphically portraying a long
series of couplings and thric
ings of the indecisive, some
what savage lovers.
Nancy Henderson is superb
as a sort of cat-woman with a
four-foot mane of synthetic
hair that moves and dances
with a wildness and gay aban
don that seem to be the
mainsprings of the piece. Cay
abandon is the best way to de
scribe the roles of John Los
chmann and Jeffrey Sherwood.
To say that they are as happy
with each other as with the
woman is not quite right. Hap
piness has nothing to do with
it. The point of the action
seems to be the action itself:
driven, animalistic, uncom
mited and absolutely compel
ling.
The second Pasqualetti
piece, "The Gospel According
t0..." is a world premiere,
treated to a standing ovation. A
complicated piece for five men
and five women set to several
gospels sung by Aretha
Franklin (recorded, of course),
it spends the energy and
rhythm so crucial to "Daphne"
on the more recognizable
framework of biblical charac
ters, loosely outlining the life
of Christ.
Yet even here, sexual am
biguity is evident. The men and
women wear identical dresses,
more reminiscent of Balen
ciaga gowns than tunics of the
first century A.D. The effect of
the color and movement of the
costumes is beautiful, how
ever, as the dancers, John Los
chmann in particular, dance
themselves into a frenzy. Sex
ual role hang-ups aside, it is an
exciting experience.
The program will be re
peated on November 20, 7:30
p.m. at Marines' Memorial

Herbie Hancock's recent return to
acoustic jazz has been seen by some as
a long needed rebirth of jazz, and by
others as a resurrection of dead and
outdated music. In either case, Han
cock's new work with the V.S.O.P.
Quintet is undoubtedly the most im
portant event in jazz this year.
The V.S.O.P. Quintet is a collection
of five of the most important musical
voices today: Hancock, Freddie Hub
bard, Ron Carter, Wayne Shorter and
Tony Williams. For the past several
years, these artists have been as
sociated with the jazz-rock fusion, but
now they have gathered to perform the
acoustic music they played during the
'60s. The Quintet first gathered two
years ago at the Newport jazz Festival,
when it was featured during a salute to
Hancock. Originally planned as a one
time affair (V.S.O.P. stands for Very
Special One-time Performance) its suc
cess led to an album, a concert tour and
now a second album, "The Quintet."
This album features cuts recorded dur-"
ing the Quintet's two California con
certs this summer.
Although the music must seem mys
tifying to fans of Hancock's more recent
work, it is the most rewarding album
which any of these artists (Ron Carter
excepted) has produced in the last five
years. When one looks at the artists in
dividually, the album's importance be
comes undeniable.
Freddie Hubbard: throughout the
late '60s and early '70s, Hubbard's work
for CTI was of generally high quality.
Albums such as "Red Clay" and
"Straight Life" featured consistently
good playing and excellent supporting
musicians. Pressured by his record
company, Hubbard's last two albums
have been disco-oriented jazz, de
signed to sell, not to please musical
purists.
Wayne Shorter: Shorter's work with
Weather Report has been interesting
but certainly not as challenging as the

Quintet's music. Wayne, during his
V.S.O.P. work, has been stretching
out, using longer phrases and more
elaborate solos than his Weather Re
port albums have revealed.
Tony Williams: Williams' re
emergence as a jazz drummer is
perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the
Quintet's work. Having started his big
time career at age 17 with Miles Davis,
Williams proved himself a great of jazz
drummers while still a teenager. Yet his
work during the '70s has been largely
ignored, while his stylistic followers,

Billy Cobham, for example, reaped the
recognition. His work on V.S.O.P.
combined with his recent album with
McCoy Tyner has heralded William's
re-entry as an important jazz figure.
Herbie Hancock's return to acoustic
music was the most surprising of all the
V.S.O.P. artists. Since his very popular
"Headhunters" album, he has rarely
played the acoustic piano. For the
Quintet album, however, he plays only
acoustic. He has also just recorded a
trio album on acoustic and will possibly
be playing solo recitals early next year.
Compared with his funk work of the
past few years Hancock's new man
euver is an astonishing reversal. In

deed, the acoustic albums which Han
cock recorded during the late '60s and
early '70s are among the best of that
period. Yet with his first jazz-funk
album, "Headhunters," Hancock sold
more albums than with all his previous
records combined. His shift towards
jazz-rock was not a complete surprise.
Hancock frequently talked of the
necessity of appealing to his audience.
His "Headhunters" album was not, as
some claim, only to make money, but
rather to find acceptance among the
music-listening public. With

"Headhunters" and the albums that fol
lowed it, Hancock gained this accep
tance.
On the "Quintet" album Hancock
shows that his playing has changed dur
ing his electric work. The hard-bop
style of his early work has been re
placed by a more orchestraF approach
to the piano. He is much more adept at
accompanying his sidemen than ever
before. On cuts such as "Dolores" or
"Jessica" this is particularly evident.
His playing is unfortunately not as
crisp as it was in the past, as even Han
cock admits. Vet with time, his ability
on the acoustic will return and perhaps
surpass his old work. (It should be

pointed out that it takes considerably
less finger strength and agility to play
electric keyboards, consequently it is
not surprising that Hancock should bea
bit rusty.)
The playing on the "Quintet" album
makes it evident that the group does
not play together regularly. But the ex
citement which the musicians generate
more than makes up for any looseness
in ensemble passages.
It is too soon to predict future
V.S.O.P albums and tours, but the op
portunity is undeniably there. From a
financial point of view, it is quite feasi
ble. Ironically, the V.S.O.P. musicians
were forced into more commercial
musical ventures, but there recent
reunion has been a smashing success.
The same music which couldn't find an
audience in the '60s is selling out large
auditoriums today.
Thus the V.S.O.P. musicians are pre
sent with the opportunity of playing
challenging music which is also com
mercially successful. It would be dif
ficult to imagine them turning this
down. Freddie Hubbard, for example,
has been openly critical of the music
which he is forced to play to earn a
living.
With his early work, Hubbard proved
that he is one of the top three of four
trumpeters around; yet at which
should be the peak of his career, he is
playing his most uninteresting music.
Not surprisingly, Hubbard takes advan
tage of the Quintet to showcase his ta
lents; his solos are consistently excel
lent throughout the album.
It is too early to say what influence
the Quintet will have on the jazz world.
It is unlikely that artists like Wayne
Shorter or Herbie Hancock will return
completely to acoustic music, yet it has
become clear that musicians no longer
must play "electric" to be successful. In
this regard, the Quintet's importance
cannot be undervalued.

Schizophrenia is the out

Pacific Ballet's opening fall per

the second half pulsates with

as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.
Next comes "Intermezzo,"
also by Berg, also lyrical, grace
ful and neo-classical, set to
piano music by Brahms. Gay
Wallstrom and Michael Brad
shaw move well together, not
to be taken for granted in a pas
de deux, where the focus is on
a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,
but Bradshaw clearly is not a
strong dancer in the most basic
sense. The last few lifts are a
strain, and his heavy, close
mouthed breathing can be
heard all over the small au
ditorium.
The ballet itself is pleasant
but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
the empathy of their move
ments.
The lack of emotional con
tent in the first half of the prog
ram is more than compensated
for in the second half, with two
pieces by John Pasqualetti,
who like Berg is an artistic di
rector of the Pacific Ballet
Company.
"Daphne of the Dunes" fea
tures two men and a woman in
a bisexual menage a trois that

leaves nothing to the imagina
tion. Coming after the delicate
pink-and-white aesthetic of
Berg, "Daphne" is a jolt,
graphically portraying a long
series of couplings and thric
ings of the indecisive, some
what savage lovers.
Nancy Henderson is superb
as a sort of cat-woman with a
four-foot mane of synthetic
hair that moves and dances
with a wildness and gay aban
don that seem to be the
mainsprings of the piece. Cay
abandon is the best way to de
scribe the roles of John Los
chmann and Jeffrey Sherwood.
To say that they are as happy
with each other as with the
woman is not quite right. Hap
piness has nothing to do with
it. The point of the action
seems to be the action itself:
driven, animalistic, uncom
mited and absolutely compel
ling.
The second Pasqualetti
piece, "The Gospel According
t0..." is a world premiere,
treated to a standing ovation. A
complicated piece for five men
and five women set to several
gospels sung by Aretha
Franklin (recorded, of course),
it spends the energy and
rhythm so crucial to "Daphne"
on the more recognizable
framework of biblical charac
ters, loosely outlining the life
of Christ.
Yet even here, sexual am
biguity is evident. The men and
women wear identical dresses,
more reminiscent of Balen
ciaga gowns than tunics of the
first century A.D. The effect of
the color and movement of the
costumes is beautiful, how
ever, as the dancers, John Los
chmann in particular, dance
themselves into a frenzy. Sex
ual role hang-ups aside, it is an
exciting experience.
The program will be re
peated on November 20, 7:30
p.m. at Marines' Memorial

Herbie Hancock's recent return to
acoustic jazz has been seen by some as
a long needed rebirth of jazz, and by
others as a resurrection of dead and
outdated music. In either case, Han
cock's new work with the V.S.O.P.
Quintet is undoubtedly the most im
portant event in jazz this year.
The V.S.O.P. Quintet is a collection
of five of the most important musical
voices today: Hancock, Freddie Hub
bard, Ron Carter, Wayne Shorter and
Tony Williams. For the past several
years, these artists have been as
sociated with the jazz-rock fusion, but
now they have gathered to perform the
acoustic music they played during the
'60s. The Quintet first gathered two
years ago at the Newport jazz Festival,
when it was featured during a salute to
Hancock. Originally planned as a one
time affair (V.S.O.P. stands for Very
Special One-time Performance) its suc
cess led to an album, a concert tour and
now a second album, "The Quintet."
This album features cuts recorded dur-"
ing the Quintet's two California con
certs this summer.
Although the music must seem mys
tifying to fans of Hancock's more recent
work, it is the most rewarding album
which any of these artists (Ron Carter
excepted) has produced in the last five
years. When one looks at the artists in
dividually, the album's importance be
comes undeniable.
Freddie Hubbard: throughout the
late '60s and early '70s, Hubbard's work
for CTI was of generally high quality.
Albums such as "Red Clay" and
"Straight Life" featured consistently
good playing and excellent supporting
musicians. Pressured by his record
company, Hubbard's last two albums
have been disco-oriented jazz, de
signed to sell, not to please musical
purists.
Wayne Shorter: Shorter's work with
Weather Report has been interesting
but certainly not as challenging as the

Quintet's music. Wayne, during his
V.S.O.P. work, has been stretching
out, using longer phrases and more
elaborate solos than his Weather Re
port albums have revealed.
Tony Williams: Williams' re
emergence as a jazz drummer is
perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the
Quintet's work. Having started his big
time career at age 17 with Miles Davis,
Williams proved himself a great of jazz
drummers while still a teenager. Yet his
work during the '70s has been largely
ignored, while his stylistic followers,

Billy Cobham, for example, reaped the
recognition. His work on V.S.O.P.
combined with his recent album with
McCoy Tyner has heralded William's
re-entry as an important jazz figure.
Herbie Hancock's return to acoustic
music was the most surprising of all the
V.S.O.P. artists. Since his very popular
"Headhunters" album, he has rarely
played the acoustic piano. For the
Quintet album, however, he plays only
acoustic. He has also just recorded a
trio album on acoustic and will possibly
be playing solo recitals early next year.
Compared with his funk work of the
past few years Hancock's new man
euver is an astonishing reversal. In

deed, the acoustic albums which Han
cock recorded during the late '60s and
early '70s are among the best of that
period. Yet with his first jazz-funk
album, "Headhunters," Hancock sold
more albums than with all his previous
records combined. His shift towards
jazz-rock was not a complete surprise.
Hancock frequently talked of the
necessity of appealing to his audience.
His "Headhunters" album was not, as
some claim, only to make money, but
rather to find acceptance among the
music-listening public. With

"Headhunters" and the albums that fol
lowed it, Hancock gained this accep
tance.
On the "Quintet" album Hancock
shows that his playing has changed dur
ing his electric work. The hard-bop
style of his early work has been re
placed by a more orchestraF approach
to the piano. He is much more adept at
accompanying his sidemen than ever
before. On cuts such as "Dolores" or
"Jessica" this is particularly evident.
His playing is unfortunately not as
crisp as it was in the past, as even Han
cock admits. Vet with time, his ability
on the acoustic will return and perhaps
surpass his old work. (It should be

pointed out that it takes considerably
less finger strength and agility to play
electric keyboards, consequently it is
not surprising that Hancock should bea
bit rusty.)
The playing on the "Quintet" album
makes it evident that the group does
not play together regularly. But the ex
citement which the musicians generate
more than makes up for any looseness
in ensemble passages.
It is too soon to predict future
V.S.O.P albums and tours, but the op
portunity is undeniably there. From a
financial point of view, it is quite feasi
ble. Ironically, the V.S.O.P. musicians
were forced into more commercial
musical ventures, but there recent
reunion has been a smashing success.
The same music which couldn't find an
audience in the '60s is selling out large
auditoriums today.
Thus the V.S.O.P. musicians are pre
sent with the opportunity of playing
challenging music which is also com
mercially successful. It would be dif
ficult to imagine them turning this
down. Freddie Hubbard, for example,
has been openly critical of the music
which he is forced to play to earn a
living.
With his early work, Hubbard proved
that he is one of the top three of four
trumpeters around; yet at which
should be the peak of his career, he is
playing his most uninteresting music.
Not surprisingly, Hubbard takes advan
tage of the Quintet to showcase his ta
lents; his solos are consistently excel
lent throughout the album.
It is too early to say what influence
the Quintet will have on the jazz world.
It is unlikely that artists like Wayne
Shorter or Herbie Hancock will return
completely to acoustic music, yet it has
become clear that musicians no longer
must play "electric" to be successful. In
this regard, the Quintet's importance
cannot be undervalued.

Schizophrenia is the out
standing characteristic of the
Pacific Ballet's opening fall per
formance. The first half of its
program concentrates on bal
letic sweetness and light, while
the second half pulsates with
conflict and sensuality.
"La Primavera," choreog
raphed by Henry Berg to music
by Antonio Vivaldi, starts the
evening with gentle lyricism.
Three women in pale pink twirl
and intertwine in complicated
patterns, but with uncompli
cated emotions. The ballet's
the thing, the mood alternately
tranquil and upbeat.
Vivaldi's playful, entergetic
music is the fourth star of the
piece. The other three (Susan
Alleluia, Deborah Frates and
Alyce Taylor) are competent,
graceful and attractive. An oc
casional misstep, however,
makes one somewhat uneasy,
as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.

a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,
but Bradshaw clearly is not a
strong dancer in the most basic
sense. The last few lifts are a
strain, and his heavy, close
mouthed breathing can be
heard all over the small au
ditorium.
The ballet itself is pleasant
but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
the empathy of their move
ments.
The lack of emotional con
tent in the first half of the prog
ram is more than compensated
for in the second half, with two
pieces by John Pasqualetti,
who like Berg is an artistic di
rector of the Pacific Ballet
Company.
"Daphne of the Dunes" fea
tures two men and a woman in
a bisexual menage a trois that

leaves nothing to the imagina
tion. Coming after the delicate
pink-and-white aesthetic of
Berg, "Daphne" is a jolt,
graphically portraying a long
series of couplings and thric
ings of the indecisive, some
what savage lovers.
Nancy Henderson is superb
as a sort of cat-woman with a
four-foot mane of synthetic
hair that moves and dances
with a wildness and gay aban
don that seem to be the
mainsprings of the piece. Cay
abandon is the best way to de
scribe the roles of John Los
chmann and Jeffrey Sherwood.
To say that they are as happy
with each other as with the
woman is not quite right. Hap
piness has nothing to do with
it. The point of the action
seems to be the action itself:
driven, animalistic, uncom
mited and absolutely compel
ling.
The second Pasqualetti
piece, "The Gospel According
t0..." is a world premiere,
treated to a standing ovation. A
complicated piece for five men
and five women set to several
gospels sung by Aretha
Franklin (recorded, of course),
it spends the energy and
rhythm so crucial to "Daphne"
on the more recognizable
framework of biblical charac
ters, loosely outlining the life
of Christ.
Yet even here, sexual am
biguity is evident. The men and
women wear identical dresses,
more reminiscent of Balen
ciaga gowns than tunics of the
first century A.D. The effect of
the color and movement of the
costumes is beautiful, how
ever, as the dancers, John Los
chmann in particular, dance
themselves into a frenzy. Sex
ual role hang-ups aside, it is an
exciting experience.
The program will be re
peated on November 20, 7:30
p.m. at Marines' Memorial

Herbie Hancock's recent return to
acoustic jazz has been seen by some as
a long needed rebirth of jazz, and by
others as a resurrection of dead and
outdated music. In either case, Han
cock's new work with the V.S.O.P.
Quintet is undoubtedly the most im
portant event in jazz this year.
The V.S.O.P. Quintet is a collection
of five of the most important musical
voices today: Hancock, Freddie Hub
bard, Ron Carter, Wayne Shorter and
Tony Williams. For the past several
years, these artists have been as
sociated with the jazz-rock fusion, but
now they have gathered to perform the
acoustic music they played during the
'60s. The Quintet first gathered two
years ago at the Newport jazz Festival,
when it was featured during a salute to
Hancock. Originally planned as a one
time affair (V.S.O.P. stands for Very
Special One-time Performance) its suc
cess led to an album, a concert tour and
now a second album, "The Quintet."
This album features cuts recorded dur-"
ing the Quintet's two California con
certs this summer.
Although the music must seem mys
tifying to fans of Hancock's more recent
work, it is the most rewarding album
which any of these artists (Ron Carter
excepted) has produced in the last five
years. When one looks at the artists in
dividually, the album's importance be
comes undeniable.
Freddie Hubbard: throughout the
late '60s and early '70s, Hubbard's work
for CTI was of generally high quality.
Albums such as "Red Clay" and
"Straight Life" featured consistently
good playing and excellent supporting
musicians. Pressured by his record
company, Hubbard's last two albums
have been disco-oriented jazz, de
signed to sell, not to please musical
purists.
Wayne Shorter: Shorter's work with
Weather Report has been interesting
but certainly not as challenging as the

Quintet's music. Wayne, during his
V.S.O.P. work, has been stretching
out, using longer phrases and more
elaborate solos than his Weather Re
port albums have revealed.
Tony Williams: Williams' re
emergence as a jazz drummer is
perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the
Quintet's work. Having started his big
time career at age 17 with Miles Davis,
Williams proved himself a great of jazz
drummers while still a teenager. Yet his
work during the '70s has been largely
ignored, while his stylistic followers,

Billy Cobham, for example, reaped the
recognition. His work on V.S.O.P.
combined with his recent album with
McCoy Tyner has heralded William's
re-entry as an important jazz figure.
Herbie Hancock's return to acoustic
music was the most surprising of all the
V.S.O.P. artists. Since his very popular
"Headhunters" album, he has rarely
played the acoustic piano. For the
Quintet album, however, he plays only
acoustic. He has also just recorded a
trio album on acoustic and will possibly
be playing solo recitals early next year.
Compared with his funk work of the
past few years Hancock's new man
euver is an astonishing reversal. In

deed, the acoustic albums which Han
cock recorded during the late '60s and
early '70s are among the best of that
period. Yet with his first jazz-funk
album, "Headhunters," Hancock sold
more albums than with all his previous
records combined. His shift towards
jazz-rock was not a complete surprise.
Hancock frequently talked of the
necessity of appealing to his audience.
His "Headhunters" album was not, as
some claim, only to make money, but
rather to find acceptance among the
music-listening public. With

"Headhunters" and the albums that fol
lowed it, Hancock gained this accep
tance.
On the "Quintet" album Hancock
shows that his playing has changed dur
ing his electric work. The hard-bop
style of his early work has been re
placed by a more orchestraF approach
to the piano. He is much more adept at
accompanying his sidemen than ever
before. On cuts such as "Dolores" or
"Jessica" this is particularly evident.
His playing is unfortunately not as
crisp as it was in the past, as even Han
cock admits. Vet with time, his ability
on the acoustic will return and perhaps
surpass his old work. (It should be

pointed out that it takes considerably
less finger strength and agility to play
electric keyboards, consequently it is
not surprising that Hancock should bea
bit rusty.)
The playing on the "Quintet" album
makes it evident that the group does
not play together regularly. But the ex
citement which the musicians generate
more than makes up for any looseness
in ensemble passages.
It is too soon to predict future
V.S.O.P albums and tours, but the op
portunity is undeniably there. From a
financial point of view, it is quite feasi
ble. Ironically, the V.S.O.P. musicians
were forced into more commercial
musical ventures, but there recent
reunion has been a smashing success.
The same music which couldn't find an
audience in the '60s is selling out large
auditoriums today.
Thus the V.S.O.P. musicians are pre
sent with the opportunity of playing
challenging music which is also com
mercially successful. It would be dif
ficult to imagine them turning this
down. Freddie Hubbard, for example,
has been openly critical of the music
which he is forced to play to earn a
living.
With his early work, Hubbard proved
that he is one of the top three of four
trumpeters around; yet at which
should be the peak of his career, he is
playing his most uninteresting music.
Not surprisingly, Hubbard takes advan
tage of the Quintet to showcase his ta
lents; his solos are consistently excel
lent throughout the album.
It is too early to say what influence
the Quintet will have on the jazz world.
It is unlikely that artists like Wayne
Shorter or Herbie Hancock will return
completely to acoustic music, yet it has
become clear that musicians no longer
must play "electric" to be successful. In
this regard, the Quintet's importance
cannot be undervalued.

Schizophrenia is the out
standing characteristic of the
Pacific Ballet's opening fall per
formance. The first half of its
program concentrates on bal
letic sweetness and light, while
the second half pulsates with
conflict and sensuality.
"La Primavera," choreog
raphed by Henry Berg to music
by Antonio Vivaldi, starts the
evening with gentle lyricism.
Three women in pale pink twirl
and intertwine in complicated
patterns, but with uncompli
cated emotions. The ballet's
the thing, the mood alternately
tranquil and upbeat.
Vivaldi's playful, entergetic
music is the fourth star of the
piece. The other three (Susan
Alleluia, Deborah Frates and
Alyce Taylor) are competent,
graceful and attractive. An oc
casional misstep, however,
makes one somewhat uneasy,
as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.
Next comes "Intermezzo,"
also by Berg, also lyrical, grace
ful and neo-classical, set to
piano music by Brahms. Gay
Wallstrom and Michael Brad
shaw move well together, not
to be taken for granted in a pas
de deux, where the focus is on
a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,

but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
the empathy of their move
ments.
The lack of emotional con
tent in the first half of the prog
ram is more than compensated
for in the second half, with two
pieces by John Pasqualetti,
who like Berg is an artistic di
rector of the Pacific Ballet
Company.
"Daphne of the Dunes" fea
tures two men and a woman in
a bisexual menage a trois that

leaves nothing to the imagina
tion. Coming after the delicate
pink-and-white aesthetic of
Berg, "Daphne" is a jolt,
graphically portraying a long
series of couplings and thric
ings of the indecisive, some
what savage lovers.
Nancy Henderson is superb
as a sort of cat-woman with a
four-foot mane of synthetic
hair that moves and dances
with a wildness and gay aban
don that seem to be the
mainsprings of the piece. Cay
abandon is the best way to de
scribe the roles of John Los
chmann and Jeffrey Sherwood.
To say that they are as happy
with each other as with the
woman is not quite right. Hap
piness has nothing to do with
it. The point of the action
seems to be the action itself:
driven, animalistic, uncom
mited and absolutely compel
ling.
The second Pasqualetti
piece, "The Gospel According
t0..." is a world premiere,
treated to a standing ovation. A
complicated piece for five men
and five women set to several
gospels sung by Aretha
Franklin (recorded, of course),
it spends the energy and
rhythm so crucial to "Daphne"
on the more recognizable
framework of biblical charac
ters, loosely outlining the life
of Christ.
Yet even here, sexual am
biguity is evident. The men and
women wear identical dresses,
more reminiscent of Balen
ciaga gowns than tunics of the
first century A.D. The effect of
the color and movement of the
costumes is beautiful, how
ever, as the dancers, John Los
chmann in particular, dance
themselves into a frenzy. Sex
ual role hang-ups aside, it is an
exciting experience.
The program will be re
peated on November 20, 7:30
p.m. at Marines' Memorial
Theatre, San Francisco.

Herbie Hancock's recent return to
acoustic jazz has been seen by some as
a long needed rebirth of jazz, and by
others as a resurrection of dead and
outdated music. In either case, Han
cock's new work with the V.S.O.P.
Quintet is undoubtedly the most im
portant event in jazz this year.
The V.S.O.P. Quintet is a collection
of five of the most important musical
voices today: Hancock, Freddie Hub
bard, Ron Carter, Wayne Shorter and
Tony Williams. For the past several
years, these artists have been as
sociated with the jazz-rock fusion, but
now they have gathered to perform the
acoustic music they played during the
'60s. The Quintet first gathered two
years ago at the Newport jazz Festival,
when it was featured during a salute to
Hancock. Originally planned as a one
time affair (V.S.O.P. stands for Very
Special One-time Performance) its suc
cess led to an album, a concert tour and
now a second album, "The Quintet."
This album features cuts recorded dur-"
ing the Quintet's two California con
certs this summer.
Although the music must seem mys
tifying to fans of Hancock's more recent
work, it is the most rewarding album
which any of these artists (Ron Carter
excepted) has produced in the last five
years. When one looks at the artists in
dividually, the album's importance be
comes undeniable.
Freddie Hubbard: throughout the
late '60s and early '70s, Hubbard's work
for CTI was of generally high quality.
Albums such as "Red Clay" and
"Straight Life" featured consistently
good playing and excellent supporting
musicians. Pressured by his record
company, Hubbard's last two albums
have been disco-oriented jazz, de
signed to sell, not to please musical
purists.
Wayne Shorter: Shorter's work with
Weather Report has been interesting
but certainly not as challenging as the

Quintet's music. Wayne, during his
V.S.O.P. work, has been stretching
out, using longer phrases and more
elaborate solos than his Weather Re
port albums have revealed.
Tony Williams: Williams' re
emergence as a jazz drummer is
perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the
Quintet's work. Having started his big
time career at age 17 with Miles Davis,
Williams proved himself a great of jazz
drummers while still a teenager. Yet his
work during the '70s has been largely
ignored, while his stylistic followers,

Billy Cobham, for example, reaped the
recognition. His work on V.S.O.P.
combined with his recent album with
McCoy Tyner has heralded William's
re-entry as an important jazz figure.
Herbie Hancock's return to acoustic
music was the most surprising of all the
V.S.O.P. artists. Since his very popular
"Headhunters" album, he has rarely
played the acoustic piano. For the
Quintet album, however, he plays only
acoustic. He has also just recorded a
trio album on acoustic and will possibly
be playing solo recitals early next year.
Compared with his funk work of the
past few years Hancock's new man
euver is an astonishing reversal. In

deed, the acoustic albums which Han
cock recorded during the late '60s and
early '70s are among the best of that
period. Yet with his first jazz-funk
album, "Headhunters," Hancock sold
more albums than with all his previous
records combined. His shift towards
jazz-rock was not a complete surprise.
Hancock frequently talked of the
necessity of appealing to his audience.
His "Headhunters" album was not, as
some claim, only to make money, but
rather to find acceptance among the
music-listening public. With

"Headhunters" and the albums that fol
lowed it, Hancock gained this accep
tance.
On the "Quintet" album Hancock
shows that his playing has changed dur
ing his electric work. The hard-bop
style of his early work has been re
placed by a more orchestraF approach
to the piano. He is much more adept at
accompanying his sidemen than ever
before. On cuts such as "Dolores" or
"Jessica" this is particularly evident.
His playing is unfortunately not as
crisp as it was in the past, as even Han
cock admits. Vet with time, his ability
on the acoustic will return and perhaps
surpass his old work. (It should be

pointed out that it takes considerably
less finger strength and agility to play
electric keyboards, consequently it is
not surprising that Hancock should bea
bit rusty.)
The playing on the "Quintet" album
makes it evident that the group does
not play together regularly. But the ex
citement which the musicians generate
more than makes up for any looseness
in ensemble passages.
It is too soon to predict future
V.S.O.P albums and tours, but the op
portunity is undeniably there. From a
financial point of view, it is quite feasi
ble. Ironically, the V.S.O.P. musicians
were forced into more commercial
musical ventures, but there recent
reunion has been a smashing success.
The same music which couldn't find an
audience in the '60s is selling out large
auditoriums today.
Thus the V.S.O.P. musicians are pre
sent with the opportunity of playing
challenging music which is also com
mercially successful. It would be dif
ficult to imagine them turning this
down. Freddie Hubbard, for example,
has been openly critical of the music
which he is forced to play to earn a
living.
With his early work, Hubbard proved
that he is one of the top three of four
trumpeters around; yet at which
should be the peak of his career, he is
playing his most uninteresting music.
Not surprisingly, Hubbard takes advan
tage of the Quintet to showcase his ta
lents; his solos are consistently excel
lent throughout the album.
It is too early to say what influence
the Quintet will have on the jazz world.
It is unlikely that artists like Wayne
Shorter or Herbie Hancock will return
completely to acoustic music, yet it has
become clear that musicians no longer
must play "electric" to be successful. In
this regard, the Quintet's importance
cannot be undervalued.

Schizophrenia is the out
standing characteristic of the
Pacific Ballet's opening fall per
formance. The first half of its
program concentrates on bal
letic sweetness and light, while
the second half pulsates with
conflict and sensuality.
"La Primavera," choreog
raphed by Henry Berg to music
by Antonio Vivaldi, starts the
evening with gentle lyricism.
Three women in pale pink twirl
and intertwine in complicated
patterns, but with uncompli
cated emotions. The ballet's
the thing, the mood alternately
tranquil and upbeat.
Vivaldi's playful, entergetic
music is the fourth star of the
piece. The other three (Susan
Alleluia, Deborah Frates and
Alyce Taylor) are competent,
graceful and attractive. An oc
casional misstep, however,
makes one somewhat uneasy,
as if one were holding one's
breath while watching figure
skaters, hoping they don't lose
their balance and fall.
Next comes "Intermezzo,"
also by Berg, also lyrical, grace
ful and neo-classical, set to
piano music by Brahms. Gay
Wallstrom and Michael Brad
shaw move well together, not
to be taken for granted in a pas
de deux, where the focus is on
a pair, as opposed to two indi
vidual dancers.

Wallstrom is sure of herself,
which is a relief after the low
level anxiety of the first piece,
but Bradshaw clearly is not a
strong dancer in the most basic
sense. The last few lifts are a
strain, and his heavy, close
mouthed breathing can be
heard all over the small au
ditorium.
The ballet itself is pleasant
but emotionally sterile, at least
as danced by these two. The
one moment of interaction be
tween them, in which they
simply look at each other, has
so little emotional content it is
almost embarrassing. Not only
is there no spark between
them, there is no connection at
all, which is odd considering
