63 killed in Israeli reprisals
Lebanon — Israeli warplanes streaked across the
southern Lebanese border early yesterday, pounding
Palestinian strongholds in reprisal for guerrilla rocket
attacks that killed three Israelis this week. Lebanese
officials said the Israeli foray killed 63 persons and
wounded 82.
Israel's deputy defense minister, at a funeral for
one of the Israeli victims, said the guerrillas "will pay
the full price for their actions," that "Jewish blood is
not for the taking," and vowed "never to give the
murderers any rest."
Abu Jihad, a Palestinian guerrilla commander
supervising rescue operations in the nearly flattened
town of Azzieh, six miles north of the border, said,
"not a single guerrilla has been killed and most of the
casualties are women and children."
It was the first Israeli air raid announced in nearly
two years, and the first time the hardline government
of Menahem Begin has openly flexed its military mus
cle since taking office June 20.
Bomb craters 10 yards wide could be seen in vil
lages and camps hit by the Israeli jets. Refugees said
as many as 12 Israeli jets made repeated sorties to
drop their bombs during the early morning raid.
A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion said the raid was "a direct consequence of the
irresponsible and criminal encouragement of Israel
by the United States."
Burns warns against dollar cut
Washington — A continuing decline in the value of
the dollar would increase consumer prices in this
country and could throw the world economy into a
tailspin, Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Re
serve Board said yesterday.
"If you depreciate the dollar, you'll be releasing
forces that not Congress nor the Federal Reserve, nor
anyone else will be able to control," Burns told the
Senate Banking Committee.
"We dare not, therefore, be complacent about the
current depreciating tendencies of the dollar," he
said.
The dollar has dropped steeply in value in recent
months against the German mark, the Japanese yen
and the Swiss franc, in part because of this country's
huge trade deficit, estimated at $25 billion to $30
billion this year.

Brezhnev praises U.S. relations
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev re
ceived a message from President Jimmy Carter yes
terday and said U.S.-Soviet relations have shown "a
definite change for the better."
U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon handed Carter's
message to Brezhnev during a meeting in the Soviet
leader's Kremlin office that lasted just more than an
hour.
A State Department spokesman in Washington said
the message was a private letter relating to the 60th
anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, celebrated
Monday. But American officials here and in
Washington declined to give its contents.
The Soviet news agency Tass said Brezhnev pointed
to a definite change for the better in relations bet
ween the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. lately and reaf
firmed the U.S.S.R.'s consistent course toward a
steady and constructive development of relations.
Anti-heroin progress questioned
New York — Despite claims by President Jimmy
Carter that his administration has made great head
way in fighting the nation's heroin problem, law en
forcement officials in many urban areas say use of the
drug is as high as ever.
The officials and other drug authorities concede
that for the most part the federal government has
been successful in its campaign to stem the flow of
"brown" heroin from Mexico, the United States'
main supplier.
But, they maintain, the ebbing of the Mexican flow
has merely resulted in the main supply shifting to the
"white" heroin from the Far East and in dealers reduc
ing the purity level of whatever kind of heroin they
sell.
Earlier this week, Carter said his administration's
fight against heroin abuse had achieved "remarkable
success" because of reduced quality of the drug, lack
of availability and increases in price. He also cited a
decline in heroin-related crimes.
Voters unhappy with Carter
New York — A large majority of voters in three
heavily Democratic big cities say President Jimmy
Carter is doing a bad job managing the problems of
urban America — a world some voters clearly would
like to escape.
An Associated Press-NBC election-day poll

conducted Tuesday shows Carter's overall job rating
among voters in Houston, Cleveland and New York
City is low, and their view of his performance plum
mets precipitously when they specifically evaluate his
handling of city problems.
In New York City, 75 per cent of the polled electo
rate said Carter has been doing "only fair" or a
"poor" job dealing with urban problems. And one of
three of the New York voters is considering a move
from the city.
Federal employes on welfare rolls
Washington — A government check of welfare reci
pients has turned up 26,334 current or recent federal
workers on welfare rolls, HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano Jr., announced yesterday.
They made up 1.4 per cent of the 1.8 million federal
workers whose names were checked by computer
against records of 8.2 million welfare recipients in 20
states and the District of Columbia. There are 2.7
million federal workers and 11.2 million persons in
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children prog
ram.
Califano said many federal workers with large
families and low-paying jobs may be entitled to the
benefits. He said he does not think federal workers
are "more fraud-prone than any other group of citi
zens."
NRC denies nuclear safety hazard
Washington — The staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission says there is no need to shut down nuc
lear power plants to correct electrical and fire
hazards, contrary to charges made by a citizens
group.
The Union of Concerned Scientists Friday pub
lished a memorandum from one NRC official to
another describing defects in electrical connectors
and citing a test in which fire spread through trays of
electrical cables.
Robert Pollard, a nuclear safety engineer who had
quit the NRC two years ago and joined the Union of
Concerned Scientists, petitioned the NRC to suspend
power plant operations where such defects exist.
Today's weather
