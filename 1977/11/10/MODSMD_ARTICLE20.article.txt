# Another look at the Guarneri Quartet
## Music great but the act lacks life 
### 
The Cuarneri is a great quartet. To
those of us who have known them exc
lusively from their recordings, or from
last year's Beethoven cycle"at Stanford,
however, this year's set of concerts
might come as a shock; their playing is
no less accurate or less polished than
before, but I found that, for the most
part, I could only enjoy them with my
eyes closed. The group's performance
philosophy made me happy to be lis
tening, but not excited to be doing this
listening there.
There is an element of theater in all
performed music — the performers are
contributing visual stimulae to the au
dience, whether their intention in
cludes that or not.
The Cuarneri theater is not the best
in the world — their approach is so visi
bly serious that success can only come
when they play a piece that matches
their attitude, such as last year's late
Beethoven, or the Berg "Quartet" that
they played last Sunday. (This treat
ment would have been great on the
Lutoslowski had they played it well, but
that's a different story.)
This raises a very old and provocative
question — should a performing en
semble alter its approach from record
ing studio to concert hall? In other

words, should the great artist acknow
ledge the presence of the audience by
including in his performance certain
gestures or expressions that are
superflous to the music?
The Guarneri would say no; their ap
proach is based on the premise that
there is only one interpretation that is
valid for them, and this interpretation
should be immutable from record to
live performance. The music should
speak for itself and remain pure from
pollution by any showmanship.
By no means am I suggesting that
their performance could have been en
hanced by the addition of contrived ex
tramusical gimmicks; no three-ring
circus or naked dancers could have
made me enjoy them more. I just
wanted to see them enjoying them
selves — to be critical of their own play
ing in such a way that they could smile if
they felt satisfied with the quality of
their performance.
Good quartet playing needs to be
precise; consequently, the members of
the Guarneri, in order to achieve their
high level of precision, must devote
their full concentration to the paramet
ers of every note they play. It takes the
same concentration, however, to play
both a frivolous note and a solemn one,

so the concentration shows on their
faces in similar fashion; in Schubert's
"Quartet in E flat" the effect of the light,
bird call-like phrases of the scherzo was
lost almost entirely because First Violin
Steinhardt's facial expression referred
to how to play the notes, rather than to
the humor that was Schubert's justifica
tion for writing those notes in the first
place.
The sound was beautiful, but when
we see so much heaviness go into the
production of a light effect, we become
confused; it is like a magic show in
which the mirrors and wires necessary
tor the performance of the tricks are in
full view — the trick may be no less well
realized, but we are no longer impre
ssed, because we have seen how it
works.
Such is the case with music — the
performer must avoid dispelling the
magic of the music, not dragging it
down to the mundane, but allowing it
to capture the effect for which the
composer had originally intended it.
Without this approach, the Guarneri
has condemned itself to the role of
being everyone's favorite recording ar
tist.
