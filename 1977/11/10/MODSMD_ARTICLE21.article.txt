In an early diary entry, Virginia Woolf describes
passing a single file of "imbeciles" on her afternoon
constitutional: ". . . one realized that every one in
that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling
idiotic creature, with no forehead, or no chin, and an
imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious stare. It was per
fectly horrible. They should certainly be killed." The
passage is remarkable for the simple cruelty, em
phasized when Woolf immediately turns to the sub
ject of buying pineapples. This cruelty concerning
human frailties, which is sometimes elevated to lack
of sympathy, and the descriptions of everyday com
merce,share her attention in this diary.
Perhaps her flinty tongue, striking epigrammatic
protraits of friends and strangers, expresses its moral
principle when she says, of a friend, "He abused Ott.,
but frankly." These portraits are not thoughtlessly
abusive; the people in her life do not form a line of
imbeciles whom she murders with words. One sus
pects Woolf values frankness not because of the in
timacy it affords, but the distance. The distance is
pronounced when she describes people as animals.
Katherine Mansfield "stinks like a . . . civet cat;" a
servant resembles "a rough coated young carthorse,
with muddy hoofs;" "the upper classes looked like
pet dogs threatened with a cold bath." She reports
being "amused" when her brother confides his fear
of the human faces he sees "like gorillas . . .perfectly
inhuman. . . She wonders if "the horrible sense of
community which the war produces, as if we all sat in
a third class railway carriage together, draws one's
attention to the animal human being more closely."
This passage brings together her vision of the ani
mal human, the presence of war, and Woolf's sen
sitivity to class differences, all of which echo
throughout the diary. The animal in the human both
attracts and repells Woolf. As a metaphor, the quality
is attractive, even affectionate, growing from a family
habit of nicknaming herself "Mandril" or "Goat" and
her husband "Mongoose." But the closeness of the
third-class railway carriage suggests the press of
flesh, the odor of wet wool and bad breath, the
muddy boots and, what is worse, the muddy minds.

Perhaps she guesses that her sharp tongue, that
"long goose wand" that contains the unpredictable,
moody and mad human personality in words, would
provide no control in the midst of the "masses,"
"docile herds," "crowds" which she detests. Her
form of ridicule is a way of containing the "animal"
that threatens to spill over, whether high born or low.
The day peace is announced in 1918, Woolf watches
the drunken, boisterous crowds and notes, "there
was no centre, no form for all this wandering emotion
to take."
Yet, standing off to the side of the crowd and mak
ing mental notes for her diary, she does give it form.
Woolf never loses herself in the midst of any gather
ing; she is always observing, or observing herself
observing. It may be the only way to preserve her self,
that could slip so easily into another person's habit of
mind and observe that person inside and out. Even
her language preserves her social and emotional au
tonomy: she speaks of taking up her "station" in the
kitchen during air raids, the servants one floor below
her in the cellar. In the midst of war, she preserves

these class distinctions.
The diarist notes that one reviewer describes the
characters of her second novel, "Night and Day," as
"four impassioned snails." It is ironic that an author
who compares so many people to animals has her
characters dismissed at the level of crustaceans.
This reference appears at the end of the first vol
ume of the diary. It is not as an author that Virginia
Woolf emerges in these pages, but as a book reviewer
and printer. The "Times Literary Supplement" some
times sends her two and three books a week; she
spends hours setting type and hand-printing copies
of Katherine Mansfield's "Prelude" and T.S. Eliot's
"Poems" under the imprint of the Hogarth Press. It is
only when the review books don't arrive, or requests
for Hogarth publications subside, that she mentions
the novel in progress.
In fact, despite the friends, family and acquain
tances who populate these pages, it is a profile of a
life devoted to work that emerges. Woolf answers her
own question as to what constitutes happiness, with
the word "work." Her intense dislike of the Jonso
nian flesh teaming the streets is more understandable
when compared to the cerebral, almost ascetic, qual
ity of her life: long hours spent reading over a fire,
afternoon walks in the park, quiet evenings with
Leonard. The subject of "happiness" echoes again
and again at the end of this diary. One might think she
overlooks an important source of her happiness, a
quiet and terse presence in this diary, until she men
tions her husband in the last sentence of this volume:
"Yet I daresay we're the happiest couple in England."
This exact sentiment echoes again in the last sen
tence she ever wrote. Woolf's own demon, a peculiar
kind of animal, was madness, and when she felt an
other attack coming on in the spring of 1941 she wrote
Leonard a farewell letter. In it, she mentioned her
happiness with him four times and ended with the
words, "I don't think two people could have been
happier that we have been."
Then, as if the many walks on the downs in this
diary foreshadow it, she walked across the water
meadows to the River Ouse, and drowned herself.

afternoon walks in the park, quiet evenings with

overlooks an important source of her happiness, a
quiet and terse presence in this diary, until she men
tions her husband in the last sentence of this volume:
"Yet I daresay we're the happiest couple in England."

tence she ever wrote. Woolf's own demon, a peculiar
kind of animal, was madness, and when she felt an
other attack coming on in the spring of 1941 she wrote
Leonard a farewell letter. In it, she mentioned her
happiness with him four times and ended with the

happier that we have been."

The Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume One 1915-
1919. Edited by Anne Olivier Bell; Introduction
by Quentin Bell (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich -
356 pages, $12.95).
In an early diary entry, Virginia Woolf describes
passing a single file of "imbeciles" on her afternoon
constitutional: ". . . one realized that every one in
that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling
idiotic creature, with no forehead, or no chin, and an
imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious stare. It was per
fectly horrible. They should certainly be killed." The
passage is remarkable for the simple cruelty, em
phasized when Woolf immediately turns to the sub
ject of buying pineapples. This cruelty concerning
human frailties, which is sometimes elevated to lack
of sympathy, and the descriptions of everyday com
merce,share her attention in this diary.
Perhaps her flinty tongue, striking epigrammatic
protraits of friends and strangers, expresses its moral
principle when she says, of a friend, "He abused Ott.,
but frankly." These portraits are not thoughtlessly
abusive; the people in her life do not form a line of
imbeciles whom she murders with words. One sus
pects Woolf values frankness not because of the in
timacy it affords, but the distance. The distance is
pronounced when she describes people as animals.
Katherine Mansfield "stinks like a . . . civet cat;" a
servant resembles "a rough coated young carthorse,
with muddy hoofs;" "the upper classes looked like
pet dogs threatened with a cold bath." She reports
being "amused" when her brother confides his fear
of the human faces he sees "like gorillas . . .perfectly
inhuman. . . She wonders if "the horrible sense of
community which the war produces, as if we all sat in
a third class railway carriage together, draws one's
attention to the animal human being more closely."
This passage brings together her vision of the ani
mal human, the presence of war, and Woolf's sen
sitivity to class differences, all of which echo
throughout the diary. The animal in the human both
attracts and repells Woolf. As a metaphor, the quality
is attractive, even affectionate, growing from a family
habit of nicknaming herself "Mandril" or "Goat" and
her husband "Mongoose." But the closeness of the
third-class railway carriage suggests the press of
flesh, the odor of wet wool and bad breath, the
muddy boots and, what is worse, the muddy minds.

Perhaps she guesses that her sharp tongue, that
"long goose wand" that contains the unpredictable,
moody and mad human personality in words, would
provide no control in the midst of the "masses,"
"docile herds," "crowds" which she detests. Her
form of ridicule is a way of containing the "animal"
that threatens to spill over, whether high born or low.
The day peace is announced in 1918, Woolf watches
the drunken, boisterous crowds and notes, "there
was no centre, no form for all this wandering emotion
to take."
Yet, standing off to the side of the crowd and mak
ing mental notes for her diary, she does give it form.
Woolf never loses herself in the midst of any gather
ing; she is always observing, or observing herself
observing. It may be the only way to preserve her self,
that could slip so easily into another person's habit of
mind and observe that person inside and out. Even
her language preserves her social and emotional au
tonomy: she speaks of taking up her "station" in the
kitchen during air raids, the servants one floor below
her in the cellar. In the midst of war, she preserves

these class distinctions.

pronounced when she describes people as animals.
Katherine Mansfield "stinks like a . . . civet cat;" a
servant resembles "a rough coated young carthorse,
with muddy hoofs;" "the upper classes looked like
pet dogs threatened with a cold bath." She reports
being "amused" when her brother confides his fear
of the human faces he sees "like gorillas . . .perfectly
inhuman. . . She wonders if "the horrible sense of
community which the war produces, as if we all sat in
a third class railway carriage together, draws one's
attention to the animal human being more closely."
This passage brings together her vision of the ani
mal human, the presence of war, and Woolf's sen
sitivity to class differences, all of which echo
throughout the diary. The animal in the human both
attracts and repells Woolf. As a metaphor, the quality
is attractive, even affectionate, growing from a family
habit of nicknaming herself "Mandril" or "Goat" and
her husband "Mongoose." But the closeness of the
third-class railway carriage suggests the press of
flesh, the odor of wet wool and bad breath, the
muddy boots and, what is worse, the muddy minds.

Perhaps she guesses that her sharp tongue, that
"long goose wand" that contains the unpredictable,
moody and mad human personality in words, would
provide no control in the midst of the "masses,"
"docile herds," "crowds" which she detests. Her
form of ridicule is a way of containing the "animal"
that threatens to spill over, whether high born or low.
The day peace is announced in 1918, Woolf watches
the drunken, boisterous crowds and notes, "there
was no centre, no form for all this wandering emotion
to take."
Yet, standing off to the side of the crowd and mak
ing mental notes for her diary, she does give it form.
Woolf never loses herself in the midst of any gather
ing; she is always observing, or observing herself
observing. It may be the only way to preserve her self,
that could slip so easily into another person's habit of
mind and observe that person inside and out. Even
her language preserves her social and emotional au
tonomy: she speaks of taking up her "station" in the
kitchen during air raids, the servants one floor below
her in the cellar. In the midst of war, she preserves

these class distinctions.
The diarist notes that one reviewer describes the
characters of her second novel, "Night and Day," as
"four impassioned snails." It is ironic that an author
who compares so many people to animals has her
characters dismissed at the level of crustaceans.
This reference appears at the end of the first vol
ume of the diary. It is not as an author that Virginia
Woolf emerges in these pages, but as a book reviewer
and printer. The "Times Literary Supplement" some
times sends her two and three books a week; she
spends hours setting type and hand-printing copies
of Katherine Mansfield's "Prelude" and T.S. Eliot's
"Poems" under the imprint of the Hogarth Press. It is
only when the review books don't arrive, or requests
for Hogarth publications subside, that she mentions
the novel in progress.
In fact, despite the friends, family and acquain
tances who populate these pages, it is a profile of a
life devoted to work that emerges. Woolf answers her
own question as to what constitutes happiness, with
the word "work." Her intense dislike of the Jonso
nian flesh teaming the streets is more understandable
when compared to the cerebral, almost ascetic, qual
ity of her life: long hours spent reading over a fire,
afternoon walks in the park, quiet evenings with
Leonard. The subject of "happiness" echoes again
and again at the end of this diary. One might think she
overlooks an important source of her happiness, a
quiet and terse presence in this diary, until she men
tions her husband in the last sentence of this volume:
"Yet I daresay we're the happiest couple in England."
This exact sentiment echoes again in the last sen
tence she ever wrote. Woolf's own demon, a peculiar
kind of animal, was madness, and when she felt an
other attack coming on in the spring of 1941 she wrote
Leonard a farewell letter. In it, she mentioned her
happiness with him four times and ended with the
words, "I don't think two people could have been
happier that we have been."
Then, as if the many walks on the downs in this
diary foreshadow it, she walked across the water
meadows to the River Ouse, and drowned herself.

The Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume One 1915-
1919. Edited by Anne Olivier Bell; Introduction
by Quentin Bell (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich -
356 pages, $12.95).
In an early diary entry, Virginia Woolf describes
passing a single file of "imbeciles" on her afternoon
constitutional: ". . . one realized that every one in
that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling
idiotic creature, with no forehead, or no chin, and an
imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious stare. It was per
fectly horrible. They should certainly be killed." The
passage is remarkable for the simple cruelty, em
phasized when Woolf immediately turns to the sub
ject of buying pineapples. This cruelty concerning
human frailties, which is sometimes elevated to lack
of sympathy, and the descriptions of everyday com
merce,share her attention in this diary.
Perhaps her flinty tongue, striking epigrammatic
protraits of friends and strangers, expresses its moral
principle when she says, of a friend, "He abused Ott.,
but frankly." These portraits are not thoughtlessly
abusive; the people in her life do not form a line of
imbeciles whom she murders with words. One sus
pects Woolf values frankness not because of the in
timacy it affords, but the distance. The distance is
pronounced when she describes people as animals.
