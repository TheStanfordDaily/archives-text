# Sorority support planned
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Some 35 women met last
night to organize support for
reinstating sororities here after
the Board of Trustees voted
Tuesday to postpone voting on
the sorority ban until their De
cember meeting.
The group decided their first
step should be writing a list of
objectives for establishing
sororities here, and then pub
licizing these objectives in
dorms and to various on
campus women's groups in an
effort to get more support.
The women agreed that most
students already have "pre
conceived images of sororities
and stressed informing
freshmen "before they get
steadfast notions about what
sororities are like."
According to ASSU Co
president Anne Henkels, the
trustees fear that "the
sororities don't allow local au
tonomy" and that the
sororities will be racially dis
criminatory.
"To me it's like they (the
trustees) are saying women are
going to be discriminatory and
men aren't. It's like they don't
trust us," responded one wo
man.
Henkels said that the trus
tees "did not want recommen
dations for membership to be

sent to the national sororities"
because "it should be up to the
women here who they have in
their sororities."
Henkels added that this
reasoning is "very consistent
with their policies."
Reid Butler, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, said,
"The University has a very im
portant concern of what kinds
of restrictions a house is going
to impose on the University."
Some women claimed that
the rules are "up to the house
and up to the girls. They do
have regulations 'iet up by the
sorority, but they can be ad
justed to follow the needs of
the girls in each individual
house."
However, Butler said he
talked to one sorority alumna
and "she said there were cer
tain restrictions."
Butler said that the Univer
sity and trustees are mostly
"concerned with seeing a
strong show of interest" and
"need to see an organizational
plan of what will happen" if the
ban is rescinded.
Henkels added that postpon
ing the sorority issue was "a
stalling tactic," but that the
trustees "do want to rescind
the ban."
Several women who submit
ted the proposal to the trustees

asking that the ban be lifted
also sent letters to the nine
sororities which previously
existed here asking for their
support and what their specific
regulations for membership
and housing are.
A letter from Delta Delta
Delta sorority members stated
that they "want to see more es
tablished interest and make
sure the ban is lifted before
they bother to get involved,"
said Marian Stephenson, one
of the women who wrote the
letter.
"It's like a circle because the
sororities won't show interest
until the ban has been lifted,
and the trustees won't lift the
ban because the sororities ha
ven't shown interest," com
mented one woman at the
meeting.
