# In Roble Hall
## Student fights off assailant 
### Randy Keith 
Early yesterday morning a Roble Hall resident
fought off a would-be rapist in her dorm room.
The 20-year-old Roble resident was reportedly
attacked around 4 a.m. in her room by an assail
ant who climbed onto the window ledge and
gained access to the room by cutting the screen
on the window, according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said that the woman reported she
was asleep when the attacker entered the room
and she screamed and fought him off.
The assailant is described as a male, about 20
years old, with a slender build. He is of un
known race with a possible olive-colored com
plexion and a soft Afro-type haircut. He was
wearing a long-sleeve navy blue shirt and blue
jeans.
The woman reported that the attacker may
have been armed with a knife, but that she was
not wearing her glasses or contact lenses and so

was unable to tell for sure.
Niemeyer said the assailant fled across dry
Lake Lagunita after the woman fought him off.
Norman Robinson, director of residential
education, said he has instructed resident staff
members to remind students about "reasonable
precautions they can take" to avoid attacks. He
also said that he was going to meet with the
manager of University housing to discuss possi
ble ways to make dorms more secure.
Roble Hall co-coordinator Debbie Cauble said
that security lights in Roble had already been
replaced and that the staff in the dorm was trying
to get students to block their windows to pre
vent anyone from entering them.
The attack at Roble was the first reported at
tempted rape on campus this year, according to
police reports. Police say that there have been
no reported rapes this year.
According to Lillie, there has been a "constant
stream of reports on room thefts" in the dorm.
Police have no suspect in the case.
