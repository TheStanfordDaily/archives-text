# Senators criticize Murphy's acts

### Craig Dennis 
ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy was
criticized by numerous
senators at last night's final
Elections Review Board meet
ing for his actions while inves
tigating ASSU Senate campaign
misconduct.
Senators Dan Livingston,
|anet Rappaport, Alternate-
Senator Kevin Childress and
members of the Stanford Or
ganizing Committee slate said
Murphy had poorly handled
accusations of campaign viola
tions.
Senator David Catanzarite, a
SOC member, accused Mur
phy of "lying to candidates"
while Livingston said Murphy
made 'heading, hypothetical
questions obviously designed
to make people make in
criminating statements."
When Murphy asked
Livingston about his involve
ment in the blue leaflet,
Livingston stated to the ERB last
night, "I told him everything I
knew, and he kept telling me
there was no charge.
"I never intended to not
cooperate or mislead,"
Livingston continued. "But
until I knew what to respond
to, I could not give a written
statement." He said Murphy
was "very cagey about the
whole thing" and was never
specific.
Later in the ERB meeting,
Murphy responded, "I asked
him for a full and complete
statement of his activities in re
gard to the blue flyer in asking
for a written statement." Mur
phy said he became "very an
gry" when he realized that
Livingston's slate campaign
manager, Don Barton, had lied
to him.
ERB member Deric Jennings,
a former Council of Presidents
member, said, "My own sense

is that Sean (Murphy) has a
right to expect ... to ask a
simple question and get an
answer." However, Jennings
said he has a "feeling Sean was
at fault" for some of the facts
not coming out during the
campaign.
Chris Cray, appearing be
fore the ERB for the first time,
admitted responsibility for or
ganizing the yellow leaflet stuf
fing of the Daily. He also re
peated his earlier stand that the
SOC had not participated in its
production or distribution,
even though some members of
the slate were aware of Cray's
actions.
Senator Rick Levy, a SOC
member, said, "Foreknow
ledge would only be an offense
if accompanied by consent,
and there was not consent."
Catanzarite said, "I did ev
erything short of calling in au
thorities in stopping it."
Cray said when a Rob Doc
ters' slate leaflet came out with
"outright lies," he realized the
Daily would not print a rebuttal
that close to the election. Cray
said he told himself then,
"Well, it sounds like the Daily
is ready for another leaflet stuf
fing."
He said he had help from
more than 20 individuals in
what Cray said was the third
time in the last four years he
has participated in a Daily stuf
fing.
"I am seriously considering
stuffing the Daily again," Cray
said, "except for the fact it cost
me $30 and I don't like getting
up early."
ERB member Dave Carlson
said the board will meet
through the night and today in
preparing their decision for
presentation at tonight's se
nate meeting. The ERB has the
power to disqualify any
senator.
