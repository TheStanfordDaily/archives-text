# After report accepted
## No action on divestment 
### 
The Board of Trustees ac
cepted the report on the finan
cial impact of divestiture from
corporations with South Afri
can investment, but the body
took no action to change Uni
versity investment policies at
its meeting this week.

The report, prepared in re
sponse to a demand from the
Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy
last spring, had indicated di
vestiture would have a detri
mental affect on the Univer
sity.
As a result of the report, Vice
President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy recom
mended that the board not di
vest itselt of $125 million in
securities in 59 corporations it
now holds in U.S. firms doing
business in South Africa.
Karen Carter, a student
member of the Committee on
Investments, said the board
viewed the report as simply
another piece of information it
may use in forming investment
policies.
Massy said the board was in
volved in "no discussion what
soever" on the issue of the
University putting forward
proxy resolutions of its own on
the South Africa issue.
No specific action of this sort
is presently planned for next
month either, Massy said.
He said the report of the Ad
Hoc Commission on Invest
ment responsibility should be
completed within about a
week, however, and that re

port would be presented to the
board at its December meet
ing.
Massy said the ad hoc com
mission report will deal with
procedures and guidelines tor
dealing with all aspects ot in
vestment responsibility includ
ing how to deal with proxy re
solutions and how to initiate
proxy action.
He said that the report will
not deal with South Atrica
specifically, but "the new
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility that will doubtless
be formed as a result of the ad
hoc commission's delibera
tions will want to consider
shareholder responsibilities
with respect to apartheid, and
they may in time wish to con
sider the issue of divestment as
well."
Massy called favorable con
sequences of divestment, with
respect to the situation in
South Africa, "conjectural."
He said that is "partly because
it is unlikely that such a sum
mary action by Stanford . . .
would materially affect corpo
rate behavior, and partly be
cause the direction of the ef
fects of corporate withdrawal
on improving the lot of blacks
in South Africa is not at all
clear."

cial impact of divestiture from
corporations with South Afri
can investment, but the body
took no action to change Uni
versity investment policies at
its meeting this week.

The report, prepared in re
sponse to a demand from the
Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy
last spring, had indicated di
vestiture would have a detri
mental affect on the Univer
sity.
As a result of the report, Vice
President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy recom
mended that the board not di
vest itselt of $125 million in
securities in 59 corporations it
now holds in U.S. firms doing
business in South Africa.
Karen Carter, a student
member of the Committee on
Investments, said the board
viewed the report as simply
another piece of information it
may use in forming investment
policies.
Massy said the board was in
volved in "no discussion what
soever" on the issue of the
University putting forward
proxy resolutions of its own on
the South Africa issue.
No specific action of this sort
is presently planned for next
month either, Massy said.
He said the report of the Ad
Hoc Commission on Invest
ment responsibility should be
completed within about a
week, however, and that re

port would be presented to the
board at its December meet
ing.
Massy said the ad hoc com
mission report will deal with
procedures and guidelines tor
dealing with all aspects ot in
vestment responsibility includ
ing how to deal with proxy re
solutions and how to initiate
proxy action.
He said that the report will
not deal with South Atrica
specifically, but "the new
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility that will doubtless
be formed as a result of the ad
hoc commission's delibera
tions will want to consider
shareholder responsibilities
with respect to apartheid, and
they may in time wish to con
sider the issue of divestment as
well."
Massy called favorable con
sequences of divestment, with
respect to the situation in
South Africa, "conjectural."
He said that is "partly because
it is unlikely that such a sum
mary action by Stanford . . .
would materially affect corpo
rate behavior, and partly be
cause the direction of the ef
fects of corporate withdrawal
on improving the lot of blacks
in South Africa is not at all
clear."
