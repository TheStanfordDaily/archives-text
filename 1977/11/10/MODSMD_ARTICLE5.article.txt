# Parapsychology at Stanford — the case of the enigmatic fellowship
## 
### 
Since the dawn of recorded
history, man has been in
trigued by the possible exis
tence of psychic phenomena.
According to Plato, divination
could occur during dreaming,
while Aristotle argued that a
casual link was involved in
prophetic dreams. The latter
also suggested that nocturnal
images could serve as initial

stimuli for waking thoughts
which could then lead to sub
sequent behavior similar to the
dream episode. Modern thin
kers have continued to debate
this and other such issues. But
the study of parapsychology
has only slowly begun to
emerge into the curriculum of
traditional psychology.
Within the laboratory and
classroom there is both a cog
nitive and kinetic aspect of

psychic phenomena, or "psi,"
which needs to be studied. The
cognitive aspect can be de
fined as obtaining knowledge
or awareness of something
without the use of the known
senses or resorting to rational,
empirical processes. A widely
used term for the cognitive as
pects of psi is ESP or extra sen
sory perception which in
cludes the processes of tele
pathy, clairvoyance and pre-

cognition. The kinetir psi is cal
led psychokinesis and refers to
a process whereby an indi
vidual can alter or influence
physical events, such as the
movement of objects without

the physical intervention of
any being.
Research on both aspects of
psychic phenomena has been
conducted at the University
since 1912. This research was
made possible by two bequests
on the part of Leland Stanford's
younger brother, Thomas Wel
ton. In 1912, he donated
$50,000 to support a "Thomas
Welton Stanford Psychical Re
search Fellowship." And upon
his death in 1918, it was disco
vered that he left the further
sum of $526,000 to be used for
the development of "psychical
or psychological science." The
ambiguous language of the
will, however, has since
created controversy as to
whether the income from the
two gifts has been misused;
critics charge that the funds
have been diverted into con
ventional psychological re
search, contrary to the spirit in
which the bequests were
made; defenders of the de
partment's policy say that their
use of the money is completely
justified by Stanford's will.
Thomas Welton Stanford was
born on March 11,1832 to a
family of eight children. He set
out at an early age with Leland
to make his fortune in the gold
rush. In 1860, with his savings
of $60,000, Thomas emigrated
to Australia. Stanford appa
rently suffered so greatly at sea
that he never again ventured
across the ocean to his native
country. With his savings he
set up an import business of
items available only in the U.S.
Among these was the Singer
sewing machine with which he
was able to establish a virtual
monopoly over the com
petitors in the area. On one
occasion he discouraged a po
tential competitor by dropping
his would-be rival's sewing
machine out of the window.
It is difficult to determine
when Stanford's interest in
psychic phenomena first
started. Some evidence exists
that he was already interested
in spirit communication in his
early twenties while still in
California. But it appears that
his curiousity was not fully
aroused until 1871-1872 or
shortly after the death of his
wife.
Having attained a prominent
position in the business world,
he devoted himself in large
part to scientific endeavors. En
joying the role of the "gentle
man scientist," he studied as
tronomy, microbiology and
psychical science. The man
sion which he had constructed
for himself contained a private
observatory, a 100-foot high av
iary covering two acres of his
property and a library housing
an extensive collection of sci
entific works. It was in this
milieu that Stanford, with the
help of his personal medium
Charles Bailey, began his
psychic research. The majority
of this "research" took the
form of group seances, the par
ticipants in which were

selected from a list of Mel
bourne's elite. Stanford hoped
to include as many prominent
members of the business
community in the sessions as
he could in order to convince
them of the veracity of his con
clusions.

The seances produced many
apports — objects such as
stones; marbles, and feathers
which are delivered from a
spirit through the air with the
help of a medium. Charles
Bailey specialized in apporting
and brought to the table (or
later inside a cage in which he
had been placed) hundreds of
apports from foreign lands.
(These apports remained on
display at the Stanford
Museum which he helped built

until 1937. Due to the embar
rassment which they caused
the members of the museum
staff, they have now been
moved down to the museum
basement.) Bailey also claimed
to communicate with spirits.
On several occasions he man
aged to bring learned treatises
from deceased scholars to the
seances.
Although no formal investi-

gation has ever been con
ducted, it seems likely, given
Bailey's background as a
working-class ne'er-do-well,
that he was little more than an
opportunistic con-man who
saw in Thomas Stanford's in
terests a chance for a easy,
risk-free life.

Stanford brought to his
psychical research a system
of personal belief holding that
life on Earth is merely one stage
in a long progression which
exists independent of life and
death. His letters to the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees and
President David Starr Jordan
betray a desire to have this be
lief accepted and corrobo
rated.
The investment income from
the $50,000 gift has been used
by fellows who have ap
proached the study of psychic
phenomena from very diffe
rent angles. The first fellow,
John Edgar Coover, held the
post from 1912 until 1937. (As a
result of inflation, however,
the income is now sufficient to
bring in a fellow for one year
only, every several years.) In
1913 T.W. Stanford invited
Coover to Melbourne to test
Bailey. The invitation made
President Jordan extremely
nervous because he suspected
that a rigorous investigation
might prove Bailey a fraud.
Bailey, upon learning of
Coover's planned visit, fortuit
ously left for Europe, never to
return to his erstwhile
employer. In 1917, Coover
published a sizable volume en
titled "Experiments in Psychi
cal Research at Stanford." The
negative findings contained in
this work — that there is no
"telepathy as a common capac
ity," nor "telepathy as a capac
ity of single individuals" —
generated a great deal of con
troversy and would later create
an additional element of com
plexity in the debate over the
proper use of Thomas Stan
ford's gifts.
The research fellows who
followed Coover conducted
experiments in the areas of
subliminal perception, hal
lucination, and automative
writing. One researcher even
studied the homing behavior
of animals and the apparent
sensitivity of birds to magnetic
fields. For the most part, their
findings have been as negative
or inconclusive as those of
Coover.
Criticism of the University's
use of the Stanford gifts
remained diffuse until the 1975
publication of an article by
parapsychologist Frederick
Dommeyer in "The Journal of
Parapsychology." Entitled
"Psychical Research at Stan
ford University," Dommeyer's
piece is a scholarly examina
tion of Thomas Stanford, the
circumstances under which he
made the bequests and the
subsequent circumstances
which have led to the con
troversy. The major conclusion
which emerges from Dom
meyer's work is that the funds
from the start have been ad
ministered in a manner hostile
to a spirit of open inquiry in the
field of parapsychology.
To start with, Dommeyer
says, President Jordan may
have "tricked" Stanford into
wording his will in such a way

that after his death the income
from the larger gift could be
used for conventional
psychological research.
Stanford apparently wrote
more than one version of his
will and did not write the final
one until after lengthy consul
tation with )ordan. The final
wording can be interpreted as
an unconditional mandate for

the University to use the funds
in almost any way it sees fit:
. . . the net income thereof
shall be applied in such manner
and under such conditions
consistent with the trusts of the
said University as shall seem to
them in their . . . absolute and
unfettered discretion best, exc
lusively and wholly for the ad
vancement of education, learn
ing and general knowledge in
connection with psychical or
psychological science study

and on research. . . .
The question of whether the
uses to which the money has
been put run counter to Stan
ford's intentions depends on
the definition of the word
"psychology." Dommeyer
points out that at the turn of
the century, the field of
psychology was in its infancy
and hence left room for a great
deal of latitude in individual in
terpretation of what was in-

eluded in the field's cur
riculum. It is therefore very
possible that Stanford under
stood the word in an entirely
different manner from Jordan.
