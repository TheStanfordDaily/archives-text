# The

Coover left his post in 1937, the
purpose of the fellowship en
dowed by the $50,000 grant was
redefined at the instigation of
President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Dommeyer feels that the re
sults of the research con
ducted by the parapsychologi
cal fellows after 1937 has been
in such disharmony with the
expectations of those friendly
to spiritualism, psychical re
search and parapsychology,
and also so inconsistent with
the positive experimental re
sults obtained at the Duke Uni-

versity Parapsychology
Laboratory and elsewhere in
this country and abroad that
they constitute an enigma in
the field. These errant results,
Dommeyer feels, are related to
the broadening of the fellow
ship's purpose. The revised
language states that
The expression "psychical re-

search field" is used in the
broad sense to include
mediumistic phenomena, tele
pathy, clairvoyance, hallucina
tion, hypnosis, dreams dissoca
tion of personality, subcon
scious mechanisms, motor au
tomatism subliminal perception
and other phenomena that they
may be assured to have a direct
bearing on psychology of the

occult. There are also possible
types of research with electrical
potentials of the central nerv
ous system which might be re
garded as coming within the
scope here defined.
Psychology Professor Roger
Shephard, the current
chairman of the Committee on
the Stanford Pyschic Research

Fellowship, is very sensitive
about any hint of a "scandal"
regarding the funds. Far from
being misused, he says, the
gifts are being employed with
absolute propriety.
"It is anyone's guess what a
man of Thomas Welton Stan
ford's broad scientific interests
would consider to be the most
productive direction for

psychical research today.
Clearly most modern parap
sychologists are no longer
much interested in spirit rap
pings, levitations and
materializations. Even the
phenomena of that kind largely
'dematerialized' following the
advent of infrared photo
graphy. Interest has since

shifted more to controlled
laboratory investigations of ex
trasensory perception, dis
sociated states, and the like."

With 50 years of advance in
scientific methodology, he
says, "we feel that progress is
most likely to be achieved by

bringing the most powerful av
ailable methods to bear on the
fundamental processes and as
sumptions underlying any

psychological phenomena that
appear to be paranormal." Ac
cording to Shephard, "the
wisdom of this approach is

being well demonstrated" by
the current holder of the
Psychic Research Fellowship,
Dr. Lila Gatlin, who is applying
advanced methods of informa
tion theory and computer
simulation to the analysis of
data from ESP experiments.
In her work, Professor Gatlin
is attempting to test the im
plications of ESP systemati
cally, by applying mathemati
cal analyses to raw sequences
of data obtained from resear
chers at other institutions. In

so doing, she hopes to chal
lenge the traditional definition
of ESP â€” the transmission of
information without an
"energy carrier." The concept
of an energy carrier is best un
derstood in the context of two
people talking on the tele
phone. The information con
tained in one person's words is
converted to electrical energy
and is carried by that energy
along a wire to the other per
son. Thus the traditional
theory of ESP postulates the
transmission of information
without any form of "electric
ity" or other energy to carry it.
This theory, she feels, undere
stimates the capabilities of the

mind. It is not a question of
information creation in the
mind ot a person experiencing
ESP, but of the process by
which that information arrived
there.
Despite the lack of break
throughs in the field of parap
sychology, one can neverthe
less conclude, as Professor

Gatlin does in her article enti
tled "Meaningful Information
Creation: An Alternative In
terpretation of Psychic
Phenomenon" in The Journal
of The American Society of
Psychical Research, that in the
real world, where the repro
duction of life can be consi
dered a form of information
transmission, "it is inevitable
