# SRI: the story goes on
## 
### 
Editor, the Thursday Daily:
Trying to make a Jekyll and Hyde story out of SRI and its
history, as Cynthia Lehigh did in your November 3 issue,
leaves out a good deal of reality. There is considerably more
to tell about Stanford-SRI relations and the separation of 1970
than can be told in terms of good guys and bad guys — or that
can be found in the Daily's old files, or revealed by aging
campus radicals of the '60s.
Problems with SRI and the question of separation were in
the wind long before the decade of the '60s began. They were
considered by two separate committees appointed by Presi
dent Wallace Sterling before that decade was half over. The
committee he appointed in 1964 included people from both
SRI and the University and at the conclusion of its study the
University's members adopted a draft statement that re
commended separation. The recommendation was shelved
in favor of a new policy statement that attempted to clarify as
well as improve relations between the two institutions.
It was four years later when, as Lehigh puts it, "On January
14, about 50 students entered (smashed their way into,
would be more accurate) a closed trustees meeting on the
campus and presented a list of demands, including a demand
for a student-trustee forum." She might also have added that
the list also included an SDS demand that "all relations with
Stanford Research Institute be severed immediately."
Somehow that demand got switched around later to a
demand that SRI be brought under tighter control by the
University.
