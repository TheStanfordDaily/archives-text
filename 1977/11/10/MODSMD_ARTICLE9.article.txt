Back in October 1968, Acting President Robert Glaser met
with the ASSU Senate on the issue of Stanford-SRI relations
and the Institute's research for the Department of Defense.
He then appointed a joint student faculty committee to
"explore and make recommendations regarding the rela
tionship between the University and the Institute." The
committee completed its study and made its report in April
1969, with the majority favoring separation, but without a
consensus on the terms to be employed.
Lehigh reports the student-trustee "forum" that took
place in Memorial Auditorium on March 11, 1969, as though
it actually was conducted as a forum. It was, in fact, a boorish
Roman circus arranged by the SDS *o embarrass and dis
credit the five trustees who walked on stage believing they
would meet a rational audience under rational conditions.
It was after that disastrous experience that, as Lehigh
writes, "The trustees refused to agree to an open meeting on
the SRI study committee's recommendations." That would
have been an understandable refusal in almost any other
imaginable climate than the climate that prevailed on this
campus in March 1969, because the study committee had not
yet made any recommendations.
Lehigh may innocently believe, along with God knows
how many of her readers in the current student generation,
that the trustees refused to discuss the SRI issue with stu
dents. The fact is that the trustees held open hearings on the
campus shortly after the committee's report was made. But
they were conducted under conditions that insured that all
views could be expressed and heard.
