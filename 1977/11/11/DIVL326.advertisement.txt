Mel Practiss
Pre-med Student
Can't miss him on campus, always wears white.
Constantly being sought after by freshmen and transfer students who mistake him for ice-cream man.
Mel drinks Lite Beer from Miller because it's less filling. Can't afford to get filled up.
At last count he was in charge of 114 mice, 137 frogs and 240, uh...480 rabbits.
Spends spare time in library analyzing stitching on medical books.
Lite Beer from Miller.
Everything you always wanted in a beer. And less.
