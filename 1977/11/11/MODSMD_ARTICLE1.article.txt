### Sara Lessley 
Two ASSU Senators were disqual
ified, one senator was suspended tor
this quarter and 16 others were cen
sured or reprimanded in final deci
sions ot the Elections Review Board
(ERB) during last night's senate meet
ing.
The ERB's findings,concerning 19
of the 40 senators and alternates,
ranged from lying to obstruction of
the election investigation, and are fi
nal.
Following the ERB report, the se
nate adopted a resolution by voice
count to the effect that it "supported
the ERB assertion that their findings
had no implication on the integrity or
character of the persons disqual
ified, censured, reprimanded or
suspended."
The senate accepted the Nomina
tion Committee list of students
nominated for university commit

tees, and also voted to confirm the
principles of the Honor Code. Both
proposals were presented by ASSU
Co-president Steve Westly.
The two disqualified senators are
Janet Rappaport and Dan Livingston.
Two alternates, Lynn Rubinett and
David Catanzarite, will replace the
two as full senators.
Rappaport was charged with a fai
lure to report full campaign costs
with extenuating circumstances and
found to have exceeded the cam
paign spending limit due to negli
gence. No action was taken on the
first charge, but she was disqualified
by an ERB vote ot 4-1 on the second
finding.
Rappaport commented after the
meeting that "I supported the ERB
from the beginning and will not
change my stand on that. The ERB did
not cast a judgment on the integrity
of the individuals involved ... to
those who voted for me . . . my plat
form was always honest and I did not
misrepresent myselt to the voters, or
anyone at all."
Also disqualified was Dan
Livingston. He was found to have
failed to cooperate fully and openly
with Elections Commissioner Sean
Murphy and to have failed to report
full campaign costs. He was disqual
ified from the senate by a 4-1 vote.
Livingston said he "had no oppor
tunity to respond to the charges of
failure to cooperate fully with the
elections commissioner. It came as a

complete surprise that I was disqual
ified for a charge I didn't know was
being leveled at me."
Livingston added: "Who could
have seen that a senate seat won four
weeks ago could be taken away by a
subjective ex post facto judgment of
an extra constitutional commission?
The rules were created to fit the cir
cumstances."
Alternate Sen. Kevin Childress was
suspended from the senate for this
quarter for his failure to report full
campaign costs, and for lying to the
elections commissioner.
Chairperson Fred Crethel said the
23rd candidate will replace him for
the duration of the fall quarter. Can
didates Will Nixon and Chuck
Pacheco are tied for that position. In
the winter and spring quarters Chil
dress will have full privileges re
turned.
Candidate )ohn Hart, who ran with
Livingston and Childress, was only
reprimanded due to lack of evidence
on the charge of failure to report full
campaign costs.
Senators Mary Bateson and
Richard Levy and Alternate Sen. Mike
Veiluva of the Stanford Organizing
Committee (SOC) were censured for
impeding the elections commission
investigation, neglecting to maintain
close communication with their slate
and failure to take sufficient action in
the face of a potential offense (the
distribution of the yellow leaflets).
Also reprimanded were members
of the undergraduate and graduate
SOC slates: Marvin Anderson,
Meriel Burtle, David Catanzarite,
Fred Grethel, Carlylo Kinnison, Ken
neth Nunn, Lynn Rubinett, Donald
Moonshine, Francisco Santana,
Nicholas Valenzuela, Victor Mar
tinez and Steven Mentor.
They were tound to have impeded
the elections commission investiga
tion and to have neglected to main
tain close communication with each
other as a slate.
Catanzarite was commended by
the ERB tor his "effort to dissuade the
individual from distributing" the

ERB member Deric Jennings said
the ERB defined a reprimand as
meaning "even in view of all ex
tenuating circumstances, they could
have done more," while to censure
means "they should have done
more.
Jennings added that "in absence of
specific guidelines — what ought to
be expected of candidates' behavior
— one of the standards brought to
bear was what kinds of behavior are
necessary for the system to work.
There are certain kinds ol behavior
that you have to be able to presup
pose, ethical behavior in that sense
in order for an election process to
function in the way it should."
There was no action taken in the
case of candidate Dave Newmark
who had been charged with failure to
report full campaign costs.
Jennings added the "ERB made de
cisions on what constituted offenses
and then decided on what the penal
ties would be, quite separately."
ERB member Mark Sexton said the
ERB met from 7 p.m. Wednesday

night to 11 a.m. yesterday morning.
"The decisions made were not easy,"
he added.
"In many casesthe ERB toundwhat
could constitute an offense, but
didn't seem to be punishable," said
ERB member David Carlson. 1 hus no

(ERB) during last night's senate meet
ing.
The ERB's findings,concerning 19
of the 40 senators and alternates,
ranged from lying to obstruction of
the election investigation, and are fi
nal.
Following the ERB report, the se

first charge, but she was disqualified
by an ERB vote ot 4-1 on the second
finding.
Rappaport commented after the
meeting that "I supported the ERB
from the beginning and will not
change my stand on that. The ERB did
not cast a judgment on the integrity
of the individuals involved ... to
those who voted for me . . . my plat
form was always honest and I did not
misrepresent myselt to the voters, or
anyone at all."
Also disqualified was Dan
Livingston. He was found to have
failed to cooperate fully and openly
with Elections Commissioner Sean
Murphy and to have failed to report
full campaign costs. He was disqual

Livingston said he "had no oppor
tunity to respond to the charges of
failure to cooperate fully with the
elections commissioner. It came as a

complete surprise that I was disqual
ified for a charge I didn't know was
being leveled at me."
Livingston added: "Who could
have seen that a senate seat won four
weeks ago could be taken away by a
subjective ex post facto judgment of
an extra constitutional commission?
The rules were created to fit the cir
cumstances."
Alternate Sen. Kevin Childress was
suspended from the senate for this

ified from the senate by a 4-1 vote.
Livingston said he "had no oppor
tunity to respond to the charges of
failure to cooperate fully with the

complete surprise that I was disqual
ified for a charge I didn't know was
being leveled at me."
Livingston added: "Who could
have seen that a senate seat won four
weeks ago could be taken away by a
subjective ex post facto judgment of
an extra constitutional commission?
The rules were created to fit the cir
cumstances."
Alternate Sen. Kevin Childress was
suspended from the senate for this

ERB member Deric Jennings said
the ERB defined a reprimand as
meaning "even in view of all ex
tenuating circumstances, they could
have done more," while to censure
means "they should have done
more.
Jennings added that "in absence of
specific guidelines — what ought to
be expected of candidates' behavior
— one of the standards brought to
bear was what kinds of behavior are
necessary for the system to work.
There are certain kinds ol behavior
that you have to be able to presup
pose, ethical behavior in that sense
in order for an election process to
function in the way it should."
There was no action taken in the
case of candidate Dave Newmark

Two ASSU Senators were disqual
ified, one senator was suspended tor
this quarter and 16 others were cen
sured or reprimanded in final deci
sions ot the Elections Review Board
(ERB) during last night's senate meet
ing.
The ERB's findings,concerning 19
of the 40 senators and alternates,
ranged from lying to obstruction of
the election investigation, and are fi
nal.
Following the ERB report, the se

the ERB assertion that their findings
had no implication on the integrity or

suspended."

finding.
Rappaport commented after the
meeting that "I supported the ERB
from the beginning and will not
change my stand on that. The ERB did
not cast a judgment on the integrity
of the individuals involved ... to
those who voted for me . . . my plat
form was always honest and I did not
misrepresent myselt to the voters, or
anyone at all."
