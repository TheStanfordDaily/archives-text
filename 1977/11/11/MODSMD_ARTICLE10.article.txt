The problem of implementing the
policy of having members of group X
evaluate other members of group X
for potential employment arises only
in the case when the employer is a
member of group non-X. But, in pre
cisely this case, in order to imple
ment the policy, members of group X
would have to be chosen (whether
hired or not makes no difference to
the argument) by members of group
non-X to do the hiring of members of
group X. This, however, involves
either an infinite redress or that
members of group non-X choose
members of group X according to
some criteria of evaluation, which do
not include the criterion of member
ship in group X.
If the original argument is valid,
that members of group non-X can
not evaluate members of group X,
then members of group X cannot
evaluate members of group non-X,
and thus the policy cannot be im
plemented. On the other hand, ifthe

policy can be implemented by mem
bers of group non-X choosing mem
bers of group X to implement it, then
the original argument on which the
policy is based is not valid, that is, it
must be possible for members of
group non-X to evaluate members of
group X.
The argument, theretore, that only
members of group X can evaluate
other members of group X, because
only they can understand the think
ing of members of group X, is self
refuting. If the validity of arguments
depends on their being believed to
be valid, then my not believing the
argument to be valid is a refutation of
it. If its validity is such that everyone
can and ought to recognize it, then
everyone has the ability to evaluate
some of the thinking of others,
namely, the argument itself.
Barriers

The barriers to evaluating the
thinking of others are not that one is
unable to understand and evaluate

the thinking of those different from
oneself, for example, of those in ra
cial, ethnic, or sexual subgroups
other than one's own; the barriers
are lack of knowledge or inadequate
reasoning ability.
b) The bias of present criteria of
evaluation of merit: The argument is
that present criteria for evaluating
merit are based in favor of members
of racial, ethnic, or sexual group
non-X. Therefore, in order to correct
this bias, members of group X should
be hired because they are members
of group X.
It is possible that present criteria
tor evaluating the abilities ot indi
viduals for particular jobs are un
sound and racially, ethnically, or
sexually biased. This must, however,
be established, not merely presup
posed. The percentage argument
will not establish this, as previously
argued. And it cannot be argued that
the criteria must be biased in favor ol
members of group non-X because

members of group non-X set them.
In order to establish that the
criteria are biased, then, one would
have to demonstrate that according
to the criteria the best-qualitied
people are sometimes passed over in
favor of less qualified people in
employment. Such a demonstration,
however, would require criteria for
evaluating the merits of individuals
in order to establish that certain indi
viduals are better qualified than
others.
This attempt to demonstrate that
present criteria are biased would
then actually establish what the
sounder, unbiased criteria are. Far
from supporting the argument that
members of racial, ethnic, or sexual
group X should be hired because of
their membership in group X, be
cause the present criteria for evaluat
ing merit are biased against group X,
the demonstration of such bias
would establish that it is possible to
evaluate individuals properly on the
basis of merit, by establishing how it
is possible.
One might still try to defend the
biased-criteria argument by arguing
that all criteria must be biased, that
hiring on the basis of merit alone is
intrinsically impossible. But one
could not demonstrate this without
demonstrating the actual bias of
criteria, and this can only be done by
using the yardstick of the merit criter
ion.
Conclusion
The aiguments here examined for
employing people because of their
membership in some racial, ethnic,
or sexual group — the compensation
argument, the percentage-quota ar
gument, and the biased-judgment
argument — all deny the very princi
ple they assume. They assume that
people should be employed because
of their individual qualifications, but
they deny that the criterion of indi
vidual merit should be used in
employment.
But the initial principle is, I be
lieve, the only soqnd one. A person
should be employed for a particular
job because he is the best-qualified
applicant. The only criterion for this
is the ability to do the job.
The best-qualitied person for a job
is the person who can do it best. The
best person for a job as a mathemati
cian is the best mathematician; the
best person for a job as a carpenter is
the best carpenter; and the best per
son for a job as a pianist is the only
one who plays the piano best.

cisely this case, in order to imple
ment the policy, members of group X
would have to be chosen (whether
hired or not makes no difference to
the argument) by members of group
non-X to do the hiring of members of
group X. This, however, involves
either an infinite redress or that
members of group non-X choose
members of group X according to
some criteria of evaluation, which do
not include the criterion of member
ship in group X.
If the original argument is valid,
that members of group non-X can
not evaluate members of group X,
then members of group X cannot
evaluate members of group non-X,
and thus the policy cannot be im
plemented. On the other hand, ifthe

policy can be implemented by mem
bers of group non-X choosing mem
bers of group X to implement it, then
the original argument on which the
policy is based is not valid, that is, it
must be possible for members of
group non-X to evaluate members of
group X.
The argument, theretore, that only
members of group X can evaluate
other members of group X, because
only they can understand the think
ing of members of group X, is self
refuting. If the validity of arguments
depends on their being believed to
be valid, then my not believing the
argument to be valid is a refutation of
it. If its validity is such that everyone
can and ought to recognize it, then
everyone has the ability to evaluate
some of the thinking of others,
namely, the argument itself.
Barriers

The barriers to evaluating the
thinking of others are not that one is
unable to understand and evaluate

the thinking of those different from
oneself, for example, of those in ra
cial, ethnic, or sexual subgroups
other than one's own; the barriers
are lack of knowledge or inadequate
reasoning ability.
b) The bias of present criteria of
evaluation of merit: The argument is
that present criteria for evaluating
merit are based in favor of members
of racial, ethnic, or sexual group
non-X. Therefore, in order to correct
this bias, members of group X should
be hired because they are members
of group X.
It is possible that present criteria
tor evaluating the abilities ot indi
viduals for particular jobs are un
sound and racially, ethnically, or
sexually biased. This must, however,
be established, not merely presup
posed. The percentage argument
will not establish this, as previously
argued. And it cannot be argued that
the criteria must be biased in favor ol
members of group non-X because

members of group non-X set them.
In order to establish that the
criteria are biased, then, one would
have to demonstrate that according
to the criteria the best-qualitied
people are sometimes passed over in
favor of less qualified people in
employment. Such a demonstration,
however, would require criteria for
evaluating the merits of individuals
in order to establish that certain indi
viduals are better qualified than
others.
This attempt to demonstrate that
present criteria are biased would
then actually establish what the
sounder, unbiased criteria are. Far
from supporting the argument that
members of racial, ethnic, or sexual
group X should be hired because of
their membership in group X, be
cause the present criteria for evaluat
ing merit are biased against group X,
the demonstration of such bias
would establish that it is possible to
evaluate individuals properly on the
basis of merit, by establishing how it
is possible.
One might still try to defend the
biased-criteria argument by arguing
that all criteria must be biased, that
hiring on the basis of merit alone is
intrinsically impossible. But one
could not demonstrate this without
demonstrating the actual bias of
criteria, and this can only be done by
using the yardstick of the merit criter
ion.
Conclusion
The aiguments here examined for
employing people because of their
membership in some racial, ethnic,
or sexual group — the compensation
argument, the percentage-quota ar
gument, and the biased-judgment
argument — all deny the very princi
ple they assume. They assume that
people should be employed because
of their individual qualifications, but
they deny that the criterion of indi
vidual merit should be used in
employment.
But the initial principle is, I be
lieve, the only soqnd one. A person
should be employed for a particular
job because he is the best-qualified
applicant. The only criterion for this
is the ability to do the job.
The best-qualitied person for a job
is the person who can do it best. The
best person for a job as a mathemati
cian is the best mathematician; the
best person for a job as a carpenter is
the best carpenter; and the best per
son for a job as a pianist is the only
one who plays the piano best.

group X. This, however, involves
either an infinite redress or that
members of group non-X choose
members of group X according to
some criteria of evaluation, which do
not include the criterion of member
ship in group X.
If the original argument is valid,
that members of group non-X can
not evaluate members of group X,
then members of group X cannot
evaluate members of group non-X,
and thus the policy cannot be im
plemented. On the other hand, ifthe

policy can be implemented by mem
bers of group non-X choosing mem
bers of group X to implement it, then
the original argument on which the
policy is based is not valid, that is, it
must be possible for members of
group non-X to evaluate members of
group X.
The argument, theretore, that only
members of group X can evaluate
other members of group X, because
only they can understand the think
ing of members of group X, is self
refuting. If the validity of arguments
depends on their being believed to
be valid, then my not believing the
argument to be valid is a refutation of
it. If its validity is such that everyone
can and ought to recognize it, then
everyone has the ability to evaluate
some of the thinking of others,
namely, the argument itself.
Barriers

The barriers to evaluating the
thinking of others are not that one is
unable to understand and evaluate

the thinking of those different from
oneself, for example, of those in ra
cial, ethnic, or sexual subgroups
other than one's own; the barriers
are lack of knowledge or inadequate
reasoning ability.
b) The bias of present criteria of
evaluation of merit: The argument is
that present criteria for evaluating
merit are based in favor of members
of racial, ethnic, or sexual group
non-X. Therefore, in order to correct
this bias, members of group X should
be hired because they are members
of group X.
It is possible that present criteria
tor evaluating the abilities ot indi
viduals for particular jobs are un
sound and racially, ethnically, or
sexually biased. This must, however,
be established, not merely presup
posed. The percentage argument
will not establish this, as previously
argued. And it cannot be argued that
the criteria must be biased in favor ol
members of group non-X because

members of group non-X set them.
In order to establish that the
criteria are biased, then, one would
have to demonstrate that according
to the criteria the best-qualitied
people are sometimes passed over in
favor of less qualified people in
employment. Such a demonstration,
however, would require criteria for
evaluating the merits of individuals
in order to establish that certain indi
viduals are better qualified than
others.
This attempt to demonstrate that
present criteria are biased would
then actually establish what the
sounder, unbiased criteria are. Far
from supporting the argument that
members of racial, ethnic, or sexual
group X should be hired because of
their membership in group X, be
cause the present criteria for evaluat
ing merit are biased against group X,
the demonstration of such bias
would establish that it is possible to
evaluate individuals properly on the
basis of merit, by establishing how it
is possible.
One might still try to defend the
biased-criteria argument by arguing
that all criteria must be biased, that
hiring on the basis of merit alone is
intrinsically impossible. But one
could not demonstrate this without
demonstrating the actual bias of
criteria, and this can only be done by
using the yardstick of the merit criter
ion.
Conclusion
The aiguments here examined for
employing people because of their
membership in some racial, ethnic,
or sexual group — the compensation
argument, the percentage-quota ar
gument, and the biased-judgment
argument — all deny the very princi
ple they assume. They assume that
people should be employed because
of their individual qualifications, but
they deny that the criterion of indi
vidual merit should be used in
employment.
But the initial principle is, I be
lieve, the only soqnd one. A person
should be employed for a particular
job because he is the best-qualified
applicant. The only criterion for this
is the ability to do the job.
The best-qualitied person for a job
is the person who can do it best. The
best person for a job as a mathemati
cian is the best mathematician; the
best person for a job as a carpenter is
the best carpenter; and the best per
son for a job as a pianist is the only
one who plays the piano best.

(Third of three parts)
The problem of implementing the
policy of having members of group X
evaluate other members of group X
for potential employment arises only
in the case when the employer is a
member of group non-X. But, in pre
cisely this case, in order to imple
ment the policy, members of group X
would have to be chosen (whether
hired or not makes no difference to
the argument) by members of group
non-X to do the hiring of members of
group X. This, however, involves
either an infinite redress or that
members of group non-X choose
members of group X according to
some criteria of evaluation, which do
not include the criterion of member
ship in group X.
If the original argument is valid,
that members of group non-X can
not evaluate members of group X,
then members of group X cannot
evaluate members of group non-X,
