# The

## A

Rae Doll, et al.

Included in the latest issue of The
Real News (Oct. 21) was an editorial
entitled "Homosexuality: Death
Trap." We are writing in response
because we feel the editorial to be a
product of misinformation and
propaganda and we urge everyone to
recognize and understand the fal
lacies in the author's argument.
The editorial contends that
homosexuality is "a philosophy that
will cut off any future generations if
fully accepted" and that a gay person
rejects "the natural type of bonding

that brought him (sic) into the
world." Unfortunately, the author
does not understand that the gay
perspective is not one which sup
ports homosexuality to the exclusion
of all other forms of sexuality.
Instead, it is based on the belie)
that men and women should be able
"to express themselves, emotionally
and physically, with whomever they
wish without having to deal with an
overextended society which dictates
what their feelings should be and to
whom they should be expressed. In
deed, if arguments concerning what
is "natural" are to be made, the au
thor should know that for some time
now, men and women have been
recognized as being basically bisex
ual by nature.
The author asks, "Don't you know
that love relationships are diffe
rent?" We respond "Yes, they cer
tainly are, but who has determined
that difference for you: you or soci
ety?" And the answer is painful.
Implication
Probably the most unfortunate as
pect of the editorial, however, is the
implication that the true intention of
all gay people is to have everyone
else "convert." The cartoon accom
panying the editorial is evidence
enough that the author has bought
the myth that many ignorant people,
including Senator Briggs of Califor
nia ("they'll get our children in the
schools!") and Anita Bryant ("they'll
get our children everywhere!") are
trying to sell.
It is highly disturbing to us that no
deeper analysis of the current "they
will take over" scare is being made by
this representative from the black
community, particularly given the
history of black oppression and the
myths which accompany it, many of
which persist even today.
Destructive myth
Let us explode this destructive
myth and reveal the truth which it
obscures: gay activists are not work
ing to "recruit" either children or
adults. They are working to attain
freedom from our oppression; an
end to the legal and social persecu
tion which we must face every day.
As teachers, we want only to be
able to teach without having to un
dergo monitoring and/or manipula
tion of our personal lifestyles.
As professionals, as members ot

the working class, as child-raisers:
we, in fact demand to be able to do
the things which we have been skil
led for or wish to do occupationally
without having to defend or lie about
our sexuality.
Gay activism did not spring into
being with the purpose of making
the whole world gay; it was born in
response to acts of persecution and
oppression of gays by the straight
and self-righteous society all around
us. Acts like the writing and publica
tion of the editorial in The Real News
stand as testimony to this persecu
tion.
Great disappointment
Aside from our anger, it is a great
disappointment we feel when we
realize that myths especially de
signed to weaken our struggle as an
oppressed people are supported by
members of another oppressed
group which has the same kinds of
myths to confront, directed against
its own people.
The author states "All struggle is
not the same." We feel that he does
not realize that the struggle of all op
pressed peoples is indeed the same
in its most crucial aspect: it is the
struggle against ignorance.

the Womens Collective of the Gay
Peoples Union.)
