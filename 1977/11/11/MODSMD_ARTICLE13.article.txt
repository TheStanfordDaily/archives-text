# Foodstore execs fear eat-out trend
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — To hear
the food-chain industry rep
resentatives tell it, things aren't
so super at the supermarket
these days.
It seems the grocery store,
an American institution on the
order of the church, school
and library, is facing possible
revolutionary change, not
necessarily of its own making.

Figures show that increasing
numbers of Americans in the
eat-and-run society of the '70s
are choosing to dine out.
Compounding this problem, in
the view of industry execu
tives, is a population trend to
ward fewer births and more
single persons living alone.
The Food Marketing Insti
tute, which represents most of

the nation's food store chains,
is concerned about these
trends and has hired the A.C.
Neilsen Co. to conduct public
opinion research to tell the in
dustry how to improve its bus
iness.
What impact will changing
buying habits and lifestyles
have on grocery stores?
For one thing, the word
"super" might come out ot
supermarket.
"We have begun to rethink
the notion that bigger is bet
ter,' says Robert Aders, presi
dent of the marketing institute.
And the Neilsen people say
the things about supermarkets
that irk people must somehow
be changed — things like long
checkout lines, dirty stores,
rude employes and difficulty in
finding things.
However, industry officials
don't like to think the $195
billion-per-year grocery store
business is facing revolutio
nary change.
"We prefer to call it 'evolu
tion,' " says Victor Hirsch, the
trade association's public af

fairs director.
But it is clear the industry's
perceived interloper in the bat
tle for the food dollar is the
man who runs the restaurant.
Figures show Americans
spend more than $50 billion to
eat out.
Besides facing increasing
competition from conven
tional restaurants and fast-food
establishments, the supermar
ket industry says it is spending
more than ever for food, hired
help and energy.
Because of these factors, of
ficials concede, increased
competition isn't likely to re
sult in any reduction in grocery
store prices.
"The last two years, competi
tion has just been brutal,"
Hirsch .says. "Every retailer is
trying to cement a foothold in
the market, to find his niche."
For consumers, he says, this
should mean more freedom of
choice between particular
types of stores and less fad
dishness, such as special
promotions and games that are
used as come-ons.

The Food Marketing Insti
tute, which represents most of

the nation's food store chains,

trends and has hired the A.C.

opinion research to tell the in

What impact will changing

have on grocery stores?
For one thing, the word

supermarket.
"We have begun to rethink
the notion that bigger is bet

dent of the marketing institute.
And the Neilsen people say
the things about supermarkets
that irk people must somehow
be changed — things like long
checkout lines, dirty stores,
rude employes and difficulty in
finding things.
However, industry officials
don't like to think the $195
billion-per-year grocery store
business is facing revolutio
nary change.
"We prefer to call it 'evolu

But it is clear the industry's
perceived interloper in the bat

man who runs the restaurant.
Figures show Americans
spend more than $50 billion to
eat out.
Besides facing increasing
competition from conven
tional restaurants and fast-food
establishments, the supermar

more than ever for food, hired
help and energy.
Because of these factors, of

competition isn't likely to re

store prices.
"The last two years, competi

Hirsch .says. "Every retailer is
trying to cement a foothold in
the market, to find his niche."
For consumers, he says, this
should mean more freedom of
choice between particular
types of stores and less fad
dishness, such as special
promotions and games that are
used as come-ons.

More and more Americans are eating out. This trend along with a lower birth rate and increasing numbers
ol single persons living alone may threaten the existence of the supermarket as we know it today,
according to some food store representatives.
Washington (AP) — To hear
the food-chain industry rep
resentatives tell it, things aren't
so super at the supermarket
these days.
It seems the grocery store,
an American institution on the
order of the church, school
and library, is facing possible
revolutionary change, not
necessarily of its own making.

Figures show that increasing
numbers of Americans in the
eat-and-run society of the '70s
are choosing to dine out.
Compounding this problem, in
the view of industry execu
tives, is a population trend to
ward fewer births and more
single persons living alone.
