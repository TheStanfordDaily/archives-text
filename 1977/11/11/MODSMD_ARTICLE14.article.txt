# Drought destroys 18 million trees
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
The drought has killed 18
million trees in California this
year, almost twice as many as
were killed by forest fires,
foresters reported this week.
Some of the trees died for
lack of water, but most were
killed because their drought
stricken condition made them
vulnerable to disease and in
sects, said Dick Smith, an en
tomologist for the U.S. Forest
Service.
Smith said the death rate
among trees this year was two
to five times normal.
The trees killed by the
drought were estimated to be
worth about $900 million and
would have produced enough
lumber to build 600,000
houses, or a city six times the
size of Sacramento.
The number of trees lost to
the drought was about as many
as loggers would cut in two
years.
(An estimated 100 eucalyptus

trees on campus worth about
$500 each have died due to
drought conditions, according
to University Plant Services.)
Dick Hunt, an insect and dis
ease specialist for the state
Forestry Department, said the
drought loss will mount.
"You can't figure the actual
cost of this whole calamity
now," Hunt said.
