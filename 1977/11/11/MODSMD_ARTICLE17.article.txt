"We are here by default," Dr. Robert Bakker
of Johns Hopkins University told an audience ot
one hundred in his lecture on the evolution ot
dinosaurs Wednesday afternoon.
Bakker traced the one hundred and thirty-five
million year domination of the terrestrial
ecosystem of herbivorous and carnivorous di
nosaur species, which ended 70 million years
ago, through the present forms of mammals.
Both dinosaurs and mammals evolved from
primitive forms of reptiles, who walked the
earth 300 to 225 million years ago.
Predator-prey relationships derived from
bone fossils of herbivorous and carnivorous
animals show that a wide variety of species
existed. Analysis of the internal structures of
these bones indicates that these animals had
structures typical of today's reptiles, Bakker
said.
"All the continents were stuck together ex
cept China," Bakker explained. According to
fossil findings "the southern regions were gla
cial . . . the cold blooded couldn't colonize
them." More recent mammal-like reptile fossils
have been found there, showing them to be the
first to colonize these areas, he said.
The inability of the cold blooded to colonize
these areas is due to their metabolism, said Bak
ker. The reptile's metabolic system must in
crease its heat output. Unable to sustain this
effort beyond a narrow temperature preference
range, the reptile dies when the temperature
exceeds this range. Mammal-like animals, he
further explained, by virtue of their enormous
food intake, can "increase their heat production
and adjust to heats and sinks ... in different
habitats."

While some of the primitive reptiles retained
their original forms, other evolved into di
nosaurs, Bakker said. While they started out
very tiny in size, later forms attained "a com
plete monopoly on largeness," Bakker said.
According to Bakker, estimates of heart-lung
output figures show that the mammal-like re
ptiles could outrun the dinosaurs in a single
anaerobic (not using oxygen) bound but would
be exhausted for days after the effort. Thus the
larger mammal like dinosaurs succeeded them
since they could move quickly for longer
stretches of time and consumed oxygen more
efficiently.
Different dinosaur species were becoming ex
tinct about every two million years during the
dinosaurs period of domination, but were con
tinuously replaced by new species, Bakker said.
When the shallow seas drained and the topog
raphy homogenized, animals had to change
their consumption patterns.
The smaller mammals adapted their tood con
sumption patterns without much difficulty be
cause they occupied a lower position on the
food chain. Dinosaurs had a harder time adapt
ing and suffered from predation and interpreta
tion (animals who consume the food supply re
quired by another species and not themselves).
Bakker said this extinction process was a
natural consequence.
As to the implications of these findings tor the
evolution of humans, Bakker characterized our
successors as warm blooded, capable of main
taining homeostasis in a wide variety of envi
ronments, intelligent, manipulative, and able to
produce tools. "Raccoons would take over the
world," he said.
