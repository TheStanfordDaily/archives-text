Why is that plot of land (to the right of Mem Audi in the state it is
in? What do they eventually hope to do with it?
According to Oscar Nelson, Director of Facilities and Proper
ties, there is at present a stockpile of topsoil on the site which will
be used for landscaping the new Green Library annex and the
new Herbert Hoover Federal Memorial Building. Also, there is
a temporary office tor the Tanner Memorial Fountain workers.
After these projects are finished, Nelson said the site "will be
returned to its normal emptiness."
The site is "earmarked for academic use," Nelson said. How
ever, nothing specific has been determined. A few years ago, it
was thought that a new speech and drama building would be put
on the site. But, due to a lack of funds, this never became a reality.
Nelson said that although the site is not reserved, they would
still like to see it used for something related to the facilities
already available in Memorial Auditorium.
