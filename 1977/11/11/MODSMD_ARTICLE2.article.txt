# Report of homosexual attack confirmed
## 
### Randy Keith 
Police here have confirmed that a
possible homosexual attack was re
ported to them Oct. 4, after previ
ously denying that any such report
had been made.
Stanford police Detective Donald
Lillie said Wednesday that an inci
dent listed on the Oct. 4 police re
port as an "assault with a deadly
weapon" was reported as a
homosexual attack.
"We don't doubt that the sex act
was committed," he said.
During the weeks following Oct. 4,
investigating officers denied that any
homosexual rape or attack had been
reported to them. They did confirm
that an assault with a deadly weapon
had been reported by a man on that
date, but said that the case had been
closed because the victim had de
clined to pursue it.
According to the Oct. 4 police re
port the attack took place about 9:30
p.m. the same date, and that a report
to police had been made slightly
more than an hour later.

The usual description of cir
cumstances surrounding the crime
and the precise location where it was
reported to have occurred were de
leted from the report shown to the
Daily.
The report gave only the times, the
fact that the attack occurred on cam
pus, the name of the officer making
the initial report and the designation
"assault with a deadly weapon."
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who is in
charge of investigations for the Stan
ford police, when asked during the
week following the incident if the
listed assault had been in fact re
ported as a homosexual rape or at
tack, replied that no such incident
had been reported.
He did say that the listed assault
had reportedly occurred on campus
near the Hoover Pavilion, off Palm
Drive.
He added that the case had been
turned over to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office tor further in
vestigation. Officials at the Sheriff's
office said the case had in turn been

taken over by the Palo Alto Police
Department, which has jurisdiction
over the part of campus where the
attack was reported to have taken
place.
Agent Lou Verna of the Palo Alto
Police Department was assigned to
handle the case. When contacted
three weeks ago and asked whether
the "assault with a deadly weapon"
case which he had been assigned had
any connection with either a
homosexual rape or attack he said
that as far as he knew it did not.
He said the case is inactive because
the victim could not give a descrip
tion of possible attackers and asked
that the investigation be stopped.
When contacted yesterday
Niemeyer said he had declined to
comment when questioned earlier
on the specifics of the case because it
had been turned over to another
jurisdiction.
He said that when he had been
specifically asked whether a
homosexual rape or attack had oc
curred "I said no; there was not a
rape because it was not a rape under

the definition of rape."
When asked yesterday if a man
were to be sexually assaulted by
other men whether it would be con
sidered a rape, Niemeyer said, "in
my opinion it wouldn't."
"Rape is defined in the penal code
as the unlawful intercourse and
penetration of another human be
ing," he said.
"What typically happens in a male
rape situation is that there is sodomy
. . . and that was our definition of
male rape," he later added.
Niemeyer said that the assault vic
tim refused to cooperate with au
thorities "as tar as having an exami
nation at the hospital."
"He said that he was not raped,"
Niemeyer added.
Lillie was asked Wednesday to ver
ify his initial statement that the re
ported assault had been reported as
a homosexual attack and he replied
"It was reported as such."
When asked to comment on Lillie's
statements to the Daily Wednesday,
Niemeyer said yesterday,"I think
you better talk to Lillie about that and
I'll talk to him about that too."
"Because again, it's very improper
for us to comment on another juris
diction's case . . . it's very deadly
business to do that; for one agency
to speculate or comment on another
agency's case. It's very, very bad
practice and we don't do it."
Niemeyer was also asked yester
day about the police investigation of
the attempted rape which occurred
early Wednesday morning.
"We're disturbed by it because it's
the first such attack we've had that
has been reported of that nature. In
other words, a cat-burglar type at
tack," he said.
He said such attack "has been pick
ing up all over the area" especially in
the area surrounding San )ose State.
Niemeyer also said that his office
has been working with police at
UC-Berkeley to set up a program of
rape prevention techniques.
He said that he wanted the house
associates (RAs) and others close to
students here to take a more active
role in teaching students about how
to prevent rape.
"The police can't teach all the
people. And the police kind of serve
as a resource base and assist," he
said.
He added that he had also talked to
the Stanford Bookstore about stock
ing a high powered screech alarm
that can be used to call for help and
scare off attackers.

homosexual rape or attack had been
reported to them. They did confirm
that an assault with a deadly weapon
had been reported by a man on that
date, but said that the case had been
closed because the victim had de
clined to pursue it.
According to the Oct. 4 police re
port the attack took place about 9:30
p.m. the same date, and that a report
to police had been made slightly
more than an hour later.

The usual description of cir
cumstances surrounding the crime
and the precise location where it was
reported to have occurred were de
leted from the report shown to the
Daily.
The report gave only the times, the
fact that the attack occurred on cam
pus, the name of the officer making
the initial report and the designation
"assault with a deadly weapon."
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who is in
charge of investigations for the Stan
ford police, when asked during the
week following the incident if the
listed assault had been in fact re
ported as a homosexual rape or at
tack, replied that no such incident
had been reported.
He did say that the listed assault
had reportedly occurred on campus
near the Hoover Pavilion, off Palm
Drive.
He added that the case had been
turned over to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office tor further in
vestigation. Officials at the Sheriff's
office said the case had in turn been

taken over by the Palo Alto Police
Department, which has jurisdiction
over the part of campus where the
attack was reported to have taken
place.
Agent Lou Verna of the Palo Alto
Police Department was assigned to
handle the case. When contacted
three weeks ago and asked whether
the "assault with a deadly weapon"
case which he had been assigned had
any connection with either a
homosexual rape or attack he said
that as far as he knew it did not.
He said the case is inactive because
the victim could not give a descrip
tion of possible attackers and asked
that the investigation be stopped.
When contacted yesterday
Niemeyer said he had declined to
comment when questioned earlier
on the specifics of the case because it
had been turned over to another
jurisdiction.
He said that when he had been
specifically asked whether a
homosexual rape or attack had oc
curred "I said no; there was not a
rape because it was not a rape under

the definition of rape."
When asked yesterday if a man
were to be sexually assaulted by
other men whether it would be con
sidered a rape, Niemeyer said, "in
my opinion it wouldn't."
"Rape is defined in the penal code
as the unlawful intercourse and
penetration of another human be
ing," he said.
"What typically happens in a male
rape situation is that there is sodomy
. . . and that was our definition of
male rape," he later added.
Niemeyer said that the assault vic
tim refused to cooperate with au
thorities "as tar as having an exami
nation at the hospital."
"He said that he was not raped,"
Niemeyer added.
Lillie was asked Wednesday to ver
ify his initial statement that the re
ported assault had been reported as
a homosexual attack and he replied
"It was reported as such."
When asked to comment on Lillie's
statements to the Daily Wednesday,
Niemeyer said yesterday,"I think
you better talk to Lillie about that and
I'll talk to him about that too."
"Because again, it's very improper
for us to comment on another juris
diction's case . . . it's very deadly
business to do that; for one agency
to speculate or comment on another
agency's case. It's very, very bad
practice and we don't do it."
Niemeyer was also asked yester
day about the police investigation of
the attempted rape which occurred
early Wednesday morning.
"We're disturbed by it because it's
the first such attack we've had that
has been reported of that nature. In
other words, a cat-burglar type at
tack," he said.
He said such attack "has been pick
ing up all over the area" especially in
the area surrounding San )ose State.
Niemeyer also said that his office
has been working with police at
UC-Berkeley to set up a program of
rape prevention techniques.
He said that he wanted the house
associates (RAs) and others close to
students here to take a more active
role in teaching students about how
to prevent rape.
"The police can't teach all the
people. And the police kind of serve
as a resource base and assist," he
said.
He added that he had also talked to
the Stanford Bookstore about stock
ing a high powered screech alarm
that can be used to call for help and
scare off attackers.
Police here have confirmed that a
possible homosexual attack was re
ported to them Oct. 4, after previ
ously denying that any such report
had been made.
Stanford police Detective Donald
Lillie said Wednesday that an inci
dent listed on the Oct. 4 police re
port as an "assault with a deadly

homosexual attack.
"We don't doubt that the sex act
was committed," he said.

and the precise location where it was
reported to have occurred were de
leted from the report shown to the
Daily.
The report gave only the times, the
fact that the attack occurred on cam
pus, the name of the officer making
the initial report and the designation
"assault with a deadly weapon."
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who is in
charge of investigations for the Stan
ford police, when asked during the
week following the incident if the
listed assault had been in fact re
ported as a homosexual rape or at
tack, replied that no such incident
had been reported.
He did say that the listed assault
had reportedly occurred on campus
near the Hoover Pavilion, off Palm
Drive.
He added that the case had been
turned over to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office tor further in
vestigation. Officials at the Sheriff's
office said the case had in turn been

taken over by the Palo Alto Police
Department, which has jurisdiction
over the part of campus where the
attack was reported to have taken
place.
Agent Lou Verna of the Palo Alto
Police Department was assigned to
handle the case. When contacted
three weeks ago and asked whether
the "assault with a deadly weapon"
case which he had been assigned had
any connection with either a
homosexual rape or attack he said
that as far as he knew it did not.
He said the case is inactive because
the victim could not give a descrip
tion of possible attackers and asked
that the investigation be stopped.
When contacted yesterday
Niemeyer said he had declined to
comment when questioned earlier
on the specifics of the case because it
had been turned over to another
jurisdiction.
He said that when he had been
specifically asked whether a
homosexual rape or attack had oc
curred "I said no; there was not a
rape because it was not a rape under

the definition of rape."
When asked yesterday if a man
were to be sexually assaulted by
other men whether it would be con
sidered a rape, Niemeyer said, "in
my opinion it wouldn't."
"Rape is defined in the penal code
as the unlawful intercourse and
penetration of another human be
ing," he said.
"What typically happens in a male
rape situation is that there is sodomy
. . . and that was our definition of
male rape," he later added.
Niemeyer said that the assault vic
tim refused to cooperate with au
thorities "as tar as having an exami
nation at the hospital."
"He said that he was not raped,"
Niemeyer added.
Lillie was asked Wednesday to ver
ify his initial statement that the re
ported assault had been reported as
a homosexual attack and he replied
"It was reported as such."
When asked to comment on Lillie's
statements to the Daily Wednesday,
Niemeyer said yesterday,"I think
you better talk to Lillie about that and
I'll talk to him about that too."
"Because again, it's very improper
for us to comment on another juris
diction's case . . . it's very deadly
business to do that; for one agency
to speculate or comment on another
agency's case. It's very, very bad
practice and we don't do it."
Niemeyer was also asked yester
day about the police investigation of
the attempted rape which occurred
early Wednesday morning.
"We're disturbed by it because it's
the first such attack we've had that
has been reported of that nature. In
other words, a cat-burglar type at
tack," he said.
He said such attack "has been pick
ing up all over the area" especially in
the area surrounding San )ose State.
Niemeyer also said that his office
has been working with police at
UC-Berkeley to set up a program of
rape prevention techniques.
He said that he wanted the house
associates (RAs) and others close to
students here to take a more active
role in teaching students about how
to prevent rape.
"The police can't teach all the
people. And the police kind of serve
as a resource base and assist," he
said.
He added that he had also talked to
the Stanford Bookstore about stock
ing a high powered screech alarm
that can be used to call for help and
scare off attackers.
Police here have confirmed that a
possible homosexual attack was re
ported to them Oct. 4, after previ
ously denying that any such report
had been made.
Stanford police Detective Donald
Lillie said Wednesday that an inci
dent listed on the Oct. 4 police re
port as an "assault with a deadly
weapon" was reported as a
homosexual attack.
"We don't doubt that the sex act
was committed," he said.
During the weeks following Oct. 4,
investigating officers denied that any
homosexual rape or attack had been
reported to them. They did confirm
that an assault with a deadly weapon
had been reported by a man on that
date, but said that the case had been
closed because the victim had de
clined to pursue it.
According to the Oct. 4 police re
port the attack took place about 9:30
p.m. the same date, and that a report
to police had been made slightly
more than an hour later.
