# justice Dept. is proud owner of topless bar
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Jus
tice Department is keeping a
close eye these days on a go-go
jointwith fourtoplessdancers.
It's got a piece of the action.
The department has ac
quired a financial stake in the
success of the "Lone Star Beef
House," a bar that caters to the
downtown lunch crowd, and
hopes to seize ownership and
sell it to recover money alleged
embezzled from the govern
ment.
Meantime, department
lawyers have won a court order
protecting the government's
interest in the place. This
means the government's
lawyers can keep their eyes on
the operation to make sure its
value is intact.
Embarrassed amusement
All of this has provoked em
barrassed amusement among
the lawyers handling the case.
One of them strolled up to
the place the other day to post
the legal notice of the govern
ment claim. But it was impossi
ble to avoid the distractions of
the entertainment, partly be
cause he couldn't tell at first
glance whether the dancer was
bottomless as well as topless.
"At first he thought she was
wearing some sort of flesh
colored thing. Then he de
cided she wasn't," another

lawyer recounted later.
The bar, two blocks north ot
the department and almost a
next-door neighbor to the FBI
building, is involved in the
government's embezzlement
case against William Sibert.
A former Transportation De
partment employe, Sibert has
been charged with embezzling
more than $856,000 from mass
transit funds and spending the
money on 14 fancy cars, a
$30,000 houseboat, a house
with a swimming pool, and the
Lone Star Beef House.
In a bargain with pro
secutors, Sibert has pleaded
guilty to several of the charges
and is awaiting sentencing. He's
already serving a prison sen
tence for a firearms violation.
Partner's argument
The government took steps
to seize Sibert's property to re
cover the embezzled money
but ran into an argument from
a partner of Sibert who claims
to own half of the topless bar.
Government lawyers are
pursuing a civil suit to obtain
the bar, and the court has pro
hibited the operators from
doing anything to decrease the
value of the place until the case
is settled.
If the department wins the
suit, the bar would be put up
for sale at public auction.

Department lawyers stres
sed that although they have
some supervisory authority
over the operation, they're not
in the business of making day
to-day decisions about the way
the place is run.
One department official re
ported after a lunch-time visit
that the dancers are indeed
eye-catching, but the food
leaves much to be desired. And
the rock music from the juke
box, he said, "is loud enough
to blow the hamburger off your
plate."

doing anything to decrease the
value of the place until the case
is settled.
If the department wins the
suit, the bar would be put up
for sale at public auction.

Department lawyers stres
sed that although they have
some supervisory authority
over the operation, they're not
in the business of making day
to-day decisions about the way
the place is run.
One department official re

that the dancers are indeed
eye-catching, but the food
leaves much to be desired. And
the rock music from the juke

Washington (AP) — The Jus
tice Department is keeping a
close eye these days on a go-go
jointwith fourtoplessdancers.
It's got a piece of the action.
The department has ac
quired a financial stake in the
success of the "Lone Star Beef
House," a bar that caters to the
downtown lunch crowd, and
hopes to seize ownership and
sell it to recover money alleged
embezzled from the govern
ment.
Meantime, department
lawyers have won a court order
protecting the government's
interest in the place. This
means the government's
lawyers can keep their eyes on
the operation to make sure its
value is intact.
Embarrassed amusement
All of this has provoked em
barrassed amusement among
the lawyers handling the case.
One of them strolled up to
the place the other day to post
the legal notice of the govern
ment claim. But it was impossi
ble to avoid the distractions of
the entertainment, partly be
cause he couldn't tell at first
glance whether the dancer was
bottomless as well as topless.
"At first he thought she was
wearing some sort of flesh
colored thing. Then he de
cided she wasn't," another

lawyer recounted later.
The bar, two blocks north ot
the department and almost a
next-door neighbor to the FBI
building, is involved in the
government's embezzlement
case against William Sibert.
A former Transportation De
partment employe, Sibert has
been charged with embezzling
more than $856,000 from mass
transit funds and spending the
money on 14 fancy cars, a
$30,000 houseboat, a house
with a swimming pool, and the
Lone Star Beef House.
In a bargain with pro
secutors, Sibert has pleaded
guilty to several of the charges
and is awaiting sentencing. He's
already serving a prison sen
tence for a firearms violation.
Partner's argument
The government took steps
to seize Sibert's property to re
cover the embezzled money
but ran into an argument from
a partner of Sibert who claims
to own half of the topless bar.
Government lawyers are
pursuing a civil suit to obtain
the bar, and the court has pro
hibited the operators from
doing anything to decrease the
value of the place until the case
is settled.
If the department wins the
suit, the bar would be put up
for sale at public auction.
