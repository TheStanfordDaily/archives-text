# Trustees give preliminary OK to new comp center
## 
### 
The Board ot Trustees gave preliminary
approval to a new campus computing center
at its meeting earlier this week.
Under the plan, the Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP) would be
consolidated into one facility located in the
Jordan Quad area.
The $3.6 million plan is scheduled for
completion by the end of fall quarter 1979
tentatively.
A background report supplied to trustees
stated that high levels of staffing and diffi
culty in maintaining high levels of service to
academic and administrative users of SCIP
were two problems with the present SCIP
facility set up.
SCIP presently occupies Encina Hall base
ment, Pine and Polya Halls of Jordan Quad,
12,000 square feet of modular space behind
Old Pavilion and the Encina Commons area

behind Encina Hall.
Substantial operational savings is ex
pected from the consolidation.
The report stated that after completion of
Outer Quad improvements to Margaret
Jacks Hall and Building 120, the Computer
Science and Communication Departments
will be moved into the Quad leaving many
Jordan Quad buildings vacant.
SCIP will be assigned to Cypress, Red
wood, Cedar, Pine and Polya Halls in Jordan
Quad under the plan, plus a new computer
building to be constructed over a 10- 12-
month period commencing early 1978.
The proposal still needs approval of the
Land and Buildings plus finance and De
velopment committees before bids will be
let. That process could take months, accord
ing to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the pres
ident for trustee affairs.
