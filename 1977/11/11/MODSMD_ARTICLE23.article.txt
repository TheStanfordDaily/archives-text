Le Pot Au Feu
1149 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
Authentic French restaur
ants are hard to locate in the
United States. Many foreign
restaurants that claim to be
genuine make so many con
cessions to American tastes
that they present at best a poor
imitation of the actual foreign
dish. Le Pot Au Feu serves
Tuesday through Saturday
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. authen
tic and carefully prepared
French food.
Owned and operated by
Jean Cornil of Vichy, France
and his American wife Nina, Le
Pot Au Feu exudes a combina
tion of the warmth of a country
inn, due in part to the charm
ing glow of actual kerosene
glass lamps on each table, and
the romantic gaiety of the
French sidewalk cafe; some
tables are on a raised dais and
equipped with umbrellas.
The restaurant is small and
intimate; usually between 6
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. tables are
available, but after this time
plan to linger in the sitting
room and enjoy complimen
tary wine while you wait. Le Pot

Au Feu does not take reserva
tions but this does not seem to
be an inconvenience.
From the time one enters Le
Pot Au Feu one is treated with
the utmost politeness. Nina
Cornil supervises the restaur
ant with charm and finesse.
Servers are helpful and effi
cient but relaxed, present at
the exact moment they are
needed but do not hover and
simper .
Working from a tiny and
spotless kitchen chef/artist
lean Cornil produces a small
but provocative selection of
entrees. Regular dinners range
from filet mignon to Le Lapin a
la Moutarde, rabbit with mus
tard sauce, and Coq au Vin, a
traditional French dish of chic
ken in wine sauce.
M. Cornil also offers a diffe
rent special dish nightly. Two
of these entrees are Coquilles
St. Jacques, a scallop and sea
food dish, and Filet de Boef en
Croute, a filet mignon in a pas
try crust. All dinners include
soup, salad and French bread
and butter.
The presence of a specialty
indicates M. Cornil's concern
with every entree; rather than
sacrifice care in preparation to

a menu so large as to be cum
bersome, a single extraordi
nary plate requiring special
preparation is offered each
evening in addition to the regu
lar menu. Prices of all dinners
range from $7 to $8.75 ($1 less
for a la carte).
It is difficult to savor an ex
cellent French meal without
also enjoying a good wine. The
wine list offers a very good,
light house wine, white and
red ($5.50), bottled specifically
for Le Pot Au Feu and also a jug
wine. Other wines include
several bottled by Joseph
Phelps ($6.50 to $9 per bottle).
Red wine is served in balloon
wine glasses, excellent for
savoring the bouquet.
Certain dishes excel in every
fine restaurant. I strongly re
commend Le Saumon en
Croute au Beaune Blanc, sal
mon wrapped in a pastry shell
with lemon and butter sauce.
The first two courses of the
meal were very good.
The delicate leek soup was
neither overpowering nor
heavy and starchy with potato
and had the texture of fine
cream. The salad that followed,
several lovely leaves of red let

tuce, was dressed with a mus
tard dressing, perhaps a bit
strong. The salad was topped
with fresh chopped parsley.
The bread accompanying
this meal was a bit disappoint
ing as it was sourdough. Sour
dough, though a West Coast
treat and good in its own right,
is not French and tends to be
too forceful to clean the palate
and accent the dish.
The salmon itself was per
fectly cooked. The pastry was
light as air and practically
melted in the mouth. The fish
was moist and the sauce was
served separately, rather than
soaking the pastry. Thezuchini
was also bien cuit, firm and
flavourful, and the plate
looked elegant.
The brown rice was
flavoured with curry powder
which I felt incongruous and a
bit inappropriate. The fish and
sauce were very subtle; plain
brown rice would have been a
better compliment. On the
whole, however, this fancy and
difficult dish was excellently
prepared and presented.
For those who like simpler
fare, the Pot Au Feu, a brisket
of meat and some assorted
vegetables cooked in a broth is

an excellent country dish.
Served with French mustard
for the meat, coarse salt and
tiny dill gherkins, this may
well be the most traditional
dish on the menu. The tlavorot
the broth may be enhanced by
doing as the French do: add a
little of your red wine to it.
Several desserts are ottered.
I chose the raspberry crepes.
These were paper thin and til
led with whipping cream and
unsweetened fresh raspberries
with just a touch of rum. Ex
presso coftee is traditionally
French but there is also tea,
American coffee and Cap
pucino.
After a meal at Le Pot Au Feu I
felt pleasantly refreshed. I re
commend this restaurant to
those who enjoy an exquisite
meal prepared with the op
timum amount of attention to
every plate.
Each dish is treated as a work
of art with an identifying signa
ture, and )ean and Nina Cornil
are very proud of their estab
lishment. Le Pot Au Feu is, I
feel, one of the best it not the
best French restaurant in the
Stanford area.

meal were very good.
The delicate leek soup was
neither overpowering nor
heavy and starchy with potato
and had the texture of fine
cream. The salad that followed,
several lovely leaves of red let

tuce, was dressed with a mus
tard dressing, perhaps a bit
strong. The salad was topped
with fresh chopped parsley.
The bread accompanying
this meal was a bit disappoint
ing as it was sourdough. Sour
dough, though a West Coast
treat and good in its own right,
is not French and tends to be
too forceful to clean the palate
and accent the dish.
The salmon itself was per
fectly cooked. The pastry was
light as air and practically
melted in the mouth. The fish
was moist and the sauce was
served separately, rather than
soaking the pastry. Thezuchini
was also bien cuit, firm and
flavourful, and the plate
looked elegant.
The brown rice was
flavoured with curry powder
which I felt incongruous and a
bit inappropriate. The fish and
sauce were very subtle; plain
brown rice would have been a
better compliment. On the
whole, however, this fancy and
difficult dish was excellently
prepared and presented.
For those who like simpler
fare, the Pot Au Feu, a brisket
of meat and some assorted
vegetables cooked in a broth is

an excellent country dish.
Served with French mustard
for the meat, coarse salt and
tiny dill gherkins, this may
well be the most traditional
dish on the menu. The tlavorot
the broth may be enhanced by
doing as the French do: add a
little of your red wine to it.
Several desserts are ottered.
I chose the raspberry crepes.
These were paper thin and til
led with whipping cream and
unsweetened fresh raspberries
with just a touch of rum. Ex
presso coftee is traditionally
French but there is also tea,
American coffee and Cap
pucino.
After a meal at Le Pot Au Feu I
felt pleasantly refreshed. I re
commend this restaurant to
those who enjoy an exquisite
meal prepared with the op
timum amount of attention to
every plate.
Each dish is treated as a work
of art with an identifying signa
ture, and )ean and Nina Cornil
are very proud of their estab
lishment. Le Pot Au Feu is, I
feel, one of the best it not the
best French restaurant in the

Authentic French restaur
ants are hard to locate in the
United States. Many foreign
restaurants that claim to be
genuine make so many con
cessions to American tastes
that they present at best a poor
imitation of the actual foreign
dish. Le Pot Au Feu serves
Tuesday through Saturday
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. authen
tic and carefully prepared
French food.
Owned and operated by
Jean Cornil of Vichy, France
and his American wife Nina, Le
Pot Au Feu exudes a combina
tion of the warmth of a country
inn, due in part to the charm
ing glow of actual kerosene
glass lamps on each table, and
the romantic gaiety of the
French sidewalk cafe; some
tables are on a raised dais and
equipped with umbrellas.
The restaurant is small and
intimate; usually between 6
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. tables are
available, but after this time
plan to linger in the sitting
room and enjoy complimen
tary wine while you wait. Le Pot

Au Feu does not take reserva
tions but this does not seem to
be an inconvenience.
From the time one enters Le
Pot Au Feu one is treated with
the utmost politeness. Nina
Cornil supervises the restaur
ant with charm and finesse.
Servers are helpful and effi
cient but relaxed, present at
the exact moment they are
needed but do not hover and
simper .
Working from a tiny and
spotless kitchen chef/artist
lean Cornil produces a small
but provocative selection of
entrees. Regular dinners range
from filet mignon to Le Lapin a
la Moutarde, rabbit with mus
tard sauce, and Coq au Vin, a
traditional French dish of chic
ken in wine sauce.
M. Cornil also offers a diffe
rent special dish nightly. Two
of these entrees are Coquilles
St. Jacques, a scallop and sea
food dish, and Filet de Boef en
Croute, a filet mignon in a pas
try crust. All dinners include
soup, salad and French bread
and butter.
The presence of a specialty
indicates M. Cornil's concern
with every entree; rather than
sacrifice care in preparation to

a menu so large as to be cum
bersome, a single extraordi
nary plate requiring special
preparation is offered each
evening in addition to the regu
lar menu. Prices of all dinners
range from $7 to $8.75 ($1 less
for a la carte).
It is difficult to savor an ex
cellent French meal without
also enjoying a good wine. The
wine list offers a very good,
light house wine, white and
red ($5.50), bottled specifically
for Le Pot Au Feu and also a jug
wine. Other wines include
several bottled by Joseph
Phelps ($6.50 to $9 per bottle).
Red wine is served in balloon
wine glasses, excellent for
savoring the bouquet.
Certain dishes excel in every
fine restaurant. I strongly re
commend Le Saumon en
Croute au Beaune Blanc, sal
mon wrapped in a pastry shell
with lemon and butter sauce.
The first two courses of the

ing glow of actual kerosene
glass lamps on each table, and
the romantic gaiety of the
French sidewalk cafe; some
tables are on a raised dais and
equipped with umbrellas.
The restaurant is small and
intimate; usually between 6
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. tables are
available, but after this time
plan to linger in the sitting
room and enjoy complimen
tary wine while you wait. Le Pot

Au Feu does not take reserva
tions but this does not seem to
be an inconvenience.
From the time one enters Le
Pot Au Feu one is treated with
the utmost politeness. Nina
Cornil supervises the restaur
ant with charm and finesse.
Servers are helpful and effi
cient but relaxed, present at
the exact moment they are
needed but do not hover and
simper .
Working from a tiny and
spotless kitchen chef/artist
lean Cornil produces a small
but provocative selection of
entrees. Regular dinners range
from filet mignon to Le Lapin a
la Moutarde, rabbit with mus
tard sauce, and Coq au Vin, a
traditional French dish of chic
ken in wine sauce.
M. Cornil also offers a diffe
rent special dish nightly. Two
of these entrees are Coquilles
St. Jacques, a scallop and sea
food dish, and Filet de Boef en
Croute, a filet mignon in a pas
try crust. All dinners include
soup, salad and French bread
and butter.
The presence of a specialty
indicates M. Cornil's concern
with every entree; rather than
sacrifice care in preparation to

a menu so large as to be cum
bersome, a single extraordi
nary plate requiring special
preparation is offered each
evening in addition to the regu
lar menu. Prices of all dinners
range from $7 to $8.75 ($1 less
for a la carte).
It is difficult to savor an ex
cellent French meal without
also enjoying a good wine. The
wine list offers a very good,
light house wine, white and
red ($5.50), bottled specifically
for Le Pot Au Feu and also a jug
wine. Other wines include
several bottled by Joseph
Phelps ($6.50 to $9 per bottle).
Red wine is served in balloon
wine glasses, excellent for
savoring the bouquet.
Certain dishes excel in every
fine restaurant. I strongly re
commend Le Saumon en
Croute au Beaune Blanc, sal
mon wrapped in a pastry shell
with lemon and butter sauce.
The first two courses of the
meal were very good.
The delicate leek soup was
neither overpowering nor
heavy and starchy with potato
and had the texture of fine
cream. The salad that followed,
several lovely leaves of red let

tuce, was dressed with a mus
tard dressing, perhaps a bit
strong. The salad was topped
with fresh chopped parsley.
The bread accompanying
this meal was a bit disappoint
ing as it was sourdough. Sour
dough, though a West Coast
treat and good in its own right,
is not French and tends to be
too forceful to clean the palate
and accent the dish.
The salmon itself was per
fectly cooked. The pastry was
light as air and practically
melted in the mouth. The fish
was moist and the sauce was
served separately, rather than
soaking the pastry. Thezuchini
was also bien cuit, firm and
flavourful, and the plate
looked elegant.
The brown rice was
flavoured with curry powder
which I felt incongruous and a
bit inappropriate. The fish and
sauce were very subtle; plain
brown rice would have been a
better compliment. On the
whole, however, this fancy and
difficult dish was excellently
prepared and presented.
For those who like simpler
fare, the Pot Au Feu, a brisket
of meat and some assorted
vegetables cooked in a broth is

an excellent country dish.
Served with French mustard
for the meat, coarse salt and
tiny dill gherkins, this may
well be the most traditional
dish on the menu. The tlavorot
the broth may be enhanced by
doing as the French do: add a
little of your red wine to it.
Several desserts are ottered.
I chose the raspberry crepes.
These were paper thin and til
led with whipping cream and
unsweetened fresh raspberries
with just a touch of rum. Ex
presso coftee is traditionally
French but there is also tea,
American coffee and Cap
pucino.
After a meal at Le Pot Au Feu I
felt pleasantly refreshed. I re
commend this restaurant to
those who enjoy an exquisite
meal prepared with the op
timum amount of attention to
every plate.
Each dish is treated as a work
of art with an identifying signa
ture, and )ean and Nina Cornil
are very proud of their estab
lishment. Le Pot Au Feu is, I
feel, one of the best it not the
best French restaurant in the
Stanford area.

Authentic French restaur
ants are hard to locate in the
United States. Many foreign
restaurants that claim to be
genuine make so many con
cessions to American tastes
that they present at best a poor
imitation of the actual foreign
dish. Le Pot Au Feu serves
Tuesday through Saturday
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. authen
tic and carefully prepared
French food.
Owned and operated by
Jean Cornil of Vichy, France
and his American wife Nina, Le
Pot Au Feu exudes a combina
