# Football playoffs set
## Theta Delts top IM seedings 
### David Plager 
The Theta Delts, Law 111, the
Leftovers and Eucalypto are the
top seeds in the 'A,' 'B,' coed
and women's divisions respec
tively as the intramural football
playoffs in all four divisions get
underway this weekend. The
field of 149 teams that started
regular season play six weeks
ago has been narrowed down
to 61 playoff qualifiers an
ticipating Sunday's first-round
games.
The Theta Delts' impressive
46-6 and 46-12 wins over the Phi
Delts and SAE earned them the
No. 1 seed in the 'A' league
over the undefeated, defend
ing champion Zeta Psi squad.

Two of the Zete's four wins
were by less than a touchdown
including a 13-12 overtime de
cision over the No. 3 seed, Biz
11. Biz I, whose only losses
were to the Zetes and Biz II
round out the seeded quartet.
In first-round action, the
Theta Delts will put their unde
feated record on the line
against SCIP and the Zetes will
do likewise against the Sigma
Chis. Both games are Sunday at
2 p.m. on fields 7 and 8.
The fight for the 'B' league
crown, which will culminate in
a championship game Dec. 4,
promises to be typically excit
ing and unpredictable. Thir
teen of the 35 qualifiers carry

undefeated records into the
playoffs. Another 13 teams are
4-1. The aging advocates of Law
111 have been accorded the dis
tinction, or jinx, of being the
No. 1 seed. Although they ha
ven't run up the most impres
sive scores, they are possibly
an 'A' caliber team and the
other 'B' teams will be hard
pressed to derail them.
Which team does have the
most impressive record on
paper? That honor goes to the
Donnerheas, whose cumula
tive score for their five victories
of 110-0 earned them the No. 2
seed. 8.R.A., Organized
Crime, the Space Cowboys,
the Ghetto and Ujamaa, also all
undefeated, are seeded third
through seventh. Defending
B' league champion Los Arcos
was the only team with a loss to
earn a seed, as they edged into
the eighth position. Although
upset in their opening game
against the KAs, they came on
strong to win their last four
games by a combined score of
97-12.
In the coed league, the un
defeated Leftovers, were the
overwhelming choice tor the
top spot. They outscored their
four opponents 151-20. They
could be pressed, however, by
B.R.A. and Junipero, both un
defeated and seeded second
and third respectively. Tran
cos, whose only loss was to the

Leftovers, is the No. 4 seed.
The only women's playoff
game this weekend is between
Mirlo and Roble Sunday at 3
p.m. The top two women's
teams, Eucalypto and FTLS
square off against each other
Sunday at 1 p.m. to determine
that league's regular season
champion.
Important Note:
All first-round games in all
divisions are scheduled for this
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
All playoff teams should check
in at the IM Office, 350 Encina,
today to see when and where
the games are scheduled.
