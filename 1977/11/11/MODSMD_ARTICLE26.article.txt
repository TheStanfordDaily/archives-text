# Cardinals gear for SJS clash
## 
### David Georgette 
Stanford hasn't won eight
regular season football games
since 1971 —the last time it was
in the Rose Bowl. Chances are
the Cardinals won't be going to
Pasadena this season, but with
a 6-3 record (4-2 in the Pacific
-8), wins in the final two games
of the season would put the
Cards in contending position
for some type of post-season
action.
So there will be plenty at
stake tomorrow when the
Cards host San jose St. (4-5) in a
non-conference match-up.
Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. (KZSU
90.1 FM, KSFO 560 AM), and
the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment has declared the after
noon "Fan Appreciation Day."
The Cards themselves could
probably use some apprecia
tion from the fans in the wake
of last Saturday's 49-0 shellack
ing by USC in Los Angeles.
"We're trying to shake out the
distress you go through when
you lose like that," said Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh.

"On offense, we'll just have to
prove to ourselves we're good.
Everything went wrong last
week — from performance to
strategy."
Despite having thrown four
interceptions against the Tro
jans, Stanford quarterback Guy
Benjamin still leads the Pac-8 in
passing, and tops conference
quarterbacks in completions,
touchdowns and yards.
All-America sought
All this should please Walsh,
who answered why he left Ben
jamin in all the way against USC
long after the game was out of
reach. "Guy Benjamin has
been shuttled in and out of the
lineup for three years," Walsh
said emphatically. "We'd like
Guy Benjamin to be All-
America. Our primary concern
is to win above all, but our next
aim is to let Guy Benjamin have
a chance to be the All-America
quarterback — at the sacrifice
of other things."
To be the All-America quar
terback, a passer needs good
receivers, and Benjamin has at

his disposal the top three in the
conference. Flanker James Lof
ton heads the list with 43
catches, followed by halfback
Darrin Nelson (42) and split
end Bill Kellar (41).
While it is likely the offense
will rebound from the destruc
tion of the Coliseum, the
much-maligned Cardinal de
fense will again probably hold
the key to Stanford's success.
"If our defense can stop San
Jose, I think we'll win," said
Walsh. "My guess is they'll try
to run at us to see if it'll work.
My hope is we'll stop it. I don't
see them stopping our offense,
but then that's difficult to say

after last week."
Defensively, Stanford is
ranked seventh in the Pac-8,
and also seventh against the
rush. Should the Spartans
choose to test the Cards'
strength against the run, they'll
probably give the ball to junior
halfback Kevin Cole. He has
carried the ball 142 times this
season for 567 yards, including
127 last week in the Spartans'
win over Hawaii.
Against the pass, Stanford is
rated fourth-best in the con
ference, although opponents
have completed 65 per cent of
their passes. The Spartans'
quarterback is Ed Luther, a
sophomore who's thrown for

1066 yards in 211 attempts.
Despite the failings of the
Cardinal defense at some cru
cial times this season, Walsh
said, "I think the defense has
held up well considering we've
had a lot of guys in and out.
We've put men here and there
that have made progress."
)ust how much progress the
Cards have made this season
won't be totally known until
after the season is over. But a
loss to the Spartans would tend
to lessen the success already
attained, and would certainly
end what opportunities the
Cards have to go to a bowl
game.

Against the pass, Stanford is
rated fourth-best in the con
ference, although opponents
have completed 65 per cent of
their passes. The Spartans'
quarterback is Ed Luther, a
sophomore who's thrown for

1066 yards in 211 attempts.
Despite the failings of the
Cardinal defense at some cru
cial times this season, Walsh
said, "I think the defense has
held up well considering we've
had a lot of guys in and out.
We've put men here and there
that have made progress."
)ust how much progress the
Cards have made this season
won't be totally known until
after the season is over. But a
loss to the Spartans would tend
to lessen the success already
attained, and would certainly
end what opportunities the
Cards have to go to a bowl
game.
Stanford hasn't won eight
regular season football games
since 1971 —the last time it was
in the Rose Bowl. Chances are
the Cardinals won't be going to
Pasadena this season, but with
a 6-3 record (4-2 in the Pacific
-8), wins in the final two games
of the season would put the
Cards in contending position
for some type of post-season
action.
So there will be plenty at
stake tomorrow when the
Cards host San jose St. (4-5) in a
non-conference match-up.
Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. (KZSU
90.1 FM, KSFO 560 AM), and
the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment has declared the after
noon "Fan Appreciation Day."
The Cards themselves could
probably use some apprecia
tion from the fans in the wake
of last Saturday's 49-0 shellack
ing by USC in Los Angeles.
"We're trying to shake out the
distress you go through when
you lose like that," said Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh.

"On offense, we'll just have to
prove to ourselves we're good.
Everything went wrong last
week — from performance to
strategy."
Despite having thrown four
interceptions against the Tro
jans, Stanford quarterback Guy
Benjamin still leads the Pac-8 in
passing, and tops conference
quarterbacks in completions,
touchdowns and yards.
All-America sought
All this should please Walsh,
who answered why he left Ben
jamin in all the way against USC
long after the game was out of
reach. "Guy Benjamin has
been shuttled in and out of the
lineup for three years," Walsh
said emphatically. "We'd like
Guy Benjamin to be All-
America. Our primary concern
is to win above all, but our next
aim is to let Guy Benjamin have
a chance to be the All-America
quarterback — at the sacrifice
of other things."
To be the All-America quar
terback, a passer needs good
receivers, and Benjamin has at

his disposal the top three in the
conference. Flanker James Lof
ton heads the list with 43
catches, followed by halfback
Darrin Nelson (42) and split
end Bill Kellar (41).
While it is likely the offense
will rebound from the destruc
tion of the Coliseum, the
much-maligned Cardinal de
fense will again probably hold
the key to Stanford's success.
"If our defense can stop San
Jose, I think we'll win," said
Walsh. "My guess is they'll try
to run at us to see if it'll work.
My hope is we'll stop it. I don't
see them stopping our offense,
but then that's difficult to say

after last week."
Defensively, Stanford is
ranked seventh in the Pac-8,
and also seventh against the
rush. Should the Spartans
choose to test the Cards'
strength against the run, they'll
probably give the ball to junior
halfback Kevin Cole. He has
carried the ball 142 times this
season for 567 yards, including
127 last week in the Spartans'
win over Hawaii.
