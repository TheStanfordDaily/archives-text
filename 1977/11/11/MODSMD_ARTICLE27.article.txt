# Rivers joins journalistic elite
## 
### 
Looking around in desp
eration for some way to pull
A's in journalism this quar
ter, the Daily sports staff in
vited Bill Rivers, the P.C.
Edwards professor of
communication to join us
as our guest football
prophet this week.
Rivers, a highly regarded
author and journalism in
structor, has risked his life
long reputation of quality
work for reputable publica
tions by accepting the
sports staff invitation.
"My secretary, Janet Col
lom, gambles with me every
Saturday, betting five cents
on Stanford. Last week, she
gave me USC and six points.
I think she lost.
"I have a successful for
mula this week: Every team
Collom thinks will win will
lose. She has just given me
her predictions for this
Saturday's games. I've put
on a reverse twist, betting
on those she thinks will
lose. The winners:
"Although Collom
doesn't know it, quarter
back Rob Hertel of USC has
been relaxing all week. He'll
continue to relax during the
game. That's why Charles
White will have to run, not

walk. It's a good thing; USC
will edge Washington in a
squeaker: 24-19.
"Collom thinks Idaho
State is more romantic than
Washington State. That's
because she thinks Idaho is
next to Mexico. Too bad.
Washington State will beat
Idaho State, 19-7.
"Oregon State will lose
lor one reason: Collom
pitched and tossed a coin,
read it, then predicted that
Oregon State will defeat
UCLA. Pish and tosh. UCLA
32, Oregon State 14.
"Collom believes
California will lose because
Oregon has the fuel neces
sary to win. Fuelish.
California 28, Oregon 14.
"Collom is a loyal Stan
ford graduate, but she's so
discouraged after last
week's defeat that she pre
dicts San Jose State will win.
Unfortunately, Guy Benja
min won't complete more
than 31 passes out of 32.
Moreover, Dan McCann
and Cordon King will score
touchdowns on intercep
tions. Stanlord 37, San Jose
State 10. (Because McCann
and King are on the offen
sive unit, how do they inter
cept' This is a fantasy.)"
