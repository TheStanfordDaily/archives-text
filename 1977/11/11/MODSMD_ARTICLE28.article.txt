# Allstetter, Melamed finish Stanford careers
## Soccer captains in last game for Cards 
### Dean Eyre 
Of the five seniors playing
their last soccer games for the
Farm this weekend, the ab
sence of two will be particu
larly felt next year.
Co-captains Bill Allstetter
and Jim Melamed both have
leadership ability, playing
skills and have witnessed the
growth of Stanford soccer over
the last four years.
There the similarities end.
While both have made equal
contributions to the team,
their paths and roles differ.
"I was recruited around the
Midwest and Illinois state
schools," said Melamed. "The
first year I came, only myself
and one other freshman made
the varsity."

"I had to find out from a
friend of my mother's who the
(Stanford) coach was and just
sent a letter to him and never
really heard much," said
Allstetter. "I just showed up
and said, 'Can I play?"
Melamed progressed rapidly
in the soccer program, partly
due to physical strength and
ability. "From the moment he
came here, he was a very
strong soccer player," said as
sistant coach Phil Wright. "His
assets are ball control and
mental ability."
"By his sophomore year, he
had taken a leadership posi
tion, and that's one of Jimmy's
greatest aspects. He's been in
valuable to the whole program
— I give him a large amount of

credit for taking us from 1-6 to
9-7."
In recalling the progress
made in Stanford soccer,
Melamed mentioned team
work as the key concept.
First impressions
"My initial impressions of
the team under Priddle was
that people were very, very in
dependent almost to the point
of being 'prima donnish.' Al
though I would say the skill,
technical level was comparable
to this team, the level of play
was nowhere near. The basic
difference is total team play
now."
While Melamed was receiv
ing advice from the varsity
coaching staff, Allstetter was
determined to stay with the
freshman team, despite a lack
of instruction.
"Billy went through two
years of incredible frustration
playing with literally no coach
ing," said Wright.
"I didn't have a concept of
the game," Allstetter said.
"Here you get contact with
players who are much better.
Vou start seeing things even
without coaches. I think just in
the last year and a half, I've re
ally gotten a whole lot more
feeling for the game, a concept
of it."
Since joining the varsity
squad two seasons ago, Allstet
ter has been on the rise. Yet,
even with more instruction and
conditioning, an important
element was missing — unity.
Esprit de corps
"The team spirit is much dif
ferent from when I (first)
played," Allstetter said.
"Somehow there's so much
more cohesiveness in the
group now. People are much
more concerned with the team

than with how they do (per
sonally)."
During the current season,
the contributions of the co
captains have helped the Car
dinals weather a 1-6 record.
"He (Allstetter) makes up tor
it (a lack of highly developed
technique) with work and in
credible desire," said Wright.
"He's a team leader, but for a
completely different reason
(than Melamed). He inspired
everybody because when it
came to practice the guy
worked — he was that sort of
inspirational player, able to
pull the team together."
Off and on the field Allstetter
and Melamed displayed confi
dence which didn't go un
noticed.
"Melamed gives our mid
field maturity," said Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge. "He is
the one that is the stabilizing
effect."
Came saver
Allstetter's defensive ability
has brought many sighs of re
lief to the team and Stanford
spectators, using his long
strides to stay ahead of oppos
ing forwards.
"Billy is tenacious on de
fense. I would consider he and
Melamed the best tacklers on
the team. I'm going to push for
Melamed for all-conference at
midfield and Billy for all
conference in the sweeper
position because of his speed
and ability to direct from be
hind."
Just as the coaching staff
recognizes the important func
tion of the team leaders, so do
the players realize the im
provement in soccer at Stan
ford because of the valuable
guidance of Lodge.
"He cares so much for the

team to do well — his en
thusiasm spreads," said
Allstetter. "Soccer is his life —
he loves the game. I really
know a philosophy for what
we're doing."
Lodge, the main man
Melamed concurred with
this description, adding, "One
thing he (Lodge) provides is a
real ball of energy at the center
of the Stanford soccer prog
ram.
As the final games of the sea
son draw nearer, reflections on
two fine soccer careers be
come more intense.
"During the season, you
spend so much time and effort
— when it's over there's going
to definitely be a hole," said
Allstetter. "I have to decide a
way tofill up where it'sgoingto
be vacated by the lack of Stan
ford soccer."
"If you characterize a soccer
player at Stanford and a lot of
other athletes, you feel like
you have devoted a tremend
ous amount of time and energy
to one pursuit," said Melamed.
"I don't think you're ever really
satisfied with your play."
Lodge summed up the feel
ings with his expectations for
Melamed and Allstetter.
"I am just interested in
making their Stanford soccer
experience valuable to them. !
want them to leave here as
people of the world, moving
forward and I want them to
look back and say, 'My soccer
experience at Stanford was fan
tastic.' And that's really impor
tant to me that they have that
feeling."
judging from the progress of
the team and the satisfaction
expressed by his team's co
captains, Lodge's expectations
are already met.

Senior |im Melamed prepares to blast the ball in a Stanford soccer
match earlier this fall. A Cardinal co-captain, Melamed plays in his
last two games for Stanford this weekend.
Of the five seniors playing
their last soccer games for the
Farm this weekend, the ab
sence of two will be particu
larly felt next year.
Co-captains Bill Allstetter
and Jim Melamed both have
leadership ability, playing
skills and have witnessed the
growth of Stanford soccer over
the last four years.
There the similarities end.
While both have made equal
contributions to the team,
their paths and roles differ.
"I was recruited around the
Midwest and Illinois state
schools," said Melamed. "The
first year I came, only myself
and one other freshman made
the varsity."

"I had to find out from a
friend of my mother's who the
(Stanford) coach was and just
sent a letter to him and never
really heard much," said
Allstetter. "I just showed up
and said, 'Can I play?"
Melamed progressed rapidly
in the soccer program, partly
due to physical strength and
ability. "From the moment he
came here, he was a very
strong soccer player," said as
sistant coach Phil Wright. "His
assets are ball control and
mental ability."
"By his sophomore year, he
had taken a leadership posi
tion, and that's one of Jimmy's
greatest aspects. He's been in
valuable to the whole program
— I give him a large amount of

credit for taking us from 1-6 to
9-7."
In recalling the progress
made in Stanford soccer,
Melamed mentioned team
work as the key concept.
First impressions
"My initial impressions of
the team under Priddle was
that people were very, very in
dependent almost to the point
of being 'prima donnish.' Al
though I would say the skill,
technical level was comparable
to this team, the level of play
was nowhere near. The basic
difference is total team play
now."
While Melamed was receiv
ing advice from the varsity
coaching staff, Allstetter was
determined to stay with the
freshman team, despite a lack
of instruction.
"Billy went through two
years of incredible frustration
playing with literally no coach
ing," said Wright.
"I didn't have a concept of
the game," Allstetter said.
"Here you get contact with
players who are much better.
Vou start seeing things even
without coaches. I think just in
the last year and a half, I've re
ally gotten a whole lot more
feeling for the game, a concept
of it."
Since joining the varsity
squad two seasons ago, Allstet
ter has been on the rise. Yet,
even with more instruction and
conditioning, an important
element was missing — unity.
Esprit de corps
"The team spirit is much dif
ferent from when I (first)
played," Allstetter said.
"Somehow there's so much
more cohesiveness in the
group now. People are much
more concerned with the team

than with how they do (per
sonally)."
During the current season,
the contributions of the co
captains have helped the Car
dinals weather a 1-6 record.
"He (Allstetter) makes up tor
it (a lack of highly developed
technique) with work and in
credible desire," said Wright.
"He's a team leader, but for a
completely different reason
(than Melamed). He inspired
everybody because when it
came to practice the guy
worked — he was that sort of
inspirational player, able to
pull the team together."
Off and on the field Allstetter
and Melamed displayed confi
dence which didn't go un
noticed.
"Melamed gives our mid
field maturity," said Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge. "He is
the one that is the stabilizing
effect."
Came saver
Allstetter's defensive ability
has brought many sighs of re
lief to the team and Stanford
spectators, using his long
strides to stay ahead of oppos
ing forwards.
"Billy is tenacious on de
fense. I would consider he and
Melamed the best tacklers on
the team. I'm going to push for
Melamed for all-conference at
midfield and Billy for all
conference in the sweeper
position because of his speed
and ability to direct from be
hind."
Just as the coaching staff
recognizes the important func
tion of the team leaders, so do
the players realize the im
provement in soccer at Stan
ford because of the valuable
guidance of Lodge.
"He cares so much for the

team to do well — his en
thusiasm spreads," said
Allstetter. "Soccer is his life —
he loves the game. I really
know a philosophy for what
we're doing."
Lodge, the main man
Melamed concurred with
this description, adding, "One
thing he (Lodge) provides is a
real ball of energy at the center
of the Stanford soccer prog
ram.
As the final games of the sea
son draw nearer, reflections on
two fine soccer careers be
come more intense.
"During the season, you
spend so much time and effort
— when it's over there's going
to definitely be a hole," said
Allstetter. "I have to decide a
way tofill up where it'sgoingto
be vacated by the lack of Stan
ford soccer."
"If you characterize a soccer
player at Stanford and a lot of
other athletes, you feel like
you have devoted a tremend
ous amount of time and energy
to one pursuit," said Melamed.
"I don't think you're ever really
satisfied with your play."
Lodge summed up the feel
ings with his expectations for
Melamed and Allstetter.
"I am just interested in
making their Stanford soccer
experience valuable to them. !
want them to leave here as
people of the world, moving
forward and I want them to
look back and say, 'My soccer
experience at Stanford was fan
tastic.' And that's really impor
tant to me that they have that
feeling."
judging from the progress of
the team and the satisfaction
expressed by his team's co
captains, Lodge's expectations
are already met.

Senior |im Melamed prepares to blast the ball in a Stanford soccer
match earlier this fall. A Cardinal co-captain, Melamed plays in his
last two games for Stanford this weekend.
Of the five seniors playing
their last soccer games for the
Farm this weekend, the ab
sence of two will be particu
larly felt next year.
Co-captains Bill Allstetter
and Jim Melamed both have
leadership ability, playing
skills and have witnessed the
growth of Stanford soccer over
the last four years.
There the similarities end.
While both have made equal
contributions to the team,
their paths and roles differ.
"I was recruited around the
Midwest and Illinois state
schools," said Melamed. "The
first year I came, only myself
and one other freshman made
the varsity."

"I had to find out from a
friend of my mother's who the
(Stanford) coach was and just
sent a letter to him and never
really heard much," said
Allstetter. "I just showed up
and said, 'Can I play?"
Melamed progressed rapidly
in the soccer program, partly
due to physical strength and
ability. "From the moment he
came here, he was a very
strong soccer player," said as
sistant coach Phil Wright. "His
assets are ball control and
mental ability."
"By his sophomore year, he
had taken a leadership posi
tion, and that's one of Jimmy's
greatest aspects. He's been in
valuable to the whole program
— I give him a large amount of

credit for taking us from 1-6 to
9-7."
In recalling the progress
made in Stanford soccer,
Melamed mentioned team
work as the key concept.
First impressions
"My initial impressions of
the team under Priddle was
that people were very, very in
dependent almost to the point
of being 'prima donnish.' Al
though I would say the skill,
technical level was comparable
to this team, the level of play
was nowhere near. The basic
difference is total team play
now."
While Melamed was receiv
ing advice from the varsity
coaching staff, Allstetter was
determined to stay with the
freshman team, despite a lack
of instruction.
"Billy went through two
years of incredible frustration
playing with literally no coach
ing," said Wright.
"I didn't have a concept of
the game," Allstetter said.
"Here you get contact with
players who are much better.
Vou start seeing things even
without coaches. I think just in
the last year and a half, I've re
ally gotten a whole lot more
feeling for the game, a concept
of it."
Since joining the varsity
squad two seasons ago, Allstet
ter has been on the rise. Yet,
even with more instruction and
conditioning, an important
element was missing — unity.
Esprit de corps
"The team spirit is much dif
ferent from when I (first)
played," Allstetter said.
"Somehow there's so much
more cohesiveness in the
group now. People are much
more concerned with the team

than with how they do (per
sonally)."
During the current season,
the contributions of the co
captains have helped the Car
dinals weather a 1-6 record.
"He (Allstetter) makes up tor
it (a lack of highly developed
technique) with work and in
credible desire," said Wright.
"He's a team leader, but for a
completely different reason
(than Melamed). He inspired
everybody because when it
came to practice the guy
worked — he was that sort of
inspirational player, able to
pull the team together."
Off and on the field Allstetter
and Melamed displayed confi
dence which didn't go un
noticed.
"Melamed gives our mid
field maturity," said Stanford
coach Nelson Lodge. "He is
the one that is the stabilizing
effect."
Came saver
Allstetter's defensive ability
has brought many sighs of re
lief to the team and Stanford
spectators, using his long
strides to stay ahead of oppos
ing forwards.
"Billy is tenacious on de
fense. I would consider he and
Melamed the best tacklers on
the team. I'm going to push for
Melamed for all-conference at
midfield and Billy for all
conference in the sweeper
position because of his speed
and ability to direct from be
hind."
Just as the coaching staff
recognizes the important func
tion of the team leaders, so do
the players realize the im
provement in soccer at Stan
ford because of the valuable
guidance of Lodge.
"He cares so much for the

team to do well — his en
thusiasm spreads," said
Allstetter. "Soccer is his life —
he loves the game. I really
know a philosophy for what
we're doing."
Lodge, the main man
Melamed concurred with
this description, adding, "One
thing he (Lodge) provides is a
real ball of energy at the center
of the Stanford soccer prog
ram.
As the final games of the sea
son draw nearer, reflections on
two fine soccer careers be
come more intense.
"During the season, you
spend so much time and effort
— when it's over there's going
to definitely be a hole," said
Allstetter. "I have to decide a
way tofill up where it'sgoingto
be vacated by the lack of Stan
ford soccer."
"If you characterize a soccer
player at Stanford and a lot of
other athletes, you feel like
you have devoted a tremend
ous amount of time and energy
to one pursuit," said Melamed.
"I don't think you're ever really
satisfied with your play."
Lodge summed up the feel
ings with his expectations for
Melamed and Allstetter.
"I am just interested in
making their Stanford soccer
experience valuable to them. !
want them to leave here as
people of the world, moving
forward and I want them to
look back and say, 'My soccer
experience at Stanford was fan
tastic.' And that's really impor
tant to me that they have that
feeling."
judging from the progress of
the team and the satisfaction
expressed by his team's co
captains, Lodge's expectations
are already met.
