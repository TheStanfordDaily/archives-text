# Oregon, WSU harriers chase Pac-8 title
## 
### Tom Simpson 
Many of the nation's finest
cross country runners will
gather for the Pacific-8
Championships/NCAA District
8 Qualifying at the Stanford
Golf Course, Saturday at 11
a.m. Five of the top 20 col
legiate teams as listed in Track
and Field News, including No.
2 Oregon and No. 4
Washington State, will partici
pate.
Henry Rono of Washing
State is a heavy favorite to win
his second consecutive Pac-8
crown. Last year, the diminu
tive Kenyan set the record for
Stanford's hilly 10,000 meter
course at 29:18.6. Rono is a
plucky runner, who blasts
competition away with an un
remitting pace.
The scramble behind Rono
should be fascinating. Samson
Kimwombwa of WSU, who last
summer broke David Bed
ford's 1973 10,000-meter world
record by running 27:30.47 in
Helsinki, Finland, and Steve

Scott of UC-lrvine, America's
finest 1500 meter runner, will
challenge Rono.
Since its beginning in 1969,
the Pacific-8 Championship
meet has drawn the nation's
top harriers. Old-timers main
tain that the first Pac-8 meet,
held at Stanford, was perhaps
the finest collegiate cross
country race ever.
WSU senior Gerry Lindgren,
who at 18 had run against and
beaten the Russian National
team in a track meet in Los
Angeles, was matched against
precocious Oregon freshman
Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine
had easily beaten Lindgren in a
dual meet two weeks before,
but at Stanford the runners
raced to a dead heat. Lindgren
later defeated Prefontaine at
the NCAA championships.
Prefontaine went on to lead
Oregon to Pac-8 crowns in
1970, 1971 and 1973, by captur
ing the individual title in each
of these meets. In 1972, with
Prefontaine in training for the

Olympics, the first of WSU's
crop of Kenyans, John Ngeno,
captured the Pac-8 title in Seat
tle, and helped WSU secure its
first championship.
The six-mile record estab
lished by Lindgren and Prefon
taine in 1969 was broken by
Prefontaine in 1973, as he ran
28:05.4. Ngeno later broke Pre
fontaine's mark, winning his
second Pac-8 crown in 1974 in
27:37.6.
The 1969 and 1970 seasons
were the "glory years" of Stan
ford cross country, marked by
the presence of Greg Brock,
Don Kardong and Duncan
McDonald. Brock captured
third in the Pac-8 in 1970, with
Mac Donald ninth. Kardong
finished seventh that year in
the Pac-8, and then went on to
finish third in the NCAA
championships, which indi
cated the quality of competi
tion in the Pac-8 meet.
In 1976 the course length was
changed to the current 10,000
meters, and the meet, now

permanently established at the
Stanford Golf Course, was
combined with the District 8
Qualifying Meet. Fifteen teams
are expected to compete on
Saturday for the four NCAA
team berths.
Despite the fact that Oregon
defeated WSU in the Pac-8
Northern Division Champion
ships Oct. 29, Stanford coach
Marshall Clark rates WSU a
slight favorite in this year's
meet. Oregon and WSU are
shoe-ins for NCAA berths, but
there will be a dogfight for the
final two spots.
Challengers
UC-lrvine, with Scott and
Ralph Serna, and Washington,
with Bill Stolp, look to be the
frontrunners for the open
spots. They are rated seventh
and eleventh in the nation, re
spectively, by Track and Field
News. Fresno State, Cal and
Stanford, however, cannot be
counted out.
"We're happy with the
team's progress and have a

positive attitude towards the
race," said Clark. Roy Kissin
and Jerry Emory were singled
out by Clark as having a good
chance to qualify for the NCAA
meet. Kissin has been Stan
ford's top runner all year, and
could easily be among the top
10 finishers Saturday. Emory
qualified for the NCAA meet
last year, and has lately been
coming around to form.
The scrambling horde be
hind Rono will probably be led
by WSU freshman Joel
Cheruiyot; 1975 Pac-8 champ
ion Joshua Kimet of WSU;
Kimombwa; Alberto Salzarand
Rudy Chapa of Oregon; Scott
and Serna of Irvine; Stolp of
Washington, and Kissin of
Stanford. The first four runners
who are not on teams which
qualify for the NCAA meet, re
ceive individual berths.
To see Saturday's race, turn
right off Junipero Serra onto
Fremont and go just beyond
the Big Red Barn to the second
tee.

course at 29:18.6. Rono is a
plucky runner, who blasts
competition away with an un
remitting pace.
The scramble behind Rono
should be fascinating. Samson
Kimwombwa of WSU, who last
summer broke David Bed
ford's 1973 10,000-meter world
record by running 27:30.47 in
Helsinki, Finland, and Steve

Scott of UC-lrvine, America's
finest 1500 meter runner, will
challenge Rono.
Since its beginning in 1969,
the Pacific-8 Championship
meet has drawn the nation's
top harriers. Old-timers main
tain that the first Pac-8 meet,
held at Stanford, was perhaps
the finest collegiate cross
country race ever.
WSU senior Gerry Lindgren,
who at 18 had run against and
beaten the Russian National
team in a track meet in Los
Angeles, was matched against
precocious Oregon freshman
Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine
had easily beaten Lindgren in a
dual meet two weeks before,
but at Stanford the runners
raced to a dead heat. Lindgren
later defeated Prefontaine at
the NCAA championships.
Prefontaine went on to lead
Oregon to Pac-8 crowns in
1970, 1971 and 1973, by captur
ing the individual title in each
of these meets. In 1972, with
Prefontaine in training for the

Olympics, the first of WSU's
crop of Kenyans, John Ngeno,
captured the Pac-8 title in Seat
tle, and helped WSU secure its
first championship.
The six-mile record estab
lished by Lindgren and Prefon
taine in 1969 was broken by
Prefontaine in 1973, as he ran
28:05.4. Ngeno later broke Pre
fontaine's mark, winning his
second Pac-8 crown in 1974 in
27:37.6.
The 1969 and 1970 seasons
were the "glory years" of Stan
ford cross country, marked by
the presence of Greg Brock,
Don Kardong and Duncan
McDonald. Brock captured
third in the Pac-8 in 1970, with
Mac Donald ninth. Kardong
finished seventh that year in
the Pac-8, and then went on to
finish third in the NCAA
championships, which indi
cated the quality of competi
tion in the Pac-8 meet.
In 1976 the course length was
changed to the current 10,000
meters, and the meet, now

permanently established at the
Stanford Golf Course, was
combined with the District 8
Qualifying Meet. Fifteen teams
are expected to compete on
Saturday for the four NCAA
team berths.
Despite the fact that Oregon
defeated WSU in the Pac-8
Northern Division Champion
ships Oct. 29, Stanford coach
Marshall Clark rates WSU a
slight favorite in this year's
meet. Oregon and WSU are
shoe-ins for NCAA berths, but
there will be a dogfight for the
final two spots.
Challengers
UC-lrvine, with Scott and
Ralph Serna, and Washington,
with Bill Stolp, look to be the
frontrunners for the open
spots. They are rated seventh
and eleventh in the nation, re
spectively, by Track and Field
News. Fresno State, Cal and
Stanford, however, cannot be
counted out.
"We're happy with the
team's progress and have a

positive attitude towards the
race," said Clark. Roy Kissin
and Jerry Emory were singled
out by Clark as having a good
chance to qualify for the NCAA
meet. Kissin has been Stan
ford's top runner all year, and
could easily be among the top
10 finishers Saturday. Emory
qualified for the NCAA meet
last year, and has lately been
coming around to form.
The scrambling horde be
hind Rono will probably be led
by WSU freshman Joel
Cheruiyot; 1975 Pac-8 champ
ion Joshua Kimet of WSU;
Kimombwa; Alberto Salzarand
Rudy Chapa of Oregon; Scott
and Serna of Irvine; Stolp of
Washington, and Kissin of
Stanford. The first four runners
who are not on teams which
qualify for the NCAA meet, re
ceive individual berths.
To see Saturday's race, turn
right off Junipero Serra onto
Fremont and go just beyond
the Big Red Barn to the second
tee.
Many of the nation's finest

top harriers. Old-timers main
tain that the first Pac-8 meet,
held at Stanford, was perhaps
the finest collegiate cross
country race ever.
WSU senior Gerry Lindgren,
who at 18 had run against and
beaten the Russian National
team in a track meet in Los
Angeles, was matched against
precocious Oregon freshman
Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine
had easily beaten Lindgren in a
dual meet two weeks before,
but at Stanford the runners
raced to a dead heat. Lindgren
later defeated Prefontaine at
the NCAA championships.
Prefontaine went on to lead
Oregon to Pac-8 crowns in
1970, 1971 and 1973, by captur
ing the individual title in each
of these meets. In 1972, with
Prefontaine in training for the

Olympics, the first of WSU's
crop of Kenyans, John Ngeno,
captured the Pac-8 title in Seat
tle, and helped WSU secure its
first championship.
The six-mile record estab
lished by Lindgren and Prefon
taine in 1969 was broken by
Prefontaine in 1973, as he ran
28:05.4. Ngeno later broke Pre
fontaine's mark, winning his
second Pac-8 crown in 1974 in
27:37.6.
The 1969 and 1970 seasons
were the "glory years" of Stan
ford cross country, marked by
the presence of Greg Brock,
Don Kardong and Duncan
McDonald. Brock captured
third in the Pac-8 in 1970, with
Mac Donald ninth. Kardong
finished seventh that year in
the Pac-8, and then went on to
finish third in the NCAA
championships, which indi
cated the quality of competi
tion in the Pac-8 meet.
In 1976 the course length was
changed to the current 10,000
meters, and the meet, now

permanently established at the
Stanford Golf Course, was
combined with the District 8
Qualifying Meet. Fifteen teams
are expected to compete on
Saturday for the four NCAA
team berths.
Despite the fact that Oregon
defeated WSU in the Pac-8
Northern Division Champion
ships Oct. 29, Stanford coach
Marshall Clark rates WSU a
slight favorite in this year's
meet. Oregon and WSU are
shoe-ins for NCAA berths, but
there will be a dogfight for the
final two spots.
Challengers
UC-lrvine, with Scott and
Ralph Serna, and Washington,
with Bill Stolp, look to be the
frontrunners for the open
spots. They are rated seventh
and eleventh in the nation, re
spectively, by Track and Field
News. Fresno State, Cal and
Stanford, however, cannot be
counted out.
"We're happy with the
team's progress and have a

positive attitude towards the
race," said Clark. Roy Kissin
and Jerry Emory were singled
out by Clark as having a good
chance to qualify for the NCAA
meet. Kissin has been Stan
ford's top runner all year, and
could easily be among the top
10 finishers Saturday. Emory
qualified for the NCAA meet
last year, and has lately been
coming around to form.
The scrambling horde be
hind Rono will probably be led
by WSU freshman Joel
Cheruiyot; 1975 Pac-8 champ
ion Joshua Kimet of WSU;
Kimombwa; Alberto Salzarand
Rudy Chapa of Oregon; Scott
and Serna of Irvine; Stolp of
Washington, and Kissin of
Stanford. The first four runners
who are not on teams which
qualify for the NCAA meet, re
ceive individual berths.
To see Saturday's race, turn
right off Junipero Serra onto
Fremont and go just beyond
the Big Red Barn to the second
tee.
Many of the nation's finest
cross country runners will
gather for the Pacific-8
Championships/NCAA District
8 Qualifying at the Stanford
Golf Course, Saturday at 11
a.m. Five of the top 20 col
legiate teams as listed in Track
and Field News, including No.
2 Oregon and No. 4
Washington State, will partici
pate.
Henry Rono of Washing
State is a heavy favorite to win
his second consecutive Pac-8
crown. Last year, the diminu
tive Kenyan set the record for
Stanford's hilly 10,000 meter
course at 29:18.6. Rono is a
plucky runner, who blasts
competition away with an un
remitting pace.
The scramble behind Rono
should be fascinating. Samson
Kimwombwa of WSU, who last
summer broke David Bed
ford's 1973 10,000-meter world
record by running 27:30.47 in
Helsinki, Finland, and Steve

Scott of UC-lrvine, America's
finest 1500 meter runner, will
challenge Rono.
