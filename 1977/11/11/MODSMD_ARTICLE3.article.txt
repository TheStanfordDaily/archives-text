# Special office aids in securing patents for campus inventors

### Barbie Fields 
The Office of Technology Licens
ing (OTL) here has reported $1.3 mill
ion in gross licensing income since
its inception in 1970.
The OTL is responsible for deter
mining if an invention by a member
of the University community is mar
ketable and patentable, negotiating
licenses and securing patent rights
for people associated with the Uni
versity.
Over $750,000 of it's income has
been distributed back to inventors,
their departments, and the General
Fund according to Niels Reimers, di
rector of OTL.
"The main function of the OTL is to
bridge the gap from research to utili
zation," said Reimers. "We have four
to six inventions that come through
this office every month. But only
about 50 license agreements have
been signed from 1970 to the pre
sent. That works out to eight per cent
of all invention disclosures resulting
in successful licenses," he said.
"So far the OTL has generated all

of its own money for administration
without benefit of the big hit," said
Reimers. (A big hit is a major royalty
generating invention.) This is sig
nificant because most comparable
university licensing offices don't
even break even unless they have
had a big hit.
"You try to meet expenses and
hope for the occasional big hit which
justifies all further efforts. Most
other universities that have 'made it'
did so on one or two big hits. Florida
State has Gator Ade; Indiana has
stannous fluoride; Wisconsin has
Vitamin D. There's always that poten
tial here. I think we should have
something within five years," said
Reimers.
TheOTL.'s "Seventh Annual Report
for 1975-76" states that "the majority
of licensed income received to date
has been from advancing payments
rather than earned royalties based on
sales."
Reimers estimated that one in 100
projects makes it through the de
velopment phasewithin industry and

often it takes years for the product to
reach the market and generate
'earned royalties.'
"Undeveloped technology is risky
by nature," he said. "Our job is to
convince companies to make the ini
tial advanced payment to the Univer
sity for the right to produce a mar
ketable project or invention."
Many inventions that do make it
are in the medical field. The fluores
cence activated cell sorter was de
veloped in 1971 by Dr. Leonard Her
zenberg, professor of genetics here,
and his associates. It is now pro
duced commercially for research
use.
Patents may play an important role
in selling an invention to a company
besides generating an added income
for the University. "Last year Stan
ford obtained $300,000 in patent
royalties," said Reimers. "Also pa
tents insure exclusive development
and production for 17 years to a
company," he said.
"Contrary to the belief by Ralph
Nader and other consumer action
groups, a patent spurs more research
and invention. It rarely creates a
monopoly situation because it chal
lenges people to invent a better way
of obtaining an objective," he ad
ded.
"There are over 28,000 unused pa
tents that the government has ac
cumulated mainly due to a lack of
incentive in developing them," said
Reimers.
Reimers acknowledged that scien
tists with licenses or patents ar
ranged by OTL have an edge when it
comes to drawing salary increases
within the University.

mining if an invention by a member
of the University community is mar
ketable and patentable, negotiating
licenses and securing patent rights
for people associated with the Uni
versity.
Over $750,000 of it's income has
been distributed back to inventors,
their departments, and the General
Fund according to Niels Reimers, di
rector of OTL.
"The main function of the OTL is to
bridge the gap from research to utili
zation," said Reimers. "We have four
to six inventions that come through
this office every month. But only
about 50 license agreements have
been signed from 1970 to the pre
sent. That works out to eight per cent
of all invention disclosures resulting
in successful licenses," he said.
"So far the OTL has generated all

of its own money for administration
without benefit of the big hit," said
Reimers. (A big hit is a major royalty
generating invention.) This is sig
nificant because most comparable
university licensing offices don't
even break even unless they have
had a big hit.
"You try to meet expenses and
hope for the occasional big hit which
justifies all further efforts. Most
other universities that have 'made it'
did so on one or two big hits. Florida
State has Gator Ade; Indiana has
stannous fluoride; Wisconsin has
Vitamin D. There's always that poten
tial here. I think we should have
something within five years," said
Reimers.
TheOTL.'s "Seventh Annual Report
for 1975-76" states that "the majority
of licensed income received to date
has been from advancing payments
rather than earned royalties based on
sales."
Reimers estimated that one in 100
projects makes it through the de
velopment phasewithin industry and

often it takes years for the product to
reach the market and generate
'earned royalties.'
"Undeveloped technology is risky
by nature," he said. "Our job is to
convince companies to make the ini
tial advanced payment to the Univer
sity for the right to produce a mar
ketable project or invention."
Many inventions that do make it
are in the medical field. The fluores
cence activated cell sorter was de
veloped in 1971 by Dr. Leonard Her
zenberg, professor of genetics here,
and his associates. It is now pro
duced commercially for research
use.
Patents may play an important role
in selling an invention to a company
besides generating an added income
for the University. "Last year Stan
ford obtained $300,000 in patent
royalties," said Reimers. "Also pa
tents insure exclusive development
and production for 17 years to a
company," he said.
"Contrary to the belief by Ralph
Nader and other consumer action
groups, a patent spurs more research
and invention. It rarely creates a
monopoly situation because it chal
lenges people to invent a better way
of obtaining an objective," he ad
ded.
"There are over 28,000 unused pa
tents that the government has ac
cumulated mainly due to a lack of
incentive in developing them," said
Reimers.
Reimers acknowledged that scien
tists with licenses or patents ar
ranged by OTL have an edge when it
comes to drawing salary increases
within the University.
The Office of Technology Licens
ing (OTL) here has reported $1.3 mill
ion in gross licensing income since
its inception in 1970.

mining if an invention by a member
