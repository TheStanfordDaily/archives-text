# Stanford poloists set for weekend matches
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
Stanford water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti will have a
homecoming, of sorts, today
when the Cardinals travel to
UC-Santa Barbara for the first
of two non-conference games
this weekend. Tomorrow at
deCuerre the poloists take on
San Jose State in an 11 a.m.
game.
Dettamanti, who coached at
Santa Barbara for three years
before coming to Stanford last
spring, said he was a little wor
ried about today's contest.
"Santa Barbara has improved
a lot this year," Dettamanti
said. "We're going to have to
guard against letting down
when we play them. They really
have the incentive to beat us
and they could give us a tough
game."
One factor that could make
the game closer, according to
Dettamanti, is the unavailabil
ity of sophomore Randy Kal
bus, who must take a mid-term
today.
"Not having Randy could
hurt us in mobility and strength

off the bench," Dettamanti
said.
Last time these two teams
met was in Stanford's first
game this season, which the
Cards won by four goals. Since
then, Santa Barbara has beaten
UCLA, USC and Long Beach
State and very narrowly de
feated by Pepperdine, the
fourth-ranked team in the na
tion.
UCSB is led by Ail-American
Greg Boyer and 6-foot-5 goalie
Clint Doan. Both, said De
ttamanti, are excellent water
polo players.
Saturday's game against San
lose State should be one of the
Cards' easier ones, Dettamanti
said.
"I really don't expect any
problems," he said. "San Jose
State is at a rebuilding point
and are not really a threat."
The Cards' record stands at
15-2 with only one more game
left to play after this weekend,
a home game with California
next Saturday which will de
cide the seeding for the na
tionals, held Nov. 26 and 27.
