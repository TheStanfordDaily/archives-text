Israel regrets civilian casualties
Jerusalem — Israel expressed regret yesterday for civi
lian casualties in its reprisal raid on southern Lebanon
but still defended the operation. It also welcomed Egyp
tian movement toward peace talks.
In Washington, President jimmy Carter declined to
condemn Israel, telling a news conterence: "It the pro
vocation was absent, the retaliation would have been
unnecessary."
Carter said, "The bloodshed in my opinion will not be
stopped until the nations are willing to negotiate, ad
ding that the Mideast "is teetering on another outbreak
of violence."
Prime Minister Menahem Begin, discussing the heavy
civilian toll among the more than 100 dead and 150 in
jured in Israel's bombing and strafing raid Wednesday,
told reporters, "we regret it very deeply.
But Begin, who summoned U.S. Ambassador Samuel
Lewis to his office to convey the message, added, "we
do not apologize for the operation itself.'
The southern Lebanese conflict that exploded in Is
raeli air strikes across the border Wednesday is a fester
ing remnant of the civil war that ended one year ago.
But the root source ol the conflict goes back a decade
when southern Lebanon became a base for Palestinian
guerrillas to launch terrorist raids against the jewish
state.
Before the 1975-7b civil war, the Palestinians launched
scores of raids across Israel's northern border, prompt
ing retaliatory air strikes on Lebanese territory. The
I ebanese army, never a formidable fighting force, occa
sionally clashed with the guerrillas but were unable to
curb the growing Palestinian resistance movement in
the country during the early 19705.
The recent cross-border foray was aimed at Palestinian
strongholds anci was Israel's reply to guerrilla rocket
attacks on an Israeli town that killed three civilians.
Lebanon said Israel was guilty of "overt aggression
and would bring up the matter in the U.N. Security
Council.
The U.S. envoy in Jerusalem said the LJnited States
also was "deeply concerned" about Wednesday's
casualties and is "urging all parties to exercise maximum
restraint."
The ambassador said the United States was making
efforts to reinstate the six-week-old truce in Lebanon
and have Palestinian torces withdraw from the border
area.
Progress towards full employment hill
Washin«ton — President Jimmy Carter, moving toward

public endorsement of a compromise "lull employ
ment" bill, said yesterday that federal jobs programs will
begin having their full impact early next year.
Carter told a nationally broadcast news conference
the battle against seven per cent unemployment, the
current level, is "a tedious, slow process," but one he
viewed with optimism.
The president also said he expects to announce
"within the next lew days" his backing tor a compromise
Humphrey-Hawkins jobs bill that would underscore his
belief that "every person in our country that is able to
work ought to have an opportunity for a job."
Administration sources said the bill would fix a goal of
four per cent unemployment within five years, without
mandating specific steps to bring that about. The com
promise also would require the president to report to
Congress periodically on eftorts to reach the tour per
cent objective.
Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr. (D-N.J.), chairman of the
Senate Human Resources Committee which will con
sider the bill next year, said "the level of cooperation
between the president and the sponsors ot the original
bill is a major turning point in the battle to restore the
nation's economic vitality.
