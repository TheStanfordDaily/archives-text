## Stadium will get new track 
### Bruce Anderson 
The asphalt track which rings the
tootball field in Stanford Stadium will
be replaced by a new $200,000 Tartan
track at the end of football season,
the Athletic Department announced
yesterday.
Theall-weathersynthetic surface is
scheduled to be installed by Jan. 31.
"The new track will greatly en
hance competitors' performances
and spectator enjoyment at our
home meets," track coach Payton
Jordan said. "It will be one of, it not
the, finest track facilities in the Un
ited States."
The new surface will be installed as
a 400-meter track, with eight lanes on

the straightaways and seven around
the curves. The track will be bright
red with white lane markings and
trim.
All jump runways will also be re
surfaced with the red Tartan, the
high jump pad will be enlarged and
the steeplechase pit will be redone
with Tartan leading off the track to
the barrier and from the jump back to
the track.
Jordan said, "I have to feel it will
improve our performances." He
explained that the inside lane will be
surfaced with larger granules than
the other lanes and will be sealed
differently.

This will allow distance runners to
practice on the track without damag
ing their legs, something that
couldn't happen on the old surface.
The other lanes will have smaller
granules and will be sealed more
tightly, allowing sprinters and
hurdlers to get added speed.
"It's been proven to be the best
running surface available," Jordan
said. "It also has the greatest longev
ity, and it can be patched selectively
rather than completely redone."
"From the spectator's
standpoint," Jordan added, "the
track will be one of the finest and
most beautiful facilities in the coun
try."
The Tartan track will replace a sur
face which is a rubber-asphalt synth
etic mix installed in 1969.
The present surface has drawn ex
tensive criticism in the last several
years. Complaints came from
athletes who hurt themselves train
ing on the track and from visiting
athletes who were at times tripped
up by the asphalt surface.
Two years ago USC half-miler
Rayfield Beaton attributed a loss to
California's James Robinson, after
the duo had matched strides down
the final straightaway, to a raised lane
divider.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz said the
new track will be financed by gifts to
the Athletic Department.
"The department now has $120,000
in hand in gift funds specifically re
stricted to this project," Ruetz said.
"We'll be seeking the other $80,000
in additional donations from those
interested in our track program. We
intend to undertake the project
without complete funding on the as
sumption that gift support will help
us cover our total expenses."
The new track will reportedly also
be open for use by faculty, staff and
students for limited recreational
running.
Construction is scheduled to
begin Nov. 21, two days after the Big
Came.
