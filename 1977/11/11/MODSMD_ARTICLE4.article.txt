# Commoner attacks energy plan

Noted environmentalist Barry Commoner at
tacked President Carter's energy plan and private
profiteering by the energy industry as barriers to a
solution of our energy woes before a crowd at
Kresge Auditorium last night.
Commoner, a professor of environmental sci
ence at Washington University in St. Louis, said
the basic problem lies in the use of nonrenewable
and capital intensive sources for our energy sup
ply.
Energy is the essential element that fuels our
economy and when inevitable scarcity drives the
price of nonrenewable sources up, the economy
as a whole suffers severely, he said. However,
Commoner added, capital intensive industries are
highly profitable for their owners.
The rapid rise of costs creates a bad investment
climate and capital intensive technologies waste
resources that could go to other needy sectors of
the economy, he said. Not only business, but con
sumers, especially the poor, suffer, he contended.
Carter's plan concentrates on these nonrenew
able and capital intensive sources, according to
Commoner. Over half our new demand for energy

will be met by coal and 23 per cent from nuclear,
he said. "Carter's plan doesn't solve the energy
crisis, it worsens it," said Commoner.
Since coal is nonrenewable, Commoner said he
reasons that the president's policy must really
point towards breeder reactors. He said the text of
Carter's plan contains a line inferring present
breeder programs have been cancelled in favor of
developing new ones.
He quoted energy chief James Schlesinger as
saying, "nuclear power is enshrined in the presi
dent's program."
Commoner said he sees solar power as the logi
cal direction for U.S. energy policy. But since the
concentrated political clout of the utilities could
not stand under a solar power policy, he said we
must move away from capitalist foundations that
caused the problem in the first place and make
energy decisions for the good of the public, and
not private industry.
Also speaking with Commoner was Amory Lo
vins, a consulting physicist for Friends of the Earth,
Inc. in London. He said the solution to our energy
problems lies in the use of what he calls soft
energy.

Hard energy, Lovins said, is the nonrenewable,
capital intensive sources Commoner referred to.
Opposed to this is Lovins' soft energy renewable,
small scale, "backyard" type energy sources that
could take care of most of our needs.
Lovins said he sees several advantages to using
soft energy. Hard technology would require more
regulatory agencies, more bureaucracy, and more
power centralized in large corporations, he said,
while soft technology would give energy policy
back to cities and states.
It would also fit energy source to energy use,
and hence greatly decrease our waste, he con
tinued. Soft technology would be environmentally
safer, and being labor intensive, would decrease
unemployment and be a blessing for the Third
World, he asserted.
Lovins said he also sees reduced use of nuclear
and other expensive energy sources as having a
stabilizing effect on the international scene. Fewer
reactors would mean fewer nuclear weapons and
an oil import reduction would cut U.S. trade de
ficits and possibly America's need to sell weapons
overseas.
Lovins suggested, "The best form of Mideast
arms control might be American roof insulation."
