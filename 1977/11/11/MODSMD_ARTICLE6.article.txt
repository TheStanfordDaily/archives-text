Tuition and lees may be increased
next year by an estimated 9.4 per
cent, Provost William Miller told the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
Tuition will rise by similar amounts
in subsequent years, Miller said,
based on the underlying assumption
that tuition will grow at about the
same rate as national income.
Faculty salaries will increase by
one to two per cent more than the
Consumer Price Index for the next
few years. According to Miller, the
University is gaining on the CPI and
other institutions.
He said faculty here enjoy a higher
salary level than those at most other
institutions. He emphasized, how
ever, that the higher cost of housing
in the Bay Area is a problem.
Library acquisition expenses will
be growing at a fairly high rate, ac
cording to Miller. Next year the lib
rary expense will go up by 10 per cent
more than the CPI.
President Richard Lyman said that
in view of rapidly rising tuition costs,
society as a whole must make up its
mind about the funding of private
institutions.

He said that while high cost may
drive off some students, too much
cost-cutting may hurt the quality of
education here, lowering the Uni
versity's attractiveness.
At present, Miller said, the Univer
sity hangs in a delicate balance.
There are external forces working
against budgetary equilibrium and
the University must push back, he
said.
He said, however, that deficits will
not be a problem for the next few
years, giving the University time to
adjust.
Lyman said he is planning to ap
point an administrative panel with
some faculty representation to study
the effects of mandatory retirement
legislation now before Congress. He
was cautious, however, emphasizing
that he did not want to take any im
mediate action that might prove
harmful.
The senate's only action was to
remove "in the year of our Lord"
from the wording of University dip
lomas. The wording has been the
source of complaints in previous
years.
