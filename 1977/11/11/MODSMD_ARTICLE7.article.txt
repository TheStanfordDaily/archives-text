# An analytic comparison
## The 						'Irgun' and the PLO 
### 
Moshe Aelion

When I was appointed as a Daily
columnist, I vowed to myself not to
write about the Arab-Israeli conflict.
First ot all, I thought, so much is con
stantly being written on it; and sec
ondly, I should write about the prob
lems and concerns of the graduate
students, the science and engineer
ing students, the married students
and the foreign students. I belong to
all these groups, and they are usually
underrepresented in the Daily
pages.
I succeeded in keeping my vow for
one article. But this week, after read
ing Mr. Abu-Helu's article (Daily,
Nov. 7 and 8), I could hold myself no
longer. There exists a well-known
propaganda rule, which I think is due
to Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda
minister. It states: "No matter how
gross or absurd is the lie you wish to
get across, if you repeat it enough
times, people will start thinking
there is some truth in it."
I am not going to engage in de
tailed refutations of the assertions in
Mr. Abu-Helu's article. Anyone pos
sessing even a superficial knowledge
of the history of the Middle East
could easily do that.
Transparent lies
Let me just point out the most
transparent lies: 1) Arabic is a foreign
language for the Palestinians; 2)
Arabs are second class citizens in Is
rael; 3) Israel has been an Arab land
for the whole of its recorded history;
4) The Arab Jews enjoyed equal rights
in the Arab states; 5) Arab Jews fled
the Arab states because of Israeli
promises; 6) Israel burned the Al-
Aqsa mosque; 7) Israel had de
stroyed thousands ot Arab villages
(why not millions?). . . .
I could go on and on, but I am
afraid the reader is getting bored.
The "Irgun" was the main
treedom-fighting Jewish under
ground in Israel while the country
was under the British imperialist
rule, during the years 1937-1948. The
PLO is the umbrella organization of
the Arab terrorist groups.
Recent history
Let us delve for a while into recent
history and consider several typical
operations ot the Irgun and the PLO.
On May 4, 1947, the Irgun
launched the most famous com
mando attack in the history of Israel's
struggle for independence. It was
against the Acre Fortress, where
many underground fighters were
serving jail terms as political prison
ers. The fortress was in the midst of a
British military complex, and was
considered impenetrable.
The attack was successful, and the
prisoners were freed. The comman
der of the operation and several
other Irgun commando were killed.
On July 22, 1946, the Irgun blew up
the British Military Headquarters in
Israel, at the Jerusalem King David
Hotel. Officials later admitted receiv
ing warning phone calls, requesting
them to evacuate the building. The
British Officer in charge refused to
believe the Irgun could penetrate the
elaborate security measures, and
chose to treat the call as a hoax.
There were heavy casualties among
British military personnel.
The Irgun never attacked the civi
lian population, be it British or Arab.
Shortly betore each operation, the
Irgun command took great care to
intorm the civilian population about
what was going to happen.
In 1948, all the surrounding Arab
states invaded the newly born State
of Israel with the expressed aim of
committing genocide — purifying
the state from the Jews. The Irgun

joined the Israeli Defense Forces,
Zairal. Irgun units fought in Jaffa and
in the battle for Jerusalem.
A most treacherous battle occur
red at Deir-Yassin, a town which
governed one of the access roads to
the Holy City. As an Arab eye-witness
recounts the story in the Jordanian
paper Al-Urdun (Amman, February
19580): "A small truck appeared,
which had loudspeakers mounted
over it. It warned the townspeople
about the impending battle. It was
greeted with a hail of bullets. About
400 people left the town before the
battle started. The battle involved
house to house skirmishes, the kind
which inflicts many casualties on
both sides. The Irgun soldiers finally
succeeded in taking the town. There
were more than a hundred Arab
casualties."
The Irgun command later issued a
statement regretting the casualties
inflicted on the civilian population,
noting that whenever a battle is
fought in an urban area, these are
bound to occur.
PLO operations
Let us consider now several typical
PLO operations.
On Nov. 26,1971, the prime minis
ter of Jordan, Wasfi Tal, was assassi
nated in Cairo.
On May 30, 1972, 27 civilians were
killed with 80 wounded, in the arri
vals lounge of Lod Airport. Most of
the victims were Puerto Rican pil
grims.
On Sept. 5,1972,11 Israeli athletes
were murdered in the Munich
Olympic Games, an event which
should have symbolized friendship
among mankind.
On May 15, 1974, PLO terrorists
massacred 25 high school students at
Maalot, Israel.
The pattern, in these two accounts
of the Irgun and PLO operations, is
clear. The Irgun was an underground
of freedom fighters. They fought
against a foreign, imperialist power
— the British occupation forces.
They never targeted an operation
against civilians, Arab or British.
Zeev Jabotinsky, the spiritual
leader of the Irgun, wrote in a poem
(1920) concerning his dream about
Israel: "There they will live, in aban
dance and happiness, the son of
Arabia, the son of Nazareth (meaning
the Christians), and my son (the
Jews)."
In contrast, the PLO is a murder
organization. It is even worse than
the Baader-Meinhof gang in many
respects. Its stated purpose is not so
cial — it is genocide. It has one ad
vantage over the' Baader-Meinhof
gang — it is financed by the oil
sheiks.
As former PLO chairman Ahmed
Shukeiri said (Palestinian docu
ments, 1967), "The Jews came by the
sea and will return by the sea." Or, as
Yassir Arafat said in an interview with
B. Jordan (Daily Mail, Jan. 14, 1969),
"They are going upcountry tomor
row. They have simple orders: kill
Jews. We don't care whether the
dead are civilians or soldiers as long
as they are Jews." Apparently, the
PLO terrorists do take care not to
tackle Jewish soldiers.
Conclusions
You may ask, Mr. Abu-Helu, what
are the conclusions to be drawn from
all of this. As Chairman Mao once
said, "The guerilla fighter is like a
, fish. If the people support him, he is
like a fish in the ocean. The enemy
will never get him. If the people do
not support him, he is like a fish
without water. He is dead."
The Irgun was supported by the

Jewish people in Israel. The Viet
Cong was supported by large parts of
the population in South Vietnam.
The PLO is not supported by the Is
raeli Arab population, including
those living in Judea and Samaria.
All PLO operations have been ex
ternal, initiated from outside the
country. In the words ot Chairman
Mao, it is a dead fish. It is kept alive
by Saudi money and the political
support of the communist bloc in the
U.N.
Why doesn't the PLO have a grass
roots Arab support in Israel? The
reason is that it is a murder organiza
tion, not a genuine guerrilla organiza
tion. PLO actions will only worsen
the situation of the Arab refugees. An
Arab state already exists in Palestine:
the State of Jordan.
If I were a Palestinian, Mr. Abu-
Helu, I would disavow any support
for the PLO. The only way to end the
suffering of the Arab refugees is to
try and heal the wounds; to engage
in constructive settlement prog
rams; to try and solve the conflict.
More terror will only mean more
grief and misery for everyone in
volved.

Conclusions
You may ask, Mr. Abu-Helu, what
are the conclusions to be drawn from
all of this. As Chairman Mao once
said, "The guerilla fighter is like a
, fish. If the people support him, he is
like a fish in the ocean. The enemy
will never get him. If the people do
not support him, he is like a fish
without water. He is dead."
The Irgun was supported by the

Jewish people in Israel. The Viet
Cong was supported by large parts of
the population in South Vietnam.
The PLO is not supported by the Is
raeli Arab population, including
those living in Judea and Samaria.
All PLO operations have been ex
ternal, initiated from outside the
country. In the words ot Chairman
Mao, it is a dead fish. It is kept alive
by Saudi money and the political
support of the communist bloc in the
U.N.
Why doesn't the PLO have a grass
roots Arab support in Israel? The
reason is that it is a murder organiza
tion, not a genuine guerrilla organiza
tion. PLO actions will only worsen
the situation of the Arab refugees. An
Arab state already exists in Palestine:
the State of Jordan.
If I were a Palestinian, Mr. Abu-
Helu, I would disavow any support
for the PLO. The only way to end the
suffering of the Arab refugees is to
try and heal the wounds; to engage
in constructive settlement prog
rams; to try and solve the conflict.
More terror will only mean more
grief and misery for everyone in
volved.

Transparent lies
Let me just point out the most
transparent lies: 1) Arabic is a foreign
language for the Palestinians; 2)
Arabs are second class citizens in Is
rael; 3) Israel has been an Arab land
for the whole of its recorded history;
4) The Arab Jews enjoyed equal rights
in the Arab states; 5) Arab Jews fled
the Arab states because of Israeli

(why not millions?). . . .

The "Irgun" was the main
treedom-fighting Jewish under
ground in Israel while the country
was under the British imperialist
rule, during the years 1937-1948. The
PLO is the umbrella organization of
the Arab terrorist groups.
Recent history
Let us delve for a while into recent
history and consider several typical
operations ot the Irgun and the PLO.
On May 4, 1947, the Irgun
launched the most famous com
mando attack in the history of Israel's
struggle for independence. It was
against the Acre Fortress, where
many underground fighters were
serving jail terms as political prison
ers. The fortress was in the midst of a
British military complex, and was
considered impenetrable.
The attack was successful, and the
prisoners were freed. The comman
der of the operation and several
other Irgun commando were killed.
On July 22, 1946, the Irgun blew up
the British Military Headquarters in
Israel, at the Jerusalem King David
Hotel. Officials later admitted receiv
ing warning phone calls, requesting
them to evacuate the building. The
British Officer in charge refused to
believe the Irgun could penetrate the
elaborate security measures, and
chose to treat the call as a hoax.
There were heavy casualties among
British military personnel.
The Irgun never attacked the civi
lian population, be it British or Arab.
Shortly betore each operation, the
Irgun command took great care to
intorm the civilian population about
what was going to happen.
In 1948, all the surrounding Arab
states invaded the newly born State
of Israel with the expressed aim of
committing genocide — purifying
the state from the Jews. The Irgun

joined the Israeli Defense Forces,
Zairal. Irgun units fought in Jaffa and
in the battle for Jerusalem.
A most treacherous battle occur
red at Deir-Yassin, a town which
governed one of the access roads to
the Holy City. As an Arab eye-witness
recounts the story in the Jordanian
paper Al-Urdun (Amman, February
19580): "A small truck appeared,
which had loudspeakers mounted
over it. It warned the townspeople
about the impending battle. It was
greeted with a hail of bullets. About
400 people left the town before the
battle started. The battle involved
house to house skirmishes, the kind
which inflicts many casualties on
both sides. The Irgun soldiers finally
succeeded in taking the town. There
were more than a hundred Arab
casualties."
The Irgun command later issued a
statement regretting the casualties
inflicted on the civilian population,
noting that whenever a battle is
fought in an urban area, these are
bound to occur.
PLO operations
Let us consider now several typical
PLO operations.
On Nov. 26,1971, the prime minis
ter of Jordan, Wasfi Tal, was assassi
nated in Cairo.
On May 30, 1972, 27 civilians were
killed with 80 wounded, in the arri
vals lounge of Lod Airport. Most of
the victims were Puerto Rican pil
grims.
On Sept. 5,1972,11 Israeli athletes
were murdered in the Munich
Olympic Games, an event which
should have symbolized friendship
among mankind.
On May 15, 1974, PLO terrorists
massacred 25 high school students at
Maalot, Israel.
The pattern, in these two accounts
of the Irgun and PLO operations, is
clear. The Irgun was an underground
of freedom fighters. They fought
against a foreign, imperialist power
— the British occupation forces.
They never targeted an operation
against civilians, Arab or British.
Zeev Jabotinsky, the spiritual
leader of the Irgun, wrote in a poem
(1920) concerning his dream about
Israel: "There they will live, in aban
dance and happiness, the son of
Arabia, the son of Nazareth (meaning
the Christians), and my son (the
Jews)."
In contrast, the PLO is a murder
organization. It is even worse than
the Baader-Meinhof gang in many
respects. Its stated purpose is not so
cial — it is genocide. It has one ad
vantage over the' Baader-Meinhof
gang — it is financed by the oil
sheiks.
As former PLO chairman Ahmed
Shukeiri said (Palestinian docu
ments, 1967), "The Jews came by the
sea and will return by the sea." Or, as
Yassir Arafat said in an interview with
B. Jordan (Daily Mail, Jan. 14, 1969),
"They are going upcountry tomor
row. They have simple orders: kill
Jews. We don't care whether the
dead are civilians or soldiers as long
as they are Jews." Apparently, the
PLO terrorists do take care not to
tackle Jewish soldiers.
Conclusions
You may ask, Mr. Abu-Helu, what
are the conclusions to be drawn from
all of this. As Chairman Mao once
said, "The guerilla fighter is like a
, fish. If the people support him, he is
like a fish in the ocean. The enemy
will never get him. If the people do
not support him, he is like a fish
without water. He is dead."
The Irgun was supported by the

Jewish people in Israel. The Viet
Cong was supported by large parts of
the population in South Vietnam.
The PLO is not supported by the Is

should have symbolized friendship
among mankind.
On May 15, 1974, PLO terrorists
massacred 25 high school students at
Maalot, Israel.
The pattern, in these two accounts
of the Irgun and PLO operations, is
clear. The Irgun was an underground
of freedom fighters. They fought
against a foreign, imperialist power
— the British occupation forces.
They never targeted an operation
against civilians, Arab or British.
Zeev Jabotinsky, the spiritual
leader of the Irgun, wrote in a poem
(1920) concerning his dream about
Israel: "There they will live, in aban
dance and happiness, the son of
Arabia, the son of Nazareth (meaning
the Christians), and my son (the
Jews)."
In contrast, the PLO is a murder
organization. It is even worse than
the Baader-Meinhof gang in many
respects. Its stated purpose is not so
cial — it is genocide. It has one ad
vantage over the' Baader-Meinhof
gang — it is financed by the oil
sheiks.
As former PLO chairman Ahmed
Shukeiri said (Palestinian docu
ments, 1967), "The Jews came by the
sea and will return by the sea." Or, as
Yassir Arafat said in an interview with
B. Jordan (Daily Mail, Jan. 14, 1969),
"They are going upcountry tomor
row. They have simple orders: kill
Jews. We don't care whether the
dead are civilians or soldiers as long
as they are Jews." Apparently, the
PLO terrorists do take care not to
tackle Jewish soldiers.
Conclusions
You may ask, Mr. Abu-Helu, what
are the conclusions to be drawn from
all of this. As Chairman Mao once
said, "The guerilla fighter is like a
, fish. If the people support him, he is
like a fish in the ocean. The enemy
will never get him. If the people do
not support him, he is like a fish
without water. He is dead."
The Irgun was supported by the

Jewish people in Israel. The Viet
Cong was supported by large parts of
the population in South Vietnam.
The PLO is not supported by the Is
raeli Arab population, including
those living in Judea and Samaria.
All PLO operations have been ex
ternal, initiated from outside the
country. In the words ot Chairman
Mao, it is a dead fish. It is kept alive
by Saudi money and the political
support of the communist bloc in the
U.N.
Why doesn't the PLO have a grass
roots Arab support in Israel? The
reason is that it is a murder organiza
tion, not a genuine guerrilla organiza
tion. PLO actions will only worsen
the situation of the Arab refugees. An
Arab state already exists in Palestine:
the State of Jordan.
If I were a Palestinian, Mr. Abu-
Helu, I would disavow any support
for the PLO. The only way to end the
suffering of the Arab refugees is to
try and heal the wounds; to engage
in constructive settlement prog
rams; to try and solve the conflict.
More terror will only mean more
grief and misery for everyone in
volved.

Transparent lies
Let me just point out the most
transparent lies: 1) Arabic is a foreign
language for the Palestinians; 2)
Arabs are second class citizens in Is
rael; 3) Israel has been an Arab land
for the whole of its recorded history;
4) The Arab Jews enjoyed equal rights
in the Arab states; 5) Arab Jews fled
the Arab states because of Israeli

(why not millions?). . . .

The "Irgun" was the main
treedom-fighting Jewish under
ground in Israel while the country
was under the British imperialist
rule, during the years 1937-1948. The
PLO is the umbrella organization of
the Arab terrorist groups.
Recent history
Let us delve for a while into recent
history and consider several typical
operations ot the Irgun and the PLO.
On May 4, 1947, the Irgun
launched the most famous com
mando attack in the history of Israel's
struggle for independence. It was
against the Acre Fortress, where
many underground fighters were
serving jail terms as political prison
ers. The fortress was in the midst of a
British military complex, and was
considered impenetrable.
The attack was successful, and the
prisoners were freed. The comman
der of the operation and several
other Irgun commando were killed.
On July 22, 1946, the Irgun blew up
the British Military Headquarters in
Israel, at the Jerusalem King David
Hotel. Officials later admitted receiv
ing warning phone calls, requesting
them to evacuate the building. The
British Officer in charge refused to
believe the Irgun could penetrate the
elaborate security measures, and
chose to treat the call as a hoax.
There were heavy casualties among
British military personnel.
The Irgun never attacked the civi
lian population, be it British or Arab.
Shortly betore each operation, the
Irgun command took great care to
intorm the civilian population about
what was going to happen.
In 1948, all the surrounding Arab
states invaded the newly born State
of Israel with the expressed aim of
committing genocide — purifying
the state from the Jews. The Irgun

joined the Israeli Defense Forces,
Zairal. Irgun units fought in Jaffa and
in the battle for Jerusalem.
A most treacherous battle occur
red at Deir-Yassin, a town which
governed one of the access roads to
the Holy City. As an Arab eye-witness
recounts the story in the Jordanian
paper Al-Urdun (Amman, February
19580): "A small truck appeared,
which had loudspeakers mounted
over it. It warned the townspeople
about the impending battle. It was
greeted with a hail of bullets. About
400 people left the town before the
battle started. The battle involved
house to house skirmishes, the kind
which inflicts many casualties on
both sides. The Irgun soldiers finally
succeeded in taking the town. There
were more than a hundred Arab
casualties."
The Irgun command later issued a
statement regretting the casualties
inflicted on the civilian population,
noting that whenever a battle is
fought in an urban area, these are
bound to occur.
PLO operations
Let us consider now several typical
PLO operations.
On Nov. 26,1971, the prime minis
ter of Jordan, Wasfi Tal, was assassi
nated in Cairo.
On May 30, 1972, 27 civilians were
killed with 80 wounded, in the arri
vals lounge of Lod Airport. Most of
the victims were Puerto Rican pil
grims.
On Sept. 5,1972,11 Israeli athletes
were murdered in the Munich
Olympic Games, an event which
should have symbolized friendship
among mankind.
On May 15, 1974, PLO terrorists
massacred 25 high school students at
Maalot, Israel.
The pattern, in these two accounts

committing genocide — purifying
the state from the Jews. The Irgun

joined the Israeli Defense Forces,
Zairal. Irgun units fought in Jaffa and
in the battle for Jerusalem.
A most treacherous battle occur
red at Deir-Yassin, a town which
governed one of the access roads to
the Holy City. As an Arab eye-witness
recounts the story in the Jordanian
paper Al-Urdun (Amman, February
19580): "A small truck appeared,
which had loudspeakers mounted
over it. It warned the townspeople
about the impending battle. It was
greeted with a hail of bullets. About
400 people left the town before the
battle started. The battle involved
house to house skirmishes, the kind
which inflicts many casualties on
both sides. The Irgun soldiers finally
succeeded in taking the town. There
were more than a hundred Arab
casualties."
The Irgun command later issued a
statement regretting the casualties
inflicted on the civilian population,
noting that whenever a battle is
fought in an urban area, these are
bound to occur.
PLO operations
Let us consider now several typical
PLO operations.
On Nov. 26,1971, the prime minis
ter of Jordan, Wasfi Tal, was assassi
nated in Cairo.
On May 30, 1972, 27 civilians were
killed with 80 wounded, in the arri
vals lounge of Lod Airport. Most of
the victims were Puerto Rican pil
grims.
On Sept. 5,1972,11 Israeli athletes
were murdered in the Munich
Olympic Games, an event which
should have symbolized friendship
among mankind.
On May 15, 1974, PLO terrorists
massacred 25 high school students at
Maalot, Israel.
The pattern, in these two accounts
of the Irgun and PLO operations, is
clear. The Irgun was an underground
of freedom fighters. They fought
against a foreign, imperialist power
— the British occupation forces.
They never targeted an operation
against civilians, Arab or British.
Zeev Jabotinsky, the spiritual
leader of the Irgun, wrote in a poem
(1920) concerning his dream about
Israel: "There they will live, in aban
dance and happiness, the son of
Arabia, the son of Nazareth (meaning
the Christians), and my son (the
Jews)."
In contrast, the PLO is a murder
organization. It is even worse than
the Baader-Meinhof gang in many
respects. Its stated purpose is not so
cial — it is genocide. It has one ad
vantage over the' Baader-Meinhof
gang — it is financed by the oil
sheiks.
As former PLO chairman Ahmed
Shukeiri said (Palestinian docu
ments, 1967), "The Jews came by the
sea and will return by the sea." Or, as
Yassir Arafat said in an interview with
B. Jordan (Daily Mail, Jan. 14, 1969),
"They are going upcountry tomor
row. They have simple orders: kill
Jews. We don't care whether the
dead are civilians or soldiers as long
as they are Jews." Apparently, the
PLO terrorists do take care not to
tackle Jewish soldiers.
Conclusions
You may ask, Mr. Abu-Helu, what
are the conclusions to be drawn from
all of this. As Chairman Mao once
said, "The guerilla fighter is like a
, fish. If the people support him, he is
like a fish in the ocean. The enemy
will never get him. If the people do
not support him, he is like a fish
without water. He is dead."
The Irgun was supported by the

Jewish people in Israel. The Viet
Cong was supported by large parts of
the population in South Vietnam.
The PLO is not supported by the Is
raeli Arab population, including
those living in Judea and Samaria.
All PLO operations have been ex
ternal, initiated from outside the
country. In the words ot Chairman
Mao, it is a dead fish. It is kept alive
by Saudi money and the political
support of the communist bloc in the
U.N.
Why doesn't the PLO have a grass
roots Arab support in Israel? The
reason is that it is a murder organiza
tion, not a genuine guerrilla organiza
tion. PLO actions will only worsen
the situation of the Arab refugees. An
Arab state already exists in Palestine:
the State of Jordan.
If I were a Palestinian, Mr. Abu-
Helu, I would disavow any support
for the PLO. The only way to end the
suffering of the Arab refugees is to
try and heal the wounds; to engage
in constructive settlement prog
rams; to try and solve the conflict.
More terror will only mean more
grief and misery for everyone in
volved.

When I was appointed as a Daily
columnist, I vowed to myself not to
write about the Arab-Israeli conflict.
First ot all, I thought, so much is con
stantly being written on it; and sec
ondly, I should write about the prob
lems and concerns of the graduate
students, the science and engineer
ing students, the married students
and the foreign students. I belong to
all these groups, and they are usually
underrepresented in the Daily
pages.
I succeeded in keeping my vow for
one article. But this week, after read
ing Mr. Abu-Helu's article (Daily,
Nov. 7 and 8), I could hold myself no
longer. There exists a well-known
propaganda rule, which I think is due
to Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda
minister. It states: "No matter how
gross or absurd is the lie you wish to
get across, if you repeat it enough
times, people will start thinking
there is some truth in it."
I am not going to engage in de
tailed refutations of the assertions in
Mr. Abu-Helu's article. Anyone pos
sessing even a superficial knowledge
of the history of the Middle East
could easily do that.
Transparent lies
Let me just point out the most
transparent lies: 1) Arabic is a foreign
language for the Palestinians; 2)
Arabs are second class citizens in Is
rael; 3) Israel has been an Arab land
for the whole of its recorded history;
4) The Arab Jews enjoyed equal rights
in the Arab states; 5) Arab Jews fled
the Arab states because of Israeli
promises; 6) Israel burned the Al-
Aqsa mosque; 7) Israel had de
stroyed thousands ot Arab villages
(why not millions?). . . .
I could go on and on, but I am
afraid the reader is getting bored.
The "Irgun" was the main
treedom-fighting Jewish under
ground in Israel while the country
was under the British imperialist
rule, during the years 1937-1948. The
PLO is the umbrella organization of
the Arab terrorist groups.
Recent history
Let us delve for a while into recent
history and consider several typical
operations ot the Irgun and the PLO.
On May 4, 1947, the Irgun
launched the most famous com
mando attack in the history of Israel's
struggle for independence. It was
against the Acre Fortress, where
many underground fighters were
serving jail terms as political prison
ers. The fortress was in the midst of a
British military complex, and was
considered impenetrable.
The attack was successful, and the
prisoners were freed. The comman
der of the operation and several
other Irgun commando were killed.
On July 22, 1946, the Irgun blew up
the British Military Headquarters in
Israel, at the Jerusalem King David
Hotel. Officials later admitted receiv
ing warning phone calls, requesting
them to evacuate the building. The
British Officer in charge refused to
believe the Irgun could penetrate the
elaborate security measures, and
chose to treat the call as a hoax.
There were heavy casualties among
British military personnel.
The Irgun never attacked the civi
lian population, be it British or Arab.
Shortly betore each operation, the
Irgun command took great care to
intorm the civilian population about
what was going to happen.
In 1948, all the surrounding Arab
states invaded the newly born State
of Israel with the expressed aim of
committing genocide — purifying
the state from the Jews. The Irgun

joined the Israeli Defense Forces,
Zairal. Irgun units fought in Jaffa and
in the battle for Jerusalem.
A most treacherous battle occur
