South Africa
The article "South Africa from the Inside" by Ronald
Hilton (Daily, Nov. 4) leaves me feeling that (a) I've fallen
down a rabbit hole or (b) Hilton is really Art Buchwald
with a bad fever. Either way, I have the same sensation as
when I've heard someone justify the 1942 internment of
West Coast lapanese-Americans on grounds that "it was
for their own protection."
Hilton's comic-opera professor has us fallen under
either the evil eye of Moscow or the soothing affirma
tions of Vorster and Ford Motor Co. He concludes that
"there is a better way ot solving problems" but omits
how. I think I have a way.
How about interning Vorster and theapartheidists (for
their own protection, of course), which would remove
the teeth from the radical opposition and allow the
moderate activists to bring about a peaceful revolution
with equality for all, after which the interned would be
welcomed back to a forgiving, safe-tor-democracy land
and live happily ever after?
Clearly this has to be a reasonable solution: the Krem
lin would never dream of it.

'A matter of principle'
I would like to comment on the practice of the ASSU
fee assessment refunds. I feel that it is a great idea for the
ASSU to give us back our money for the student organi
zations and services that we do not wish to support. As
far as I m concerned those organizations are worthless,
just like all the other student organizations and services.
Therefore should have a right to get back their
$H, and I propose that we should get back all our other
student fee assessments as well.
In actuality, I feel that I could put the money to a much
better use. Eight bucks could get me about four or five
six-packs of Coors or Bud and at the same time I might
even have enough left over for a bag of chips!
Ftow can you compare the benefits of a career plan
ning and placement center and tree legal counseling or a

student run band, radio station, newspaper, course
guide, and government to extra pocket change or a few
extra beers? In my opinion, I find the latter tremend
ously more important.
Now I know there are those who might say that I am
cheap, but in reality it is not the money that I am con
cerned with, rather it is "a matter of principle!" I just do
not feel the need for any student involvement or ac
tivities at Stanford.
Some also may say that I am the only one who thinks
this way but from my observation I would say that there
are quite a few students who are in strong agreement
with me. During the week that the ASSU was giving
refunds I saw dozens of students busily signing their
names to every single refund sheet, thereby proclaiming
their non-support of those organizations.
I feel a sort of camaraderie with these individuals
because they, too, feel that all student activities and
services are useless and are thereby getting their refund
as "a matter of principle." I even feel a stronger sense of
moral values when I later meet my comrades at the
student union where we quickly spend our newly
acquired gains on such delectables as strawberry yogurt
custard. As I said before, it is all just "a matter of princi
ple."
Now as I stated previously, I believe that we should
increase these refunds. I believe the ASSU should have
refunds at the beginning of the next quarter for all the
student fee assessments including that of the ASSU it
self. This way we all could almost immediately enjoy the
benefits of not being bothered with all these useless
student organizations and services on campus.
However, an even better proposal that I would like to
make is one in which we could avoid paying the ASSU
fee assessment in the first place. My proposal is that next
quarter those of us who see no need for student in
volvement on campus should avoid paying the ASSU fee
assessment by just simply not paying tuition, "as a mat
ter of principle."
