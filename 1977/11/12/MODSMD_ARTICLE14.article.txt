# Stat-padding days gone
## Spartans close gap on Stanford 
### 
At first glance, having a game
against San Jose State might
mean little more to Stanford
than a chance to pad the stats
and pick up an easy win.
After all, in the 33 football
games between the two
schools, the Spartans have
won only four times. And kf the
years Jim Plunkett quarter
backed Stanford are any indi
cation, having won those four
games was quite an ac
complishment. But since Plun
kett left the Farm, the Spartans
have given Stanford plenty of
rough times. Two of San Jose
State's wins over Stanford have
come in this decade.
The three years Plunkett
quarterbacked Stanford the
Spartans were swamped in
their annual visit to Stanford
Stadium 68-20, 63-21 and
34-3.
The first win opened the 1968
season, and marked Plunkett's
debut as Stanford quarterback.

He threw four touchdown pas
ses in that game. By Plunkett's
senior season in 1970, though,
at least San Jose had managed
to close the gap.
Upset
And in 1971 the Spartans did
more than narrow the margin.
In a late-season game, the
Spartans defeated a Rose
Bowl-bound Stanford outfit,
13-12. In that game, Stanford
place kicker Rod Garcia failed
to hit on any of five field goal
tries and also missed a conver
sion.
The next season, Stanford
retaliated. Mike Boryla hit on
22 of 33 passes for 229 yards in
three quarters of action to pace
the 44-0 Stanford romp.
In 1973, though, it took 10
fourth-quarter points by Stan
ford to insure a 23-12 victory.

In 1974, things were a bit
tighter. The 17-point favorite
Cards rallied from a 14-0 deficit
to lead 21-14 in the fourth quar
ter. Then the Spartans went on
a 19-play, 80-yard drive for a
touchdown and the tie in a
game where they outgained
Stanford rushing and passing.
In 1975, things got worse, at
least from the Stanford view
point. Following a 19-19 tie at
Michigan, the Cards came
home to host the Spartans on
regional television and were
outscored 36-34. The Spartans
came up with 30 second
quarter points and then held
off a late Stanford rally for the
win.
The Spartans had nearly 500
yards offense against Stanford
that game, and their quarter
back Roger Proffitt, who the
week prior had passed for only
three yards, riddled the Stan
ford secondary for 258 yards
and two touchdowns.
Last year it looked like the
Spartans were ready to make it
two in a row over the Cards on
the tube. Only this time a Stan
ford rally came all the way
back.
Trailing 23-14 in the fourth
quarter, quarterback Guy Ben
jamin directed Stanford on two
scoring drives to pull out the
28-23 victory. Benjamin
finished the day with 25 com
pletions in 41 attempts for 277
yards and two touchdowns.

than a chance to pad the stats
and pick up an easy win.
After all, in the 33 football
games between the two
schools, the Spartans have
won only four times. And kf the
years Jim Plunkett quarter
backed Stanford are any indi
cation, having won those four
games was quite an ac
complishment. But since Plun
kett left the Farm, the Spartans
have given Stanford plenty of
rough times. Two of San Jose
State's wins over Stanford have
come in this decade.
The three years Plunkett
quarterbacked Stanford the
Spartans were swamped in
their annual visit to Stanford
Stadium 68-20, 63-21 and
34-3.
The first win opened the 1968
season, and marked Plunkett's
debut as Stanford quarterback.

He threw four touchdown pas
ses in that game. By Plunkett's
senior season in 1970, though,
at least San Jose had managed
to close the gap.
Upset
And in 1971 the Spartans did
more than narrow the margin.
In a late-season game, the
Spartans defeated a Rose
Bowl-bound Stanford outfit,
13-12. In that game, Stanford
place kicker Rod Garcia failed
to hit on any of five field goal
tries and also missed a conver
sion.
The next season, Stanford
retaliated. Mike Boryla hit on
22 of 33 passes for 229 yards in
three quarters of action to pace
the 44-0 Stanford romp.
In 1973, though, it took 10
fourth-quarter points by Stan
ford to insure a 23-12 victory.

In 1974, things were a bit
tighter. The 17-point favorite
Cards rallied from a 14-0 deficit
to lead 21-14 in the fourth quar
ter. Then the Spartans went on
a 19-play, 80-yard drive for a
touchdown and the tie in a
game where they outgained
Stanford rushing and passing.
In 1975, things got worse, at
least from the Stanford view
point. Following a 19-19 tie at
Michigan, the Cards came
home to host the Spartans on
regional television and were
outscored 36-34. The Spartans
came up with 30 second
quarter points and then held
off a late Stanford rally for the
win.
The Spartans had nearly 500
yards offense against Stanford
that game, and their quarter
back Roger Proffitt, who the
week prior had passed for only
three yards, riddled the Stan
ford secondary for 258 yards
and two touchdowns.
Last year it looked like the
Spartans were ready to make it
two in a row over the Cards on
the tube. Only this time a Stan
ford rally came all the way
back.
Trailing 23-14 in the fourth
quarter, quarterback Guy Ben
jamin directed Stanford on two
scoring drives to pull out the
28-23 victory. Benjamin
finished the day with 25 com
pletions in 41 attempts for 277
yards and two touchdowns.

Today's game will be Stanford quarterback Guy Benjamin's third
appearance against San Jose State. Benjamin has thrown four
touchdown passes against the Spartans.
At first glance, having a game

mean little more to Stanford
