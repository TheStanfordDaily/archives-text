# Everybody â€“ asleep!
## 
### 
Stanford fans will gettheir
chance to be part of a movie
today, and the film makers
are asking for a bit of acting
on the crowd's part.
Famed sleep researcher
Dr. William Dement will
have his film crew train its
cameras on the crowd at the
end of the first quarter, and
it would be appreciated if
the fans would cooperate by
pretending to be asleep dur
ing this time.
