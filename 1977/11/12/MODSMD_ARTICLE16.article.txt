# But first some sleep
## LSJUMB looks at quotas

(Editor's note: The following is
a summary of today's presenta
tion by the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, prepared for the Daily by

Stanford Stadium on a
sunny, Saturday afternoon.
Stupored fraternity men have
already blocked off the
stadium's prime seating. Fren
zied alums, reeking of Jack
Daniel's and Galliano
cocktails, stumble off the tail
gates of their cars and go fill in
the old fart section. Paly High
prepubescents parade the out
sideof the field hopingtocatch
the eye of some lustful
freshman. Cretin-like jour
nalists up in the press box
munch greedily on free hot
dogs, and red-hot students
dive into their books for some
last minute pre-game studying.
Suddenly, frat rat, old fart,
pre-med and prepubescent
alike jump to their feet to wel
come the one thing even more
bizzarre than they, the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band.
After yet another victory
against the.Rubber Band down
in soggy Southern California,
the Incomparables are back,
ready to present one more
sick, sick, sick pre-game and

halftime show to the Stanford
crowd.
Finally accepting that coach
Walsh never promised them a
rose garden, Card fans have
realized that SLEEP may be
more gratifying than Stanford
football. In fact, the team doc
tor discovered that our first de
fensive team contained at least
seven narcoleptics. Deter
mined to get back on their feet,
each player calls on Dr. Bill
Dement to "Show Me the
Way." In spite of Walsh's pro
tests, Dement burdens the
players with Stanford Sleepi
ness Scale surveys. Luckily
though, this dream sequence
ends, Dement turns into the
"Boogie Man," and the Cards
wake up, after all.
Halftime
Even the Band, known for
sleep-walking and for taking
frequent "trips," is well aware
of the controversy raging over
affirmative action. The Incom
parables encourage all
graduate schools, no matter
what their quotas may be, to
ADMIT dedicated Band mem
bers who have, over the past
four years, cast their grades to
the "Wheels of Fortune."
Unfortunately for them,
everyone wants their piece of
the pie, and no one will win the
admissions game unless

schools have a "Line On
Them." Consequently,
thousands of college students
waste four years of good times
on a GPA which may not gain
them admittance anywhere ex
cept for one campus organiza
tion whose members thrive on
lots of "Good Lovin'."
Women, too, are making a
place for themselves in equal
rights. Even Hoover Tower may
someday be renamed for one
or two women, proving that
the Stanford campus is soon to
be "Suffragette City."
Though the Bakke Decision
forewarns the end of affirma
tive action programs nation
wide, admissions committees
still continue with their "Jungle
Love" policies of selection.
Who knows? Someday, there
might be quotas for the other
guy-

Dement to "Show Me the
Way." In spite of Walsh's pro
tests, Dement burdens the
players with Stanford Sleepi

though, this dream sequence
ends, Dement turns into the

wake up, after all.
Halftime
Even the Band, known for
sleep-walking and for taking
frequent "trips," is well aware
of the controversy raging over
affirmative action. The Incom
parables encourage all
graduate schools, no matter
what their quotas may be, to
ADMIT dedicated Band mem
bers who have, over the past
four years, cast their grades to
the "Wheels of Fortune."
Unfortunately for them,
everyone wants their piece of
the pie, and no one will win the
admissions game unless

schools have a "Line On
Them." Consequently,
thousands of college students
waste four years of good times
on a GPA which may not gain
them admittance anywhere ex
cept for one campus organiza
tion whose members thrive on
lots of "Good Lovin'."
Women, too, are making a
place for themselves in equal
rights. Even Hoover Tower may
someday be renamed for one
or two women, proving that
the Stanford campus is soon to
be "Suffragette City."
Though the Bakke Decision
forewarns the end of affirma
tive action programs nation
wide, admissions committees
still continue with their "Jungle
Love" policies of selection.
Who knows? Someday, there
might be quotas for the other
guy-

Stanford Stadium on a
sunny, Saturday afternoon.
Stupored fraternity men have
already blocked off the
stadium's prime seating. Fren
zied alums, reeking of Jack
Daniel's and Galliano
cocktails, stumble off the tail
gates of their cars and go fill in
the old fart section. Paly High
prepubescents parade the out
sideof the field hopingtocatch
the eye of some lustful
freshman. Cretin-like jour
nalists up in the press box
munch greedily on free hot
dogs, and red-hot students
dive into their books for some
last minute pre-game studying.
Suddenly, frat rat, old fart,
pre-med and prepubescent
alike jump to their feet to wel
come the one thing even more
bizzarre than they, the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band.
After yet another victory
against the.Rubber Band down
in soggy Southern California,
the Incomparables are back,
ready to present one more
sick, sick, sick pre-game and

halftime show to the Stanford
crowd.
Finally accepting that coach
Walsh never promised them a
rose garden, Card fans have
realized that SLEEP may be
more gratifying than Stanford
football. In fact, the team doc
tor discovered that our first de
fensive team contained at least
seven narcoleptics. Deter
mined to get back on their feet,
each player calls on Dr. Bill
Dement to "Show Me the
Way." In spite of Walsh's pro
tests, Dement burdens the
players with Stanford Sleepi
ness Scale surveys. Luckily
