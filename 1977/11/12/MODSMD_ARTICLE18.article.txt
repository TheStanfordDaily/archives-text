# Huskies, Trojans matched in critical conference clash
## 
### 
It's been a long time since so much attention
has been focused on the events in Husky
Stadium.
But the attention today is deserved. The
Pacific-8 tussle there between the USC Trojans
and the Washington Huskies is the key game in
the conference this weekend, and could possi
bly be the crucial game of the season.
The Huskies and Trojans, along with UCLA,
are tied for the conference lead with 4-1 records.
A loss for the Huskies would knock them out of
Rose Bowl contention and make an appearance
in another bowl unlikely because of three non
conference losses.
It's been more than 13 years since the Huskies
have gone to the Rose Bowl, and this season
they figured the talent was there to renew ac
quaintances with Pasadena. They have a solid,
swarming defense teamed with a straight
forward no-frills offense that has averaged over
30 points per conference game.
The Trojans, meanwhile, have been getting an
average of over 30 points per conference outing,
also. And the similarities between the teams
don't end with their point totals.
They both feature tailback-oriented offenses
with big-play capability receivers. They both
have physically tough defenses that can take
their toll on opposing offenses. The USC de
fense ranks No. 1 in the Pac-8 with the Huskies
No. 2.
What's missing?
But the thing the Huskies don't have is the
winning tradition of USC. The Trojans have

made it to the Rose Bowl eight of the past 11
years. In that time, the Huskies have won more
than six games in a season only twice, and have
defeated USC only once. That 8-7 win came two
years ago on the artificial surface in Seattle.
UCLA hopes to keep its Rose Bowl chances
healthy with a win over the Oregon State Beav
ers today in Los Angeles. Bruin quarterback Rick
Bashore, the third-leading passer in the Pac-8,
suffered a collapsed lung and a broken rib in a
victory over Oregon last week, so UCLA will go
with Steve Bukich at the helm.
The Beavers are without a conference victory,
and have lost to UCLA five straight years. To
make things worse, they have the eighth-ranked
offense in the Pac-8.
Also playing
Up in Eugene, Cal will try to raise its Pac-8
record to .500 against the Oregon Ducks. The
Ducks are on a seven-game losing streak this
season, and they haven't beaten a football team
from the Golden State since they ripped Cal,
41-10, in 1973.
Further north and to the east, the battle of the
Palouse looks to be a mismatch. The University
of Idaho and Washington State are just eight
miles apart, but in terms of gridiron differences
it's more like eight hundred miles.
The Cougars (5-4) could guarantee their first
winning season since 1972 by defeating the
Vandals, who are 2-6, including a lopsided loss
to Rice. The last time Idaho beat WSU was 1965.
