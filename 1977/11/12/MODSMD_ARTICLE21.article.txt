# Cards still alive in numbers game
## 
### 
While for the most part Stan
ford's chances for the 1978
Rose Bowl were quashed in the
mud of the Los Angeles Col
iseum last Saturday, the Cards
still have an outside chance to
win a trip to Pasadena for a
meeting with the Big 10 rep
resentative Jan. 2.
(Since Jan.l falls on a Sunday
in 1978, the Rose Bowl will be
played the next day, Monday,

Jan. 2.)
For Stanford to make it to the
Rose Bowl, the Cards would
have to defeat San Jose State
today thereby insuring
themselves the best non
conference record among the
contenders and then knock
off California next week. That
would give Stanford a 5-2
Pacific-8 mark, and give the
Cards the Rose Bowl if they end
up in a multi-team tie for first.
For a multi-team tie to result,
of course, USC, UCLA and
Washington would all have to
lose at least one more game.
The most probable way that
series of misfortune might be
fall the conference co-leaders
would be for USC to lose to the
Huskies today, then defeat
UCLA Nov. 25. Meanwhile, the
Huskies would lose to
Washington State next week in
Seattle. And voila!, the Cards
would be in the Rose Bowl.
Of course, if the Trojans beat
the Huskies, Stanford would
be eliminated from the Rose
Bowl (unless Oregon State up
sets UCLA today).
If all the speculation about
the Rose Bowl seems confus
ing, the possibilities of the
Cards being invited to another
bowl are even more perplex
ing. The post-season festivals
most likely to ask Stanford to
participate are the Liberty Bowl
(Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 19), the
Fiesta Bowl (Tempe, Ariz., Dec.
25), or the Sun Bowl (El Paso,
Tex., Dec. 31).
