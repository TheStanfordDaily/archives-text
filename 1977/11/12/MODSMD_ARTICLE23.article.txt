### 
Today's game has been
designated as "Fan Ap
preciation Day/' making
this the third straight season
Stanford has collaborated
with local merchants to ex
press appreciation to Car
dinal football fans for their
support.
According to Stanford
Sports Information Director
Gary Cavalli, the 50 prizes to
be distributed to selected
fans "range the gamut from
free food to free clothing."
The winners will be
selected at random as they
enter the stadium. "It's a
way of saying thanks to the
fans," said Cavalli.
