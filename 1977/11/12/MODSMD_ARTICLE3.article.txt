# Cards fight for South Bay supremacy
## Stanford battles San Jose State for Santa Clara Valley crown 
### Bruce Anderson 
The battle for bragging rights
gets underway today at 1 p.m.
as Stanford and San Jose State
clash to determine collegiate
football supremacy of the
Santa Clara Valley.
The South Bay rivalry has
heated under the f i re of the last
three contests in which each
team has won a game and the
other ended in a 21-21 draw.
Stanford (6-3 on the season,
4-2 in Pac-8) enters the noncon
ference matchup coming from
a 49-0 razing administered by
the USC Trojans last Saturday
in Los Angeles. San Jose State
(4-5), on the other hand, enters
the game on a winning note
having knocked off Hawaii
24-14 last weekend.
"The SC game is in the past
and we just have to look for
ward to the game with San Jose
State," said Bill Kellar, Stan
ford's split end and the No. 7
pass receiver in the nation. Kel
lar added that "the main thing
for Stanford is to get an 8-3 re
cord," and to do that the Car
dinals must first get by San Jose
before facing California in next
Saturday's Big Game.
Curable impotency?
And getting by San Jose
means that the Stanford of
fense must put points on the
scoreboard, something it was
unable to accomplish in last
week's whitewash in Los
Angeles.
San Jose State will have its
hands full trying to duplicate
the Trojan feat, however. The
Stanford offense, directed by
the nation's top passer, Guy
Benjamin, ranks eighth nation
ally in total offense with 422
yards a game.
The 6-foot-4 senior quarter
back from Sepulveda has com
pleted 176 of 280 passes for 16
touchdowns and 2086 yards.
Benjamin has a bevy of
talented receivers to work
with, including the Pacific-B's
top three pass catchers.
Speedster James Lofton tops
the conference with 43 recep
tions, whjle teammates Darrin
Nelson, with 42, and Kellar,
with 41, are right behind the

senior flanker. Lofton is par
ticularly dangerous having
caught 10 TD passes already
this season.
Tight end Mitch Pleis suf
fered a shoulder separation
against SC. He was operated
on Monday and will miss the
rest of the season. Second
string tight end Pat Bowe suf
fered an ankle sprain down
south but is expected to start.
The Cards may, however, use
three wide receivers from
many of their offensive sets to
day.
Precocious Nelson
Nelson, Stanford's top
ground gainer, set a confer
ence freshman rushing record
last week with 764 yards on the
season. Nelson now ranks
third in single season rushing
on the Stanford all-time list.
Sharing the ball-toting load
with Nelson will be fullbacks
John Finley and Phil Francis.
"The way goes our defense
goes, so goes the team," said
San Jose coach Lynn Stiles
Monday.
San Jose will counter the ver
satile Card offense with a de
fense shored by a proven
linebacking corps of Frank
Manumaleuna, Randy Gill,
Rayford Roberson and Jerry
Duran.
Tough inside
Manumaleuna and Gill at the
inside linebacking spots have
been particularly effective. The
pair lead the team in tackles,
Gill with 183 and "The Mowin'
Samoan" with 125.
Senior Gerald Small heads
the Spartan secondary. The
6-foot, 180-pound cornerback
won all-conference and All-
Coast honors last season but
suffered a shoulder separation
after three games this season.
Small missed five games, saw
limited action last week and
will start for the first time since
September this afternoon.
"We've been an up-and
down team all year," Stiles
said. "We've lacked any real
consistency, especially on of
fense."
Stanford expects that San

Cardinal halfback Darrin Nelson, the fifth-leading rusher in the Pacific-8, breaks through a hole in the
UCLA defense. Nelson has gained 764 yards this season.
Jose will attempt to find consis
tency on the ground.
Ball control
"We believe they'll come out
fairly conservative at the be
ginning of the game and try
and run and get the ball control
and keep the ball away from
our offense/' Stanford defen
sive end Dean Wilson said.
If the Spartans go to the
ground, they will go to sopho
more tailback Kevin Cole who
leads the team with 567 yards
rushing. Last week against the
Rainbows, Cole rushed for 127
yards on 25 cafries and scored

two touchdowns.
Directing the San Jose attack
will be quarterback Ed Luther.
The 6-foot-2, 202-pound
sophomore has passed for 1066
yards and six touchdowns this
season, completing 98 of 211
passes. Luther's favorite target
is senior Steve Joyce who has
25 receptions for 371 yards.
Ceres ino leads
Card middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino paced Stan
ford with a 24-tackle effort last
year against the Spartans and
leads this year's squad with 155
tackles, just nine short of Jim
Merlo's school mark of 164.

Among Ceresino's two
dozen tackles in the San Jose
game last year was a goal line
stop of Spartan running back
Walter Robinson. Officials said
Ceresino stopped Robinson
short of the Stanford end zone
on the last play of the first half.
Disputed play
But San Jose State faithfuls
still insist that Robinson cros
sed the plane of the end zone
on his one-yard dive. Cere
sino's tackle saved six points
and perhaps the game.
But today last season's con
test can be forgotten, and the
anticipated "Fan Appreciation

Day" crowd of 47,000 can
watch the two schools battle
for the right to boast football
superiority for the next year.
Should Stanford win its last
two games, it would not only
equal the best football record
on the Farm since 1951, but the
team might receive bowl con
sideration by several of the
smaller bowls.
For San Jose, there are no
bowl hopes and it is too late for
the Spartans to finish with a
glowing record.
There is only pride . . . and
bragging rights.

yards and six touchdowns this
season, completing 98 of 211
passes. Luther's favorite target
is senior Steve Joyce who has
25 receptions for 371 yards.
Ceres ino leads
Card middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino paced Stan
ford with a 24-tackle effort last
year against the Spartans and
leads this year's squad with 155
tackles, just nine short of Jim
Merlo's school mark of 164.

Among Ceresino's two
dozen tackles in the San Jose
game last year was a goal line
stop of Spartan running back
Walter Robinson. Officials said
Ceresino stopped Robinson
short of the Stanford end zone
on the last play of the first half.
Disputed play
But San Jose State faithfuls
still insist that Robinson cros
sed the plane of the end zone
on his one-yard dive. Cere
sino's tackle saved six points
and perhaps the game.
But today last season's con
test can be forgotten, and the
anticipated "Fan Appreciation

Day" crowd of 47,000 can
watch the two schools battle
for the right to boast football
superiority for the next year.
Should Stanford win its last
two games, it would not only
equal the best football record
on the Farm since 1951, but the
team might receive bowl con
sideration by several of the
smaller bowls.
For San Jose, there are no
bowl hopes and it is too late for
the Spartans to finish with a
glowing record.
There is only pride . . . and
bragging rights.
The battle for bragging rights
gets underway today at 1 p.m.
as Stanford and San Jose State
clash to determine collegiate
football supremacy of the
Santa Clara Valley.
The South Bay rivalry has
heated under the f i re of the last
three contests in which each
team has won a game and the
other ended in a 21-21 draw.
Stanford (6-3 on the season,
4-2 in Pac-8) enters the noncon
ference matchup coming from
a 49-0 razing administered by
the USC Trojans last Saturday
in Los Angeles. San Jose State
(4-5), on the other hand, enters
the game on a winning note
having knocked off Hawaii
24-14 last weekend.
"The SC game is in the past
and we just have to look for
ward to the game with San Jose
State," said Bill Kellar, Stan
ford's split end and the No. 7
pass receiver in the nation. Kel
lar added that "the main thing
for Stanford is to get an 8-3 re
cord," and to do that the Car
dinals must first get by San Jose
before facing California in next
Saturday's Big Game.
Curable impotency?
And getting by San Jose
means that the Stanford of
fense must put points on the
scoreboard, something it was
unable to accomplish in last
week's whitewash in Los
Angeles.
San Jose State will have its
hands full trying to duplicate
the Trojan feat, however. The
Stanford offense, directed by
the nation's top passer, Guy
Benjamin, ranks eighth nation
ally in total offense with 422
yards a game.
The 6-foot-4 senior quarter
back from Sepulveda has com
pleted 176 of 280 passes for 16
touchdowns and 2086 yards.
Benjamin has a bevy of
talented receivers to work
with, including the Pacific-B's
top three pass catchers.
Speedster James Lofton tops
the conference with 43 recep
tions, whjle teammates Darrin
Nelson, with 42, and Kellar,
with 41, are right behind the

senior flanker. Lofton is par
ticularly dangerous having
caught 10 TD passes already
this season.
Tight end Mitch Pleis suf
fered a shoulder separation
against SC. He was operated
on Monday and will miss the
rest of the season. Second
string tight end Pat Bowe suf
fered an ankle sprain down
south but is expected to start.
The Cards may, however, use
three wide receivers from
many of their offensive sets to
day.
Precocious Nelson
Nelson, Stanford's top
ground gainer, set a confer
ence freshman rushing record
last week with 764 yards on the
season. Nelson now ranks
third in single season rushing
on the Stanford all-time list.
Sharing the ball-toting load
with Nelson will be fullbacks
John Finley and Phil Francis.
"The way goes our defense
goes, so goes the team," said
San Jose coach Lynn Stiles
Monday.
San Jose will counter the ver
satile Card offense with a de
fense shored by a proven
linebacking corps of Frank
Manumaleuna, Randy Gill,
Rayford Roberson and Jerry
Duran.
Tough inside
Manumaleuna and Gill at the
inside linebacking spots have
been particularly effective. The
pair lead the team in tackles,
Gill with 183 and "The Mowin'
Samoan" with 125.
Senior Gerald Small heads
the Spartan secondary. The
6-foot, 180-pound cornerback
won all-conference and All-
Coast honors last season but
suffered a shoulder separation
after three games this season.
Small missed five games, saw
limited action last week and
will start for the first time since
September this afternoon.
"We've been an up-and
down team all year," Stiles
said. "We've lacked any real
consistency, especially on of
fense."
Stanford expects that San

Cardinal halfback Darrin Nelson, the fifth-leading rusher in the Pacific-8, breaks through a hole in the

Jose will attempt to find consis

Ball control
"We believe they'll come out
fairly conservative at the be
ginning of the game and try
and run and get the ball control
and keep the ball away from
our offense/' Stanford defen
sive end Dean Wilson said.
If the Spartans go to the
ground, they will go to sopho
more tailback Kevin Cole who
leads the team with 567 yards
rushing. Last week against the
Rainbows, Cole rushed for 127
yards on 25 cafries and scored

two touchdowns.
Directing the San Jose attack
will be quarterback Ed Luther.

Gill with 183 and "The Mowin'
Samoan" with 125.
Senior Gerald Small heads

6-foot, 180-pound cornerback
won all-conference and All-

Small missed five games, saw
limited action last week and

Jose will attempt to find consis
tency on the ground.
Ball control
"We believe they'll come out
fairly conservative at the be
ginning of the game and try
and run and get the ball control
and keep the ball away from
our offense/' Stanford defen
sive end Dean Wilson said.
If the Spartans go to the
ground, they will go to sopho
more tailback Kevin Cole who
leads the team with 567 yards
rushing. Last week against the
Rainbows, Cole rushed for 127
yards on 25 cafries and scored

two touchdowns.
Directing the San Jose attack
will be quarterback Ed Luther.
The 6-foot-2, 202-pound
sophomore has passed for 1066
yards and six touchdowns this
season, completing 98 of 211
passes. Luther's favorite target
is senior Steve Joyce who has
25 receptions for 371 yards.
Ceres ino leads
Card middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino paced Stan
ford with a 24-tackle effort last
year against the Spartans and
leads this year's squad with 155
tackles, just nine short of Jim
Merlo's school mark of 164.

Among Ceresino's two
dozen tackles in the San Jose
game last year was a goal line
stop of Spartan running back
Walter Robinson. Officials said
Ceresino stopped Robinson
short of the Stanford end zone
on the last play of the first half.
Disputed play
But San Jose State faithfuls
still insist that Robinson cros
sed the plane of the end zone
on his one-yard dive. Cere
sino's tackle saved six points
and perhaps the game.
But today last season's con
test can be forgotten, and the
anticipated "Fan Appreciation

Day" crowd of 47,000 can
watch the two schools battle
for the right to boast football
superiority for the next year.
Should Stanford win its last
two games, it would not only
equal the best football record
on the Farm since 1951, but the
team might receive bowl con
sideration by several of the
smaller bowls.
For San Jose, there are no
bowl hopes and it is too late for
the Spartans to finish with a
glowing record.
There is only pride . . . and
bragging rights.
The battle for bragging rights
gets underway today at 1 p.m.
as Stanford and San Jose State
clash to determine collegiate
football supremacy of the
Santa Clara Valley.
The South Bay rivalry has
heated under the f i re of the last
three contests in which each
team has won a game and the
other ended in a 21-21 draw.
Stanford (6-3 on the season,
4-2 in Pac-8) enters the noncon
ference matchup coming from
a 49-0 razing administered by
the USC Trojans last Saturday
in Los Angeles. San Jose State
(4-5), on the other hand, enters
the game on a winning note
having knocked off Hawaii
24-14 last weekend.
"The SC game is in the past
and we just have to look for
ward to the game with San Jose
State," said Bill Kellar, Stan
ford's split end and the No. 7
pass receiver in the nation. Kel
lar added that "the main thing
for Stanford is to get an 8-3 re
cord," and to do that the Car
dinals must first get by San Jose
before facing California in next
Saturday's Big Game.
Curable impotency?
And getting by San Jose
means that the Stanford of
fense must put points on the
scoreboard, something it was
unable to accomplish in last
week's whitewash in Los
Angeles.
San Jose State will have its
hands full trying to duplicate
the Trojan feat, however. The
Stanford offense, directed by
the nation's top passer, Guy
Benjamin, ranks eighth nation
ally in total offense with 422
yards a game.
The 6-foot-4 senior quarter
back from Sepulveda has com
pleted 176 of 280 passes for 16
touchdowns and 2086 yards.
Benjamin has a bevy of
talented receivers to work
with, including the Pacific-B's
top three pass catchers.
Speedster James Lofton tops
the conference with 43 recep
tions, whjle teammates Darrin
Nelson, with 42, and Kellar,
with 41, are right behind the

senior flanker. Lofton is par
ticularly dangerous having
caught 10 TD passes already
this season.
Tight end Mitch Pleis suf
fered a shoulder separation
against SC. He was operated
on Monday and will miss the
rest of the season. Second
string tight end Pat Bowe suf
fered an ankle sprain down
south but is expected to start.
The Cards may, however, use
three wide receivers from
many of their offensive sets to
day.
Precocious Nelson
Nelson, Stanford's top
ground gainer, set a confer
ence freshman rushing record
last week with 764 yards on the
season. Nelson now ranks
third in single season rushing
on the Stanford all-time list.
Sharing the ball-toting load
with Nelson will be fullbacks
John Finley and Phil Francis.
"The way goes our defense
goes, so goes the team," said
San Jose coach Lynn Stiles
Monday.
San Jose will counter the ver
satile Card offense with a de
fense shored by a proven
linebacking corps of Frank
Manumaleuna, Randy Gill,
Rayford Roberson and Jerry
Duran.
Tough inside
Manumaleuna and Gill at the
inside linebacking spots have
been particularly effective. The
pair lead the team in tackles,
Gill with 183 and "The Mowin'
