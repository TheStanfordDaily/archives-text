# Cardinal career overshadowed
## Kellar quietly dissects secondaries 
### Richard Keller 
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."
Started young
Since he was six years old,
Kellar has played football. He
lived across from Hillsboro
High School where his father is
a track coach and teacher. He

Stanford wide receiver Bill Kellar leaps high to snare a pass. The
senior's sure hands and concentration have helped him grab 41
passes this season - third-best in the Pacific-8. Kellar is seventh-best
in the country with 5.1 receptions a game.
often played five hours a day as
a kid.
While leading his team to the
state championship his senior
year, Kellar met Steve Dils.
Now the backup for Benjamin,
Dils lives 30 miles away from
Hillsboro in Vancouver, Wash.
Last summer Kellar ran
routes and Dils threw passes
twice a week in Portland's Civic
Stadium. In August, the regi
men was stepped up to five
times a week. A 32-28 victory
over UCLA was partially a result
of their dedication.
When Benjamin injured his
ankle before the Bruin game,
Walsh called on Dils to step in.
Dils and Kellar connected on
four occasions for 45 yards.
Dils' passes and Kellar's hands
were seemingly computer

programmed to be in the same
place at the same time.
Benjamin is now accus
tomed to Kellar's moves as well
as Dils, Kellar said.
"I know Guy will get me the
ball if I get open. He's such a
pure passer. And he's able to
read off other receivers. If his
primary receiver is covered,
he'll look to his second read. If
that's not there, he'll dump the
ball off to a back. He'll stay with
the receiver until the last pos
sible moment.
"He reminds me of Joe
Namath back when the Jets
beat the Colts in the Super
Bowl. He will make it in the
pros."
Benjamin was equally com
plimentary about his talented
receiver.
"I've thrown to Bill Singler,

Lofton and (Tony) Hill," Ben
jamin said, "but if I had to bet
my life on someone catching a
ball, I'd have to pick Bill.
"Lofton is so flashy; he gets a
lot of attention. But Bill's a re
ally smart receiver. He's super,
super consistent.
"He doesn't look quick, but
he has good speed. It's just that
James and Tony have great
speed."
Added Benjamin, "Some of
his best games have been
when our offense was shut
down and we lost. He keeps
that constant level."
A perfect example of Benja
min's point occurred at the
rain-drenched USC game in
Los Angeles. Stanford was shut
out, 49-0 but not Kellar. He
caught six passes for 97 yards.
Kellar attributed his fine

showing to more than consis
tency.
A true Duck
He said, "As soon as it
started raining, I sat down on
the bench and thought, 'How
many times have you played in
this kind of weather. You
probably have a bigger advan
tage than any of the others on
the field except Francis be
cause he's from Oregon.' You
just can't get back on your
heels so much, or make any
real quick moves."
In addition, Kellar said he
was "mentally very ready" and
that he enjoys the "challenge
of playing against tougher
teams."
Lofton, another favorite
target of Benjamin's bullets,
has received an incredible
amount of publicity, especially
in comparison to Kellar. Even
Walsh was quoted as saying,
"He (Lofton) is the greatest re
ceiver I've ever been as
sociated with."
"Sometimes publicity makes
a player," Kellar said. "But it
doesn't affect how you play.
"James has scored more.
Along with that he's a world
class long jumper. That's good
for publicity.
"I'm not a glamour receiver.
If I let it bother me, it'll hurt my
game. I can't go out distribut
ing leaflets telling people what
I can do.
"James and I are very good
friends," Kellar said. "We're
(the offensive backfield) all
pretty close. We all get along
well off the field too. Person to
person. It helps the continuity
of it all."
Pre-game ritual
Superstitions. Athletes from
all sports have them. Kellar also
has a ritual.
Aboard the bus on the way to
the stadium, he will always
chew gum. Upon arrival in the
locker room, his first priority is
to thoroughly scan the prog
ram. Next, Kellar takes off his
shoes and shirt, walking
around, trying "to get a few
good laughs,", usually with
Francis. The purpose of this
sacred routine is to "feel re
laxed," Kellar explained.
Once out on the field, Kellar
and Lofton immediately begin

to analyze the defensive backs.
"I'll get the feel for a DB
early," Kellar said. "Since we
switch sides of the field, we'll
tell each other what the defen
sive setup is on each side.
Communication is the key."
Many pro receivers, includ
ing Biletnikoff, use stickum on
their hands to get a better grip
on the ball. Kellar gave it up
during his freshman season.
"I stopped using it because
we use leather balls," he said.
"And it makes it harder for Guy
to throw. Grass and dirt stick to
your hands so you have to go
around with your fists closed.
"Now I'll just lick my hands
every time in the huddle to get
the right tackiness," he added.
Kellar came to Stanford be
cause he wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl.
"One of my goals was to play
in the Rose Bowl," he said.
"None of the Northwest
schools had any possibility of
making it.
"I didn't want to b6 a cor
nerstone. I didn't want to be
involved in a rebuilding prog
ram and suffer through losing
seasons."
Despite his lack of a "star"
status, there are the 12 pro
teams that have expressed in
terest to Kellar. Walsh thinks
interest will translate into a
draft pick.
"I don't think he will be the
most highly sought-after re
ceiver," said Walsh. "I don't
think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

a kid.
While leading his team to the
state championship his senior
year, Kellar met Steve Dils.
Now the backup for Benjamin,
Dils lives 30 miles away from
Hillsboro in Vancouver, Wash.
Last summer Kellar ran
routes and Dils threw passes
twice a week in Portland's Civic
Stadium. In August, the regi
men was stepped up to five
times a week. A 32-28 victory
over UCLA was partially a result
of their dedication.
When Benjamin injured his
ankle before the Bruin game,
Walsh called on Dils to step in.
Dils and Kellar connected on
four occasions for 45 yards.
Dils' passes and Kellar's hands
were seemingly computer

programmed to be in the same
place at the same time.
Benjamin is now accus
tomed to Kellar's moves as well
as Dils, Kellar said.
"I know Guy will get me the
ball if I get open. He's such a
pure passer. And he's able to
read off other receivers. If his
primary receiver is covered,
he'll look to his second read. If
that's not there, he'll dump the
ball off to a back. He'll stay with
the receiver until the last pos
sible moment.
"He reminds me of Joe
Namath back when the Jets
beat the Colts in the Super
Bowl. He will make it in the
pros."
Benjamin was equally com
plimentary about his talented
receiver.
"I've thrown to Bill Singler,

Lofton and (Tony) Hill," Ben
jamin said, "but if I had to bet
my life on someone catching a
ball, I'd have to pick Bill.
"Lofton is so flashy; he gets a
lot of attention. But Bill's a re
ally smart receiver. He's super,
super consistent.
"He doesn't look quick, but
he has good speed. It's just that
James and Tony have great
speed."
Added Benjamin, "Some of
his best games have been
when our offense was shut
down and we lost. He keeps
that constant level."
A perfect example of Benja
min's point occurred at the
rain-drenched USC game in
Los Angeles. Stanford was shut
out, 49-0 but not Kellar. He
caught six passes for 97 yards.
Kellar attributed his fine

showing to more than consis
tency.
A true Duck
He said, "As soon as it
started raining, I sat down on
the bench and thought, 'How
many times have you played in
this kind of weather. You
probably have a bigger advan
tage than any of the others on
the field except Francis be
cause he's from Oregon.' You
just can't get back on your
heels so much, or make any
real quick moves."
In addition, Kellar said he
was "mentally very ready" and
that he enjoys the "challenge
of playing against tougher
teams."
Lofton, another favorite
target of Benjamin's bullets,
has received an incredible
amount of publicity, especially
in comparison to Kellar. Even
Walsh was quoted as saying,
"He (Lofton) is the greatest re
ceiver I've ever been as
sociated with."
"Sometimes publicity makes
a player," Kellar said. "But it
doesn't affect how you play.
"James has scored more.
Along with that he's a world
class long jumper. That's good
for publicity.
"I'm not a glamour receiver.
If I let it bother me, it'll hurt my
game. I can't go out distribut
ing leaflets telling people what
I can do.
"James and I are very good
friends," Kellar said. "We're
(the offensive backfield) all
pretty close. We all get along
well off the field too. Person to
person. It helps the continuity
of it all."
Pre-game ritual
Superstitions. Athletes from
all sports have them. Kellar also
has a ritual.
Aboard the bus on the way to
the stadium, he will always
chew gum. Upon arrival in the
locker room, his first priority is
to thoroughly scan the prog
ram. Next, Kellar takes off his
shoes and shirt, walking
around, trying "to get a few
good laughs,", usually with
Francis. The purpose of this
sacred routine is to "feel re
laxed," Kellar explained.
Once out on the field, Kellar
and Lofton immediately begin

to analyze the defensive backs.
"I'll get the feel for a DB
early," Kellar said. "Since we
switch sides of the field, we'll
tell each other what the defen
sive setup is on each side.
Communication is the key."
Many pro receivers, includ
ing Biletnikoff, use stickum on
their hands to get a better grip
on the ball. Kellar gave it up
during his freshman season.
"I stopped using it because
we use leather balls," he said.
"And it makes it harder for Guy
to throw. Grass and dirt stick to
your hands so you have to go
around with your fists closed.
"Now I'll just lick my hands
every time in the huddle to get
the right tackiness," he added.
Kellar came to Stanford be
cause he wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl.
"One of my goals was to play
in the Rose Bowl," he said.
"None of the Northwest
schools had any possibility of
making it.
"I didn't want to b6 a cor
nerstone. I didn't want to be
involved in a rebuilding prog
ram and suffer through losing
seasons."
Despite his lack of a "star"
status, there are the 12 pro
teams that have expressed in
terest to Kellar. Walsh thinks
interest will translate into a
draft pick.
"I don't think he will be the
most highly sought-after re
ceiver," said Walsh. "I don't
think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

Oregon native Bill Kellar is on the move against the Oregon State Beavers in action from last season.
Kellar has 86 career catches at Stanford.
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."
Started young
Since he was six years old,
Kellar has played football. He
lived across from Hillsboro
High School where his father is
a track coach and teacher. He

Oregon native Bill Kellar is on the move against the Oregon State Beavers in action from last season.
Kellar has 86 career catches at Stanford.
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."

Kellar has played football. He

a track coach and teacher. He

Stanford wide receiver Bill Kellar leaps high to snare a pass. The
senior's sure hands and concentration have helped him grab 41
passes this season - third-best in the Pacific-8. Kellar is seventh-best
in the country with 5.1 receptions a game.
often played five hours a day as
a kid.
While leading his team to the
state championship his senior
year, Kellar met Steve Dils.
Now the backup for Benjamin,
Dils lives 30 miles away from
Hillsboro in Vancouver, Wash.
Last summer Kellar ran
routes and Dils threw passes
twice a week in Portland's Civic
Stadium. In August, the regi
men was stepped up to five
times a week. A 32-28 victory
over UCLA was partially a result
of their dedication.
When Benjamin injured his
ankle before the Bruin game,
Walsh called on Dils to step in.
Dils and Kellar connected on
four occasions for 45 yards.
Dils' passes and Kellar's hands
were seemingly computer

programmed to be in the same
place at the same time.
Benjamin is now accus
tomed to Kellar's moves as well
as Dils, Kellar said.
"I know Guy will get me the
ball if I get open. He's such a
pure passer. And he's able to
read off other receivers. If his
primary receiver is covered,
he'll look to his second read. If
that's not there, he'll dump the
ball off to a back. He'll stay with
the receiver until the last pos
sible moment.
"He reminds me of Joe
Namath back when the Jets
beat the Colts in the Super
Bowl. He will make it in the
pros."
Benjamin was equally com
plimentary about his talented
receiver.
"I've thrown to Bill Singler,

Lofton and (Tony) Hill," Ben
jamin said, "but if I had to bet
my life on someone catching a
ball, I'd have to pick Bill.
"Lofton is so flashy; he gets a
lot of attention. But Bill's a re
ally smart receiver. He's super,
super consistent.
"He doesn't look quick, but
he has good speed. It's just that
James and Tony have great
speed."
Added Benjamin, "Some of
his best games have been
when our offense was shut
down and we lost. He keeps
that constant level."
A perfect example of Benja
min's point occurred at the
rain-drenched USC game in
Los Angeles. Stanford was shut
out, 49-0 but not Kellar. He
caught six passes for 97 yards.
Kellar attributed his fine

showing to more than consis
tency.
A true Duck
He said, "As soon as it
started raining, I sat down on
the bench and thought, 'How
many times have you played in
this kind of weather. You
probably have a bigger advan
tage than any of the others on
the field except Francis be
cause he's from Oregon.' You
just can't get back on your
heels so much, or make any
real quick moves."
In addition, Kellar said he
was "mentally very ready" and
that he enjoys the "challenge
of playing against tougher
teams."
Lofton, another favorite
target of Benjamin's bullets,
has received an incredible
amount of publicity, especially
in comparison to Kellar. Even
Walsh was quoted as saying,
"He (Lofton) is the greatest re
ceiver I've ever been as
sociated with."
"Sometimes publicity makes
a player," Kellar said. "But it
doesn't affect how you play.
"James has scored more.
Along with that he's a world
class long jumper. That's good
for publicity.
"I'm not a glamour receiver.
If I let it bother me, it'll hurt my
game. I can't go out distribut
ing leaflets telling people what
I can do.
"James and I are very good
friends," Kellar said. "We're
(the offensive backfield) all
pretty close. We all get along
well off the field too. Person to
person. It helps the continuity
of it all."
Pre-game ritual
Superstitions. Athletes from
all sports have them. Kellar also
has a ritual.
Aboard the bus on the way to
the stadium, he will always
chew gum. Upon arrival in the
locker room, his first priority is
to thoroughly scan the prog
ram. Next, Kellar takes off his
shoes and shirt, walking
around, trying "to get a few
good laughs,", usually with
Francis. The purpose of this
sacred routine is to "feel re
laxed," Kellar explained.
Once out on the field, Kellar
and Lofton immediately begin

to analyze the defensive backs.
"I'll get the feel for a DB
early," Kellar said. "Since we
switch sides of the field, we'll
tell each other what the defen
sive setup is on each side.
Communication is the key."
Many pro receivers, includ
ing Biletnikoff, use stickum on
their hands to get a better grip
on the ball. Kellar gave it up
during his freshman season.
"I stopped using it because
we use leather balls," he said.
"And it makes it harder for Guy
to throw. Grass and dirt stick to
your hands so you have to go
around with your fists closed.
"Now I'll just lick my hands
every time in the huddle to get
the right tackiness," he added.
Kellar came to Stanford be
cause he wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl.
"One of my goals was to play
in the Rose Bowl," he said.
"None of the Northwest
schools had any possibility of
making it.
"I didn't want to b6 a cor
nerstone. I didn't want to be
involved in a rebuilding prog
ram and suffer through losing
seasons."
Despite his lack of a "star"
status, there are the 12 pro
teams that have expressed in
terest to Kellar. Walsh thinks
interest will translate into a
draft pick.
"I don't think he will be the
most highly sought-after re
ceiver," said Walsh. "I don't
think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

passes this season - third-best in the Pacific-8. Kellar is seventh-best
in the country with 5.1 receptions a game.
often played five hours a day as
a kid.
While leading his team to the
state championship his senior
year, Kellar met Steve Dils.
Now the backup for Benjamin,
Dils lives 30 miles away from
Hillsboro in Vancouver, Wash.
Last summer Kellar ran
routes and Dils threw passes
twice a week in Portland's Civic
Stadium. In August, the regi
men was stepped up to five
times a week. A 32-28 victory
over UCLA was partially a result
of their dedication.
When Benjamin injured his
ankle before the Bruin game,
Walsh called on Dils to step in.
Dils and Kellar connected on
four occasions for 45 yards.
Dils' passes and Kellar's hands
were seemingly computer

programmed to be in the same
place at the same time.
Benjamin is now accus
tomed to Kellar's moves as well
as Dils, Kellar said.
"I know Guy will get me the
ball if I get open. He's such a
pure passer. And he's able to
read off other receivers. If his
primary receiver is covered,
he'll look to his second read. If
that's not there, he'll dump the
ball off to a back. He'll stay with
the receiver until the last pos
sible moment.
"He reminds me of Joe
Namath back when the Jets
beat the Colts in the Super
Bowl. He will make it in the
pros."
Benjamin was equally com
plimentary about his talented
receiver.
"I've thrown to Bill Singler,

Lofton and (Tony) Hill," Ben
jamin said, "but if I had to bet
my life on someone catching a
ball, I'd have to pick Bill.
"Lofton is so flashy; he gets a
lot of attention. But Bill's a re
ally smart receiver. He's super,
super consistent.
"He doesn't look quick, but
he has good speed. It's just that
James and Tony have great
speed."
Added Benjamin, "Some of
his best games have been
when our offense was shut
down and we lost. He keeps
that constant level."
A perfect example of Benja
min's point occurred at the
rain-drenched USC game in
Los Angeles. Stanford was shut
out, 49-0 but not Kellar. He
caught six passes for 97 yards.
Kellar attributed his fine

showing to more than consis
tency.
A true Duck
He said, "As soon as it
started raining, I sat down on
the bench and thought, 'How
many times have you played in
this kind of weather. You
probably have a bigger advan
tage than any of the others on
the field except Francis be
cause he's from Oregon.' You
just can't get back on your
heels so much, or make any
real quick moves."
In addition, Kellar said he
was "mentally very ready" and
that he enjoys the "challenge
of playing against tougher
teams."
Lofton, another favorite
target of Benjamin's bullets,
has received an incredible
amount of publicity, especially
in comparison to Kellar. Even
Walsh was quoted as saying,
"He (Lofton) is the greatest re
ceiver I've ever been as
sociated with."
"Sometimes publicity makes
a player," Kellar said. "But it
doesn't affect how you play.
"James has scored more.
Along with that he's a world
class long jumper. That's good
for publicity.
"I'm not a glamour receiver.
If I let it bother me, it'll hurt my
game. I can't go out distribut
ing leaflets telling people what
I can do.
"James and I are very good
friends," Kellar said. "We're
(the offensive backfield) all
pretty close. We all get along
well off the field too. Person to
person. It helps the continuity
of it all."
Pre-game ritual
Superstitions. Athletes from
all sports have them. Kellar also
has a ritual.
Aboard the bus on the way to
the stadium, he will always
chew gum. Upon arrival in the
locker room, his first priority is
to thoroughly scan the prog
ram. Next, Kellar takes off his
shoes and shirt, walking
around, trying "to get a few
good laughs,", usually with
Francis. The purpose of this
sacred routine is to "feel re
laxed," Kellar explained.
Once out on the field, Kellar
and Lofton immediately begin

to analyze the defensive backs.
"I'll get the feel for a DB
early," Kellar said. "Since we
switch sides of the field, we'll
tell each other what the defen
sive setup is on each side.
Communication is the key."
Many pro receivers, includ
ing Biletnikoff, use stickum on
their hands to get a better grip
on the ball. Kellar gave it up
during his freshman season.
"I stopped using it because
we use leather balls," he said.
"And it makes it harder for Guy
to throw. Grass and dirt stick to
your hands so you have to go
around with your fists closed.
"Now I'll just lick my hands
every time in the huddle to get
the right tackiness," he added.
Kellar came to Stanford be
cause he wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl.
"One of my goals was to play
in the Rose Bowl," he said.
"None of the Northwest
schools had any possibility of
making it.
"I didn't want to b6 a cor
nerstone. I didn't want to be
involved in a rebuilding prog
ram and suffer through losing
seasons."
Despite his lack of a "star"
status, there are the 12 pro
teams that have expressed in
terest to Kellar. Walsh thinks
interest will translate into a
draft pick.
"I don't think he will be the
most highly sought-after re
ceiver," said Walsh. "I don't
think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

Oregon native Bill Kellar is on the move against the Oregon State Beavers in action from last season.
Kellar has 86 career catches at Stanford.
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."
Started young
Since he was six years old,
Kellar has played football. He
lived across from Hillsboro
High School where his father is
a track coach and teacher. He

think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

Oregon native Bill Kellar is on the move against the Oregon State Beavers in action from last season.
Kellar has 86 career catches at Stanford.
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."

Stanford wide receiver Bill Kellar leaps high to snare a pass. The
senior's sure hands and concentration have helped him grab 41
passes this season - third-best in the Pacific-8. Kellar is seventh-best
in the country with 5.1 receptions a game.
often played five hours a day as
a kid.
While leading his team to the
state championship his senior
year, Kellar met Steve Dils.
Now the backup for Benjamin,
Dils lives 30 miles away from
Hillsboro in Vancouver, Wash.
Last summer Kellar ran
routes and Dils threw passes
twice a week in Portland's Civic
Stadium. In August, the regi
men was stepped up to five
times a week. A 32-28 victory
over UCLA was partially a result
of their dedication.
When Benjamin injured his
ankle before the Bruin game,
Walsh called on Dils to step in.
Dils and Kellar connected on
four occasions for 45 yards.
Dils' passes and Kellar's hands
were seemingly computer

programmed to be in the same
place at the same time.
Benjamin is now accus
tomed to Kellar's moves as well
as Dils, Kellar said.
"I know Guy will get me the
ball if I get open. He's such a
pure passer. And he's able to
read off other receivers. If his
primary receiver is covered,
he'll look to his second read. If
that's not there, he'll dump the
ball off to a back. He'll stay with
the receiver until the last pos
sible moment.
"He reminds me of Joe
Namath back when the Jets
beat the Colts in the Super
Bowl. He will make it in the
pros."
Benjamin was equally com
plimentary about his talented
receiver.
"I've thrown to Bill Singler,

Lofton and (Tony) Hill," Ben
jamin said, "but if I had to bet
my life on someone catching a
ball, I'd have to pick Bill.
"Lofton is so flashy; he gets a
lot of attention. But Bill's a re
ally smart receiver. He's super,
super consistent.
"He doesn't look quick, but
he has good speed. It's just that
James and Tony have great
speed."
Added Benjamin, "Some of
his best games have been
when our offense was shut
down and we lost. He keeps
that constant level."
A perfect example of Benja
min's point occurred at the
rain-drenched USC game in
Los Angeles. Stanford was shut
out, 49-0 but not Kellar. He
caught six passes for 97 yards.
Kellar attributed his fine

showing to more than consis
tency.
A true Duck
He said, "As soon as it
started raining, I sat down on
the bench and thought, 'How
many times have you played in
this kind of weather. You
probably have a bigger advan
tage than any of the others on
the field except Francis be
cause he's from Oregon.' You
just can't get back on your
heels so much, or make any
real quick moves."
In addition, Kellar said he
was "mentally very ready" and
that he enjoys the "challenge
of playing against tougher
teams."
Lofton, another favorite
target of Benjamin's bullets,
has received an incredible
amount of publicity, especially
in comparison to Kellar. Even
Walsh was quoted as saying,
"He (Lofton) is the greatest re
ceiver I've ever been as
sociated with."
"Sometimes publicity makes
a player," Kellar said. "But it
doesn't affect how you play.
"James has scored more.
Along with that he's a world
class long jumper. That's good
for publicity.
"I'm not a glamour receiver.
If I let it bother me, it'll hurt my
game. I can't go out distribut
ing leaflets telling people what
I can do.
"James and I are very good
friends," Kellar said. "We're
(the offensive backfield) all
pretty close. We all get along
well off the field too. Person to
person. It helps the continuity
of it all."
Pre-game ritual
Superstitions. Athletes from
all sports have them. Kellar also
has a ritual.
Aboard the bus on the way to
the stadium, he will always
chew gum. Upon arrival in the
locker room, his first priority is
to thoroughly scan the prog
ram. Next, Kellar takes off his
shoes and shirt, walking
around, trying "to get a few
good laughs,", usually with
Francis. The purpose of this
sacred routine is to "feel re
laxed," Kellar explained.
Once out on the field, Kellar
and Lofton immediately begin

to analyze the defensive backs.
"I'll get the feel for a DB
early," Kellar said. "Since we
switch sides of the field, we'll
tell each other what the defen
sive setup is on each side.
Communication is the key."
Many pro receivers, includ
ing Biletnikoff, use stickum on
their hands to get a better grip
on the ball. Kellar gave it up
during his freshman season.
"I stopped using it because
we use leather balls," he said.
"And it makes it harder for Guy
to throw. Grass and dirt stick to
your hands so you have to go
around with your fists closed.
"Now I'll just lick my hands
every time in the huddle to get
the right tackiness," he added.
Kellar came to Stanford be
cause he wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl.
"One of my goals was to play
in the Rose Bowl," he said.
"None of the Northwest
schools had any possibility of
making it.
"I didn't want to b6 a cor
nerstone. I didn't want to be
involved in a rebuilding prog
ram and suffer through losing
seasons."
Despite his lack of a "star"
status, there are the 12 pro
teams that have expressed in
terest to Kellar. Walsh thinks
interest will translate into a
draft pick.
"I don't think he will be the
most highly sought-after re
ceiver," said Walsh. "I don't
think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

Stanford wide receiver Bill Kellar leaps high to snare a pass. The
senior's sure hands and concentration have helped him grab 41
passes this season - third-best in the Pacific-8. Kellar is seventh-best
in the country with 5.1 receptions a game.
often played five hours a day as
a kid.
While leading his team to the
state championship his senior
year, Kellar met Steve Dils.
Now the backup for Benjamin,
Dils lives 30 miles away from
Hillsboro in Vancouver, Wash.
Last summer Kellar ran
routes and Dils threw passes
twice a week in Portland's Civic
Stadium. In August, the regi
men was stepped up to five
times a week. A 32-28 victory
over UCLA was partially a result
of their dedication.
When Benjamin injured his
ankle before the Bruin game,
Walsh called on Dils to step in.
Dils and Kellar connected on
four occasions for 45 yards.
Dils' passes and Kellar's hands
were seemingly computer

programmed to be in the same
place at the same time.
Benjamin is now accus
tomed to Kellar's moves as well
as Dils, Kellar said.
"I know Guy will get me the
ball if I get open. He's such a
pure passer. And he's able to
read off other receivers. If his
primary receiver is covered,
he'll look to his second read. If
that's not there, he'll dump the
ball off to a back. He'll stay with
the receiver until the last pos
sible moment.
"He reminds me of Joe
Namath back when the Jets
beat the Colts in the Super
Bowl. He will make it in the
pros."
Benjamin was equally com
plimentary about his talented
receiver.
"I've thrown to Bill Singler,

Lofton and (Tony) Hill," Ben
jamin said, "but if I had to bet
my life on someone catching a
ball, I'd have to pick Bill.
"Lofton is so flashy; he gets a
lot of attention. But Bill's a re
ally smart receiver. He's super,
super consistent.
"He doesn't look quick, but
he has good speed. It's just that
James and Tony have great
speed."
Added Benjamin, "Some of
his best games have been
when our offense was shut
down and we lost. He keeps
that constant level."
A perfect example of Benja
min's point occurred at the
rain-drenched USC game in
Los Angeles. Stanford was shut
out, 49-0 but not Kellar. He
caught six passes for 97 yards.
Kellar attributed his fine

showing to more than consis
tency.
A true Duck
He said, "As soon as it
started raining, I sat down on
the bench and thought, 'How
many times have you played in
this kind of weather. You
probably have a bigger advan
tage than any of the others on
the field except Francis be
cause he's from Oregon.' You
just can't get back on your
heels so much, or make any
real quick moves."
In addition, Kellar said he
was "mentally very ready" and
that he enjoys the "challenge
of playing against tougher
teams."
Lofton, another favorite
target of Benjamin's bullets,
has received an incredible
amount of publicity, especially
in comparison to Kellar. Even
Walsh was quoted as saying,
"He (Lofton) is the greatest re
ceiver I've ever been as
sociated with."
"Sometimes publicity makes
a player," Kellar said. "But it
doesn't affect how you play.
"James has scored more.
Along with that he's a world
class long jumper. That's good
for publicity.
"I'm not a glamour receiver.
If I let it bother me, it'll hurt my
game. I can't go out distribut
ing leaflets telling people what
I can do.
"James and I are very good
friends," Kellar said. "We're
(the offensive backfield) all
pretty close. We all get along
well off the field too. Person to
person. It helps the continuity
of it all."
Pre-game ritual
Superstitions. Athletes from
all sports have them. Kellar also
has a ritual.
Aboard the bus on the way to
the stadium, he will always
chew gum. Upon arrival in the
locker room, his first priority is
to thoroughly scan the prog
ram. Next, Kellar takes off his
shoes and shirt, walking
around, trying "to get a few
good laughs,", usually with
Francis. The purpose of this
sacred routine is to "feel re
laxed," Kellar explained.
Once out on the field, Kellar
and Lofton immediately begin

to analyze the defensive backs.
"I'll get the feel for a DB
early," Kellar said. "Since we
switch sides of the field, we'll
tell each other what the defen
sive setup is on each side.
Communication is the key."
Many pro receivers, includ
ing Biletnikoff, use stickum on
their hands to get a better grip
on the ball. Kellar gave it up
during his freshman season.
"I stopped using it because
we use leather balls," he said.
"And it makes it harder for Guy
to throw. Grass and dirt stick to
your hands so you have to go
around with your fists closed.
"Now I'll just lick my hands
every time in the huddle to get
the right tackiness," he added.
Kellar came to Stanford be
cause he wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl.
"One of my goals was to play
in the Rose Bowl," he said.
"None of the Northwest
schools had any possibility of
making it.
"I didn't want to b6 a cor
nerstone. I didn't want to be
involved in a rebuilding prog
ram and suffer through losing
seasons."
Despite his lack of a "star"
status, there are the 12 pro
teams that have expressed in
terest to Kellar. Walsh thinks
interest will translate into a
draft pick.
"I don't think he will be the
most highly sought-after re
ceiver," said Walsh. "I don't
think he'll be a first-round draft
choice. But he has an excellent
chance of being drafted and
making a pro team."

Oregon native Bill Kellar is on the move against the Oregon State Beavers in action from last season.
Kellar has 86 career catches at Stanford.
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."
Started young
Since he was six years old,
Kellar has played football. He
lived across from Hillsboro
High School where his father is
a track coach and teacher. He
