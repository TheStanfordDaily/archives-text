# Cardinal career overshadowed
## Kellar quietly dissects secondaries 
### Richard Keller 
He doesn't streak downfield
with the grace and speed of a
gazelle. He doesn't make spec
tacular one-fingered diving
catches in the end zone.
The crowd rarely stands to
acknowledge him. The press
tends to ignore his ac
complishments.
But Bill Kellar is always open.
And when the football is
thrown in his direction, he
does not miss it. If a first down
is needed, No. 42 will get it.
These seemingly mundane
qualities have caused scouts
from 12 professional teams to
contact the Cardinal wide re
ceiverfrom Hillsboro, Oregon.
Kellar, a senior with four
years of varsity experience, is
currently the seventh-leading
receiver in the NCAA. He has
averaged 5.1 receptions in
eight contests.
During his collegiate career,
"the Killer" has snagged 86
passes for 1162 yards. That fi
gure ranks him seventh on the
Stanford all-time list, one
notch ahead of the Green Bay
Packers' Randy Vataha.
1977 has been a phenomenal
season for Kellar. He now has
41 receptions, and needs only
nine more to become the fifth
player in Stanford history to
have 50 catches in one season.
If he hadn't missed the Tulane
game due to a pulled hamstr
ing, he might have reached
that mark already.
"I'm in the same mold as
Fred Biletnikoff," Kellar said.
"I'm not saying I'm as good as

he is by any means. But as far as
style of receiving, we're alike.
He catches a lot of hooks and
square outs."
Kellar compared Stanford's
offense to that of the Oakland
Raiders.
"We have a (Ken) Stabler in
(Guy) Benjamin and a (Cliff)
Branch in (James) Lofton. I'm
more like a (Mike) Siani or
Biletnikoff. I can go long, but
I'm never really called on. It's
not my role in the offense,"
Kellar said.
Not in the pattern
Inside the 20-yard line, only
one pass play goes to Kellar.
The others are designed for
tight ends, backs or Lofton.
That is why Lofton has 10
touchdowns this year and Kel
lar has two.
"Being able to catch the
football. Not losing concentra
tion in a crowd. Being able to
hold on after getting hit. Those
are my assets," Kellar con
tinued.
"I'm catching a lot in the
middle with guys coming in
from all sides. But I'm durable.
I'm able to take a good hit.
"I've had pretty good luck
blocking the 'backers. But I'm
not satisfied with my downfield
blocking," he added.
Everyone familiar with Stan
ford football is aware of Kellar's
attributes of precision patterns
and sure hands. Only his speed
is questioned.
Kellar, who runs the 40-yard
dash in 4.6 seconds, said "It's
adequate to get by the defen
sive backs. But I've got to get

faster. I plan in the winter to
run a few hills, and I could af
ford to lose five of 10 pounds."
Less experienced receivers
look to Kellar for advice and
encouragement. Few excep
tional players take the time to
pass on their knowledge.
"It's the little things he
says," remarked sophomore
tight end Pat Bowe. "If you
drop a pass he'll come up to
you and say 'Oh, that's no
problem.' Everyone on the
team likes him. Everyone re
spects him."
New coaches
Football on the Farm under
went a complete change in
coaching staffs last spring. Ac
cording to Kellar, the team has
profited.
"(Former head coach Jack)
Christiansen was a defensive
player," he said. "He was more
defensively oriented. (New
head coach Bill) Walsh is offen
sive in the way he thinks. The
offense is more sophisticated

than it was last year.
"We have more things to
confuse a defense now. To
learn it, it's not that hard. But
for the defense it is. We put a
lot of backs and receivers in
motion. That throws them off.
"We're a lot more balanced
this year," continued Kellar.
"Last year we felt we had to go
to Tony (Hill) all the time. We
have a better passing attack,
and our play selection is bet
ter."
"(Receiver coach)
Dowhower has given all his
time and effort to coach every
one of us. He's always going
over the game plan so we can
react in certain situations.
"Last year we'd just watch
films," Kellar added. "They
(the coaches) assumed that we
knew what to do, but a lot of
the time we didn't. A year later
we can see that.
"When I come up to the line

this year, I'm looking into the
defensive backfield. When I
get to a certain area, I know
there will be a hole there."
This season Benjamin is the
quarterback, period. Twelve
months ago, Card receivers
had to adjust to two signalcal
lers, the other being Mike
Cordova.
"Guy was a better quarter
back," Kellar stated. "I felt
more confident that the ball
would be easier to catch with
Guy. He had more rapport with

the players.
"Mike was a more vocal
leader. I don't know if that
helped or not. Somedays Mike
was as good as any around. But
usually he threw too hard. And
when he did, he would throw
low."
Started young
Since he was six years old,
Kellar has played football. He
lived across from Hillsboro
High School where his father is
a track coach and teacher. He
