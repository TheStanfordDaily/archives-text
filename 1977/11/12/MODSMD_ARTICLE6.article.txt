# A 						'mentally tough player'
## Phillips tackles challenges on and off field 
### Ben Webster 
Quality, not quantity, might well be senior
Ralph Phillips' perspective regarding the art of
intercepting passes.
For although the veteran Cardinal safety has
absconded with just one pass in three years, that
one was good for 85 yards and a touchdown in
the Cards' 67-14 demolition of Army in 1975. The
return is the second-longest in Stanford history,
and it gave Phillips his first recognition in a long
career which has seen him develop into the
stalwart of the Cardinal defensive backfield.
"That was my first varsity game," Phillips re
called about his playing debut in the Army
game. "That big play seems to have been sort of
a jinx for me, though, as far as my interceptions
since then."
But if Phillips hasn't been able to grab a lot of
errant aerials, he's had plenty of success grab
bing enemy ball carriers. Last year's 58 tackles
put him seventh on the team in that department.
"He's a very good tackier," said head coach
Bill Walsh about the "fine all-around safety."
Today Phillips will play out of the strong side
slot, the position he started at in all 11 games last
season. He played free safety earlier this year
while assistant coach George Seifert shuffled
around his young defensive backfield.
"Ralph has really made things a lot easier for
me this season," Seifert said. "He's been a good
influence on the younger fellows, and his gui
dance has actually allowed some of them to be
able to play."
•> 'Mentally tough'
In addition to his valuable game experience
(he ranks seventh on the team in total playing
time), Phillips is a "mentally tough player. He's
developed a great football sense, but he's also
just a real smart person," said Seifert.
You have to be in order to major in civil en
gineering, the career Ralph has chosen and the
main reason that he chose Stanford over many
other western schools that also recruited him.
"I knew about Stanford's academic reputation
and what I wanted most out of college was a
tough education," said Phillips.
Four years on the Farm with "so many interest
ing, ambitious people" have changed Phillips'
originally "casual" attitude toward studies.
Ralph pulls out all stops during winter and

spring quarters, and he confesses "I'm becom
ing more and more of a red-hot each year."
After graduation in June, Phillips will look for
a job and some experience before applying to
business school: "Stanford Biz sure would be
great."
But for this week at least, Phillips' business
has been on the gridiron. "Stanford football has
always been unpredictable," Phillips said. "Last
week we found nothing going right, and I can
see how San Jose State will be up for this game
because of that 'SC loss. But coach Walsh's at
titude over this week has been great, and that
helped all of us a lot."
As for the Big Game, Phillips said, "You don't
need to even wonder about us being fired for
that one."
The Big Game has an extra-special signifi
cance for Phillips he donned a cardinal varsity
jersey for the first time for the Cal-Stanford
game in 1974 when a 50-yard field goal by Mike
Langford won the contest for the Cards in the
last second.
"Coming from L.A. I'd never even heard of
the Big Game," said Phillips. "But being a part of
that exciting one showed me just perfectly what
the rivalry is all about."
Up until that game, Phillips had played
both ways on the JV scout squad. "I was actually
recruited as a running back," Phillips, last year's
IM 100 meter dash winner, explained. "In high
school I had played a number of positions, but
when they gave me my choice after a while here
I found that safety suited me best."
When not working in the weightroom or the
classroom, Phillips spends much of his remain
ing time in the darkroom photography is a
hobby he took up during his first year here.
But picture-taking isn't Stanford's most valu
able contribution to Phillips' life. Nor is his ath
letic experience. —-
"It's the people," he said. "The students here
are great and in this school's atmosphere I've
had a chance to meet an amazing world of
people other than just the football group that
I'm afraid the players at most other schools are
limited to."
But then, Stanford isn't like most other
schools. And Phillips isn't like most other foot
ball players.

are great and in this school's atmosphere I've
had a chance to meet an amazing world of
people other than just the football group that
I'm afraid the players at most other schools are
limited to."
But then, Stanford isn't like most other
schools. And Phillips isn't like most other foot
ball players.

Cardinal safety Ralph Phillips puts the hit on Washington State receiver
Brian Kelly.
Quality, not quantity, might well be senior
Ralph Phillips' perspective regarding the art of
intercepting passes.
For although the veteran Cardinal safety has
absconded with just one pass in three years, that
one was good for 85 yards and a touchdown in
the Cards' 67-14 demolition of Army in 1975. The
return is the second-longest in Stanford history,
and it gave Phillips his first recognition in a long
career which has seen him develop into the
stalwart of the Cardinal defensive backfield.
"That was my first varsity game," Phillips re
called about his playing debut in the Army
game. "That big play seems to have been sort of
a jinx for me, though, as far as my interceptions
since then."
But if Phillips hasn't been able to grab a lot of
errant aerials, he's had plenty of success grab
bing enemy ball carriers. Last year's 58 tackles
put him seventh on the team in that department.
"He's a very good tackier," said head coach
Bill Walsh about the "fine all-around safety."
Today Phillips will play out of the strong side
slot, the position he started at in all 11 games last
season. He played free safety earlier this year
while assistant coach George Seifert shuffled
around his young defensive backfield.
"Ralph has really made things a lot easier for
me this season," Seifert said. "He's been a good
influence on the younger fellows, and his gui
dance has actually allowed some of them to be
able to play."
•> 'Mentally tough'
In addition to his valuable game experience
(he ranks seventh on the team in total playing
time), Phillips is a "mentally tough player. He's
developed a great football sense, but he's also
just a real smart person," said Seifert.
You have to be in order to major in civil en
gineering, the career Ralph has chosen and the
main reason that he chose Stanford over many
other western schools that also recruited him.
"I knew about Stanford's academic reputation
and what I wanted most out of college was a
tough education," said Phillips.
Four years on the Farm with "so many interest
ing, ambitious people" have changed Phillips'
originally "casual" attitude toward studies.
Ralph pulls out all stops during winter and

spring quarters, and he confesses "I'm becom
ing more and more of a red-hot each year."
After graduation in June, Phillips will look for
a job and some experience before applying to
business school: "Stanford Biz sure would be
great."
But for this week at least, Phillips' business
has been on the gridiron. "Stanford football has
always been unpredictable," Phillips said. "Last
week we found nothing going right, and I can
see how San Jose State will be up for this game
because of that 'SC loss. But coach Walsh's at
titude over this week has been great, and that
helped all of us a lot."
As for the Big Game, Phillips said, "You don't
need to even wonder about us being fired for
that one."
The Big Game has an extra-special signifi
cance for Phillips he donned a cardinal varsity
jersey for the first time for the Cal-Stanford
game in 1974 when a 50-yard field goal by Mike
Langford won the contest for the Cards in the
last second.
"Coming from L.A. I'd never even heard of
the Big Game," said Phillips. "But being a part of
that exciting one showed me just perfectly what
the rivalry is all about."
Up until that game, Phillips had played
both ways on the JV scout squad. "I was actually
recruited as a running back," Phillips, last year's
IM 100 meter dash winner, explained. "In high
school I had played a number of positions, but
when they gave me my choice after a while here
I found that safety suited me best."
When not working in the weightroom or the
classroom, Phillips spends much of his remain
ing time in the darkroom photography is a
hobby he took up during his first year here.
But picture-taking isn't Stanford's most valu
able contribution to Phillips' life. Nor is his ath
letic experience. —-

limited to."

schools. And Phillips isn't like most other foot
ball players.
