# Small looms large in SJS backfield

The San Jose State Spartans have given up an average of 25
points a game. A contributing factor to their lack of defense has
been the absence of injured cornerback Gerald Small, regarded
by many as a pro prospect.
Small was an honorable mention Ail-American last season and
was a preseason Ail-American this year. With an impressive 38
unassisted tackles, he was the seventh-leading tackier on the
Spartans in 1976.
After performing up to his reputation for the first two games in
1977, Small separated a shoulder against Cal St.-Fullerton. He was
sidelined for six weeks until the Spartans took on Hawaii at home
last weekend.
"My timing may have been a little off last week," Small said,
"but I haven't suffered too much because of the nature of the
injury. I had to wear a harness for two weeks to restrict my arm
movement, but after that I was able to start exercises and run
ning. I could have played two weeks ago."
Small's team at Desert High in Edwards, Calif., at one time
faced a squad with quite a formidable quarterback. His name was
Guy Benjamin.
"He really throws it hard," said Small. "It makes it tougher on
the defensive backs."
Last year against Stanford, Small was the Spartans' one-man
pass defense. The talented cornerback amassed 12 tackles and
intercepted a Benjamin pass, returning it for 54 yards.
Other Spartans to keep the binoculars on are quarterback Ed
Luther, linebacker Randy Gill and halfback Kevin Cole.
Luther entered seven games last season, completing 28 of 49
for 339 yards and three touchdowns. So far this year he has
thrown for 1066 yards with a .465 completion rate and six scores.
Cole is a junior transfer from Harbor College. He has taken up
the slack in the Spartan offense left by the absence of fullback
James Tucker, the Spartans' second-leading rusher from 1976.
Cole has run for 596 yards and has made seven trips to the
endzone this season.
