# Out of the doghouse
## New coaches give Finley new life 
### Emilie Deutsch 
"Finley the ball carrier." The
Stanford fullback has a first
name, though and a life-off
the football field. The first
name is John and the life has
been rather inconsistent with
the typical Stanford football
experience.
"Most football players enter
quietly, play their four years of
football and leave," said Doug
Single, a Stanford assistant
coach. "John justisn'tthatkind
of person."
Finley had an excellent
sophomore year at fullback
gaining 343 yards in 70 carries
for three touchdowns. But his
junior year was marred by a
back injury during spring foot
ball and, consequently, he saw
a lot less time on the field.
"There was a point where we
didn't know if I was ever going
to play again," said Finley.
But to "Finley the ball car
rier" football is as much a part
of his everyday routine as
brushing his teeth.
"When you play football for
seven or eight years it gets to
be a habit," said Finley. "It
wasn't really a matter of being
motivated to get back into
shape after my injury, it just
seemed like the only thing to
do."
So Finley rehabilitated and
returned to the field, but he
didn't play.
On the bench
Apparently Finley fell into
disfavor with the coaching
staff. But Dave Currey, last
year's offensive backfield
coach who is now head coach
at Long Beach State, refuted
the implication of any rift with
Finley.
"There was nobody closer to
ourfamily than John was," said
Currey. "I've got a lot of re
spect for him to come back
after his injury. He's been real
dedicated and hasn't given up
the sport he loves."

Single, one of two assistants
held over in new head coach
Bill Walsh's staff, was Finley's
JV coach and had some reasons
why Finley saw less playing
time last year.
"Inconsistency in practice,"
said Single, "is probably the
one reason why Finley didn't
play last year. Now he is very
consistent. In addition to that,
he had some tough competi
tion."
Keeping company with Phil
Francis, Dave Tenn and Don
Stevenson, it's easy to see how
Finley could have lost some
desire to secure a starting posi
tion. This year with Tenn and
Stevenson having graduated,
and Francis injured, Finley has
"a new motivating force so that
he can see his own potential,"
said Single.
"Finley was perplexed about
his performance last year,"
said Single, "but realizing this
is his senior year, he can actu
ally see his own contributions
to the team. John won the spot,
stepped in, and made every
thing he could of the oppor
tunity."
Finley is apparently bloom
ing under the fresh breath of a
new staff, although he refuses
to compare it to the previous
staff.
"They know the system
they're implementing totally,"
said Finley about Walsh's
coaching entourage. "Every
thing we do out there is for a
purpose, everything has a
reason and an explanation."
There is even an explana
tion, put forth by Single, con
cerning Finley's renewed
prominence; the attentiveness
of Denny Green, the new
backfield coach, has brought
Finley out of the sideline
shadows.
"Denny has a lot of patience.
This year he's gotten a lot out
of John that we didn't have to
before," said Single.

And there's a lot more to Fin
ley than what any coach can get
out of him.
A sociology major, Finley
wants to attend law school and
return to his San Diego com
munity so he can "help out."
Tough neighborhood
"It's pretty bad where I live,"
said Finley. "All the people I
grew up with either went to
jail, or a couple of them got
killed, and the rest are just
walking up and down the
streets. It's nice to be able to
come out of something like
that."
Finley has emerged with fly
ing colors and a realistic sense
of his future.
"To go to college for four
years just to play football is tak
ing a chance. You might get
hurt, or you might not be good
enough to play at all, and
you've got to get something
else out,of it," said Finley.
"Since you're going to have to
go to class and maintain
academic eligibility, you might
as well go someplace where
that's going to benefit you."
Finley's decision to attend
Stanford, which he chose from
a field of about 40 schools, has
undeniably benefited this
year's squad. Finley's better at
titude has helped the team,
too.
The ball carrier's friendly,
outgoing manner may have
appeared as a sign of apathy
when the team wasn't winning
last year, according to Single.
And Finley agrees, "The better
the team does, the better the

coaches and players get
along." But this year his moti
vation has returned.
"We see individual plays that
have worked for pro teams and
think 'lf the Bengals can do it,
and the Chargers can do it,
hell, we can do it too.' "

This determination and a
certain amount of seriousness
must come from the realization
that this is Finley's last year of
football.
"I'm looking forward to the
Cal game," said the 6-foot-2,
