# Kennedy speaks at Medical School

### Andrea James David Lampe 
"The public deserves to participate
much more fully in the evaluation,
development and implementation of
our national policy toward science
and medical research," Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) told more than
500 faculty members and students
late Friday afternoon in Fairchild Au
ditorium.
Kennedy, chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on Health, visited
Stanford Friday as part of a fact
finding tour seeking citizen input re
lated to health and science policies.
Earlier in the day, Kennedy met
with various faculty members to dis
cuss recommendations for heart dis
ease prevention and the issues sur
rounding recombinant DNA re
search.
He also met with about 30 medical
students and clinical scholars to dis
cuss primary health care education.
Potential threat
"The greatest potential threat to
science is the lack of public under
standing and public participation,"
Kennedy said during his speech on
biomedical research and health
manpower policies.
Kennedy is the sponsor of a bill
which seeks to restrict the conduct of
recombinant DNA research. Ken
nedy said earlier in New York that he
had decided to withdraw the bill in
definitely and to replace it with a bill
to extend the National Institute of
Health guidelines for this research to
the private sector for one year.
Kennedy said he believes the fed
eral government must take several
steps to support health science prog
rams.
Stable support
"First, we must guarantee stable
and continuing support for biomedi
cal and behavioral research, includ
ing a core of support for basic re
search," he said. "Second, we must
develop a greater capacity for sys
tematically allocating our research
dollars among the health sciences."
He added that "one of our highest
priorities must be to correct the
funding imbalance at the National
Institute of Health, without curtailing
our progress in the war on cancer."
He also said that biomedical re
searchers can help the problem by
taking more initiatives in "identifying
research areas and disciplines which
have been neglected."
Required admissions
Kennedy also explained the Se
nate's position on health manpower
legislation, which requires American
medical schools to admit U.S. citi
zens studying at foreign medical

schools, whether or not the students
meet university qualifying examina
tions.
"The current law is an unwar
ranted intrusion by the federal gov
ernment into academic medicine. It
violates a basic academic freedom —
the freedom of a medical school to
select its own students in a nondis
criminatory way," Kennedy said.
Two weeks ago, the Senate voted
to repeal the existing law. The Senate
and House must now meet in con
ference to formulate a compromise.
Kennedy said, "However that con
ference comes out, the Congress will
have, at a minimum, reaffirmed its
commitment to the independence
and integrity of the nation's univer
sities."
Kennedy's talk was sponsored by
the Robert Wood Johnson Founda
tion's Clinical Scholars Program at
Stanford.
DNA hazards
Earlier, Kennedy had met with a
group of Stanford researchers to dis
cuss the hazards of recombinant
DNA experiments and public aware
ness of the issue.
Speaking of the safety of handling
potentially dangerous life forms,
Prof, of Genetics Stan Cohen
claimed that scientists have long had
"overall mechanisms for dealing
with these problems as they come
up," and that government restric
tions are unnecessary.
Biochemistry Prof. David Hogness
summarized the views of his col
leagues on DNA experimentation by
saying, "all the facts say it's not
dangerous."
Kennedy said he was particularly
interested in hearing the experts'
views on the necessity and problems
of "interfacing with the public in
broad policy issues."
Citing the "increasing power of
science and technology to influence
the health and well-being of indi
viduals," Hal Holman, Guggenheim
Prof, of Immunology, said, "The in
terface of the citizen and the scientist
is essential."
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich indicated
that biologists demonstrated "an ex
traordinary level of social responsi
bility" by calling a moratorium on re
combinant experiments in 1974. He
said that adverse public reaction now
threatens to "turn off the dialogue"
between scientists and society. "Sci
entists have not informed the public
enough to make intelligent deci
sions," he admitted.
Kennedy agreed, saying that the
policy makers themselves are
"generalists" and need to be in
' formed on sensitive technical issues.

national policy toward science and medical research in a speech at Fairchild
Auditorium in the Medical School late Friday afternoon. Kennedy had spent the
whole day at the Medical Center talking with numerous students, faculty and
administrators.
