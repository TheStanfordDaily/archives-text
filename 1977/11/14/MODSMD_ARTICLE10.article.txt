Alternate mascot
Stanford's novel botanical mascot
for athletics, the Sequoia tree, is just
great. For contingencies, however
(such as 49-0 recently in L.A.),
we should consider an alternate
plant, Epigaea, the Trailing Arbutus.

Indian coal deposits
By U.S. treaty, many southwstern
coal deposits belong to Indian tribes.
Strictly speaking, then, strip-mining
this coal requires tribal consent, and
due respect for the Indians' human

and legal rights, individual and col
lective. But it may not be happening
that way. Indeed, there is reason to
believe that some current dealings
bearing on Indian mineral rights are
rather high-handed.
The Hopis are a good case in point.
The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) deals with them almost exclu
sively through the "Hopi Tribal
Council." But many of the tribe claim
that the council, despite its trap
pings, is not legitimate. The council,
they say, was set up by the BIA itself,
staffed with a few Washington
minded Hopis, and foisted onto the
tribe willy nilly. So when the BIA and
the council "bargain," the result is

really just a series of sweetheart de
als. And these deals have repeatedly
ignored majority Hopi opinion, de
nied non-council Hopis due process
of law, and badly violated the Hopi
constitution.
Now, there is concern that the BIA
and the council are pushing ahead
with Hopi coal development illeg
ally. Not just illegally, but fast — be
fore many Hopis have a fair chance to
be heard. The coal issue is crucial
because strip-mining would mean
permanent Hopi relocation. And the
traditional Hopi way of life — religion
if you will — is inextricably rooted in
the plqj of land they now hold. An
honest vote, open to the entire tribe,
seems essential.
Council opponents are seeking to
use upcoming hearings (Indian
Claims Commission Docket 196) as a
forum. The danger, though, is that
the hearing will be hasty, and that the
BIA will keep tight control of the ball.
On Nov. 11, some people will be
sending Personal Opinion Telegrams
(any 15 word message, $2) to Presi
dent Carter, asking him personally to
insure an impartial hearing, and an
investigation of the BIA and the
council, if that becomes appropriate.
I have decided to join them.
I don't believe we can just shrug
off the kinds of charges being made.
Particularly when the alleged victims
are the sort who most need the law's
protection: few in number, different
from the rest of us, poor, and far
away. A shrug would imply that cer
tain moral lines are yet to be drawn.
Which would leave the unsettling
questions of where, finally, those
lines would be drawn, when, and by
whom.

'All that money'
I graduated from Stanford a year
and some months ago, and I have
been working since then to pay off
my student loans. In the past 12
months I have paid $4282.33 towards
my loans — all that I had left over
after rent, food and a few frivolous
expenses were paid. It occurred to
me that that amount (my whole
year's savings, working diligently)
would not even pay the tuition for a
year at Stanford now.
Thank goodness for loans, or I
never would have graduated from
such a fine school as Stanford.
I'm told that were it not for gifts to
Stanford in the form of endowments,
etc. (gifts for which I periodically re
ceive solicitations from the venera
ble alumni association), tuition
would be even higher these days.
Where does all that money (includ
ing my tuition payments) go?
It's sad that when one speaks of
"higher" education nowadays one
speaks of the cost, as well as the qual
ity.

Daily photo
The Nov. 7 issue of the Daily car
ried Paul Hariton's objection to the
"oppressive" photo of two gay men
kissing (Daily, Nov. 1). His objection
makes me wonder if his conscience
is disturbing him and if he feels a
little unsure about the validity of gay
pride, gay rights, and gay as an ac
ceptable, alternative lifestyle.
After all, the Daily merely printed a
photo of an actual event, with only a
brief, neutral comment that the men

were two of the participants in the
Polk Street event.
Perhaps the two lovers should be
congratulated for "coming out" in
public, for "expressing their
brotherhood," and "being un
ashamed of their sexuality." If gay is
synonymous with natural and beauti
ful, then the two were merely being
natural and beautiful, with nothing
to hide.
Maybe they were even doing us
straights a favor by permitting us to
see how open and expressive gay
love can be. Those of us who found
the picture a disgusting example of
blatant indiscretion perhaps need to
be re-educated so we can overcome
our uptight, red-neck attitudes.
If Hariton is embarrassed by his
"brothers" and their public display
of sexual attraction, perhaps he
should blame them and not the
Daily.

Cal banner
We feel compelled to respond to
the semi-factual article in your in
flammatory rag (Daily, Oct. 31), re
garding our misplacing of the
California banner.
The execution did occur roughly as
described. However, the account ot
the escape is somewhat inaccurate.
There were only two goons pursuing
Zete Tom Pederson. As for the
Doberman Pinscher, investigation
seems to disclose that it was actually
a Stanfurd (sic) dolly looking for
some action. Additionally, the in
jured Rally Committee member suf
fered only a sprained, not broken,
ankle.
Pederson's remaining on the
scene was not a matter of choice

prompted by humanitarian instinct,
but more a result of being tackled.
Had the other committee member,
who was sitting on Pederson,
realized that Pederson was attempt
ing to get up and run to the aid of the
injured man rather than escape, he
would certainly have released him
posthaste.
We would like to commend the
remainder of the thieves for finding
their way to Blimpie's. Generally
considered the choice of lower-class
dirt-bags, Blimpie's is also the beer
hall closest to the stadium. Such
finely developed homing instincts
are generally found only in winos
and homing pigeons.
A crash program is now underway
to adapt our cannon to fire 3-inch
shells. Our cannoneer feels he could
easily hit a moped at 1000 yards.
(Maybe when you guys get older you
can have a real motorcycle!)
We won't hold the theft against
you. After you finish your two-year
air-conditioning programs down
there at the junior University (sic),
you're welcome to come up here to
the big leagues and tinish your de
grees.
Golden Bear
P.S. The 86-year-old Cal alumni (sic)
who was knocked over in the process
of grabbing the banner is recouperat
ing (sic) in her (sic) home in the Ber
keley hills.
(Ed. 's note: The Daily's policy is not
to publish letters without the au
thor's name. However, since the
Dirty Golden Bear has obviously
taken a UC-Berkeley freshmen En
glish course in order to join
thousands ot other Cal students in an
attempt to become semi-literate, we
are making an exception to our pol
icy.)
