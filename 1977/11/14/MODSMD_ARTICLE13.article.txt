# Quebec separatists don't want total split
## 
### 
Montreal (AP) — The Parti
Quebecois swept to power a
year ago preaching indepen
dence for French-speaking
Quebec. Now the party says
separatism doesn't have to
mean a complete parting of
ways.
"We are pragmatic people.
Why stay married when you
can live together and still keep
the union alive?" explains
Camille Laurin, architect of cul
tural policy and key cabinet
minister to Premier Rene
Levesque.
"We have no intention of
demolishing our links with
Canada. What we are seeking
is a new contract with the fed
eral government — one that
will be mutually profitable and
recognize the sovereignty of
Quebec."
But Marc Lalonde, the fed
eral cabinet minister in charge
of provincial relations who is
leading Ottawa's opposition to
the separatists, says the new
terminology is "nothing but a
smokes-screen to mask
eveutual independence" that
would spell disaster for
Quebec.
About the only thing the
Parti Quebecois and its oppo
nents agree on these days is
that Quebec is at the cross

roads of a new era. And the
province's uncertain future is
hurting business, muddying
relations with the rest of
Canada and even hampering
the PQ government itself.
"We have lived together for
too many years and Quebecers
are feeling the restlessness that
comes with middle age," exp
lains Michel Robert, policy
chairman of Quebec's opposi
tion Liberal Party which seeks
to keep the province within the
110-year-old Canadian confed
eration.
"The marriage may not be a
good one, but it's better than
living alone."
Quebec, twice the size of
Texas and the largest of Cana
da's 10 provinces, has an 80 per
cent French-speaking majority
in its population of 6.2 million.
Like other Canadian provinces,
it enjoys an autonomy far grea
ter than a state in the United
States.
But the mechanics of how
Quebec could split from the
rest of Canada have not really
been worked out.
Separatism had been brew
ing for decades in Quebec, fed
by resentment at the economic
domination of the province by
"Anglos" and concern that its
French heritage was being lost.

On Nov. 15, 1976, the Parti
Quebecois scored a dramatic
victory in provincial elections
by drawing on widespread dis
satisfaction with Robert
Bourassa's ruling Liberal gov
ernment.
Levesque, the popular and
articulate new premier, prom
ised to hold a referendum be
fore 1980 on whether the pro
vince should become inde
pendent.
The major achievement of
the PQ at home has been legis
lation making French the offi
cial language of the province
and decreeing that all new
comers to the province must
study in French schools. The
bill has been widely defied in
English-language schools.
Levesque recently returned
home triumphant from an offi
cial visit to France where he
was greeted with exceptional
warmth by President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing and awarded
the nation's highest civilian
honor, the Medal of the Legion
of Honor.
But Quebec has come no
closer to nationhood than be
fore. No date has yet been set
for the referendum — al
though it is expected in 1979 —
and even its wording is the sub
ject of heated debate.

Bourassa's administration
was marked by a sagging
economy and alleged corrup
tion. Under the PQ govern
ment, Quebec still maintains
the highest unemployment
rate in Canada, nearly 10 per
cent compared to the national
average of 8.5 per cent. The
economic situation has been
made worse by the recent
flight of some business head
quarters from Montreal to To
ronto as a result of Quebec's
cloudy future.
Bernard J. Finestone, insur
ance broker and honorary
chairman of the Montreal
Board of Trade, says the Leves
que government is "dreaming
in Technicolor" about the
feasibility of its separatist
policies.
"They want to rip Quebec
out of Canada and then turn to
the other provinces and de

mand a Common Market-style
association. It is totally impos
sible to achieve," Finestone
declared.
Opposition leaders claim the
Parti Quebecois is not receiv
ing widespread supportand, to
save face, has redefined
separatism in less ominous
terms of a "sovereign
association."
Robert, who is trying to re
build the shattered Liberal
Party, argues: "It doesn't mat
ter if you call it separatism, in
dependence or a sovereign
association. We would be a
weaker, smaller country."
Sixteen citizens groups have
sprouted in recent months to
mobilize public sentiment
against separatism in time for
the referendum. The largest of
these groups, Quebec-
Canada, claims 100,000 follow
ers.
