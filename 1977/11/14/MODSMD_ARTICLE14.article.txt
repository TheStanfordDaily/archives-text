# Italian communists called democratic
## 
### Cheryl Eschbach 
Italy's Communist Party is
"totally democratic and totally
non-dangerous," stated the
Italian Consul General in a
speech at La Casa Italiana
Wednesday evening.
Sharing "purely personal"
reflections on various aspects
of Italy, Paolo Mussa of the Ita
lian Consulate in San Francisco
said "Italianized" communism
reflects the national character
of the Italian people, making it
impossible for the Soviet
Union to "export" ideology
there.
Mussa alleged that Com

munist Party leader Enrico Ber
liguer said the PCI (Italian
Communist Party) "no longer
held any attachment to the
theories ot Marx and Lenin" in
his recent speech at the Soviet
Union's anniversary celebra
tions.
The Consul General de
scribed Italy's political system
as the "ultimate in democ
racy." Parliament is both rep
resentative and sovereign, he
said; functioning as a "halfway
house" of political com
promise, it allows no party to
dominate.
"Italians are just too indi
vidualistic to form a majority
political party," he said. Mus
solini's Fascist Party govern
ment of 1923-43 was the "great
exception" to the Italians' his
toric aversion to authoritarian
rule, he added.
The Consul General expres
sed his hopes for a coalition
government in Italy. This
would end nearly 30 years ot
DC (Christian Democrat)
single-party rule, several years
ot the PCl's tacit "government
by abstention," and mark an
unprecedented com nunist
party rule in Western Europe.
The nation's political senti
ments already reflect condi
tions tavorable to bipartisan
rule, hecontenaed, with4oper
cent "center," 40 per cent
"left," and 20 per cent unde
cided. The PSI (Socialist Party)
which makes up 10 per cent of
the left wing, was not cited as
an impediment to such two
party governance.
Italy's beleaguered economy
is beginning'to face brighter
prospects, Mussa said. Citing
government reports that ba
lances of trade and payments

have improved in recent
months, Mussa stated that the
economy is becoming man
ageable in spite of "very seri
ous" obstacles.
One such obstacle is Italy's
virtual dependence on imports
tor all raw materials. This has
made it especially vulnerable
to the global inflation and
quadrupled oil prices of the
19705. It has also greatly in
creased the price of domestic
production, he added.
To alleviate Italy's oil depen
dency, the Consul General said
the government plans to invest
in extensive nuclear power
reactor development.
Public opposition to the
government proposal has been
mounting.
Overpopulation poses
another problem to normal
economic activity. A country
thesizeofCalifornia, Italyhasa
population of 55 million, three
times that of this state.
Mussa took a dispassionate
view of the anarchy and vio
lence proliferating in Italy. Be
cause the terrorists are a "great
minority," they pose no real
threat to social stability, he
said.
In recent months, terrorist
groups ranging from the ultra
left "armed proletarian nuclei"
to the "Rosso Brigate" and
ultra-rightist factions have
been expressing their disillu
sionment with the PCl's "em
bourgeoisiement" and the en
tire Italian state in student de
monstiations and outbursts of
violence often aimed explicitly
at leading establishment fi
gures.

In recent months, terrorist
groups ranging from the ultra
left "armed proletarian nuclei"
to the "Rosso Brigate" and
ultra-rightist factions have
been expressing their disillu
sionment with the PCl's "em
bourgeoisiement" and the en
tire Italian state in student de
monstiations and outbursts of
violence often aimed explicitly
at leading establishment fi
gures.
Italy's Communist Party is
"totally democratic and totally
non-dangerous," stated the
Italian Consul General in a
speech at La Casa Italiana
Wednesday evening.
Sharing "purely personal"
reflections on various aspects
of Italy, Paolo Mussa of the Ita
lian Consulate in San Francisco
said "Italianized" communism
reflects the national character
of the Italian people, making it
impossible for the Soviet
Union to "export" ideology
there.
Mussa alleged that Com

munist Party leader Enrico Ber
liguer said the PCI (Italian
Communist Party) "no longer
held any attachment to the
theories ot Marx and Lenin" in
his recent speech at the Soviet
Union's anniversary celebra
tions.
The Consul General de
scribed Italy's political system
as the "ultimate in democ
racy." Parliament is both rep
resentative and sovereign, he
said; functioning as a "halfway
house" of political com
promise, it allows no party to
dominate.
"Italians are just too indi
vidualistic to form a majority
political party," he said. Mus
solini's Fascist Party govern
ment of 1923-43 was the "great
exception" to the Italians' his
toric aversion to authoritarian
rule, he added.
The Consul General expres
sed his hopes for a coalition
government in Italy. This
would end nearly 30 years ot
DC (Christian Democrat)
single-party rule, several years
ot the PCl's tacit "government
by abstention," and mark an
unprecedented com nunist
party rule in Western Europe.
The nation's political senti
ments already reflect condi
tions tavorable to bipartisan
rule, hecontenaed, with4oper
cent "center," 40 per cent
"left," and 20 per cent unde
cided. The PSI (Socialist Party)
which makes up 10 per cent of
the left wing, was not cited as
an impediment to such two
party governance.
Italy's beleaguered economy
is beginning'to face brighter
prospects, Mussa said. Citing
government reports that ba
lances of trade and payments

have improved in recent
months, Mussa stated that the
economy is becoming man
ageable in spite of "very seri
ous" obstacles.
One such obstacle is Italy's
virtual dependence on imports
tor all raw materials. This has
made it especially vulnerable
to the global inflation and
quadrupled oil prices of the
19705. It has also greatly in
creased the price of domestic
production, he added.
To alleviate Italy's oil depen
dency, the Consul General said
the government plans to invest
in extensive nuclear power
reactor development.
Public opposition to the
government proposal has been
mounting.
Overpopulation poses
another problem to normal
economic activity. A country
thesizeofCalifornia, Italyhasa
population of 55 million, three
times that of this state.
Mussa took a dispassionate
view of the anarchy and vio
lence proliferating in Italy. Be
cause the terrorists are a "great
minority," they pose no real
threat to social stability, he
said.
