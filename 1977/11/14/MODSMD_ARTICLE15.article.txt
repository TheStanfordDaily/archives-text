# Blood-drive organizers seek more donors
## 
### Barbara Anscher 
As if energy and water shor
tages weren't enough, another
shortage has hit the University
which can have immediate and
dire consequences. There is a
shortage of blood.
Last year, the Stanford Uni
versity Hospital and Children's
Hospital used over 56,000 pints
of blood to treat accident vic
tims and diseases such as
cancer, hemophilia and heart
disorder.
This year, the addition of a
new intensive-care wing at the
hospital would require 40 per
cent or about 22,400 more pi nts
of blood annually.
The huge quantity of blood is
being provided by a small
group of persons. In fact, only
three to five per cent of all elig
ible donors in the nation actu
ally give blood, according to
senior Marilee Unruh, co
chairperson of Stanford Red
Cross blood drives.
Local blood
"Blood for the hospital has
to come locally and when it is
needed, or it just won't be

there. If it isn't there, you have
to cut down on research in
such areas as open-heart
surgery," Unruh said.
She said the hospital uses
456 pints of blood a month for
heart surgery alone.
Working with senior Lisa
Eshman, Unruh is in charge of
finding at least 35 donors prior
to each campus blood drive.
Usually, the donors come
from her personal contact
pool.
The drives are coordinated
with the Red Cross, which
selects dates for setting up
bloodmobiles at residences or
periodically in Tresidder Un
ion. The drive is sponsored by
Alpha Phi Omega, the service
fraternity.
"The people who respond
are those who have grown up
with the idea of giving blood.
To get first-time donors, it usu
ally takes some face-to-face
talking," Unruh said.
In order to get new donors,
most groups at Stanford "go
the personal recruitment route
and then back it up with adver

tising," according to Lee Fort,
director of donor resources at
the Red Cross blood center.
Students, faculty, staff
Fort said 9% units of blood
were donated by Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff bet
ween July 1976 and July 1977.
"We need 85 units per day or
1900 per month and we haven t
hit 1900 yet. Last month we
reached 1750. We need to go to
more donor sources," he said.
"We get many new donors
each year from Stanford. Five
hundred eighty-three of the
966 units donated last year
came from new donors," Fort
said.
The blood given by one
donor can be separated into
four different parts. Red cells
help many anemic children by
increasing the oxygen ex
change throughout their sys
tems. Red cells are also used in
surgery, particularly open
heart, Unruh said.
Plasma is used for treatment
of burns and shock as it helps
prevent infections. Platelets
are used in treating leukemia

and other forms of cancer.
Cryoprecipitate arrests bleed
ing in hemophilic patients.
Stanford Medical Center has
the equipment to freeze
blood. This allows doctors to
use the blood up to 21 days
after it is taken. Unruh said the
ability to store blood only ac
centuates the need for people
to give blood consistently be
cause "it is difficult to store it
when you have a burst of
people (donors)."
According to Unruh, it takes
about one hour to go through
the entire process of donating
blood. Only five to 10 minutes
is actually used to draw blood.
Most of the time is used for a
medical examination prior to
the extraction of blood and
mandatory refreshments af
terwards.
"People tend to find it an
overall pleasant experience,
odd as that may sound," Unruh
said. "After all, you're actually
forced to sit and eat cookies
afterwards. And it makes you
feel like you're doing some
thing good."

"Each person has 10 to 12
pints of blood in him, and
you're giving less than a pint. It
only takes 48 hours to get the
total blood volume back up,"
Unruh said.
She concluded that fear of
giving blood does not keep
donors away, but misconcep
tions about who is qualified to
be a donor do stop many
people from participating in
blood drives.
In order to give blood, a per
son must be between the ages
of 17 and 65 and must weigh
over 110 pounds. Anyone who
is ill or is on medication is
excluded. However, those tak
ing birth control pills or low
doses of tetracycline are ac
ceptable donors.
The next blood drive will be
held today from noon to 3 p.m.
upstairs at Tresidder. There
will beanotheron Nov. 18from
1 to 4 p.m. at Lagunita Court.
Any one who wishes to give
blood during other hours can
make an appointment by cal
ling the Red Cross Stanford
Blood Center.

As the need for blood increases, student organizers have been making
efforts to get new donors into the blood-giving habit.
As if energy and water shor
tages weren't enough, another
shortage has hit the University
which can have immediate and
dire consequences. There is a
shortage of blood.
Last year, the Stanford Uni
versity Hospital and Children's
Hospital used over 56,000 pints
of blood to treat accident vic
tims and diseases such as
cancer, hemophilia and heart
disorder.
This year, the addition of a
new intensive-care wing at the
hospital would require 40 per
cent or about 22,400 more pi nts
of blood annually.
The huge quantity of blood is
being provided by a small
group of persons. In fact, only
three to five per cent of all elig
ible donors in the nation actu
ally give blood, according to
senior Marilee Unruh, co
chairperson of Stanford Red
Cross blood drives.
Local blood
"Blood for the hospital has
to come locally and when it is
needed, or it just won't be

there. If it isn't there, you have
to cut down on research in
such areas as open-heart
surgery," Unruh said.
She said the hospital uses
456 pints of blood a month for
heart surgery alone.
Working with senior Lisa
Eshman, Unruh is in charge of
finding at least 35 donors prior
to each campus blood drive.
Usually, the donors come
from her personal contact
pool.
The drives are coordinated
with the Red Cross, which
selects dates for setting up
bloodmobiles at residences or
periodically in Tresidder Un
ion. The drive is sponsored by
Alpha Phi Omega, the service
fraternity.
"The people who respond
are those who have grown up
with the idea of giving blood.
To get first-time donors, it usu
ally takes some face-to-face
talking," Unruh said.
In order to get new donors,
most groups at Stanford "go
the personal recruitment route
and then back it up with adver

tising," according to Lee Fort,
director of donor resources at
the Red Cross blood center.
Students, faculty, staff
Fort said 9% units of blood
were donated by Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff bet
ween July 1976 and July 1977.
"We need 85 units per day or
1900 per month and we haven t
hit 1900 yet. Last month we
reached 1750. We need to go to
more donor sources," he said.
"We get many new donors
each year from Stanford. Five
hundred eighty-three of the
966 units donated last year
came from new donors," Fort
said.
The blood given by one
donor can be separated into
four different parts. Red cells
help many anemic children by
increasing the oxygen ex
change throughout their sys
tems. Red cells are also used in
surgery, particularly open
heart, Unruh said.
Plasma is used for treatment
of burns and shock as it helps
prevent infections. Platelets
are used in treating leukemia

and other forms of cancer.
Cryoprecipitate arrests bleed
ing in hemophilic patients.
Stanford Medical Center has
the equipment to freeze
blood. This allows doctors to
use the blood up to 21 days
after it is taken. Unruh said the
ability to store blood only ac
centuates the need for people
to give blood consistently be
cause "it is difficult to store it
when you have a burst of
people (donors)."
According to Unruh, it takes
about one hour to go through
the entire process of donating
blood. Only five to 10 minutes
is actually used to draw blood.
Most of the time is used for a
medical examination prior to
the extraction of blood and
mandatory refreshments af
terwards.
"People tend to find it an
overall pleasant experience,
odd as that may sound," Unruh
said. "After all, you're actually
forced to sit and eat cookies
afterwards. And it makes you
feel like you're doing some
thing good."

"Each person has 10 to 12
pints of blood in him, and
you're giving less than a pint. It
only takes 48 hours to get the
total blood volume back up,"
Unruh said.
She concluded that fear of
giving blood does not keep
donors away, but misconcep
tions about who is qualified to
be a donor do stop many
people from participating in
blood drives.
In order to give blood, a per
son must be between the ages
of 17 and 65 and must weigh
over 110 pounds. Anyone who
is ill or is on medication is
excluded. However, those tak
ing birth control pills or low
doses of tetracycline are ac
ceptable donors.
The next blood drive will be
held today from noon to 3 p.m.
upstairs at Tresidder. There
will beanotheron Nov. 18from
1 to 4 p.m. at Lagunita Court.
Any one who wishes to give
blood during other hours can
make an appointment by cal
ling the Red Cross Stanford
Blood Center.

As the need for blood increases, student organizers have been making
efforts to get new donors into the blood-giving habit.
As if energy and water shor
tages weren't enough, another
shortage has hit the University
which can have immediate and
dire consequences. There is a
shortage of blood.
Last year, the Stanford Uni
versity Hospital and Children's
Hospital used over 56,000 pints
of blood to treat accident vic
tims and diseases such as
cancer, hemophilia and heart
disorder.
This year, the addition of a
new intensive-care wing at the
hospital would require 40 per
cent or about 22,400 more pi nts
of blood annually.
The huge quantity of blood is
being provided by a small
group of persons. In fact, only
three to five per cent of all elig
ible donors in the nation actu
ally give blood, according to
senior Marilee Unruh, co
chairperson of Stanford Red
Cross blood drives.
Local blood
"Blood for the hospital has
to come locally and when it is
needed, or it just won't be

there. If it isn't there, you have
to cut down on research in
such areas as open-heart
surgery," Unruh said.
She said the hospital uses
456 pints of blood a month for
heart surgery alone.
Working with senior Lisa
Eshman, Unruh is in charge of
finding at least 35 donors prior
to each campus blood drive.
Usually, the donors come
from her personal contact
pool.
The drives are coordinated
with the Red Cross, which
selects dates for setting up
bloodmobiles at residences or
periodically in Tresidder Un
ion. The drive is sponsored by
Alpha Phi Omega, the service
fraternity.
"The people who respond
are those who have grown up
with the idea of giving blood.
To get first-time donors, it usu
ally takes some face-to-face
talking," Unruh said.
In order to get new donors,
most groups at Stanford "go
the personal recruitment route
and then back it up with adver

tising," according to Lee Fort,
director of donor resources at
the Red Cross blood center.
Students, faculty, staff
Fort said 9% units of blood
were donated by Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff bet
ween July 1976 and July 1977.
"We need 85 units per day or
1900 per month and we haven t
hit 1900 yet. Last month we
reached 1750. We need to go to
more donor sources," he said.
"We get many new donors
each year from Stanford. Five
hundred eighty-three of the
966 units donated last year
came from new donors," Fort
said.
The blood given by one
donor can be separated into
four different parts. Red cells
help many anemic children by
increasing the oxygen ex
change throughout their sys
tems. Red cells are also used in
surgery, particularly open
heart, Unruh said.
Plasma is used for treatment
of burns and shock as it helps
prevent infections. Platelets
are used in treating leukemia

and other forms of cancer.
Cryoprecipitate arrests bleed
ing in hemophilic patients.
Stanford Medical Center has
the equipment to freeze
blood. This allows doctors to
use the blood up to 21 days
after it is taken. Unruh said the
ability to store blood only ac
centuates the need for people
to give blood consistently be
cause "it is difficult to store it
when you have a burst of
people (donors)."
According to Unruh, it takes
about one hour to go through
the entire process of donating
blood. Only five to 10 minutes
is actually used to draw blood.
Most of the time is used for a
medical examination prior to
the extraction of blood and
mandatory refreshments af
terwards.
"People tend to find it an
overall pleasant experience,
odd as that may sound," Unruh
said. "After all, you're actually
forced to sit and eat cookies
afterwards. And it makes you
feel like you're doing some
thing good."

"Each person has 10 to 12
pints of blood in him, and
you're giving less than a pint. It
only takes 48 hours to get the
total blood volume back up,"
Unruh said.
She concluded that fear of
giving blood does not keep
donors away, but misconcep
tions about who is qualified to
be a donor do stop many
people from participating in
blood drives.
In order to give blood, a per
son must be between the ages
of 17 and 65 and must weigh
over 110 pounds. Anyone who
is ill or is on medication is
excluded. However, those tak
ing birth control pills or low
doses of tetracycline are ac
ceptable donors.
The next blood drive will be
held today from noon to 3 p.m.
upstairs at Tresidder. There
will beanotheron Nov. 18from
1 to 4 p.m. at Lagunita Court.
