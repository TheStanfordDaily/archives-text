# Too smart to be a tenant?

Too smart to get an apartment?
It may seem hard to believe, but that could be the case in
New York City where a judge has ruled that a landlord can
discriminate against "intelligent persons, aware of their
rights, who may give him trouble in the future."
The judge also said a landlord could use occupation as a
basis for deciding whom to rent to.
The ruling drew comments of "absurd," "ridiculous"
and "capricious" from most of the housing experts around
the nation contacted in an Associated Press spot check last
week.
Most officials said they didn't think a similar standard
would hold up in their cities, but a few said it could happen
elsewhere.
The problem in New York — and the potential for a
similar case elsewhere — arises because most statutes do
not specifically prohibit discrimination based on intelli
gence or profession.
They deal with such things as race, religion, marital status
and sex. But they don't cover brains.
In the New York City case, Judith Pierce, who is black and
divorced, claimed that landlord Stanley Stahl refused to
rent to her because of her color and marital status; that
would have been illegal.
Stahl denied the claim. He said he didn't want to rent to
Mrs. Pierce — who is general counsel of the City Commis
sion on Human Rights — because she was a lawyer and
"would be a source of trouble to me as a tenant."
Edward Greenfield, a state court judge in Manhattan, said
it was regrettable, but there is no law covering this kind of
discrimination.

"Absent a supervening statutory prescription, a landlord
is free to do what he wishes with his property and to rent or
not to rent to any given person at his whim. . . .
"He may decide not to rent to singers because they are
noisy or not rent to bald-headed men because he has been
told they give wild parties."
Ed Holmgren of the National Committee Against Dis
crimination of Housing in Washington, D.C., said he had
never heard of such a case.
"To suggest that this form of discrimination is legal is
capricious and arbitrary," he said.
Holmgren said he doubted that such a bias would be
allowed under federal anti-discrimination housing laws. To
use intelligence as a criterion, Holmgren said, the landlord
would have to be able to prove that this is the standard
applied to everyone in the community.
Barry Dean, executive vice president of the South Florida
Apartment Association, said his group "has taken the at
titude that a fully informed tenant is a better tenant ... I
can assure you that the association does not discriminate
against smart people."
And Donald Haas of the Seattle Apartment Owners As
sociation said, "I've never heard of any such discrimination
against anyone. It would amaze me."
Robert Fitzgerald, director of the Cuyahoga County Met
ropolitan Housing Authority in Cleveland, said landlords
have always had this kind of leeway.
"A landlord may say no to musicians, for example, be
cause they make a lot of noise. But he may not say no to a
musician because he's Hungarian, let's say," Fitzgerald
explained.

"Absent a supervening statutory prescription, a landlord
is free to do what he wishes with his property and to rent or
not to rent to any given person at his whim. . . .
"He may decide not to rent to singers because they are
noisy or not rent to bald-headed men because he has been
told they give wild parties."
Ed Holmgren of the National Committee Against Dis
crimination of Housing in Washington, D.C., said he had
never heard of such a case.
"To suggest that this form of discrimination is legal is
capricious and arbitrary," he said.
Holmgren said he doubted that such a bias would be
allowed under federal anti-discrimination housing laws. To
use intelligence as a criterion, Holmgren said, the landlord
would have to be able to prove that this is the standard
applied to everyone in the community.
Barry Dean, executive vice president of the South Florida
Apartment Association, said his group "has taken the at
titude that a fully informed tenant is a better tenant ... I
can assure you that the association does not discriminate
against smart people."
And Donald Haas of the Seattle Apartment Owners As
sociation said, "I've never heard of any such discrimination
against anyone. It would amaze me."
Robert Fitzgerald, director of the Cuyahoga County Met
ropolitan Housing Authority in Cleveland, said landlords
have always had this kind of leeway.
"A landlord may say no to musicians, for example, be
cause they make a lot of noise. But he may not say no to a
musician because he's Hungarian, let's say," Fitzgerald
explained.

Too smart to get an apartment?
It may seem hard to believe, but that could be the case in
New York City where a judge has ruled that a landlord can
discriminate against "intelligent persons, aware of their
rights, who may give him trouble in the future."
The judge also said a landlord could use occupation as a
basis for deciding whom to rent to.
The ruling drew comments of "absurd," "ridiculous"
and "capricious" from most of the housing experts around
the nation contacted in an Associated Press spot check last
week.
Most officials said they didn't think a similar standard
would hold up in their cities, but a few said it could happen
elsewhere.
The problem in New York — and the potential for a
similar case elsewhere — arises because most statutes do
not specifically prohibit discrimination based on intelli
gence or profession.
They deal with such things as race, religion, marital status
and sex. But they don't cover brains.
In the New York City case, Judith Pierce, who is black and
divorced, claimed that landlord Stanley Stahl refused to
rent to her because of her color and marital status; that
would have been illegal.
Stahl denied the claim. He said he didn't want to rent to
Mrs. Pierce — who is general counsel of the City Commis
sion on Human Rights — because she was a lawyer and
"would be a source of trouble to me as a tenant."
Edward Greenfield, a state court judge in Manhattan, said
it was regrettable, but there is no law covering this kind of
discrimination.

"Absent a supervening statutory prescription, a landlord
is free to do what he wishes with his property and to rent or
not to rent to any given person at his whim. . . .
"He may decide not to rent to singers because they are
noisy or not rent to bald-headed men because he has been
