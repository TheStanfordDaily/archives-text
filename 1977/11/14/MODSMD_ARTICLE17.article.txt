# Members of Congress rated by lobbyists

### 
Washington (AP) — "Rate the
Members of Congress," a kind
of Capitol Hill parlor game in
vented several decades ago but
played until recently by only a
few, has become a popular
lobbying weapon.
All kinds of groups — big
labor, conservatives, consum
ers, farmers, liberals, business
people, senior citizens, en
vironmentalists — have disco
vered the usefulness of ratings.
All they need is a scorecard
anyone can make up, and a lit
tle patience.
It goes like this:
Say you're interested in con
sumer affairs. Decide what

legislation is important. Then
find out how 100 senators and
435 Congress members voted
on a dozen or two dozen roll
calls.
Arrange your information in
scorecard fashion, indicating
which votes were "right" and
which were "wrong." Include
percentages if you wish. Add
explanatory material about
what the symbols in the table
are all about. Then print and
distribute the findings, making
sure they get to newspapers,
news magazines, radio and
television stations.
Such organizations as
Americans For Democratic Ac
tion, the AFL-CIO and Friends

Committee on National Legis
lation have been rating mem
bers of Congress for more than
two decades. Now an esti
mated 25 or 30 organizations
compile ratings, and some of
the new players are inventing
new twists.
Environmental Action draws
up a "Dirty Dozen" list each
election year, 12 members of
the House of Representatives it
believes oppose environmen
tally sound laws.
The Consumer Federation of
America, which has rated
members of Congress since
1971, also draws up a list of
"heroes and zeros," a who's
who and who isn't among

friends of consumer legisla
tion.
The Committee for the Sur
vival of a Free Congress, a con
servative organization new to
the field, places members of
Congress into philosophical
groups on the basis of its rat
ings. It checked 315 votes ear
lier this year and decided the
House membership is 30 per
cent conservative and 70 per
cent moderate-liberal to radi
cal.
Congressional aides and rat
ers alike agree the number of
those involved in the ratings
game is growing.
"It's an easy tool for a con
stituent to use," said Kathleen
Sheekey of the Consumer Fed
eration of America. "It's not an
amorphous distinction. It's a
real test, not a lot of rhetoric."
Critics of the ratings system
claim it is unreliableand unfair.
"In addition to giving a simplis
tic view of a man's legislative
record, they sometimes don't
take into account a floor situa
tion," said one congressional
aide.
But the ratings are regarded
seriously by many.
Al Zack, a spokesman for the
AFL-CIO, said some members
of Congress try to find out in
advance which roll calls will
show up in the labor federa
tion's ratings.
