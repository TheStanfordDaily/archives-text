# Antenna removed from U.S. Embassy

### 
Moscow (AP) — American
technicians have quietly re
moved an antenna from the
roof of the U.S. Embassy, 17
months after discovering it was
sending high-frequency radio
signals into a telephone on the
American ambassador's desk.
The radio signals were dis
covered during a radiation
monitoring sweep prompted
by Soviet bombardment of the
Embassy with microwaves,
sources said.
However, State Department
officials waited 17 months be
fore removing the loop-shaped
antenna, reportedly because
they did not want the Soviets to
use it as an excuse to blame the
microwave bombardment on
U.S. equipment.
U.S. officials have re
peatedly denied American
electronic equipment was re
sponsible for the microwave
levels.
"When we did realize this

was happening — and we
didn't until after the mic
rowave story broke — we were
afraid that the Soviets would
more or less use it against us as
a political move, saying we
were inducing these signals
onto ourselves," one U.S.
source said.
Instead of moving the an
tenna immediately, State De
partment officials ordered
special filters installed on the
affected telephone lines last
winter to block out the high
frequency signals.
The antenna was removed
from the roof of the Embassy's
south wing during recent re
pair work after a fire at the 10-
story structure in August.
The antenna had been lo
cated less than 20 feet from the
ambassador's office on the
ninth floor. Sources said the
proximity reproduced the
radio signals through the tele
phone lines even though there
was no physical connection.

The sources said former
Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel
Jr. was furious when told in
May 1976 that the high
frequency signals were coming
through his telephone. He or
dered the radio transmitter
shut down and used only in
emergencies.
It could not be determined
whether he could hear the in
terference.
The antenna had been used
to transmit Embassy message
traffic when the Embassy's
main communications chan
nels were down or overloaded.
Stoessel left Moscow in Sep
tember 1976 to become U.S.
ambassador to West Germany
and was replaced by Malcolm
Toon.
The Soviet microwave beams
aimed at the Embassy are re
ported to be a mixture of much
higher frequencies ranging
from about 1900 to 9500
megahertz.

Moscow (AP) — American
technicians have quietly re
moved an antenna from the
roof of the U.S. Embassy, 17
months after discovering it was
sending high-frequency radio
signals into a telephone on the
American ambassador's desk.
The radio signals were dis
covered during a radiation
monitoring sweep prompted
by Soviet bombardment of the
Embassy with microwaves,
sources said.
However, State Department
officials waited 17 months be
fore removing the loop-shaped
antenna, reportedly because
they did not want the Soviets to
use it as an excuse to blame the
microwave bombardment on
U.S. equipment.
U.S. officials have re
peatedly denied American
electronic equipment was re
sponsible for the microwave
levels.
"When we did realize this

was happening — and we
didn't until after the mic
rowave story broke — we were
afraid that the Soviets would
more or less use it against us as
a political move, saying we
were inducing these signals
onto ourselves," one U.S.
source said.
Instead of moving the an
tenna immediately, State De
partment officials ordered
special filters installed on the
affected telephone lines last
winter to block out the high
frequency signals.
The antenna was removed
from the roof of the Embassy's
south wing during recent re
pair work after a fire at the 10-
story structure in August.
The antenna had been lo
cated less than 20 feet from the
ambassador's office on the
ninth floor. Sources said the
proximity reproduced the
radio signals through the tele
phone lines even though there
was no physical connection.

The sources said former
Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel
Jr. was furious when told in
May 1976 that the high
frequency signals were coming
through his telephone. He or
dered the radio transmitter
shut down and used only in
emergencies.
It could not be determined
whether he could hear the in
terference.
