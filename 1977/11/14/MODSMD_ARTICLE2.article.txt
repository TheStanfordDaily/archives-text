Students accustomed to receiving
their Veterans Administration educa
tional assistance checks at the be
ginning of each month may be won
dering what has become of their
November check.
A congressional change in VA pol
icy has ended automatic prepayment
of educational assistance benefits to
prevent abuse of the system. The
new schedule provides for payment
at the end of the month.
Prepayment resulted in a "fantas
tic, almost unbelievable" amount of
overpayment, according to Assistant
Registrar and Recorder Walter Fin
deisen, who handles veterans' affairs
here. In California last year, over
payment of educational assistance
benefits reached $450 million, he
said.
Automatic prepayment provided a
loophole for non-students to receive

educational assistance, where many
would pay the nominal tuition of
California's state schools just to
claim VA benefits. According to Fin
deison, these student imposters
would never been seen on campus
again.
Higher tuition rates prevented this
from becoming a problem at private
institutions such as Stanford, he said.
The new policy, which became ef-"
fective June 1, is "much more com
plicated," Findeisen stated. Students
will usually receive payment at the
end of each month, except for those
eligible for advance payment during
the months of September and Oc
tober. For advance payment, stu
dents must preregister, and com
plete any summer school enrollment
a full calendar month before their au
tumn quarter or semester.
Some 200 Stanford students cur
rently receive VA educational assis
tance benefits.
