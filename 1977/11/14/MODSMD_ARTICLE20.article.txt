# Cards thwart late SJS surge to win, 31-26
## Charitable Stanford tries to give game to Spartans; San Jose gives it back 
### David Georgette 
"That's Stanford football for
you," said Cardinal assistant
coach George Seifert.
"I think we played well
enough to put it away," said
Stanford quarterback Guy Ben
jamin. "We marched down the
field. They didn't stop us."
"They" are the San Jose State
Spartans. Despite being out
gained by 200 yards of total of
fense Saturday in Stanford
Stadium, the Spartans came up
just a few plays short in a
fourth-quarter bid to upset the
Cardinals (7-3) and ruin a
record-breaking performance
by halfback Darrin Nelson in
the 31-26 Stanford victory.
The Spartans (4-6) scored 20
points in the fourth quarter,
but their hopes for upending
the Cards were crushed by
linebacker Ray Cardinally who
picked off Spartan quarterback
Ed Luther's pass in Stanford
territory with less than 20 sec
onds left.
One last play
Cardinalli's theft did more
than end San Jose State's final
offensive play of the day,
though. It gave the Cards and
Nelson one more shot at break
ing Stanford's individual single
game rushing mark of 209 yards
set by Lou Valli against Califor
nia in 1956. Nelson had 207 as
Stanford lined up on the Spar
tan 27 with nine seconds left.
"Three yards to go — what
the heck — give a guy a

chance," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh. And Nelson
got his chance on a pitch
sweep — the same type of play
Stanford had started the day
with — and got four yards and
the record.
"Darrin Nelson is one of the
great tailbacks on the West
Coast," said Spartan head
coach Lynn Stiles. "He is just
an amazing young man. We
tried our best to stop him but it
wasn't good enough."
Green light
The Spartans not only
couldn't stop Nelson, they
couldn't stop the Stanford of
fense. The Cards rolled for 29
first downs and 561 yards total
offense. The Stanford offense
probably did a better job of de
fensing itself than the Spartans
did.
Stanford punter Brad Fox
was not called upon to kick the
ball once, as every Cardinal
drive ended in a score or a tur
nover. There were six of the
latter — three first-half inter
ceptions by Benjamin, two
fumbles by Nelson and one by
fullback Phil Francis.
As Benjamin explained, it
was the turnovers which stop
ped the Cards. "Three inter
ceptions and three fumbles,"
he said. "That's it. There's no
other problem."
The turnovers also gave San
lose State opportunities to get
back into the game. The third
interception led to a Spartan
touchdown that cut the Stan
ford lead to 14-6 late in the sec
ond quarter. In the fourth
quarter, the Spartans

capitalized on Nelson's second
turnover to pull within 24-19.
Trick play
The Spartan touchdown
came on a 35-yard double
reverse flea-flicker pass.
Luther handed off to halfback
Kevin Cole, who then gave the
ball to receiver Robert
Claiborne on a reverse.
Claiborne then lateralled the
ball back to Luther, who found
a streaking Cole with a perfect
pass down the left sideline just
beyond the reach of a leaping
Ralph Phillips.
"You always wonder if you
can get it off just right," said
Stiles of the razzle-dazzle
score.
Luther credited the Spartans'
offensive coordinator and
former Stanford assistant Pete
Kattela for selecting the play.
"Coach Kattela called it," said
Luther, "and he hit it right on
the nail. He's an offensive
wizard as far as we're con
cerned.
"After I saw the second han
doff, I figured we were in trou
ble," said Stanford middle
linebacker Cordy Ceresino,
who had 17 tackles to set a new
season record of 1972. Cere
sino eclipsed the old mark of
164, set by )im Merlo in 1972.
Enthusiasm quelled
The Spartans rejoicing at the
success of their trickery was
diminished by the ensuing 86-
yard march by the Cards for a
touchdown. "If we had held
them right there and then,
we'd have had a chance to win
the game," said Stiles. Nelson
opened the drive with a burst
around end for 33 yards, and

then the Cards covered the
remaining 53 yards in seven
more running plays.
Nelson's run, which sparked
the drive, was similar to many
plays on which the Cards got to
the outside of the Spartan de
fense for big gains. "San Jose
was blitzing heavily and you
lose your team pursuit when
you blitz," said Walsh.
Despite the Cardinal score,
the Spartans weren't dead yet.
Luther got help from two pass
interference calls against Stan
ford, moving San )ose State to
the Cardinal 26 with half a mi
nute left. Then with good pass
protection, he had the time to
find Claiborne cutting across
the middle for the scoring
pass.
The Spartans lined up 10
men to the right of kicker
Randy Johnson on the follow
ing onside kick, and the ploy
succeeded as the Spartans re
covered the ball. But Cardinal
ly interception on the next
play finished off Luther's fine
second-half performance.
His better half
The Spartan quarterback re
ceived some good pass protec
tion in the second half, and
connected on 13 of 17 for 200
yards after halftime. "I would
say it's considered my best half
of the season," said Luther.
"The offensive line did a hel
luva job."
"I think we were really con
scious of their draws," defen
sive lineman Geoff Kieburtz
explained about the time
Luther had to pass. "And we
ran some stunts that they
picked up pretty well."

"I think we were able to
throw the ball a little more effi
ciently in the second half," said
Stiles, "which obviously
helped our running game."
In the first half, the Stanford
defense limited the Spartans to
117 total yards. "I think the de
fense was really ready," said
Ceresino. "We came out and
snuffed them right away. But
the defense let down some of
the time. The game wasn't as
close as we made it."
Fast start
The way the game started it
looked as if the Cards were
going to romp over the Spar
tans.
The Cards took the opening
kick-off and went 85 yards in
eight plays. Benjamin hit re
ceiver James Lofton on a 21-
yard pass for the score.
Stanford began the second
quarter by finishing up another
scoringdrive. Split end Bill Kel
lar made a fine catch near the
side of the end zone to top off a
13-play, 75-yard drive.
"I knew I'd have to run a
quick pattern," said Kellar. "It
was a perfect pass."
"Kellar is an outstanding
football player, as is Lofton,"
said Walsh. "Benjamin's prob
lem is that they come up with
so many great catches he's
continually forcing the ball in.
Sometimes he gets it through,
but sometimes it's inter
cepted."
In the second half, there was
only one interception — by
Cardinally Benjamin was nine
for nine.

21-yard toss to Lofton was his 11th TD reception of the season.

Both the referee and Stanford's Pat Bowe (85) signal in vain to this apparent three yard touchdown run by
Darrin Nelson. The play was called back because of a holding penalty, however, giving the Cards the ball
on San Jose State's 18 yard line. A fumble by Card running back Phil Francis on the next play was
recovered by San lose State, killing the drive. It was one of six Stanford turnovers in the game.
