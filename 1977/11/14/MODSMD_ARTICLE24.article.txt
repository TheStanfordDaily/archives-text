# Single game, season marks set
## Darrin brings crowd to its feet 
### Bruce Anderson 
Darrin Nelson had more
trouble fighting through the
crowd of well-wishers and au
tograph hounds after Satur
day's football game with San
lose State than he had fighting
through the Spartan defense.
Stanford opened the game
with Nelson taking a pitch from
Guy Benjamin around left end
and piercing the San Jose de
fense for 12 yards.
Two-and-a-half hours later
the game ended as it started
with Nelson bursting around
end — this time the right end
— with a Benjamin pitchout.
Sandwiched within those
two runs was the most prolific
single game rushing perfor
mance ever recorded by a Stan
ford ball carrier.
The elfin freshman viv
isected the Spartan defense for
211 yards on 20 carries to break
the Stanford single game rush
ing mark of 209 yards set by Lou
Valli in the 1956 Big Came.
Ray Handley's single season
rushing mark of 936 yards set in
1964 also fell by the wayside.
Nelson has gained 975 yards
this season on 160 carries and
should become only the fifth
freshman in NCAA Division I to
ever rush for more than 1000
yards when Stanford meets
California Saturday.
Nelson kept fans buzzing
throughout the game and the
crowd, notified of his ap
proach at Valli's record, were
rooting for the 5-foot-8, 170-

pound halfback to break the
21-year-old record.
Nelson had 207 yards with
several minutes remaining but
it appeared he would not get a
last crack at the record when
Stanford fumbled an onside
kick with 21 seconds remaining
and San Jose State recovered.
But Stanford linebacker Ray
Cardinalli intercepted an Ed
Luther pass to give the Cards
the ball with eight seconds left.
The Stanford student rooting
section reverberated with a
rhythmic chanting: "Nelson,
Nelson, Nelson."
In the stands there was no
question what Benjamin
should do with the ball — pitch
to Nelson so he could pick up
the yardage needed to break
Valli's record. In the Stanford
huddle, however, it was less
clear cut what needed to be
done on that last play.
"We thought Darrin needed
like 10 yards to get 1000 for the
season," said wide receiver Bill
Kellar. "We said, 'Darrin needs
10, let's get it for him.' "
Benjamin pitched to Nelson
who cut in behind a block on a
defensive back and dashed lor
a 4-yard gain and the record.
It was the same play which
the Cards ran successfully
throughout the game, a play
which Nelson sprung for gains
of 48 and 33 yards.
"Their linebackers were
squeezing down and the cor
nerbacks were flying up. I just
cut back inside blocks on the

cornerbacks," Nelson said.
"It's a play that has worked
for us all season," Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said of the
pitchouts to Nelson.
"Good execution, their type
of defense and the man carry
ing the ball made the play work
well for us."
"The coach asked me right

before the game how my legs
felt," Nelson said. "I said,
'112 me.' Then I thought I'd prob
ably get the ball a lot."
Stanford fans are hoping that
will be the case again when the
Cards host the Golden Bears
Saturday and Darrin Nelson
seeks to become the first Stan
ford player to ever break the
1000-yard rushing barrier.
