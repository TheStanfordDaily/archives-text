### 
Stanford's field hockey team
finished second in the six-team
AIAW Western Regional Tour
nament this weekend in
Pomona, losing to San lose
State 5-1 in Saturday's final
match.
Stanford coach Barbara
Longstreth said the Cards were
"beaten by a better team that
has tremendous depth. They
(San Jose) are one heck of a
team," said Longstreth.
Stanford defeated California
3-1 in the opening game of the
tournament Friday morning on
goals by Onnie Killifer, Nancy
White and Kelly Westerwick.
The Cards, defeated by Cal
2-1 early in the season, "really
prepired for Cal," according
to Longstreth.
Longstreth praised Julie
Johnson for doing a "tre
mendous job" covering Cal
forward Cheryl Johnson.
Third-seeded Stanford then
faced second-seeded Cal
Poly-Pomona which had a bye
in the first round of the single
elimination tournament.
A Westerwick goal gave the

Cards a 1-0 victory over Cal
Poly-Pomona and a place in the
finals against top-seeded San
Jose State which had downed
Stanford 3-0 earlier in the sea
son.
Longstreth noted that the
Cards defeated two teams that
they had met, but not beaten
during the season. "We had to
really work to finish second,"
said Longstreth.
San Jose State earned a berth
in the 16-team National Tour
nament in Denver on Nov.
23-26. The finishing order for
the other four teams was Cal
Poly-Pomona, third; Long
Beach, fourth; California, fifth,
and Sacramento State, sixth.
Longstreth said that if San
Jose State fares well in the Na
tionals, region eight (California
and Nevada) may advance two
teams into the tournament
from its regionals next year.
Stanford will take part in a
Nor-Cal tournament this
weekend. The games will be
shortened and the results will
not figure on any of the teams
season records.
