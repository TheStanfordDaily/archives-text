# Oregon runs wild
## Ducks win Pac-8 cross country 
### Tom Simpson 
Joel Cheruiyot of
Washington State held off the
charge of teammate Henry
Rono to win the Pacific-8/
NCAA District-8 Combined
Meet at the Stanford Golf
Course Saturday. Cheruiyot
and Rono finished 40 yards
ahead of Oregon's Alberto
Salazar, who led for most of the

race.
"He won," said Rono point
ing to Cheruiyot. "No, hedid,"
said Cheruiyot. "We run for
the boys," both said, as if the
individual crown meant little.
But both maintained that they
held nothing back and their
exciting sprint to the finish was
proof.
Despite the efforts of

Cheruiyot and Rono, the rest
of the WSU "boys"' failed to
qualify for the NCAA Champ
ionships and, for the first time
in the history of the Pac-8 meet,
WSU finished lower than sec
ond.
Powerful Oregon capitalized
on the absence of WSU's
Joshua Kimeto, the NCAA
5000-meter champion, to post
a convincing win and qualify its
seven-man team for the NCAA
to be hosted by Washington
State Nov. 21 in Spokane.
Six Oregon harriers finished
in the top 17, with four among
the top seven. Salazar finished
third and Oregon freshman Bill
McChesney led teammates
Don Clary and Rudy Chapa in a
sweep of the fifth, sixth and
seventh spots.
Texas-El Paso, Oregon and
Tennessee State, ranked No. 1,
2 and 3 in the country respec
tively, should have the battle
for the national team crown to
themselves now that NCAA
meet host WSU failed to qual
ify its team.
UC-lrvine, Washington and
surprising Nevada-Reno cap
tured the other NCAA berths.
Washington took second in the
Pac-8 part of the meet with 38
points to Oregon's 26 and was

followed by WSU with 64,
California with 99 and Stanford
with 131.
It was essentially a three
man race with Salazar leading
from the start and Rono and
Cheruiyot at his heels. The
three moved steadily away
from the pack until at 5Vi miles
the fourth runner was 25 yards
back from the leaders.
At that point Cheruiyot made
his move past Salazar and Rono
followed. Salazar, showing
signs of fatigue, didn't bother
to glance up at the two as they
passed.
The race to the finish tape
was between Cheruiyot and
Rono. Rono began his final
surge with about 200 yards left
and seemed to be gaining
ground on Cheriuyot, but the
Kenyan freshman was able to
sprint in just ahead of defend
ing champion Rono. Cheruiyot
covered the 10 kilometer
course in 29:34.8, four-tenths
of a second ahead of Rono but
six seconds slower than the
course record Rono set during
last year's conference meet.
Stanford had a dismal team
finish. Juniors Jerry Emory and
Roy Kissin were the top Card
finishers, placing 46th and 47th
respectively in 32:15 and 32:17.

was between Cheruiyot and
Rono. Rono began his final
surge with about 200 yards left
and seemed to be gaining
ground on Cheriuyot, but the
Kenyan freshman was able to
sprint in just ahead of defend
ing champion Rono. Cheruiyot
covered the 10 kilometer
course in 29:34.8, four-tenths
of a second ahead of Rono but
six seconds slower than the
course record Rono set during
last year's conference meet.
Stanford had a dismal team
finish. Juniors Jerry Emory and
Roy Kissin were the top Card
finishers, placing 46th and 47th
respectively in 32:15 and 32:17.
Joel Cheruiyot of
Washington State held off the
charge of teammate Henry
Rono to win the Pacific-8/
NCAA District-8 Combined
Meet at the Stanford Golf
Course Saturday. Cheruiyot
and Rono finished 40 yards
ahead of Oregon's Alberto
Salazar, who led for most of the

race.
"He won," said Rono point
ing to Cheruiyot. "No, hedid,"
said Cheruiyot. "We run for
the boys," both said, as if the
individual crown meant little.
But both maintained that they
held nothing back and their
exciting sprint to the finish was
proof.
Despite the efforts of

Cheruiyot and Rono, the rest
of the WSU "boys"' failed to
qualify for the NCAA Champ
ionships and, for the first time
in the history of the Pac-8 meet,
WSU finished lower than sec
ond.
Powerful Oregon capitalized
on the absence of WSU's
Joshua Kimeto, the NCAA
5000-meter champion, to post
a convincing win and qualify its
seven-man team for the NCAA
to be hosted by Washington
State Nov. 21 in Spokane.
Six Oregon harriers finished
in the top 17, with four among
the top seven. Salazar finished
third and Oregon freshman Bill
McChesney led teammates
Don Clary and Rudy Chapa in a
sweep of the fifth, sixth and
seventh spots.
Texas-El Paso, Oregon and
Tennessee State, ranked No. 1,
2 and 3 in the country respec
tively, should have the battle
for the national team crown to
themselves now that NCAA
meet host WSU failed to qual
ify its team.
UC-lrvine, Washington and
surprising Nevada-Reno cap
tured the other NCAA berths.
Washington took second in the
Pac-8 part of the meet with 38
points to Oregon's 26 and was

followed by WSU with 64,
California with 99 and Stanford
with 131.
It was essentially a three
man race with Salazar leading
from the start and Rono and
Cheruiyot at his heels. The
three moved steadily away
from the pack until at 5Vi miles
the fourth runner was 25 yards
back from the leaders.
At that point Cheruiyot made
his move past Salazar and Rono
followed. Salazar, showing
signs of fatigue, didn't bother
to glance up at the two as they
passed.
The race to the finish tape
was between Cheruiyot and
