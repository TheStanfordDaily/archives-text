Lodge said he was "frustrated"
about the loss to San Diego,
specifically "having Jimmy
red-carded and also losing our
keeper. We had excellent
chances the first 10 minutes of
the game that would have
turned the game around. We
were competitive against one
of the best teams in the West."
In yesterday's match, senior
Teddy Robinson ended both
his Stanford career and the
season on a winning note by
scoring the Cards' two goals.
The first goal, assisted by
Steve Dietz came 30 minutes
into the game. Robinson's sec
ond score, with 17 minutes re
maining, broke a 1-1 tie.

that was totally his goal — he
set it up. The second goal, I was
wide open (Paul) Koza —
chenko set that one up,"
Robinson said.
Lodge briefly summarized
yesterday's game and the sea
son. "We were even a little bet
ter (against USIU) strategically.
We didn't have the ballplayers
they had, but we had a system
of play which was able to
penetrate. I felt really good
that we were able to compete
against USIU because they're
10th-ranked and have an excel
lent record — 19 wins."

Friday night's game against
the Aztecs was a physical con
test, with both teams display
ing high-pitched emotion on
and off the field. Four minutes
into the second half, with the
score deadlocked at 0-0, Card

card is a warning that a player's
action is a violation of game
rules, and a red card results in

man. Against the Aztecs, Stan
ford played with 10 players for
the remaining 41 minutes of
the game.
A few minutes later Card
goalie Craig Ueland left the
game with a fractured forearm.
As he was diving for a loose
ball, an opposing player appar
ently kicked his arm.

Aztec Vidal Fernandez
scored against reserve goalie
Lewis Butler with 30 minutes
remaining for the game's only
tally.
Stanford coach Nelson
Lodge said he was "frustrated"
about the loss to San Diego,
specifically "having Jimmy
red-carded and also losing our
keeper. We had excellent
chances the first 10 minutes of
the game that would have
turned the game around. We
were competitive against one
of the best teams in the West."
In yesterday's match, senior
Teddy Robinson ended both
his Stanford career and the
season on a winning note by
scoring the Cards' two goals.
The first goal, assisted by
Steve Dietz came 30 minutes
into the game. Robinson's sec
ond score, with 17 minutes re
maining, broke a 1-1 tie.
"Steve made a beautiful shot
that was totally his goal — he
set it up. The second goal, I was
wide open (Paul) Koza —
chenko set that one up,"
Robinson said.
Lodge briefly summarized
yesterday's game and the sea
son. "We were even a little bet
ter (against USIU) strategically.
We didn't have the ballplayers
they had, but we had a system
of play which was able to
penetrate. I felt really good
that we were able to compete
against USIU because they're
10th-ranked and have an excel
lent record — 19 wins."
