# PLO might accept peace conference

### 
Tunis, Tunisia (AP) â€” The Palestine
Liberation Organization said yester
day it is prepared to accept a re
newed Middle East peace confer
ence in Geneva if Palestinian partici
pation is brought under United Na
tions auspices.
Said Kamel, head of the PLO dele
gation in Cairo, read a statement to
reporters at the Arab foreign minis
ters' meeting here, asserting that last
month's Soviet-American declara
tion was acceptable to the PLO as the
basis for a Geneva conference.
The Soviet-American document,
issued in New York by Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance and Soviet Foreign

Minister Andrei Gromyko, called for
resumption of Geneva talks before
the end of the year with the participa
tion of the Palestinian people.
No PLO reference
It made no reference to the PLO,
which has been rejected by Israel but
has been designated by the Arab
states as "the sole legitimate rep
resentative" of the Palestinian
people.
"The minimum basis that the PLO
can accept for the participation of the
Palestinian people ... is the U.S.-
Soviet statement," Kamal said.
"This statement should be consi
dered as a document of the United
Nations Security Council on the
same basis as Security Council Re
solution 242 of 1967," continued
Kamal.
Waldheim invitation
"We agree to participate in the
Geneva peace conference provided
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim, in the name of the two
superpowers, invites the representa
tives of the Palestinian people as part
of the Arab delegation to the confer
ence."
Resolution 242 and other key U.N.
measures passed since the 1967
Arab-Israeli war for an eventual set
tlement refer only to refugees and
make no specific reference to the
Palestinians.
Observers said the statement did
not appear to signal a major shift in
PLO policy. They noted it made no
mention of a PLO willingness to rec
ognize Israel's right to exist. Israel
repeatedly has condemned the PLO
for its refusal to accept an indepen
dent Jewish state.
Sole representative
Speaking on behalf of Farouk Kad
doumi, who heads the PLO delega
tion here, Kamel reiterated the PLO
is the "sole representative" of the
Palestinian people.
But the endorsement of the
Soviet-American declaration ap
peared to leave open the door for the
designation of a non-PLO member as
spokesman for the Palestinians at fu
ture Geneva talks.
The question of Palestinian rep
resentation has been the major
stumbling block to reconvening the
Geneva peace talks, suspended
since December 1973.
Israel has rejected any negotia
tions with the PLO because the or
ganization's charter calls for eradica
tion of the Jewish state.
But Egypt's President Anwar Sadat
suggested last week the Palestinian
representative might be an American
professor of Palestinian descent.
