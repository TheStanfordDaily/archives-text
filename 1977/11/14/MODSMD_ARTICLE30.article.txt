### Marcia Hadeler 
What a beautiful day it was
for a 2.8 mile run! Approxi
mately 120 people and one dog
showed up for the annual I.M.
cross country meet last Wed
nesday. Some anxious, some
eager, some questioning their
physical condition . . . they
lined up for the start.
Twice around the course and
14:32 minutes later the first
runner returned — Jerry Hall, a
graduate student running for
the Angell Field Ancients. Eigh
teen seconds later one of El To
ro's runners, Jack Martinez,
cruised in followed by Bill Be
decare, George Lynch and
Louis Armstrong.
The first woman to return,
Carolyn Tiernan of Med I,
came in at 17:25. Janice Cadlini
was second, followed by Karen
Benedik, Ellyn Pildes and
Sherry Carlson.
The Angell Field Ancient
team had three finishers in the
top 10, scored 18 team (meet)
points and captured first place.
El Toro was second with 36
points, Montclaire was third
with 47 points, with Cedro
Brickhouse bringing in fourth
with 48 points.
The Whitman Ringers won
the women's division with 254
points.
