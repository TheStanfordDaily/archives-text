# Cards, Cal to battle for No. 1
## Poloists blast UCSB, SJS 
### Brad Brockbank 
Since the beginning of the
season, Stanford water polo
coach Dante Dettamanti has
said that the counter-attack
fast-break would be the Cardi
nals' bread-and-butter play.
This weekend confirmed De
ttamanti's statements as the
watercagers crushed UC-Santa
Barbara Friday, 13-8, and fol
lowed up on Saturday by de
molishing San ]ose State, 14-1.
The Cards' fast-breaking
counter-attack dominated
both games. Of the two oppo
nents, UCSB and San Jose,
Santa Barbara learned the
quickest. After winning the
opening sprint, UCSB moved
down and quickly drew a
four-meter penalty shot. In
most cases, a penalty shot
means a sure goal but, appa
rently, nobody told Stanford
goalie John Cansel about that.
The freshman goal keeper
blocked the shot and passed
the ball out, initiating a fast
break which resulted in a 1-0
lead for Stanford.
"Our counter-attack ran
really well," said Dettamanti.
"We burned them down the
pool and we had a couple of
guys open almost every time."
Leading a well-balanced atr
tack were senior Rick
Johannsen and junior Tom
Angelo who each scored three
goals. Cansel finished with 12
saves and two blocked penalty
shots.
"It was a total team effort,"
said Johannsen. "Everybody

Scored and everybody made
good plays."
San Jose State stormed de-
Guerre Saturday morning, only
to find themselves shut out
until the last minute of the
game.
The first quarter was domi
nated by three players: junior
Dave Egan, who scored three
goals, Angelo, who scored two
and junior Robby Arnold, who
scored one and had two steals,
pushing his team-leading theft
total past the dozen mark.
At the end of the quarter, the
three of them and Gansel came
out of the game, giving way to

the second string. Junior Jack
Lorenz, playing the rest of the
contest, scored three goals to
tie Egan for the game-high
honors.
Dettamanti said afterward
that Lorenz was one of the bet
ter shooters on the team. He
also said he was glad to see
Egan scoring goals, particularly
because the hole man had
been working hard over the
last few weeks.
With the Cal game only a
week away, however, Det
tamanti added that he would
like to have seen a little more
intensity from his team.
