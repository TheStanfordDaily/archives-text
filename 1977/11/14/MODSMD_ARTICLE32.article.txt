Thewomen's volleyball team
had an up and down weekend
beating Fresno State 15-5, 15-8
and 18-16 on Friday in the
Cards' best defensive match of
the season; then losing to the
University of the Pacific 15-6,
11-15, 13-15 and 13-15 in their
worst match of the year.
"We played very well against
Fresno State on Friday," said
Stanford coach Art Lambert.
"But we beat ourselves in the
match against UOP. We just
couldn't pass the ball."
The game was played in an
extremely small gym at UOP
and the fans were reportedly
harassing the Stanford players.

"Often times one of the girls
will be off in a game," said as
sistant coach Fred Sturm. "But
three or four of our starting five
were off (in the match against
UOP)," Sturm said.
In the last two games of
Saturday's match, Stanford was
down 13-7 and 13-8, respec
tively. Both times they brought
the score up to deuce but then
couldn't put it over the hill.
The Cards now focus on up
coming matches with Califor
nia Friday and San Jose State
Saturday. Stanford still has
only one conference loss but
must win both of this
weekend's matches to guaran
tee its advancement to region
al.
