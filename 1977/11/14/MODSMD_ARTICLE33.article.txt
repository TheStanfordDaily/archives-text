HEW computers fail standards
Washington — An internal HEW study says department
computers holding sensitive information on millions of
Americans don't come close to meeting minimum stan
dards for protecting that information from unauthorized
disclosure and use.
Because of the poor showing by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare's computers, there are
indications HEW may lower its standards to improve its
compliance ratings, says Rep. Richardson Preyer (D-
N.C.).
The internal report, obtained by the Associated Press,
prompted Preyer to ask the General Accounting Office
to study the security of all major government computers
containing personal information.
"Systems security in HEW was far from meeting
minimum acceptable standards," the six-month audit
said. "The average compliance with security standards
was only 36.9 per cent."
The standards, established by HEW, are designed to
provide protection for personal information in line with
the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, which for
bids unauthorized disclosure or use of such information
gathered by government agencies.
An HEW spokesman said there would be no comment
on the report until later today.
Somalia cuts back Soviet relations
Nairobi, Kenya — Somalia, once one of Moscow's
closest friends in Africa, broke relations with Cuba yes
terday, expelled all Russian advisors and terminated
Soviet use of air and naval facilities at two Somali ports,
the Somali radio said.
The Somalis also ordered the Soviet embassy to cut
back its staff and renounced its 1974 friendship treaty
with the Kremlin, the radio said.
The moves capped a steady decline in Somali-Soviet
relations as Moscow has increasingly thrown its support
behind Ethiopia, Somalia's bitter rival.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow.
Yesterday's moves followed Somali claims that Cuban
troops are fighting alongside Ethiopian forces battling
Somali-backed insurgents in Ethiopia's southeastern
Ogaden desert.

Nuclear demonstrators sentenced
Exeter, N.H. — Some six months after 1414 nuclear
power demonstrators were arrested for refusing to leave
the construction site of a power plant, the first sentences
handed down have prompted talk of another occupa
tion.
Last May Day weekend, a coalition of anti-nuclear
power groups called the Clamshell Alliance sponsored a
demonstration at Seabrook, where the Public Service
Co. of New Hampshire had started construction of a
nuclear power generator. Authorities, moving in peace
fully, charged 1414 of the protestors with trespassing.
More than 1000 protestors have accepted guilty find
ings in District Court on trespassing charges and are now
appealing the convictions in Rockingham County
Superior Court to avail themselves of jury trials.
Carter Wentworth, 26, of Kensington and Sister Jean
Dupuy, 32, of Hartford, Conn., have had their appeals
heard. They lost; Wentworth was sentenced to four
months in the county jail, Sister Dupuy to two months.

HEW computers fail standards
Washington — An internal HEW study says department
computers holding sensitive information on millions of
Americans don't come close to meeting minimum stan
dards for protecting that information from unauthorized
disclosure and use.
Because of the poor showing by the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare's computers, there are
indications HEW may lower its standards to improve its
compliance ratings, says Rep. Richardson Preyer (D-
N.C.).
The internal report, obtained by the Associated Press,
prompted Preyer to ask the General Accounting Office
to study the security of all major government computers
containing personal information.
"Systems security in HEW was far from meeting
minimum acceptable standards," the six-month audit
said. "The average compliance with security standards
was only 36.9 per cent."
The standards, established by HEW, are designed to
provide protection for personal information in line with
the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, which for
bids unauthorized disclosure or use of such information
gathered by government agencies.
An HEW spokesman said there would be no comment
on the report until later today.
Somalia cuts back Soviet relations
Nairobi, Kenya — Somalia, once one of Moscow's
closest friends in Africa, broke relations with Cuba yes
terday, expelled all Russian advisors and terminated
Soviet use of air and naval facilities at two Somali ports,
the Somali radio said.
The Somalis also ordered the Soviet embassy to cut
back its staff and renounced its 1974 friendship treaty
with the Kremlin, the radio said.
The moves capped a steady decline in Somali-Soviet
relations as Moscow has increasingly thrown its support
behind Ethiopia, Somalia's bitter rival.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow.
Yesterday's moves followed Somali claims that Cuban
troops are fighting alongside Ethiopian forces battling
Somali-backed insurgents in Ethiopia's southeastern
Ogaden desert.

Nuclear demonstrators sentenced
Exeter, N.H. — Some six months after 1414 nuclear
power demonstrators were arrested for refusing to leave
the construction site of a power plant, the first sentences
handed down have prompted talk of another occupa
tion.
Last May Day weekend, a coalition of anti-nuclear
power groups called the Clamshell Alliance sponsored a
demonstration at Seabrook, where the Public Service
Co. of New Hampshire had started construction of a
nuclear power generator. Authorities, moving in peace
fully, charged 1414 of the protestors with trespassing.
More than 1000 protestors have accepted guilty find
ings in District Court on trespassing charges and are now
appealing the convictions in Rockingham County
Superior Court to avail themselves of jury trials.
Carter Wentworth, 26, of Kensington and Sister Jean
Dupuy, 32, of Hartford, Conn., have had their appeals
heard. They lost; Wentworth was sentenced to four
months in the county jail, Sister Dupuy to two months.
