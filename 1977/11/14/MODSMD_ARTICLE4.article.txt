### Joel Dickholtz 
About 15 per cent of the money
collected in fee assessments at fall
registration has been returned to
students, according to ASSU Finan
cial Manager Miles White.
Some $15,280 of a total assessment
of $99,433 has been refunded to stu
dents requesting all or part of their
fee assessments back.
The money collected goes to sup
port eight organizations or funds:
the Daily, KZSU, the Legal Counsel
ing Office, the Band, the Academic
Organization Board (AOB), the
Course Guide, the Guest Professor
ship Board and the program fee allo
cated by the ASSU Senate to various
smaller groups.
The AOB suffered most from the
refunds, with $2163, or 17 per cent of
its assessment, returned to students.
White said "lots of students really
don't know what AOB is or does. This
is the first time the fee has been as
sessed, so it's understandable that a
lot of students might not want to
support it.
"It's actually a central body on
campus that organizes and allocates
money to academic organizations
such as Stanford in Law, Stanford in
Business, Stanford in Government,
etc."
White explained that requests for
overseas refunds have not yet been
computed, but "from looking over
the past we can assume that they will
probably request total refunds,
which will be about $376."
