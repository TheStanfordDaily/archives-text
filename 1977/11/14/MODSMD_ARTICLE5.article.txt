## Ellsberg describes Pentagon strategy to stop earth's rotation 
### Brad Brockbank 
Daniel Ellsberg, known for his release of
the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times
in 1971, told an audience here Friday of a
one-time Pentagon plan to momentarily halt
the earth's rotation.
A standing-room-only crowd in Cubberley
Auditorium heard Ellsberg describe several
Pentagon nuclear war strategies.
Ellsberg gave an account of the military's
nuclear activities since his employment in
1958 by the Rand Corporation, where he
worked on presidential command and con
trol of nuclear weapons.
A Harvard graduate, Ellsberg was given in
1964 the job of special assistant to the assis
tant secretary of defense. In 1965, he
traveled to Vietnam as a representative of
the State Department.
In 1967, he went back to Rand to work on
the MacNamara project, a history of com
mand decisions made in Vietnam. The re
port from this project later became known as
the Pentagon Papers when Ellsberg released
the report to Sen. William Fulbright in 1969
and to the public two years later.
Charges dropped
Indicted on 12 counts of violation of es
pionage and conspiracy statutes, Ellsberg
could have faced a 115 year prison term. In
1973, however, charges were dropped when
Nixon aide John Ehrlichman and others were
indicted for breaking into the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
During his first stint with Rand, Ellsberg
and his associates worked with military offi
cials who were concerned that a well-aimed
Russian missile strike could destroy our B-52
and B-47 bombers, the United States' prim
ary retaliatory weapons. Rand's solution was
to put the bombers underground in garage
like structures. The Air Force, however, dis
agreed.
Said Ellsberg, "It made Air Force officers
physically nauseated to think of taking their
shiny bombers and putting them under
ground. That wasn't where a bomber was
supposed to be. It didn't fit their self-image
at all."
Having found Rand's idea unacceptable,

Ellsberg said, the Air Force came up with a
few ideas of their own.
"One of their ideas was for a mile-wide
highway across the country," Ellsberg
explained, "which would have many lanes
for traffic and two lanes for B-525. The B-52s
would just taxi back and forth across the
country for 3000 miles and the Russians
would never know where they were at any
one time. They'd just knock off a few com
muters with their attack."
According to Ellsberg, this idea was seri
ously'considered by the Pentagon, as was
another that came to Ellsberg's attention.
Atlas shrugged
"We didn't have fully completed missiles,
at that point, but we had a lot of engines,"
Ellsberg recalled. "The idea was to take a
great many first-stage Atlas engines, maybe
10,000, and put them in banks in Montana.
Then, when the radar system gave warning
that the Russian missiles were on their way,
we'd set off all these engines simultaneously
and stop the earth's rotation briefly.
"The point was, then, the earth stopped
rotating, well, there'd be a lot of shit flying
around, but the missiles would be flying
through the air and would, of course, over
shoot their target and they would hit Cleve
land and Boston, places we could spare.
Then we would have the retaliatory force to
destroy Russia with," Ellsberg said.
"I remember reading that report over and
over and looking at the counter-signatures
that had gone through the Air Force staff. I
remember thinking at that time, 'Could I be
in the wrong line of work?' I had a feeling
that I was dealing with people who had,
somehow, lost touch with the broader as
pects of living on this earth," he added.
Get away to Vietnam
Feeling the need to get away from that
kind of thinking, Ellsberg went to Vietnam to
study command control systems.
"FHow many people have seen 'Dr.
Strangelove?' " he asked the audience.
"You have seen a realistic documentary
about command control systems. There is
nothing in the movie that was not, then,
absolutely realistic as a possibility."

Ellsberg used the movie to point out that
there were, and still are, very few things
which would prevent almost any military
person from "pushing the button that
would launch a nuclear attack.
"No U.S. weapon then, and, I believe, no
weapon now had a lock on it of a kind that
would keep people from firing it," Ellsberg
said.
Two-person war
"In principle," he continued, "what they
do have, on a Polaris submarine or
elsewhere, is what they call a two-key sys
tem, which means that it takes two people to
launch World War 111.
"That means that a Polaris submarine is
the third largest nuclear power in the world.
Its 160 warheads, or sometimes 220
warheads, enough for every city over
100,000 in Russia, can be launched from a
submarine without any possibility of being
physically inhibited by Washington,"he
said.
The Atomic Energy Act gives the President
sole authorization to use nuclear weapons,
but, according to Ellsberg, presidents since
Eisenhower have delegated that authority to
lower field commanders even down to the
rank of major in some parts of Korea.
Another problem that Ellsberg encoun
tered was that, in the event a nuclear attack
was launched, there was no "stop" code for
calling back the attacking planes and mis
siles. Ellsberg said the reason given for this
was that the Pentagon was afraid the Rus
sians might discover the "stop" code and
then be able to paralyze the attack.
Useless surrender
"The planes took an average of 14 hours to
arrive on their targets," Ellsberg explained.
"If, during the 14 hours, the Soviets surren
dered about 10 times over, all the bombs
would fall anyway.
"There was one plan at this time. Under
any conditions of war with the Soviet Union,
a Berlin Crisis, a Cuban Crisis, whatever, it
did not require an attack, there was just one
plan. It called for hitting every city in Russia
and China. It didn't matter how it started."
At this time, Ellsberg said he became curi

ous about just how many people would die
under this plan. He asked the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for an estimate.
"The figure was 325 million people,"
Ellsberg remembered. "That was Russia and
China alone. That did not include deaths
from fallout, which would wipe out our allies
Japan, South Korea and Pakistan because
they happened to be on the border of our
strikes. It did not include casualties in West
ern Europe from Russian retaliation.
"It did not include retaliation on the U.S.
The total figure, then, from exercising that
plan, which was the only plan we had, was
five to six hundred million people.
"The laughing stopped for me, at that
point. I was confronting the most evil plans
that humans had ever devised," he said.
False insecurity
This plan, Ellsberg explained, arose from
the fear of the Russians' apparent missile
superiority. Estimates of the Russians having
150-300 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles
(ICBMs) were a prevalent idea at the time, he
said. <
According to Ellsberg, the written ac
counts during the Berlin Crisis in 1961 all
contend that the number was at least 50,
about one for every U.S. militar/ base. The

actual number of missiles, Ellsberg disco
vered, was four.
"In 1961, our B-52s were built to drop 24
megaton bombs," Ellsberg said. "That
means 12 World War lis in one bomb. We
had 650 B-52s then, and bombs for all of
them, plus Polaris, plus Titan, plus Atlas.
This, in a day when there were four Russian
ICBMs confronting us.
Secret accidents
"B-52s were falling out of the air in '61 with
bombs in them," he continued. "The bombs
came very close to going off. Safety systems
failed in every one. You didn't hear about
those accidents at that time. You were pro
tected from that knowledge by our secrecy
system.
"But you would have heard about it if all of
the safety systems in any one bomb had
failed, instead of just three out of four, as
often happened. That would have released
more explosive than all the bombs and shells
in human history, in one accident," Ellsberg
said.
"A lot of people tell me right now that the
only way Americans will ever act on their
conscience or their intelligence to change
the system is after an accident has caught
their attention."
