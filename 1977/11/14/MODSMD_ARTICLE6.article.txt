## It's finally over 
### 
The ASSU Senate set up a few days ago
an Elections Review Board (ERB) which
held hearings and issued its final report
last Thursday night. The ERB disqualified
two senators, suspended one for this
quarter, censured three and reprimanded
16.
We commend the senate for setting up
the board, for having given it full powers
of investigation, and for making the ERB's
decisions final and non-reviewable. We
thank the ERB's members for the many
hours which they spent over just a few
days in dealing with the difficult issues
before them. The ERB rendered fair deci
sions with little law and less precedent to

guide them.
By setting up the ERB, the senate can
function for the rest of its term without
having to deal with questions concerning
the recent campaign and election. All
doubts and shadows on the senate's cre
dibility have been removed; the senate
can now work on the matters before it.
We look forward to reading the ERB's
recommendations on election reform.
Persons who have suggestions on election
reform should submit their ideas to the
senajte by the first week of winter quarter,
as we believe this is the proper time when
the senate should begin to consider re
form legislation.
