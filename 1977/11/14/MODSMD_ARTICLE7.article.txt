# Attacks are faulty
## Defending corporate profits 
### 
Richard Fearon

Corporate profits — and especially
the profits of large American multi
nationals — have been attacked voc
iferously during the past few years.
Groups ranging from Marxists to
farmers have denounced the size of
these profits, and several proposals
have been promulgated to break up
some of the large U.S. corporations.
Attacks such as these are predi
cated upon faulty assumptions. A
look at the empirical data and
theoretical analysis of economic
concentration shows that the anti
trustaction espoused by many would
be conterproductive, as well as con
trary to the ethics upon which
America was founded.
Analysis of third-quarter profits
earned by several large American
firms, reported in this week's issue of
Business Week, indicates that profits
are not nearly so large as has been
charged.
General Motors (GM) maintained a
profit margin of a mere 3.5 per cent
during the third quarter of 1977. Pro
fits rose just one per cent from the
same quarter last year (since these
figures are not adjusted for inflation,
GM's real profits fell in the third
quarter).
Exxon, that oft-reviled corporate
giant, was only able to muster a profit
margin of 4.4 per cent — and its 1977
third-quarter profits were equal to
those in the third quarter of 1976.
Likewise, Beatrice Foods, by far
the largest food processor in the Un
ited States, managed only a 3.8 per
cent profit margin. And Tenneco,
one of the largest conglomerates,
maintained just a 5.5 per cent profit
margin.
These low profit margins indicate
that in almost every case, the corpo
ration is making profits of three to
five cents for each dollar of sales. Do
these profits seem inordinately
large?
According to the contemporary
oligopoly model, one expects firms
with a controlling share of the market
to raise prices above competitive
levels and to produce less than they
would produce under free competi
tion. Even if one concedes that sev

eral U.S. industries evidence con
centration ratios sufficient to be ac
corded the status of "oligopolies,"
does this inelectably mean that these
industries are less efficient than
freely-competitive industries would
be?
A host of studies indicate that the
answer is "no." D.T. Armentano, in
his excellent book "The Myths of An
titrust," analyzes the economic per
formance data for the companies in
volved in every major U.S. antitrust
case to date.
Armentano argues that although
market arrangements may be such
that a degree of market price control
is garnered, this control inevitably
wanes — and usually quickly. Thus,
even if oligopolies do occur, their
effects are bound to be minimized.
A look at the figures concerning
the most famous U.S. antitrust case,
that of the United States v. Standard
Oil Company of New Jersey, sup
ports Armentano's assertion.
Most people hold the view that the
Standard Oil case represents a blat
ant attempt to gain monopoly pro
fits. And it is commonly believed
that, had the government not inter
vened to splinter Standard Oil ot
New )ersey, this "monopoly" would
have continued into perpetuity.
Armentano's figures indicate that
these beliefs are unjustified. He
notes that by 1908, the date the case
was first brought to court, there were
at least 125 independent refineries in
the United States. And he provides
figures that indicate that Standard's
share of the market had fallen drasti
cally by the time the Supreme Court
adjudicated the case in 1911.
Armentano also argues that even
during the time that Standard Oil en
joyed 89 per cent of the petroleum
market, its performance was any
thing but the performance of a
monopolist — indeed, Standard Oil
drastically reduced prices and in
creased output several-fold. The
price of refined oil per gallon in bar
rels declined from 9-1/8 cents in 1880
to 5.91 cents in 1897.
One finds it difficult to argue that
this is the behavior of a monopolist

out to grasp any possible gains.
Former U.S. Solicitor General
Robert Bork contends that the exis
tence of an oligopoly need not cause
non-optimal production and dis
tribution of resources. Says he:
"When firms grow to size that
create concentration or when such a
structure is created by merger and
persists for many years, there is a
very strong prima facie case that the
firms' sizes are related to efficiency
. . . (and) service to consumers."
Even if large firms are making sub
stantial profits, these profits in no
way imply that the goods offered by
the oligopolists could be offered for
sale at any lower cost. Profit is not a
valid parameter of economic per
formance; efficiency is the criterion
that must be emphasized.
The expense of antitrust action
further militates against its use.
Court costs usually are very high and
the effort needed to determine
which industries are practicing
oligopolistic pricing (assuming that it
is possible to find such industries)
also is costly.
Furthermore, can the government
organize an industry as efficiently as
naturally-arising oligopolies? Recent
explorations of the government's
role in public utilities and in the air
line industry cast grave doubt on the
government's efficacy.
More than just this efficiency ar
gument, though, antitrust action
conflicts with American morals.
Achievement has always been valued
above all else — and society seems to
have internalized the precept that
benefits should be distributed ac
cording to effort.
Large corporations are firms that
have become successful. Is it fair to
censure them for being too success
ful?
Ultimately, antitrust contravenes
the right of an individual to make any
agreements that he wishes. Even it a
monopolist were to restrict produc
tion, this should be his right.
After all, one does not have to buy
what the monopolist offers.

those in the third quarter of 1976.
Likewise, Beatrice Foods, by far
the largest food processor in the Un
ited States, managed only a 3.8 per
cent profit margin. And Tenneco,
one of the largest conglomerates,
maintained just a 5.5 per cent profit
margin.
These low profit margins indicate
that in almost every case, the corpo
ration is making profits of three to
five cents for each dollar of sales. Do
these profits seem inordinately
large?
According to the contemporary
oligopoly model, one expects firms
with a controlling share of the market
to raise prices above competitive
levels and to produce less than they
would produce under free competi
tion. Even if one concedes that sev

eral U.S. industries evidence con
centration ratios sufficient to be ac
corded the status of "oligopolies,"
does this inelectably mean that these
industries are less efficient than
freely-competitive industries would
be?
A host of studies indicate that the
answer is "no." D.T. Armentano, in
his excellent book "The Myths of An
titrust," analyzes the economic per
formance data for the companies in
volved in every major U.S. antitrust
case to date.
Armentano argues that although
market arrangements may be such
that a degree of market price control
is garnered, this control inevitably
wanes — and usually quickly. Thus,
even if oligopolies do occur, their
effects are bound to be minimized.
A look at the figures concerning
the most famous U.S. antitrust case,
that of the United States v. Standard
Oil Company of New Jersey, sup
ports Armentano's assertion.
Most people hold the view that the
Standard Oil case represents a blat
ant attempt to gain monopoly pro
fits. And it is commonly believed
that, had the government not inter
vened to splinter Standard Oil ot
New )ersey, this "monopoly" would
have continued into perpetuity.
Armentano's figures indicate that
these beliefs are unjustified. He
notes that by 1908, the date the case
was first brought to court, there were
at least 125 independent refineries in
the United States. And he provides
figures that indicate that Standard's
share of the market had fallen drasti
cally by the time the Supreme Court
adjudicated the case in 1911.
Armentano also argues that even
during the time that Standard Oil en
joyed 89 per cent of the petroleum
market, its performance was any
thing but the performance of a
monopolist — indeed, Standard Oil
drastically reduced prices and in
creased output several-fold. The
price of refined oil per gallon in bar
rels declined from 9-1/8 cents in 1880
to 5.91 cents in 1897.
One finds it difficult to argue that
this is the behavior of a monopolist

out to grasp any possible gains.
Former U.S. Solicitor General
Robert Bork contends that the exis
tence of an oligopoly need not cause
non-optimal production and dis
tribution of resources. Says he:
"When firms grow to size that
create concentration or when such a
structure is created by merger and
persists for many years, there is a
very strong prima facie case that the
firms' sizes are related to efficiency
. . . (and) service to consumers."
Even if large firms are making sub
stantial profits, these profits in no
way imply that the goods offered by
the oligopolists could be offered for
sale at any lower cost. Profit is not a
valid parameter of economic per
formance; efficiency is the criterion
that must be emphasized.
The expense of antitrust action
further militates against its use.
Court costs usually are very high and
the effort needed to determine
which industries are practicing
oligopolistic pricing (assuming that it
is possible to find such industries)
also is costly.
Furthermore, can the government
organize an industry as efficiently as
naturally-arising oligopolies? Recent
explorations of the government's
role in public utilities and in the air
line industry cast grave doubt on the
government's efficacy.
More than just this efficiency ar
gument, though, antitrust action
conflicts with American morals.
Achievement has always been valued
above all else — and society seems to
have internalized the precept that
benefits should be distributed ac
cording to effort.
Large corporations are firms that
have become successful. Is it fair to
censure them for being too success
ful?
Ultimately, antitrust contravenes
the right of an individual to make any
agreements that he wishes. Even it a
monopolist were to restrict produc
tion, this should be his right.
After all, one does not have to buy
what the monopolist offers.

Corporate profits — and especially

market arrangements may be such
that a degree of market price control
is garnered, this control inevitably
wanes — and usually quickly. Thus,
even if oligopolies do occur, their
effects are bound to be minimized.
A look at the figures concerning
the most famous U.S. antitrust case,
that of the United States v. Standard
Oil Company of New Jersey, sup
ports Armentano's assertion.
Most people hold the view that the
Standard Oil case represents a blat
ant attempt to gain monopoly pro
fits. And it is commonly believed
that, had the government not inter
vened to splinter Standard Oil ot
New )ersey, this "monopoly" would
have continued into perpetuity.
Armentano's figures indicate that
these beliefs are unjustified. He
notes that by 1908, the date the case
was first brought to court, there were
at least 125 independent refineries in
the United States. And he provides
figures that indicate that Standard's
share of the market had fallen drasti
cally by the time the Supreme Court
adjudicated the case in 1911.
Armentano also argues that even
during the time that Standard Oil en
joyed 89 per cent of the petroleum
market, its performance was any
thing but the performance of a
monopolist — indeed, Standard Oil
drastically reduced prices and in
creased output several-fold. The
price of refined oil per gallon in bar
rels declined from 9-1/8 cents in 1880
to 5.91 cents in 1897.
One finds it difficult to argue that
this is the behavior of a monopolist

out to grasp any possible gains.
Former U.S. Solicitor General
Robert Bork contends that the exis
tence of an oligopoly need not cause
non-optimal production and dis
tribution of resources. Says he:
"When firms grow to size that
create concentration or when such a
structure is created by merger and
persists for many years, there is a
very strong prima facie case that the
firms' sizes are related to efficiency
. . . (and) service to consumers."
Even if large firms are making sub
stantial profits, these profits in no
way imply that the goods offered by
the oligopolists could be offered for
sale at any lower cost. Profit is not a
valid parameter of economic per
formance; efficiency is the criterion
that must be emphasized.
The expense of antitrust action
further militates against its use.
Court costs usually are very high and
the effort needed to determine
which industries are practicing
oligopolistic pricing (assuming that it
is possible to find such industries)
also is costly.
Furthermore, can the government
organize an industry as efficiently as
naturally-arising oligopolies? Recent
explorations of the government's
role in public utilities and in the air
line industry cast grave doubt on the
government's efficacy.
More than just this efficiency ar
gument, though, antitrust action
conflicts with American morals.
Achievement has always been valued
above all else — and society seems to
have internalized the precept that
benefits should be distributed ac
cording to effort.
Large corporations are firms that
have become successful. Is it fair to
censure them for being too success
ful?
Ultimately, antitrust contravenes
the right of an individual to make any
agreements that he wishes. Even it a
monopolist were to restrict produc
tion, this should be his right.
After all, one does not have to buy
what the monopolist offers.

Corporate profits — and especially
the profits of large American multi
nationals — have been attacked voc
iferously during the past few years.
Groups ranging from Marxists to
farmers have denounced the size of
these profits, and several proposals
have been promulgated to break up
some of the large U.S. corporations.
Attacks such as these are predi
cated upon faulty assumptions. A
look at the empirical data and
theoretical analysis of economic
concentration shows that the anti
trustaction espoused by many would
be conterproductive, as well as con
trary to the ethics upon which
America was founded.
Analysis of third-quarter profits
earned by several large American
firms, reported in this week's issue of
Business Week, indicates that profits
are not nearly so large as has been
charged.
General Motors (GM) maintained a
profit margin of a mere 3.5 per cent
during the third quarter of 1977. Pro
fits rose just one per cent from the
same quarter last year (since these
figures are not adjusted for inflation,
GM's real profits fell in the third
quarter).
Exxon, that oft-reviled corporate
giant, was only able to muster a profit
margin of 4.4 per cent — and its 1977
third-quarter profits were equal to
those in the third quarter of 1976.
Likewise, Beatrice Foods, by far
the largest food processor in the Un
ited States, managed only a 3.8 per
cent profit margin. And Tenneco,
one of the largest conglomerates,
maintained just a 5.5 per cent profit
margin.
These low profit margins indicate
that in almost every case, the corpo
ration is making profits of three to
five cents for each dollar of sales. Do
these profits seem inordinately
large?
According to the contemporary
oligopoly model, one expects firms
with a controlling share of the market
to raise prices above competitive
levels and to produce less than they
would produce under free competi
tion. Even if one concedes that sev

eral U.S. industries evidence con
centration ratios sufficient to be ac
corded the status of "oligopolies,"
does this inelectably mean that these
industries are less efficient than
freely-competitive industries would
be?
A host of studies indicate that the
answer is "no." D.T. Armentano, in
his excellent book "The Myths of An
titrust," analyzes the economic per
formance data for the companies in
volved in every major U.S. antitrust
case to date.
Armentano argues that although
market arrangements may be such
that a degree of market price control
is garnered, this control inevitably
wanes — and usually quickly. Thus,
