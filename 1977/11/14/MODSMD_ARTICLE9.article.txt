# Board, Daily have failed
## The 						analysis of South Africa 
### 
Peter Salovey

It is time to analyze critically the
possibilities for positive change in
South Africa and decisively act on the
basis of that analysis. The Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP) feels that the
Board of Trustees in its actions of last
spring and the Daily editorial board
in its editorial "Accounting for apar
theid" have failed on both counts.
On the one hand, the Board of
Trustees has yet to substantiate its
position that the most progressive
thing U.S. corporations can do is to
remain in South Africa and work for
equal employment opportunity.
Last spring, we requested that the
trustees provide such concrete evi
dence; so farwehdve met with much
rhetoric and no action.
On the other hand, SCRIP has
done and continues to do its
homework. Two lengthy papers
were issued last spring which sub
stantiate the position that Stanford
ought to be working for withdrawal
of American corporations from
South Africa. We are currently work
ing on two new, more comprehen
sive, documents, includingacritique
of the administration's divestment
cost report.
The lack of facts and analysis be
hind the trustees' progressive force
argument has not daunted the Daily
editorial board from putting forth es
sentially the same prescription. The
board appears to only disagree with
the trustees over the means for com
pelling corporations to exercise their
supposed potential to erode apar

theid.
Because the editorial board has
not even begun to seriously confront
the following issues, they have been
diverted by the myth that U.S. corpo
rations in South Africa can be a prog
ressive force:
—have American corporations his
torically played an effective role in
opposing the apartheid system?
—can proposed corporate reform
strategies realistically lead to a sig
nificant change in the statusiof South
African blacks?
—in what ways do foreign invest
ments actively support the con
tinued strength and determination of
the white regime?
—could the withdrawal of such in
vestments help to create the condi
tions necessary for eliminating apar
theid?
Because these issues are crucial
ones in deciding what strategy will be
most effective — workplace reform
or withdrawal — we shall deal with
them in subsequent articles.
Furthermore, because these articles
can necessarily only provide a con
densed version of our analysis, more
extensive material will be made av
ailable on reserve at UGLY.
Although we emphasize the failure
of the trustees and editorial board to
make informed judgments about
what should be done with Stanford's
South African investments, their dis
agreement with SCRIP is not just a
matter of inadequate education on
the issues. Specifically in the case of
the trustees, vested interests appear

to weigh heavily.
For example, Trustee John Grey is
president of Standard Oil of Califor
nia. There is evidence that his sub
sidiary in South Africa, Caltex (jointly
owned with Texaco) has been provid
ing fuel to the South African military
and is involved in illegally tranship
ping oil through South Africa to
Rhodesia.
Trustee Thomas Pike is vice
chairman of the Flour Corporation
which is currently building a $2 bill
ion coal-to-oil plant in South Africa.
This will eventually satisfy 25 per cent
of South Africa's petroleum needs
and make the white regime less sus
ceptible to economic sanctions.
And there is Trustee John Young,
who is executive vice-president of
Hewlett-Packard. A Hewlett-Packard
computer, the HP2116, has served
the Armaments Board of South Af
rica. This board has been given the
responsibility to "control the man
ufacture, acquisition, and develop
ment and supply of armaments."
Thus, we see that more than mere
ideas divide the Stanford community
on the issue of investment policy. In
terest also divides. This is something
the Daily editorial fails to recognize
in its dreamy call for unity, and in its
illogical suggestion that the "con
frontation" of last year's sit-in some
how had nothing to do with "improv
ing the lives of the South African
people."

It is time to analyze critically the
possibilities for positive change in
South Africa and decisively act on the
basis of that analysis. The Stanford
Committee for a Responsible In
vestment Policy (SCRIP) feels that the
Board of Trustees in its actions of last
spring and the Daily editorial board
in its editorial "Accounting for apar
theid" have failed on both counts.
On the one hand, the Board of
Trustees has yet to substantiate its
position that the most progressive
thing U.S. corporations can do is to
remain in South Africa and work for
equal employment opportunity.
Last spring, we requested that the
trustees provide such concrete evi
dence; so farwehdve met with much
rhetoric and no action.
On the other hand, SCRIP has
done and continues to do its
homework. Two lengthy papers
were issued last spring which sub
stantiate the position that Stanford
ought to be working for withdrawal
of American corporations from
South Africa. We are currently work
ing on two new, more comprehen
sive, documents, includingacritique
of the administration's divestment
cost report.
The lack of facts and analysis be
hind the trustees' progressive force
argument has not daunted the Daily
editorial board from putting forth es
sentially the same prescription. The
board appears to only disagree with
the trustees over the means for com
pelling corporations to exercise their
supposed potential to erode apar

theid.
Because the editorial board has
not even begun to seriously confront
the following issues, they have been
diverted by the myth that U.S. corpo
rations in South Africa can be a prog
ressive force:
—have American corporations his
torically played an effective role in
opposing the apartheid system?
—can proposed corporate reform
strategies realistically lead to a sig
nificant change in the statusiof South
African blacks?
—in what ways do foreign invest
ments actively support the con
tinued strength and determination of
the white regime?
—could the withdrawal of such in
vestments help to create the condi
tions necessary for eliminating apar
theid?
Because these issues are crucial
ones in deciding what strategy will be
most effective — workplace reform
or withdrawal — we shall deal with
them in subsequent articles.
Furthermore, because these articles
can necessarily only provide a con
densed version of our analysis, more
extensive material will be made av
ailable on reserve at UGLY.
Although we emphasize the failure
of the trustees and editorial board to
make informed judgments about
what should be done with Stanford's
South African investments, their dis
agreement with SCRIP is not just a
matter of inadequate education on
the issues. Specifically in the case of
the trustees, vested interests appear

to weigh heavily.
For example, Trustee John Grey is
president of Standard Oil of Califor
nia. There is evidence that his sub
sidiary in South Africa, Caltex (jointly
owned with Texaco) has been provid
ing fuel to the South African military
and is involved in illegally tranship
ping oil through South Africa to
Rhodesia.
Trustee Thomas Pike is vice
chairman of the Flour Corporation
which is currently building a $2 bill
ion coal-to-oil plant in South Africa.
This will eventually satisfy 25 per cent
of South Africa's petroleum needs
and make the white regime less sus
