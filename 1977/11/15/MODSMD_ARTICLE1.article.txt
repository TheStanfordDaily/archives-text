# Dealers, police discuss cocaine use on campus
##

"It's the champagne ot the drug
world," said one 20-year-old stu
dent who deals cocaine here. "If
you can afford it, do it.'
"It's a social stigma. If someone
comes to my room, instead of ot
tering him a cocktail, I offer him a
line," said another dealer.
Cocaine is expensive and illegal
— and can be fatal if abused. Vet,
one dealer estimates that "there
are about 20 to 30 dealers on cam
pus. About 15 per cent of the stu
dents here use cocaine. Almost 40
per cent of all my friends use it."
Known by several nicknames —
"snow," "flake," "C," "ice,"
"nose candy" and "coke" — the
campus costs of the drug are bet
ween $90 and $120 per gram.
Users tvpically go through $25 of
cocaine in a session.

When one freshman cocaine
user was asked if his dealer had
given him a fair deal, his im
mediate response was, "Yes, he's
a personal friend of mine. He gets
me a decent deal. Accessibility is
good, and he always has some
stuff."
A senior who has been dealing
tor three years explained how he
meets the rising costs of college
lite. "I usually defer my tuition. I
go into the City and can usually

find an oh-zee floating around in
the $1500 to $1900 range.
"Sometimes I can get rid ot all
28 grams in one day. It depends
on the clientele. It's like the stock
market. You develop clientele
and Bam\" he said.
"I close the deal, make the pro
fit, and repay my tuition. But, it's
not the safest business in the
world," he said.
"I don't worry about the Stan
ford police. In general, they're
pretty cool," he said.
No narcs
Police Services Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said, "There are no
narcs actively working on cam
pus. There have been no reported
cases (of cocaine possession)."
Niemeyer said he had no idea
how many students use the drug.
Only when a case is reported to
the campus police is it actively
pursued, he said.
"We know guys smoke grass.
Are the (cocaine) dealers Stanford
students? Maybe I better tell Nar
cotics to get up here," he said.
Niemeyeralso said, "We've had
only one (cocaine) arrest on cam
pus and that was a juvenile irom
Palo Alto High School."
Santa Clara agents
According to a Santa Clara
County Narcotics Bureau inves
tigator, undercover agents trom

the bureau "have ventured or
wandered on the campus a couple
of times," over the past two years
while investigating various drug
dealers.
He said that he could not dis
cuss specific cases or investiga
tions.
Trafficking large amounts ot
cocaine with the intent of selling
is a felony in California. A first
time offender can receive 15 years
in jail with a possible $25,000 tine.
A first offense with intent to sell
lesser amounts of cocaine draws
five to 15 years in jail.
Possession of cocaine tor per
sonal use in a first offense can re
sult in two to 10 years in jail.
Organized entry
Cocaine, a powder made trom
the dried leaves of the coca plant
of the Andean valleys, is usually
smuggled into the United States
by Colombians, many times spon
sored by organized crime groups.
However, there are the inde
pendent workers, the college
students, who while touring
South America may pick up a few
kilos to sell when they get home.
"In Bolivia it's only about $4.50
pergram,"saysonedealer. "Butit
you get caught, sometimes the
only way out is to bribe the police.
It can cost you anywhere from
$600 to $1000."

Some people have tried
smuggh ng coke out ot the country
in their children's clothing, in a
bottle ot whiskey, in tooth paste
tubes, and even in the cage ot a
boa constrictor.
Intellectual syrup
There are a number of ways to
eat cocaine. In 1886, Coca-Cola
was made by mixing cocaine and
caffeine in a syrup called "the in
tellectual beverage."
Today, cocaine can be sprink
led into cocktails or smoked with
tobacco or marijuana. Some
people enjoy "frosties": one per
son puts a small portion ot
cocaine on a piece ot paper and
blows it into the back ot another's
mouth.
Cocaine can be snorted, snitted
or blown on a "line" — cutting the
cocaine powder into sharp, pre
cise rows with a razor blade.
Using a straw or a rolled up $100
bill, as is the latest jet set tad, the
powder is inhaled through the
nostrils and mouth.
The drug has a tairly quick but
short effect, usually lasting 10 to
15 minutes. Atter it is inhaled, it
combines with the mucus and
drips down the back ol the throat
producing a numbing ettect.
Cocaine is a stimulant. It does
not result in blurred vision or

you can afford it, do it.'
"It's a social stigma. If someone

Cocaine is expensive and illegal
— and can be fatal if abused. Vet,
one dealer estimates that "there

When one freshman cocaine

A senior who has been dealing
tor three years explained how he
meets the rising costs of college

go into the City and can usually

find an oh-zee floating around in
the $1500 to $1900 range.

Police Services Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said, "There are no

Niemeyer said he had no idea
how many students use the drug.
Only when a case is reported to
the campus police is it actively

Are the (cocaine) dealers Stanford

Santa Clara agents
According to a Santa Clara
County Narcotics Bureau inves
tigator, undercover agents trom

the bureau "have ventured or
wandered on the campus a couple
of times," over the past two years
while investigating various drug
dealers.
He said that he could not dis
cuss specific cases or investiga
tions.
Trafficking large amounts ot
cocaine with the intent of selling
is a felony in California. A first
time offender can receive 15 years
in jail with a possible $25,000 tine.
A first offense with intent to sell
lesser amounts of cocaine draws
five to 15 years in jail.
Possession of cocaine tor per
sonal use in a first offense can re
sult in two to 10 years in jail.
Organized entry
Cocaine, a powder made trom
the dried leaves of the coca plant
of the Andean valleys, is usually
smuggled into the United States
by Colombians, many times spon
sored by organized crime groups.
However, there are the inde
pendent workers, the college
students, who while touring
South America may pick up a few
kilos to sell when they get home.
"In Bolivia it's only about $4.50
pergram,"saysonedealer. "Butit
you get caught, sometimes the
only way out is to bribe the police.
It can cost you anywhere from
$600 to $1000."

Some people have tried
smuggh ng coke out ot the country
in their children's clothing, in a
bottle ot whiskey, in tooth paste
tubes, and even in the cage ot a
boa constrictor.
Intellectual syrup
There are a number of ways to
eat cocaine. In 1886, Coca-Cola
was made by mixing cocaine and
caffeine in a syrup called "the in
tellectual beverage."
Today, cocaine can be sprink
led into cocktails or smoked with
tobacco or marijuana. Some
people enjoy "frosties": one per
son puts a small portion ot
cocaine on a piece ot paper and
blows it into the back ot another's
mouth.
Cocaine can be snorted, snitted
or blown on a "line" — cutting the
cocaine powder into sharp, pre
cise rows with a razor blade.
Using a straw or a rolled up $100
bill, as is the latest jet set tad, the
powder is inhaled through the
nostrils and mouth.
The drug has a tairly quick but
short effect, usually lasting 10 to
15 minutes. Atter it is inhaled, it
combines with the mucus and
drips down the back ol the throat
producing a numbing ettect.

"It's the champagne ot the drug
world," said one 20-year-old stu
dent who deals cocaine here. "If
you can afford it, do it.'
"It's a social stigma. If someone
comes to my room, instead of ot
tering him a cocktail, I offer him a
line," said another dealer.
Cocaine is expensive and illegal
— and can be fatal if abused. Vet,
one dealer estimates that "there
are about 20 to 30 dealers on cam
pus. About 15 per cent of the stu
dents here use cocaine. Almost 40
per cent of all my friends use it."
Known by several nicknames —
"snow," "flake," "C," "ice,"

cocaine in a session.

When one freshman cocaine
user was asked if his dealer had
given him a fair deal, his im
mediate response was, "Yes, he's
a personal friend of mine. He gets
me a decent deal. Accessibility is
good, and he always has some
stuff."
A senior who has been dealing
tor three years explained how he
meets the rising costs of college
lite. "I usually defer my tuition. I
go into the City and can usually

find an oh-zee floating around in
the $1500 to $1900 range.
"Sometimes I can get rid ot all
28 grams in one day. It depends
on the clientele. It's like the stock
market. You develop clientele
and Bam\" he said.
"I close the deal, make the pro
fit, and repay my tuition. But, it's
not the safest business in the
world," he said.
"I don't worry about the Stan
ford police. In general, they're
pretty cool," he said.
No narcs
Police Services Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said, "There are no
narcs actively working on cam
pus. There have been no reported
cases (of cocaine possession)."
Niemeyer said he had no idea
how many students use the drug.
Only when a case is reported to
the campus police is it actively
pursued, he said.
"We know guys smoke grass.
Are the (cocaine) dealers Stanford
students? Maybe I better tell Nar
cotics to get up here," he said.
Niemeyeralso said, "We've had
only one (cocaine) arrest on cam
pus and that was a juvenile irom
Palo Alto High School."
Santa Clara agents
According to a Santa Clara
County Narcotics Bureau inves
tigator, undercover agents trom

the bureau "have ventured or
wandered on the campus a couple
of times," over the past two years
while investigating various drug
dealers.
He said that he could not dis
cuss specific cases or investiga
tions.
Trafficking large amounts ot
cocaine with the intent of selling
is a felony in California. A first
time offender can receive 15 years
in jail with a possible $25,000 tine.
A first offense with intent to sell
lesser amounts of cocaine draws
five to 15 years in jail.
Possession of cocaine tor per
sonal use in a first offense can re
sult in two to 10 years in jail.
Organized entry
Cocaine, a powder made trom
the dried leaves of the coca plant
of the Andean valleys, is usually
smuggled into the United States
by Colombians, many times spon
sored by organized crime groups.
However, there are the inde
pendent workers, the college
students, who while touring
South America may pick up a few
kilos to sell when they get home.
"In Bolivia it's only about $4.50
pergram,"saysonedealer. "Butit
you get caught, sometimes the
only way out is to bribe the police.
It can cost you anywhere from
$600 to $1000."

Some people have tried
smuggh ng coke out ot the country
in their children's clothing, in a
bottle ot whiskey, in tooth paste
tubes, and even in the cage ot a
boa constrictor.
Intellectual syrup
There are a number of ways to
eat cocaine. In 1886, Coca-Cola
was made by mixing cocaine and
caffeine in a syrup called "the in
tellectual beverage."
Today, cocaine can be sprink
led into cocktails or smoked with
tobacco or marijuana. Some
people enjoy "frosties": one per
son puts a small portion ot
cocaine on a piece ot paper and
blows it into the back ot another's
mouth.
Cocaine can be snorted, snitted
or blown on a "line" — cutting the
cocaine powder into sharp, pre
cise rows with a razor blade.
Using a straw or a rolled up $100
bill, as is the latest jet set tad, the
powder is inhaled through the
nostrils and mouth.
The drug has a tairly quick but
short effect, usually lasting 10 to
15 minutes. Atter it is inhaled, it
combines with the mucus and
drips down the back ol the throat
producing a numbing ettect.
