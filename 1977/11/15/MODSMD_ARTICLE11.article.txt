# Team effort necessary
## Health care costs rising fast 
### 
David Sartor is

Few Americans would argue that
one of our nation's most pressing
problems is the rising cost of health
care. Ten years ago, health care costs
consumed about six per cent of the
gross national product, while today it
stands close to nine per cent.
The average hospital bill at present
amounts to twice what it was in 1972.
For individuals lacking employment
benefits and not qualifying tor Medi
care, Medi-Cal, and similar prog
rams, the concomitant rise in health

insurance premiums has made ill
ness a luxury.
The accusing linger has been
pointed at a number of factors which
have contributed to the runaway na
ture of this problem. Unnecessary
duplication of infrequently used new
medical technology is one source ot
wasted funds.
For example, it has been estimated
that nearly three billion dollars
would be required to install a CAT
scanner, one of the newest diagnos
tic tools, in each of the country's 6000
general hospitals. In this case, tault
lies with the hospital, which is able to
attract physicians and hence patients
only by providing the latest equip
ment.
Sharing of expensive facilities by
adjacent hospitals would eliminate
many currently wasteful situations. A
recent government study revealed
that only 5 of 16 Philadelphia open
heart surgery programs are used
enough to be considered efficient.
Equally unimpressive is the fact that
an estimated 100,000 unnecessary
hospital beds lie empty each day, at a
cost of $2 billion per year.
Commissions
Establishment of state and local
commissions to set limits on hospital
expenditures could also help to curb
health care inflation.
The physician is also guilty ot con
tributing to rising medical costs via
unnecessary admissions, prolonged
hospitalization periods, and overuse
of diagnostic and laboratory studies.
Clearly, a test should be performed
only when it leads to differential
diagnosis and not out of academic
interest or as a check ot established
tindtngs.
The potential savings justify erec
tion of local medical societies, simi
lar to the "Professional Standards
Review Organization" for Medicare
and Medicaid patients, to monitor
doctors' use of hospitals.
Finally, the patient's contribution
to financially prohibitive health care

comes through adoption of the aver
age American lifestyle. Often charac
terized by obesity, lack of exercise,
excessive smoking and alcohol con
sumption and chronic stress, the typ
ical citizen of this country does rela
tively little to stay out of the hospital
or doctor's office.
Although the situation has im
proved substantially in recent years,
more programs designed to promote
education in diet, health, and physi
cal fitness are certainly indicated, at
all levels. The sound rationale be
hind this recommendation is that ef
fective individual preventive mea
sures will decrease utilization of
formal care and hence slow the rise
in medical costs.
Thus, it is clear that a team effort —
involving hospitals, physicians and
patients — is essential if quality med
ical care is to be made financially
feasible to all Americans. The basic
human right to good health should
not be treated as a commodity, even
in a capitalistic society like our own.
The possibility of a National Health
Care System as the ultimate solution
should not be discarded due to appa
rent failures in other countries. In
stead, we should endeavor to learn
from past mistakes and to design a
plan which sets money and secon
dary gain aside in the interest of the
patient.

insurance premiums has made ill
ness a luxury.
The accusing linger has been
pointed at a number of factors which
have contributed to the runaway na
ture of this problem. Unnecessary
duplication of infrequently used new
medical technology is one source ot
wasted funds.
For example, it has been estimated
that nearly three billion dollars
would be required to install a CAT
scanner, one of the newest diagnos
tic tools, in each of the country's 6000
general hospitals. In this case, tault
lies with the hospital, which is able to
attract physicians and hence patients
only by providing the latest equip
ment.
Sharing of expensive facilities by
adjacent hospitals would eliminate
many currently wasteful situations. A
recent government study revealed
that only 5 of 16 Philadelphia open
heart surgery programs are used
enough to be considered efficient.
Equally unimpressive is the fact that
an estimated 100,000 unnecessary
hospital beds lie empty each day, at a
cost of $2 billion per year.
Commissions
Establishment of state and local
commissions to set limits on hospital
expenditures could also help to curb
health care inflation.
The physician is also guilty ot con
tributing to rising medical costs via
unnecessary admissions, prolonged
hospitalization periods, and overuse
of diagnostic and laboratory studies.
Clearly, a test should be performed
only when it leads to differential
diagnosis and not out of academic
interest or as a check ot established
tindtngs.
The potential savings justify erec
tion of local medical societies, simi
lar to the "Professional Standards
Review Organization" for Medicare
and Medicaid patients, to monitor
doctors' use of hospitals.
Finally, the patient's contribution
to financially prohibitive health care

comes through adoption of the aver
age American lifestyle. Often charac
terized by obesity, lack of exercise,
excessive smoking and alcohol con
sumption and chronic stress, the typ
ical citizen of this country does rela
tively little to stay out of the hospital
or doctor's office.
Although the situation has im
proved substantially in recent years,
more programs designed to promote
education in diet, health, and physi
cal fitness are certainly indicated, at
all levels. The sound rationale be
hind this recommendation is that ef
fective individual preventive mea
sures will decrease utilization of
formal care and hence slow the rise
in medical costs.
Thus, it is clear that a team effort —
involving hospitals, physicians and
patients — is essential if quality med
ical care is to be made financially
feasible to all Americans. The basic
human right to good health should
not be treated as a commodity, even
in a capitalistic society like our own.
The possibility of a National Health
Care System as the ultimate solution
should not be discarded due to appa
rent failures in other countries. In
stead, we should endeavor to learn
from past mistakes and to design a
plan which sets money and secon
dary gain aside in the interest of the
patient.

Few Americans would argue that
one of our nation's most pressing
problems is the rising cost of health
care. Ten years ago, health care costs
consumed about six per cent of the
gross national product, while today it
stands close to nine per cent.
The average hospital bill at present
amounts to twice what it was in 1972.
For individuals lacking employment
benefits and not qualifying tor Medi
care, Medi-Cal, and similar prog
rams, the concomitant rise in health

insurance premiums has made ill
ness a luxury.
