Bike hazard
After witnessing several accidents
and near accidents near the Old En
gineering corner, behind Memorial
Church, and in many other locations
on campus, it has become apparent
that hazards to pedestrians and
bicyclists have greatly increased in
the last tew years.
The problem is compounded by
the great number ot university vehi
cles that race around campus with
out regard to the greater hazards in
volved with motorized vehicles. I
teel that the escalating hazard calls
for a university study of the situation.
A university task force with the ex
press purpose of formulating
guidelines or regulations concerning
on-campus bike usage should be
formed. At the very least, an in-depth
bike safety program is desperately
needed.
Some specific areas that could be
dealt with are:
1. Regulation of speed at major in
tersections and thoroughfares.
2. Parking of bikes in hazardous lo
cations, such as in the archways ol
the Quad or in front of the steps
near Tresidder Union.
3. Riding of bicycles in the archways.
4. Usage of mopeds and motorcy
cles on campus.
5. Usage of university vehicles. Who
uses them and what guidelines
are they given? What penalties

and enforcement are they liable
for?
I am especially concerned with the
effects that all ot these situations
have on those members of the Stan
ford community whodo not have the
avoidance capabilities ol a Darrin
Nelson. These problems should be
considered in light of the many
young and elderly members ot the
community who have to contend
with the daily grind on campus. I am
sure that this problem is of major
concern to the disabled students on
campus, who also have to compete
in this chaotic situation.
The university needs to seriously
look into this matter.

I should like to add my thoughts to
those expressed by James Gere
(Daily, Nov. 7) regarding the condi
tion of the athletic plant used by fa
culty and staff.
Not only are there real problems
with Angell field (weeds, uneven
surfaces, dangerous gopher holes,
etc.), but also, the condition ot the
section of Encina Gym used by fa
culty and statt leaves much to be de
sired.
Many lockers are old and rusty,
peeling paint abounds and cleaning
of the dressing areas appears to be

very sporadic.
It seems to me that the great im
portance attached by faculty and staff
to regular exercise, and the obvious
benefits derived therefrom, more
than justifies the expenditure of only
a reasonable amount of funds and
effort to provide suitable locker,
shower, and dressing facilities for
statt and faculty in Encina Gym.

Return chimp
Leave it to Cal to mistake a chim r
panzee for a bear.
Certain individuals claiming to be
representatives of the University ol
California broke into the display
window ot the Stanlord University
Career Planning and Placement
Center and stole a three-toot stutted
black chimpanzee dressed as a "Big
Red Rooter" sometime between 5
p.m. Thursday, Nov. 10 and 8 a.m.
Enday, Nov. 11. The chimp was re
placed by a "Go Bears" sign; hardly a
suitable substitute to the owner, who
has a great deal ot sentimental
atachment to the animal.
We ot the Career Planning and
Placement Center appeal at this time
for the safe return ot the chimp. No
questions will be asked when it is
placed on our doorstep. (You know
where it is.)

Tuition increase
Alas, it seems that the University
administration has finally decided to
announce next year's tuition in
crease in the hope of finding the stu
dents so busy with mid-terms that
they will not have the time, or the
energy, to voice their dissent, and
perhaps to allow us ample time to
scrounge up the additional funds
needed tor another wonderful year
of the "Stanford experience."
Curiously enough, University Pro
vost William Miller has arrived at the
mystifying conclusion that the stu
dents will be able to afford this size
able tuition increase ($441 per year).
His basic rationale for the hike is that
tuition should grow in proportion to
the increase in national income.
I would like to point out that any
increase in national income tends to
be concentrated in corporation pro
tits, and not in the income ot good
old Mom and Dad.
Finally, these incessant tuition in
creases are steering us toward the
time when admission to Stanford
will be predicated on the student's
ability to pay rather than his ability to
do outstanding academic work. I
would hate lor Stanford to evolve
into the type of private institution
where academic excellence takes a
back seat to the size of the pocket
book.

Tuition increase
Alas, it seems that the University
administration has finally decided to
announce next year's tuition in
crease in the hope of finding the stu
dents so busy with mid-terms that
they will not have the time, or the
energy, to voice their dissent, and
perhaps to allow us ample time to
scrounge up the additional funds
needed tor another wonderful year
of the "Stanford experience."
Curiously enough, University Pro
vost William Miller has arrived at the
mystifying conclusion that the stu
dents will be able to afford this size
able tuition increase ($441 per year).
His basic rationale for the hike is that
tuition should grow in proportion to
the increase in national income.
I would like to point out that any
increase in national income tends to
be concentrated in corporation pro
tits, and not in the income ot good
old Mom and Dad.
Finally, these incessant tuition in
creases are steering us toward the
time when admission to Stanford
will be predicated on the student's
ability to pay rather than his ability to
do outstanding academic work. I
would hate lor Stanford to evolve
into the type of private institution
where academic excellence takes a
back seat to the size of the pocket
book.

Bike hazard
After witnessing several accidents
and near accidents near the Old En
gineering corner, behind Memorial
Church, and in many other locations
on campus, it has become apparent
that hazards to pedestrians and
bicyclists have greatly increased in
the last tew years.
The problem is compounded by
the great number ot university vehi
cles that race around campus with
out regard to the greater hazards in
volved with motorized vehicles. I
teel that the escalating hazard calls
for a university study of the situation.
A university task force with the ex
press purpose of formulating
guidelines or regulations concerning
on-campus bike usage should be
formed. At the very least, an in-depth
bike safety program is desperately
needed.
Some specific areas that could be
dealt with are:
1. Regulation of speed at major in
tersections and thoroughfares.
2. Parking of bikes in hazardous lo
cations, such as in the archways ol
the Quad or in front of the steps
near Tresidder Union.
3. Riding of bicycles in the archways.
4. Usage of mopeds and motorcy
cles on campus.
5. Usage of university vehicles. Who
uses them and what guidelines
are they given? What penalties

and enforcement are they liable
for?
I am especially concerned with the
effects that all ot these situations
have on those members of the Stan
ford community whodo not have the
avoidance capabilities ol a Darrin
Nelson. These problems should be
considered in light of the many
young and elderly members ot the
community who have to contend
with the daily grind on campus. I am
sure that this problem is of major
concern to the disabled students on
campus, who also have to compete
in this chaotic situation.
The university needs to seriously
look into this matter.

I should like to add my thoughts to
those expressed by James Gere
(Daily, Nov. 7) regarding the condi
tion of the athletic plant used by fa
culty and staff.
Not only are there real problems
with Angell field (weeds, uneven
surfaces, dangerous gopher holes,
etc.), but also, the condition ot the
section of Encina Gym used by fa
culty and statt leaves much to be de
sired.
Many lockers are old and rusty,
peeling paint abounds and cleaning
of the dressing areas appears to be

very sporadic.
It seems to me that the great im
portance attached by faculty and staff
to regular exercise, and the obvious
benefits derived therefrom, more
than justifies the expenditure of only
a reasonable amount of funds and
effort to provide suitable locker,
shower, and dressing facilities for
statt and faculty in Encina Gym.

near Tresidder Union.
3. Riding of bicycles in the archways.
4. Usage of mopeds and motorcy
cles on campus.
5. Usage of university vehicles. Who
uses them and what guidelines
are they given? What penalties

and enforcement are they liable
for?
I am especially concerned with the
effects that all ot these situations
have on those members of the Stan
ford community whodo not have the
avoidance capabilities ol a Darrin
Nelson. These problems should be
considered in light of the many
young and elderly members ot the
community who have to contend
with the daily grind on campus. I am
sure that this problem is of major
concern to the disabled students on
campus, who also have to compete
in this chaotic situation.
The university needs to seriously
look into this matter.

Encina Gym
I should like to add my thoughts to
those expressed by James Gere
(Daily, Nov. 7) regarding the condi
tion of the athletic plant used by fa
culty and staff.
Not only are there real problems
with Angell field (weeds, uneven
surfaces, dangerous gopher holes,
etc.), but also, the condition ot the
section of Encina Gym used by fa
culty and statt leaves much to be de
sired.
Many lockers are old and rusty,
peeling paint abounds and cleaning
of the dressing areas appears to be

very sporadic.
It seems to me that the great im
portance attached by faculty and staff
to regular exercise, and the obvious
benefits derived therefrom, more
than justifies the expenditure of only
a reasonable amount of funds and
effort to provide suitable locker,
shower, and dressing facilities for
statt and faculty in Encina Gym.

Return chimp
Leave it to Cal to mistake a chim r
panzee for a bear.
Certain individuals claiming to be
representatives of the University ol
California broke into the display
window ot the Stanlord University
Career Planning and Placement
Center and stole a three-toot stutted
black chimpanzee dressed as a "Big
Red Rooter" sometime between 5
p.m. Thursday, Nov. 10 and 8 a.m.
Enday, Nov. 11. The chimp was re
placed by a "Go Bears" sign; hardly a
suitable substitute to the owner, who
has a great deal ot sentimental
atachment to the animal.
We ot the Career Planning and
Placement Center appeal at this time
for the safe return ot the chimp. No
questions will be asked when it is
placed on our doorstep. (You know
where it is.)

Tuition increase
Alas, it seems that the University
administration has finally decided to
announce next year's tuition in
crease in the hope of finding the stu
dents so busy with mid-terms that
they will not have the time, or the
energy, to voice their dissent, and
perhaps to allow us ample time to
scrounge up the additional funds
needed tor another wonderful year
of the "Stanford experience."
Curiously enough, University Pro
vost William Miller has arrived at the
mystifying conclusion that the stu
dents will be able to afford this size
able tuition increase ($441 per year).
His basic rationale for the hike is that
tuition should grow in proportion to
the increase in national income.
I would like to point out that any
increase in national income tends to
be concentrated in corporation pro
tits, and not in the income ot good
old Mom and Dad.
Finally, these incessant tuition in
creases are steering us toward the
time when admission to Stanford
will be predicated on the student's
ability to pay rather than his ability to
do outstanding academic work. I
would hate lor Stanford to evolve
into the type of private institution
where academic excellence takes a
back seat to the size of the pocket
book.
