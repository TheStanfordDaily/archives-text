# Gaieties: the show everyone's been waiting for
## 
### Lynne Dombrowski 
What in the world is Gaieties? Strange as it may seem, the show
that no one seems to know much about has already sold out it's
6: $0 performance. A 4 p.m. show has also been added.
The most surprised of all about Gaieties' popularity is pro
ducer Keith Light. He had never been in a musical production
before the Ram's Head production ot "Fiddler on the Roof" last
spring. He was a villager in the chorus.
Last spring quarter, Ram's Head decided to do the Big Game
Gaieties "before they knew exactly what it was," according to
Light.
"It's a scary thing for all ot us. We don't know how well it'll be
received. 7rying to build an original show is a scary undertaking,"
he said.
Follies
The first Gaieties was given in 1911 and that tradition lasted
until 1971. The original musical revue was held lour or five times
during the week before Big Game. It used to be called the Foot
ball lollies, patterned after the /iegfield Follies, and then prog
ressed toward parodies and satires.
"Sometimes they flopped but they did them anyway" said
I ight, who spent part of his summer in the archives researching
the show.

A handbill tor the 1933 Gaieties boasted: "All ot the important
dramatic talent of the Stantord campus will be seen in original
satirical sketches, songs and specialty acts, augmented by a danc
ing chorus of 24 specimens ot feminine pulchritude. Cast ot Joo.''
Impromptu
Gaieties has been known for its impromptu manner ot organi
zation. Rehearsals for someof the shows would not start until two
weeks betore showtime. The director ot the 1954 Gaieties leit an
account of his experiences as a warning to tuture directors.
"The big thing to say for this year's show orchestration-wise is
that we did have all the music in our hands tor the Final Dress
Rehearsal. We did not sight read anything on Opening Night," he
wrote.
In 1962, the theme of Gaieties was "Captain Midnight — The
Frozen Orange Vendor." It took a satirical look at the people in
the stands at Big Game.
The last production of Gaieties in 1971 had a spoot on Dracula
that bombed (according to an old Daily). The theme song was
"Transylvania" sung to the tune of "Oklahoma."
Real stars
Persons such as actors Richard Boone, jack Palance, and Lloyd
Nolan were involved in Gaieties during their undergraduate years
at Stantord.
"Gaieties is done in bits and pieces all over campus," Light
said. "Sometimes it has a set theme, sometimes a story, some
times it's like a talent show."
Gaieties people have been putting on skits betore the Sunday
Flicks to get people used to the idea of something ditterent and to
make it a tun quarter. "What they do betore the Flicks are just
stunts, not excerpts from the show," Light said.
This year's production on Big Game Eve in Memorial Au
ditorium has about 15 ditferent scenes and will last approximately
70 minutes. Ideas of what to put in the show came from old scripts
and programs.
There is a lot ot singing and dancing. Some ot the songs are
original and others have rewritten lyrics. The specifics will be
kept a "surprise," Light said.
Satire
"We want to reintroduce an element of tun on campus.
Gaieties itselt is a way to laugh at things that go on on campus. It's
satirical in a fun way," he said.
Gaieties is not a spirit rally, Light said.
"Gaieties is not to replace the bonfire or the all-campus rally
but to go along with it," Light said.
"Gaieties won't just happen. It's taking a tremendous effort by
a large number of people and everyone is helping," Light said.
With a show of this size, authority is divided so that there are a
set of coordinators instead of only one director. The technical
director is (on Mills. Other directors are Simon Sanchez, David
Bryant, Kevin Cavanaugh and left Terry.
A 50-piece orchestra will be under the leadership ot two Band
members Randy Duvall and David Lang.
In the 50-member cast, there are no big stars. There will be a
number ot solos but on the whole it's a team effort, Light
explained.
'Professionally done'
"It's been an aL)solute blast to do. I've enjoyed every minute ot
it," said junior Beppie Weintz, a member ot the cast.

"The people who are doing it are very good. It's light, but
professionally done," cast member and senior Greg Gretenstette
said.
So, what is Gaieties?
"You can't call it a variety show, or a talent show, or a spirit
rally, or a musical — it's a collection of things," Light said.
"It takes every cliche ot Stanford life and makes tun of them in a
unique way," said cast member Courtney O'Connell, a junior.
It's part of the big spirit of Big Game Week. Gaieties helps bring
the school together to have a good time. The all-campus rally will
follow the 6:30 show this year.
"Personally, I see the potential for so much more. Stanford is a
zany place with great people. They've such a sophisticated sense
of humor that wild things fit right in," Light said.
"This will be a valid Gaieties. It may add a dimension other
Gaieties haven't seen or been yet. And it may upset intellectuals
who think it's childish, but it's [jure fun — lor all students."
The curious will have to wait until t riday night at Mem Aud to
discover the mystery of the Gaieties. Sit back and enjoy — there
will definitely be some surprises.
