# Stanford, Cal considered for post-season contests

The Cardinal offense should
make the lights burn long into
the night this week in Berkeley.
"Stanford has the most ver
satile oftense we've taced this
year," Calitornia coach Mike
White told Bay Area
sportswriters yesterday.
"They'll keep us up late this
week looking at tilms. The
problem with playing the 11th
game is there are 10 tilms to
look at."
Through the tirst 10 games ot
the season, both Cal and Stan
lord have won seven games,
and an eighth win tor either
team in the 80th Big Game
Saturday at Stanlord would put
that team in contending posi
tion tor a 12th game — a post
season bowl.
The Fiesta Bowl (Dec. 25 in
Tempe, Ariz.) and the Sun
Bowl (Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas)
are the two bowls mentioned
as most likely to invite the
Bears or the Cards. The Fiesta
Bowl otters about $250,000 and
the Sun Bowl about $175,000 to
invited teams.
Bruce Skinner, a Fiesta Bowl
official, said his bowl is consid
ering five Pacific-8 teams —
UCLA, USC, Washington, Cal
and Stantord — along with
some other teams, notably Ar
kansas.
The eighth-ranked Razor
backs (8-1) are apparently the
first choice ot the Fiesta Bowl
to tace the probable Western
Athletic Conterence represen
tative — Arizona State.
Rick Schaffer, the assistant
sports ir.tormation director at
Arkansas, said that before last
weekend the Razorbacks were
thinking they'd be going to the
Fiesta Bowl. But Arkansas de-

teated Texas A&M Saturday,
apparently catching the atten
tion ot the Orange Bowl.
"We're waiting to see what the
Orange Bowl will do," said
Schaetter. "Right now it's
deadlocked between Arkansas
and Penn State."
"I'd say we're interested in
going to the Fiesta Bowl," he
said, "but I cannot say defi
nitely that's where we'll go."
Skinner said that the Fiesta
Bowl will have representatives
at the Michigan-Ohio State,
Arkansas-Southern Methodist
and Cal-Stantord games this
weekend. According to Skin
ner, the Fiesta Bowl will otter
an invitation to its
sometime this weekend.
Saturday is the tirst day bowl
committees can otticially make
bids to teams, but most ot the
bowls not bound by contracts
to conterence representatives
have a good idea what teams
they would like to invite. The
smaller bowls, though, have to
wait and see which teams the
major bowls take.
"The major bowls are hold
ing everyone up," said Paul
Brocker, a Sun Bowl otticial.
Brocker said the Sun Bowl is
interested in Arkansas,
Pittsburgh, lowa State,
Louisiana State, Texas Tech,
Cal and Stantord, "but not
necessarily in order. Those are
the teams we are seriously
looking at."
Brocker said that the Sun
Bowl likes to try to get
ottensive-minded teams. "Our
bowl is rated second to the
Bluebonnet Bowl in ottense
the last lOyears," said Brocker.
The Bluebonnet Bowl is also
considering Arkansas, along
with three other Southwest

Conference teams. But Wel
don Humble, a Bluebonnet
Bowl official, said "I think they
(the Razorbacks) have indi
cated if they don't get to a
major bowl they'll go to the
Fiesta Bowl."
All of this would seem to
mean unless Penn State is
dumped by the Orange Bowl,
Cal or Stanford can only hope
for a bid from the Sun Bowl.
"Neither Cal or Stanford is en
thused about that," said Stan
ford's SID Gary Cavalli.

Fiesta Bowl."
All of this would seem to
mean unless Penn State is
dumped by the Orange Bowl,
Cal or Stanford can only hope
for a bid from the Sun Bowl.
"Neither Cal or Stanford is en
thused about that," said Stan

The Cardinal offense should
make the lights burn long into
the night this week in Berkeley.
"Stanford has the most ver
satile oftense we've taced this
year," Calitornia coach Mike
White told Bay Area
sportswriters yesterday.
"They'll keep us up late this
week looking at tilms. The
problem with playing the 11th
game is there are 10 tilms to
look at."
Through the tirst 10 games ot
the season, both Cal and Stan
lord have won seven games,
and an eighth win tor either
team in the 80th Big Game
Saturday at Stanlord would put
that team in contending posi
tion tor a 12th game — a post
season bowl.
The Fiesta Bowl (Dec. 25 in
Tempe, Ariz.) and the Sun
Bowl (Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas)
are the two bowls mentioned
as most likely to invite the
Bears or the Cards. The Fiesta
Bowl otters about $250,000 and
the Sun Bowl about $175,000 to
invited teams.
Bruce Skinner, a Fiesta Bowl
official, said his bowl is consid
ering five Pacific-8 teams —
UCLA, USC, Washington, Cal
and Stantord — along with
some other teams, notably Ar
kansas.
The eighth-ranked Razor
backs (8-1) are apparently the
first choice ot the Fiesta Bowl
to tace the probable Western
Athletic Conterence represen
tative — Arizona State.
Rick Schaffer, the assistant
sports ir.tormation director at
Arkansas, said that before last
weekend the Razorbacks were
thinking they'd be going to the
Fiesta Bowl. But Arkansas de-

teated Texas A&M Saturday,
apparently catching the atten
tion ot the Orange Bowl.
"We're waiting to see what the
Orange Bowl will do," said
Schaetter. "Right now it's
deadlocked between Arkansas
and Penn State."
"I'd say we're interested in
going to the Fiesta Bowl," he
said, "but I cannot say defi
nitely that's where we'll go."
Skinner said that the Fiesta
Bowl will have representatives
at the Michigan-Ohio State,
Arkansas-Southern Methodist
and Cal-Stantord games this
weekend. According to Skin
ner, the Fiesta Bowl will otter
an invitation to its
sometime this weekend.
Saturday is the tirst day bowl
committees can otticially make
bids to teams, but most ot the
bowls not bound by contracts
to conterence representatives
have a good idea what teams
they would like to invite. The
smaller bowls, though, have to
wait and see which teams the
major bowls take.
"The major bowls are hold
ing everyone up," said Paul
Brocker, a Sun Bowl otticial.
Brocker said the Sun Bowl is
interested in Arkansas,
Pittsburgh, lowa State,
Louisiana State, Texas Tech,
Cal and Stantord, "but not
necessarily in order. Those are
the teams we are seriously
looking at."
Brocker said that the Sun
Bowl likes to try to get
ottensive-minded teams. "Our
bowl is rated second to the
Bluebonnet Bowl in ottense
the last lOyears," said Brocker.
The Bluebonnet Bowl is also
considering Arkansas, along
with three other Southwest

Conference teams. But Wel
don Humble, a Bluebonnet
Bowl official, said "I think they
(the Razorbacks) have indi
cated if they don't get to a
major bowl they'll go to the
Fiesta Bowl."
All of this would seem to
mean unless Penn State is
dumped by the Orange Bowl,
