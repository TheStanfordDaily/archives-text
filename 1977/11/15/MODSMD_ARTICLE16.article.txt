# Robby Arnold: experience plus
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
At the age of eight, when most boys are
still learning to tie their shoes, Robby Ar
nold was already tossing around a water
polo ball.
Twelve years later, the Stanford junior
leads the Cards in scoring with i6 goals
and has left his shoe-tying times behind.
"He's one of the top scoring threats on
the team," said Arnold's coach, Dante De
ttamanti. "On the extra-man situations, he
holds down what we call the one position
and he does a very good job ot passing
from there, also."
"I have confidence in him as one of the
best shooters on the team," said senior
teammate Rick lohannsen. "It he shoots, I
count on him to score."
"If he has any weaknesses," said De
ttamanti, "it would be on defense. He's
really been working hard to remedy that,
though. He's been getting a lot of steals,
he's helping back and he's more alert."
"I am probably the worst defensive
ballplayer in the league," Arnold admit
ted. "That's because I came out ot a high
school program that never stressed de
fense at all. We would win games 14-13,
26-18 or something like that."
Arnold's defense has improved consid
erably over the last tew games and he cur
rently leads the team in steals. The junior
from Downey, however, does not attri
bute his piracy rate to good defense.
"Probably the reason that I'm leading
the team in steals," he explained, "is be
cause I cheat like hell! It's bad defense,
but I do it. If the ball is on one side ot the
pool and I'm guarding someone on the
other side, then I'll play hall-way between
my man and the hole man. I know instinc
tively that the next pass is going to be trom
the outside man to the hole man, so I'll
cheat, and when I know that ball's coming,
I'll go (to intercept). It's easy to get
burned, though. It they pass over to my
man, he's got a shot.
"The other thing I've done lately, is
blind-side people," he added. "I probably

learned that from Marty Davis because
he's really good at it. When the ball comes
from the hole man to a driver, the driver
can't see behind him when he goes off a
rear-back. If you read the play well
enough, you can be there at the same time
the ball is, and you can knock it away."
Besides being a good shooter and a
good thief, Arnold is also considered by
Dettamanti to be an excellent driver and a
good team player.
"He's very easy to coach," said De
ttamanti. "If you tell him something, he'll
try to go out and do it."
"I would say that water polo is very, very
important to me," explained Arnold. "If I
had a conflict between a water polo game
and a test, I'd try to get out of the test. At
this point in my life, athletics play a big
part. You can only compete when you're
young.
'I don't think you can compete on
teams much longer after college because
your body starts to deteriorate, you're
working full time and you start doing all
these other things. That's why I think it's a
very unique opportunity that aIF of us have
on the team. I want to take full advantage
of it while I can.
"I'm going to be working trom the time
I'm 25 until the time I'm 65," he continued.
"That's 40 years. Here, I'm talking about a
time span that's, maybe, five or 10 years of
my life when I can do something like this
and really be intense about it."
A third aspect of Arnold's lite is his per
sonality. There are two different sides to
him: in-the-pool and out-ot-the-pool.
"When I get in the pool with my six
teammates," he said, "I'm going to live
and die by those people. We work hard
together. We play hard together. To tell
with the other team.
"I'm competitive in things I desire to be
competitive in," Arnold explained. "That's
the way it works out. On a one-on-one
drive with a guy, it's like, 'I'm gonna beat
your ass and score.' There's no two ways
about it.

"In school," he continued, "it could be
the same way torme,butit s not. I m work
ing two jobs as well as playing water polo.
Between those two things, I'm spending
45 hours a week, which makes me a part
time student.
"In social areas," he added, "when I'm
away from the pool, I don't have to worry
about who's my friend and who's not. My
philosophy of life is: strangers are just
friends you haven't met yet. People are
people and I just like people. If somebody
gets on my case, I want to know why."
In a game like water polo, tempers flare
easily but Arnold uses the outlet to chan
nel his emotions into more constructive
areas, like scoring goals, and tries to avoid
the roughness, if possible.
"I think that roughness, in water polo, is
part of the game," Arnold said. "I think,
though, that a lot ot the roughness can be
avoided. I don't like to start things. I have
never intentionally hit someone just be
cause I was mad at him. You have to be
under control.
"We know that there are certain people
on other teams who can't take a punch,"
he added. "You hit them and they will
stop. They won't drive anymore and they
become totally ineffectual in the water.
That's the kind of image we don't want to
get. If somebody's going to start some
thing, we're going to finish it."
Outside of the pool, Arnold metamor
phoses into a different person. Intensity
becomes humor and competitiveness
changes into easygoing optimism. Arnold
is not overly worried about his future but
he does have goals. His career interests
are in small business, but water polo will
not be forgotten.
"Business is the same as sports," said
Arnold. "You have accountants that keep
score and lawyers are the referees. It's the
same thing all over again.
"I want to play until 1980," he said.
"What are the odds of making the '80
Olympics? Not too high. So I'll play until
'84!"

friends you haven't met yet. People are
people and I just like people. If somebody
gets on my case, I want to know why."
In a game like water polo, tempers flare
easily but Arnold uses the outlet to chan
nel his emotions into more constructive
areas, like scoring goals, and tries to avoid
the roughness, if possible.
"I think that roughness, in water polo, is
part of the game," Arnold said. "I think,
though, that a lot ot the roughness can be
avoided. I don't like to start things. I have
never intentionally hit someone just be
cause I was mad at him. You have to be
under control.
"We know that there are certain people
on other teams who can't take a punch,"
he added. "You hit them and they will
stop. They won't drive anymore and they
become totally ineffectual in the water.
That's the kind of image we don't want to
get. If somebody's going to start some
thing, we're going to finish it."
Outside of the pool, Arnold metamor
phoses into a different person. Intensity
becomes humor and competitiveness
changes into easygoing optimism. Arnold
is not overly worried about his future but
he does have goals. His career interests
are in small business, but water polo will
not be forgotten.
"Business is the same as sports," said
Arnold. "You have accountants that keep
score and lawyers are the referees. It's the
same thing all over again.
"I want to play until 1980," he said.
"What are the odds of making the '80
Olympics? Not too high. So I'll play until
'84!"
At the age of eight, when most boys are
still learning to tie their shoes, Robby Ar
nold was already tossing around a water
polo ball.
Twelve years later, the Stanford junior
leads the Cards in scoring with i6 goals
and has left his shoe-tying times behind.
"He's one of the top scoring threats on
the team," said Arnold's coach, Dante De
ttamanti. "On the extra-man situations, he
holds down what we call the one position
and he does a very good job ot passing
from there, also."
"I have confidence in him as one of the
best shooters on the team," said senior
teammate Rick lohannsen. "It he shoots, I
count on him to score."
"If he has any weaknesses," said De
ttamanti, "it would be on defense. He's
really been working hard to remedy that,
though. He's been getting a lot of steals,
he's helping back and he's more alert."
"I am probably the worst defensive
ballplayer in the league," Arnold admit
ted. "That's because I came out ot a high
school program that never stressed de
fense at all. We would win games 14-13,
26-18 or something like that."
Arnold's defense has improved consid
erably over the last tew games and he cur
rently leads the team in steals. The junior
from Downey, however, does not attri
bute his piracy rate to good defense.
"Probably the reason that I'm leading
the team in steals," he explained, "is be
cause I cheat like hell! It's bad defense,
but I do it. If the ball is on one side ot the
pool and I'm guarding someone on the
other side, then I'll play hall-way between
my man and the hole man. I know instinc
tively that the next pass is going to be trom
the outside man to the hole man, so I'll
cheat, and when I know that ball's coming,
I'll go (to intercept). It's easy to get
burned, though. It they pass over to my
man, he's got a shot.
"The other thing I've done lately, is
blind-side people," he added. "I probably

learned that from Marty Davis because
he's really good at it. When the ball comes
from the hole man to a driver, the driver
can't see behind him when he goes off a
rear-back. If you read the play well
enough, you can be there at the same time
the ball is, and you can knock it away."
Besides being a good shooter and a
good thief, Arnold is also considered by
Dettamanti to be an excellent driver and a
good team player.
"He's very easy to coach," said De
ttamanti. "If you tell him something, he'll
try to go out and do it."
"I would say that water polo is very, very
important to me," explained Arnold. "If I
had a conflict between a water polo game
and a test, I'd try to get out of the test. At
this point in my life, athletics play a big
part. You can only compete when you're
young.
'I don't think you can compete on
teams much longer after college because
your body starts to deteriorate, you're
working full time and you start doing all
these other things. That's why I think it's a
very unique opportunity that aIF of us have
on the team. I want to take full advantage
of it while I can.
"I'm going to be working trom the time
I'm 25 until the time I'm 65," he continued.
"That's 40 years. Here, I'm talking about a
time span that's, maybe, five or 10 years of
my life when I can do something like this
and really be intense about it."
A third aspect of Arnold's lite is his per
sonality. There are two different sides to
him: in-the-pool and out-ot-the-pool.
"When I get in the pool with my six
teammates," he said, "I'm going to live
and die by those people. We work hard
together. We play hard together. To tell
with the other team.
"I'm competitive in things I desire to be
competitive in," Arnold explained. "That's
the way it works out. On a one-on-one
drive with a guy, it's like, 'I'm gonna beat
your ass and score.' There's no two ways
about it.

"In school," he continued, "it could be
the same way torme,butit s not. I m work
ing two jobs as well as playing water polo.
Between those two things, I'm spending
45 hours a week, which makes me a part
time student.
"In social areas," he added, "when I'm
away from the pool, I don't have to worry
about who's my friend and who's not. My
philosophy of life is: strangers are just
friends you haven't met yet. People are
people and I just like people. If somebody

these other things. That's why I think it's a
very unique opportunity that aIF of us have
on the team. I want to take full advantage
of it while I can.
"I'm going to be working trom the time
I'm 25 until the time I'm 65," he continued.
"That's 40 years. Here, I'm talking about a
time span that's, maybe, five or 10 years of
my life when I can do something like this
and really be intense about it."
A third aspect of Arnold's lite is his per
sonality. There are two different sides to
him: in-the-pool and out-ot-the-pool.
"When I get in the pool with my six
teammates," he said, "I'm going to live
and die by those people. We work hard
together. We play hard together. To tell
with the other team.
"I'm competitive in things I desire to be
competitive in," Arnold explained. "That's
the way it works out. On a one-on-one
drive with a guy, it's like, 'I'm gonna beat
your ass and score.' There's no two ways
about it.

"In school," he continued, "it could be
the same way torme,butit s not. I m work
ing two jobs as well as playing water polo.
Between those two things, I'm spending
45 hours a week, which makes me a part
time student.
"In social areas," he added, "when I'm
away from the pool, I don't have to worry
about who's my friend and who's not. My
philosophy of life is: strangers are just
friends you haven't met yet. People are
people and I just like people. If somebody
gets on my case, I want to know why."
In a game like water polo, tempers flare
easily but Arnold uses the outlet to chan
nel his emotions into more constructive
areas, like scoring goals, and tries to avoid
the roughness, if possible.
"I think that roughness, in water polo, is
part of the game," Arnold said. "I think,
though, that a lot ot the roughness can be
avoided. I don't like to start things. I have
never intentionally hit someone just be
cause I was mad at him. You have to be
under control.
"We know that there are certain people
on other teams who can't take a punch,"
he added. "You hit them and they will
stop. They won't drive anymore and they
become totally ineffectual in the water.
That's the kind of image we don't want to
get. If somebody's going to start some
thing, we're going to finish it."
Outside of the pool, Arnold metamor
phoses into a different person. Intensity
becomes humor and competitiveness
changes into easygoing optimism. Arnold
is not overly worried about his future but
he does have goals. His career interests
are in small business, but water polo will
not be forgotten.
"Business is the same as sports," said
Arnold. "You have accountants that keep
score and lawyers are the referees. It's the
same thing all over again.
"I want to play until 1980," he said.
"What are the odds of making the '80
Olympics? Not too high. So I'll play until
'84!"
At the age of eight, when most boys are
still learning to tie their shoes, Robby Ar
nold was already tossing around a water
polo ball.
Twelve years later, the Stanford junior
leads the Cards in scoring with i6 goals
and has left his shoe-tying times behind.
"He's one of the top scoring threats on
the team," said Arnold's coach, Dante De
ttamanti. "On the extra-man situations, he
holds down what we call the one position
and he does a very good job ot passing
from there, also."
"I have confidence in him as one of the
best shooters on the team," said senior
teammate Rick lohannsen. "It he shoots, I
count on him to score."
"If he has any weaknesses," said De
ttamanti, "it would be on defense. He's
really been working hard to remedy that,
though. He's been getting a lot of steals,
he's helping back and he's more alert."
"I am probably the worst defensive
ballplayer in the league," Arnold admit
ted. "That's because I came out ot a high
school program that never stressed de
fense at all. We would win games 14-13,
26-18 or something like that."
Arnold's defense has improved consid
erably over the last tew games and he cur
rently leads the team in steals. The junior
from Downey, however, does not attri
bute his piracy rate to good defense.
"Probably the reason that I'm leading
the team in steals," he explained, "is be
cause I cheat like hell! It's bad defense,
but I do it. If the ball is on one side ot the
pool and I'm guarding someone on the
other side, then I'll play hall-way between
my man and the hole man. I know instinc
tively that the next pass is going to be trom
the outside man to the hole man, so I'll
cheat, and when I know that ball's coming,
I'll go (to intercept). It's easy to get
burned, though. It they pass over to my
man, he's got a shot.
"The other thing I've done lately, is
blind-side people," he added. "I probably

learned that from Marty Davis because
he's really good at it. When the ball comes
from the hole man to a driver, the driver
can't see behind him when he goes off a
rear-back. If you read the play well
enough, you can be there at the same time
the ball is, and you can knock it away."
Besides being a good shooter and a
good thief, Arnold is also considered by
Dettamanti to be an excellent driver and a
good team player.
"He's very easy to coach," said De
ttamanti. "If you tell him something, he'll
try to go out and do it."
"I would say that water polo is very, very
important to me," explained Arnold. "If I
had a conflict between a water polo game
and a test, I'd try to get out of the test. At
this point in my life, athletics play a big
part. You can only compete when you're
young.
'I don't think you can compete on
teams much longer after college because
