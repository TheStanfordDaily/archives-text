# Cardinal sins
## Beavers and other card stunts 
### 
It died with barely a whimper — a death
noticed by few and mourned by even tewer.
Hidden in the back pages ot the Los Angeles
Times sports section was a short obituary under
the headline: "Caltech: No More Football Foi
bles."
The tootball record at Caltech did not match
the school's record for excellence in science and
engineering — the Beavers had won only 25 per
cent ot their more than 400 games — and perhaps
that explained the absence ot mourners.
But the passing away ot Caltech tootball, it not
mourned, should at least be noted. Where else:
—did a college tield a team on which only 20
per cent ot the roster had high school tootball
experience?
—does the average player have an IQ of more
than 140?
—did a team play in the same conterence with
LaVerne?
"Caltech is about as well known for its tootball
team as The Wall Street Journal is tor its sports
section," said Caltech President Harold Brown.
"The handwriting has been on the wall tor a
while," the L.A. Times quoted Beaver coach Tom
Gutman as saying. "Football requires both quan
tity and quality. When you don't have quality it's
hard enough. But when you don't have quantity
either, you have to torget it."
Only 15 ot Caltech's 850 students turned out
for tootball this tall so the program was aban
doned.
Getting enough people out to be able to suit
up a team has always been a problem tor Gut
man. His efforts to recruit on campus have been
marred by a disinterested student body.
"They act like I had the plague or something,"

Gutman told the Wall Street Journal.
The coach discovered that an all-state high
school quarterback from Tennessee was on
campus but repeated efforts tailed to lure the
standout athlete out to the Caltech practice
fields.
Perhaps the Tennessee signal caller did not
want to taint his reputation by being seen on the
same field with the Beavers.
"Winning isn't the primary objective in sports
at Caltech," understates a pamphlet circulated
under the name "Facts About Caltech." Since
1893, when the Institute lost its tirst game to USC,
60-4, the Beavers have lost 311 games, tied 16 and
won 105. (That record includes three losses to
Stanford, Caltech losing by a combined score of
109-7.)
"This is the way football has always been
played at Caltech — poorly and just tor tun," The
Wall Street Journal said.
Since 1957 the Techies have not had a win
ning football season but pressure from dis
traught alumni has remained nonexistent. Re
cently Caltech has taken to playing only the
junior varsity teams of its opponents, small
junior colleges or local club teams.
Yet despite 20 consecutive seasons ot losing
tootball, Caltech has known its great football
moments.
The pinnacle ot Caltech tootball fame came
during the 1961 Rose Bowl — between
Washington and Minnesota — in what has come
to be known as The Great Rose Bowl Hoax of
1961.
A small group ot daring Caltech saboteurs mas
terminded a successful ruse that ended with the
Washington card section spelling out CALTECH
instead of WASHINGTON and forming a beaver

instead of a husky on a nationally televised
halttime card stunt performance.
One ot the Caltech pranksters posed as a high
school newspaper reporter and interviewed the
director ot the Husky card section. The journalis
tic imposter had the director explain the work
ings oi the Washington and the 2232 direction
cards that Husky rooters followed to perform the
stunts.
The sleuthtul band ot Techies broke into the
director's hotel room three times before the New
Year's Day contest: tirst, to steal a sample direc
tion card; second, to steal the master play, and
third, to substitute 2232 reprinted, rearranged
direction cards for the pilfered originals.
Luck was with the Pasadena pranksters all the
way. As the Washington rooting section began its
14-stunt presentation, the television cameras
wandered the stands ignoring the stunts in favor
of Rose Bowl dignitaries and the band. But as
stunt No. 10 began — the first of three altered
ones — the TV camera turned to the card section.
First came the beaver in place ot the husky. The
Washington crowd laughed nervously. Then
came huskies spelled backward. Now the
Washington rooters were truly confused. Finally,
triumph — CALTECFT

There are some reports that Caltech football
supporters will try to reincarnate the program. If
they can get 25 people together to play the prog
ram will be revitalized.
Until then, Caltech tootball lies under a simple
grave marker inscribed with a Caltech football
yell as its epitaph:
"Cosine, tangent, hyperbolic sine,
Three point one four one five nine.
'E' to the 'X,"D' 'Y' 'D' 'X,'
Slide rule, slip stick, Tech, Tech. Tech."
