"Lather" is the title of Frank
Zappa's latest recording, like
many of Zappa's record titles,
"Lather" bring to mind an am
bigous spectrum of associa
tions, the more obscene of
which are seized upon by Zap
pa s true fans. Vet there is more
to Zappa than his sometimes
whimsical, more ottpn

explicitly lewd lyrics. Music
fans of all descriptions have
proclaimed him a notable
guitarist and most ol all, a mas
terful composer. "Lather" will
probably constitute the bulk ol
the material which will be per
formed by /appa end his
energetic new band at Maples
Pavilion Saturday evening at 9.
