# Bradlee sets forth rare view of Post
## 
### Jacob Young 
In a profile which appeared in Es
quire magazine last year, Ben Brad
lee, executive editor of the
Washington Post was called "the
roughest, toughest editor around,"
and those who came in contact with
him were warned to watch out for the
man who gave the finger to striking
Post employes and could order a
meal and chew out a reporter in
French as well as English.
On campus yesterday, Bradlee
proved himself to be, at least in part,
the man summoned up by that pro
tile (which he dismissed as "so much
bullshit"). But he also gave a rare
glimpse into the workings of a news
paper dynasty which felled a presi
dent and turned the world's atten
tion to the Washington Post.
"From my point of view, the most
interesting question of the power of
the press is the decision by a news
paper to print or not to print. It is in
that decision that lies the real power
of the press, the power to do good or
the power to harm; or that most sub
tle of all powers, the power to do
nothing," Bradlee told the packed
Memorial Auditorium audience.
Bradlee's visit here was sponsored
by the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and
the Stanford Committee on Political
Education.
Press powers
Bradlee's topic of discussion most
of the evening concerned the power
of the press, especially on matters of
national or governmental secrecy.
He said persons in government often
keep information from the public not
because the information is of crucial
secrecy, but rather because the in
formation would "embarrass the
powers that be," Bradlee said.
In particular, he said that informa
tion on the bombing of Cambodia
included in the Pentagon Papers was
covered up because "the point was
to keep it from you, to keep it from
the American public. They (some
persons in government) are scared to
death of you, are scared the Ameri
can people would learn we were in
volved in an illegal war."
Bradlee said that "no journalist is
interested in doing damage to na
tional security. There isn't even any
self interest in that. And certainly the
power of the press to embarrass is
one of the less dangerous powers it
possesses."
Impossible
Earlier in the evening, Bradlee told
the Daily he felt it was almost impos
sible to do too much investigative
reporting of the kind that uncovered
Watergate and made Bradlee, Carl
Bernstein and Bob Woodward na
tional heroes.
Bradlee characterized the general
opinion of newspapers as "on a defi
nite downswing," but attributed
much of this problem to public ig
norance.
"Mosi people outside journalism
have no idea of the decision making
process at work in a newspaper. They
feel the editor's friends can be pro
tected just because they are the
editor's friends," he said.
Of the growing number of news
paper ombudsmen, Bradlee was
generally complementary

"I don't think the reporters like
them much," he said. "They (repor
ters) tend to have thinner skins than
anyone they cover. I feel that the
Post's ombudsman's reports are an
extraordinary diary of a paper's ef
forts to improve itself."
Bradlee
Bradlee began his career in jour
nalism at a small paper in New
Hampshire, went to the Post where
he worked the police beat, served as
press attache for the American Em
bassy in Paris, then covered the Mid
dle East for Newsweek before rejoin
ing the Post in 1961.
Of the journalists' life portrayed in
"All the President's Men," Bradlee
said, "Most people now think it's a
pretty glamorous lifestyle. The movie
didn't show how often your efforts
tail. Every time you make a phone
call, you don't get the answer you're
after."
"Woodward and Bernstein made
journalism respectable. It's an OK
profession now. When I was growing
up in Boston, my parents didn't even
know any journalists."
All that has changed now. Espe
cially for Ben Bradlee.
