# A 						'Country Wife' that beats the 'Sexual Revolution'
## 
### 
Drama Department preserves
'the willful low-mindedness,
diversion, humor, pointedness
and obscene fun of the original'

It is easy to forget that sex
was not invented in 1960,
anything antecedent being
"reproduction." Calling the
'60s an era of sexual revolu
tion belies a certain naivete
concerning human nature
and our revered, horny an
cestors.
If anything, the "Sexual
Revolution" has made sex a
less interesting subject,
mundane and oftentimes
even boring. When one can
discuss the subject with
complete aplomb, frank
ness and sang-froid in
nearly any company at any
time, there is lost the vitality
and fun which sexual dis
course can be.
"The Country Wife," Wil
liam Wycherley's 1671 satire
of Reformation morals, de
monstrates with vigor that
sex is more spirited when
covered by a veneer ot re
spectability and honor. It
takes wit and cleverness to
overcome society's imped
iments to sexuality and
there should at least be a
good chase before instinct
wins out. That is a value
often lost in our haste to
rationalize morality.
The play is satirical, which
means that the sexual be
havior of 1671 was more fun
in ridiculing than in fact, but
no doubt its success at the
time had as much to rlo with
its verity as with its smutti
ness.
In any case, the Drama
Department's production of
"The Country Wife," di
rected by John House, re
tains all the willful low
mindedness, diversion,
humor, pointedness and
obscene fun of the original.
This staging's greatest vir
tue is its spirit. Almost all the
actors perform with vitality,
obviously enjoying them
selves; their enthusiasm is
contagious.
The play has essentially
two plots, one slightly less
significant than the other.
First, there is wily Mr.
Horner, a fashionable
young man, who, upon re
turning from France, has
circulated the false informa
tion that he has suffered

emasculation due to an un
timely contraction of the
"pox." His intention
thereby is to molify the sus
picions of husbands con
cerning his amorous rela
tions with their wives, thus
freeing him to cuckold
them. The ruse has the
added advantage of protect
ing the honor so coveted by
the wives. The name of the
game, clearly, is adultery
and plenty of it. Horner, in
short order, succeeds not
only in beddinga numberof
honorable ladies, but also in
teaching an innocent coun
try wife a few of the less in
nocent pleasures.
Second, there is the more
standard situation in which
Mistress Alithea, though
betrothed to the fop Spar
kish, loves Mr. Harcourt, a
friend of Horner's. She
stands by her bethrothal,
however, because she is a
woman ot honor — the only
one, it turns out — and will
not renege on her obliga
tion. Harcourt is forced,
then, to carry out a rather
clumsy holding action
against the wedding day.
Sondra West, who has the
title role, carries herself
with as much ingenuous
ness and freshness as we
could ask from a farmer's
daughter — and she can be
naughty enough as well.
Unfortunately, she is not
immune from the occasion
ally superfluous shake and
squeal that is sillier than be
lievable.
Martin Curland, as
Horner, is probably the
most evenly played of the
leads, performing with
composure and assurance.
Except for a lapse or two
into the distractedness of a
man attacked by a fly, he
plays his part with all the
sneer and swagger of an ac
complished libertine. Also,
Leslie Medtord, as Har
court, manages a solid per
formance, though he is a bit
too earnest and reserved for
the sharp wit he is meant to
be.
One other performance
deserves praise; Al Mellin
koff, as the dcindy, Sparkish.

His affectation and daftness
are completely convincing.
Rouse has a number of re
latively minor problems
with the production. The
greatest is avoiding a ten
dency to let the play get out
of hand. It fits poorly a
slapstick interpretation;
there are moments, com
plete with high-speed,
silent-movie music, which
are sorely out of place.
Similar problems beset
the acting. Generally, the
performances are handled
with due restraint, even and
lively. The contrast, when
the players seem overcome
with excitement, is all the
more stark. Overacting is an
easy trap to fall into with this
type of comedy, and it is
one this cast is not always
able to avoid.
Finally, set designer
Michael Fisher has the good
sense to make the sets sim
ple, allowing the audience
to till in the missing details,
so that the sharp inter
changes between charac
ters would be foremost. The
set's major fault is that it is
sensible but not very in
teresting. Ostentation was
avoided at the cost of visual
interest. But the flaw is not
an important one.
There were other weak
points in the production,
such as fluttering accents or
17th century affectations
which become fidgety, but
on the whole these
blemishes are not signific
ant.
Besides, this is not a play
of serious themes or pro
found characterizations,
but of diversive pleasures
and light wit. And its satire,
being time-bound — since
times change — is not as
sardonic 300 years later.
Nevertheless, "The
Country Wite" is funny,
obscene and jovial. It won't
make you cringe, and it
won't make you cry, but if
you leave your preconcep
tions about the demure 17th
century at the door, you
might be surprised.
