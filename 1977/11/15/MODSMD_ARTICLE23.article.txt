Profile: The Horslips

Look at the beginning of the history
of most Western nations. You will see
the removal ot a race that was there
before — an older race that belonged to
the land. Unsuspected by most ot the
modern residents, the spirits ot these
ancient peoples live on, inseparable
from their land.
Seattle, an Indian chief, prophesied
about America a century ago: "And
when the last Red Man shall have
perished, and the memory of my tribe
shall have become a myth among the
White Man, these shores will swarm
with the invisible dead of my tribe. At
night when the streets of your cities and
villages are silent and you think them
deserted, they will throng with the re
turning hosts that once filled and still
love this beautiful land.
So it was in Ireland. Long before the
coming of modern Ireland's Gaelic an
cestors, the island was inhabited by the
Tuatha De Danann, a race possessed of
great magical powers. When the Tuatha

were finally defeated, they departed to
an immortal realm. Their spirits have
roamed our world at will, ever since.
We now know that some mortals
have been chosen tor the mastery ot
the arcane arts ot the Tuatha. They cast
the old spells, bringing delight to their
followers. And they sometimes appear
in the guise ot a rock band: Horslips.
Necromancy in San Francisco's
Boarding House? Last week, the sweet
strains ot Irish jigs and airs were heard
there, woven amidst the martial music
of Horslips' electric "Celtic Sym
phony." Barry Devlin, bassist and
spokesman tor the band, admitted that
there were risks about this perfor
mance: it's not easy to defy the over
whelming commercialism in the rock
industry today.
But Horslips came armed with a re
cent LP "The Book of Invasions"
(Amherst Records: D)LPA-10), their
fourth release in this country. It is fine
progressive rock; the tunes all share

the theme of the ancient battles ot Irish
history.
Though Horslips sings ot war and
wizardry, the band never plods along as
a mindless rock juggernaut. Magical
rock indeed, that has the audience tap
ping the beat and singing along as vig
orously as our pagan predecessors!
The magic stems in no small part from
the unusual instrumentation, and the
talents ot the players. Eltish tiddler
Charles O'Conner doubles on electric
mandolin. )im Lockhart alternates bet
ween keyboards, flute, and Irish whis
tles. John Lean casually provides lead
electric guitar. The three pass melodies
back and forth, then join on dramatic
instrumental and vocal harmonies.
Horslips' revelries peaked with the
pertormance ot three solid selections
from"The Book ot Invasions:" "Warm
Sweet Breath of Love," "Trouble," and
"The Power and the Glory." The pieces
burned with a model, mystical tire not
heard since lethro Tull's Aqualung

days. They are comparable to the work
of English folk-rockers Fairport Con
vention and Steeleye Span, but with a
more original approach to lyrics: "Ah
just for me weave it one more time, cast
your spell ot love. /Take me in your
arms and let me feel it one more time,
the warm sweet breath of love."
Of course, Horslips purchases such
occult power of music at the price of
sanity. Only madmen would pursue a
course ot such blantant originality, dis
daining the opportunity to flatter the
listener with formula-rock.
I heard it claimed that Horslips dis
appeared in a flash ot green fire and
smoke after the show. Hah! — there's a
limit to how much of this druidic
mumbo jumbo you can believe. Vet I'm
certain I saw, in the smiling eyes of
Barry Devlin on stage, the inscrutable
amusement of the Tuatha De Danann.

were finally defeated, they departed to
an immortal realm. Their spirits have
roamed our world at will, ever since.
We now know that some mortals
have been chosen tor the mastery ot
the arcane arts ot the Tuatha. They cast
the old spells, bringing delight to their
followers. And they sometimes appear
in the guise ot a rock band: Horslips.
Necromancy in San Francisco's
Boarding House? Last week, the sweet
strains ot Irish jigs and airs were heard
there, woven amidst the martial music
of Horslips' electric "Celtic Sym
phony." Barry Devlin, bassist and
spokesman tor the band, admitted that
there were risks about this perfor
mance: it's not easy to defy the over
whelming commercialism in the rock
industry today.
But Horslips came armed with a re
cent LP "The Book of Invasions"
(Amherst Records: D)LPA-10), their
fourth release in this country. It is fine
progressive rock; the tunes all share

the theme of the ancient battles ot Irish
history.
Though Horslips sings ot war and
wizardry, the band never plods along as
a mindless rock juggernaut. Magical
rock indeed, that has the audience tap
ping the beat and singing along as vig
orously as our pagan predecessors!
The magic stems in no small part from
the unusual instrumentation, and the
talents ot the players. Eltish tiddler
Charles O'Conner doubles on electric
mandolin. )im Lockhart alternates bet
ween keyboards, flute, and Irish whis
tles. John Lean casually provides lead
electric guitar. The three pass melodies
back and forth, then join on dramatic
instrumental and vocal harmonies.
Horslips' revelries peaked with the
pertormance ot three solid selections
from"The Book ot Invasions:" "Warm
Sweet Breath of Love," "Trouble," and
"The Power and the Glory." The pieces
burned with a model, mystical tire not
heard since lethro Tull's Aqualung

days. They are comparable to the work
of English folk-rockers Fairport Con
vention and Steeleye Span, but with a
more original approach to lyrics: "Ah
just for me weave it one more time, cast
your spell ot love. /Take me in your
arms and let me feel it one more time,
the warm sweet breath of love."
Of course, Horslips purchases such
occult power of music at the price of
sanity. Only madmen would pursue a
course ot such blantant originality, dis
daining the opportunity to flatter the
listener with formula-rock.
I heard it claimed that Horslips dis
appeared in a flash ot green fire and
smoke after the show. Hah! — there's a
limit to how much of this druidic
mumbo jumbo you can believe. Vet I'm
certain I saw, in the smiling eyes of
Barry Devlin on stage, the inscrutable
amusement of the Tuatha De Danann.

Profile: The Horslips

Look at the beginning of the history
of most Western nations. You will see
the removal ot a race that was there
before — an older race that belonged to
the land. Unsuspected by most ot the
modern residents, the spirits ot these
ancient peoples live on, inseparable
from their land.
Seattle, an Indian chief, prophesied
about America a century ago: "And
when the last Red Man shall have
perished, and the memory of my tribe
shall have become a myth among the
White Man, these shores will swarm
with the invisible dead of my tribe. At
night when the streets of your cities and
villages are silent and you think them
deserted, they will throng with the re
turning hosts that once filled and still
love this beautiful land.
So it was in Ireland. Long before the
coming of modern Ireland's Gaelic an
cestors, the island was inhabited by the
Tuatha De Danann, a race possessed of
great magical powers. When the Tuatha

were finally defeated, they departed to
an immortal realm. Their spirits have
roamed our world at will, ever since.
