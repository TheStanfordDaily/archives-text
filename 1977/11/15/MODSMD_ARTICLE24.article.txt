Carter backs unemployment bill
Washington — President Jimmy Carter endorsed
a watered-down jobs bill yesterday that would set
a four per cent unemployment rate as the goal for
1983 without committing him to set up new prog
rams to reach the target.
House and Senate backers of the bill applauded
the president's endorsement and predicted favor
able action in Congress early next year.
The measure, worked out in months of talks
between White House aides and congressional
sponsors, would require the president to submit
annual economic reports to Congress setting out
specific goals for unemployment, production, in
come and productivity.
However, unlike the original bill, it recom
mends — rather than requires — that specific gov
ernment jobs programs be set up to reach the
goals if it appears that the targets will not be
reached without help.
And while recommending that the president
consider certain programs to cut unemployment,
the bill includes a strong anti-inflation statement
declaring that stable prices should not be sac
rificed for the goal of reduced unemployment.
Brush fire burns 6 L.A. homes
Los Angeles — A wind-whipped brush fire de
stroyed six homes in the Topanga Canyon area
yesterday and threatened the exclusive suburb of
Pacific Palisades before cool sea breezes and dying
winds increased firefighters' hopes that further
damage could be averted.
"Right now it's a holding action to keep it from
getting into any more structures," said county Fire
Department Battalion Chief Rod Smith shortly be
fore 10 p.m. "But in no way do we have it con
tained yet."
However, Smith said that the winds, which had
gusted up to 30 mph earlier, had diminished as low
as 15 mph, and he was optimistic that further dam
age to homes could be prevented.
As midnight approached, city Fire Department

spokesman Jim Jeffery said: "The fire has slowed
down and we are going to attempt to stop it in
Santa Inez Canyon." That canyon is southeast of
Topanga and contains few homes.
British firemen go on strike
London — Almost all of Britain's 33,000 regular
firemen went on strike yesterday for more pay. But
a hastily trained force of soldiers and volunteers
using outdated equipment seemed to cope well
with the first day's emergencies.
No fire deaths were reported during the first day
of the unprecedented — but legal — nationwide
strike, which began at 9 a.m. and shows no pros
pect of a quick end. But there were at least three
casualties.
The strike posed the toughest challenge to date
to the Labor government's three-year-old cam
paign to hold pay raises down to 10 per cent. The
firefighters are demanding a 30 per cent increase.
50 predicted dead in Manila fire
Manila, Phillipines — Candles lit during a power
outage from a typhoon may have caused the fire
that swept through the Hotel Filipinas in
downtown Manila early yesterday, killing at least
42 persons, including one American, authorities
said.
Fire Marshall Francisco Agudon predicted a toll
of at least 50 dead. Fie said firemen had seen more
bodies in the burned-out shell as they battled the
fire.
Survivors said hotel guests panicked, stumbling
and falling as they fled down fire escapes.
Soviets purchase American grain
Washington — The Agriculture Department yes
terday announced a sale of 100,000 metric tons of
wheat to the Soviet Union, possibly the first in a
new round of purchases by the Soviets in the com
ing year.
According to department records, the sale was
the first to the Soviets to be reported officially
since Sept. 19. Rumors have circulated for weeks

that the Russians were in the market to buy more
U.S. grain.
Officials said only that "private U.S. exporters"
reported the transaction under regulations calling
for such information to be filed within 24 hours.
Russian official discusses trade
Los Angeles — The main barrier to expanded
trade between the United States and the Soviet
Union is not President jimmy Carter's human
rights campaign but competitive economic condi
tions, a top Russian trade official said yesterday.
"American firms are not competitive today in
our market," Soviet Commercial Minister Sergey
Mkrtumov told reporters at a news conference
here. "We have more favorable commercial and
other conditions in other countries."
The Russian official said he regretted the reluc
tance of the U.S. to allow the sale of large-scale
computers and jet engines to Russian buyers but
said the Soviets are able to buy them elsewhere.
Marijuana blood test developed
Los Angeles — Researchers say they have devised
the first practical test for measuring the level of
marijuana in the blood — one that eventually may
be made portable and used by police to test
motorists who may be high, much as they now test
for drunkenness.
It is being studied by a federal drug agency and
the California Highway Patrol.
"At the moment, it's a test that has to be done in
the lab, but it's one that conceivably could be
refined into a roadside test," said Dr. )im Soares,
one of the White Memorial Medical Center re
searchers who developed the test.
