"I like to use it in conjunction
with alcohol," says one user "Al
cohol slows you down. Coke does
the reverse. I'm in total control of
what's happening."
Dr. James McClenahan, direc
tor of student health, services at
Cowell, described cocaine as
"almost a recreational drug."
McClenahan said, "It's not
physically addicting." There may
be an exceptional case where
there has been psychological de
pendence, he said.
Side effects
For moderate users, the risks
are few: sniffs and inflamed nasal
tissue, which usually heal after a
couple days.
For heavier users, the risks can
be more serious. The drug con
stricts the blood vessels, which
cuts down the supply of blood
that reaches the nose. Users
sometimes develop sores, bleed
ing and ultimately a hole that cuts
through the septum dividing the

nasal passages.
Cocaine, which does have li
mited medical usage, is legally
sold for about $26 per ounce to
druggists who supply hospitals.
"There are 27.5 grams in one
ounce," says one dealer.
"Wholesale, each gram costs me
about $67.85. If it's good stuff, I
can sell it for $110 per gram.
Sometimes I can make $1050 pro
fit plus about three free grams for
myself."
Cutting it
Another dealer said, "I can usu
ally add about tour grams of
bullshit. I cut my stuff with manita
(a baby laxative), or menacol
(sugar). The purity of the stuff
floating around this country is ter
rible.
"Sometimes people buy coke
that has been cut with speed. It's
hard to tell with coke unless you
try it, or have it analyzed," he said.
One University student said her
only problem from dealing
cocaine was that most of her pro
fits went right up her nose.
