# Buying a stereo
## The 						pitfalls of that big purchase 
### Craig Dennis 
When you decide to buy
stereo equipment, there are
three closely related factors
you should consider: the size
ot your budget, the quality ot
sound your personal taste re
quires and the maximum size
area the component you are
buying will be played in.
By far, the amount of money
you have, whether it be cash
on hand or credit terms you are
willing to pay, is the most im

portant determinant in decid
ing what will compose your
component system.
Some extra financing could
make a big difference in the
quality of system you desire —
whether it be that extra casette
deck, clearer and crisper
sounding speakers or extra
wattage from a receiver or
amp.
Personal experience will
show you the best way to buy a
stereo system is to shop

around as much as possible to
get a precise idea of what a sys
tem will cost and the actual
equipment you will'."'
self.
Stereo salesmen will be
more than willing to help you
since they won't want to pass
up a potential sale, but do not
fall prey to the first offer made
to you. Shop around, get an
idea of various prices and
check those prices against
what is called the specifica
tions (or "specs") for each
component.
Stereo equipment is one ol
the most competitive items on
the marketplace today so don't
be hesitant to try talking down
a price. It has been done be
fore by many a successful
buyer.
Another good source of po
tential prices lor you will be
weekend newspapers. Special
sales on selective components
is a regular occurence, and a
good place to check locally is
the Sunday San Francisco
Examiner and Chronicle "This
World" section. There are also
many stereo magazines in cir
culation today that you might
find useful.

The mainstay ol your new
system will be an amplifier,
whether it be a part ol a re
. 01 a separate compo
nent. It is the amp that will
power your speakers and till
your room with music.
The main specification you
should check is the wattage rat
ing since it is the watts that ac
tually power music through
speakers. A rating ol 20 watts
will produce plenty ol sounds
for a dorm size room, but il you
want to keep your system lor
future use you might consider
a higher wattage rating.
Another factor to consider is
the distortion ratings. The
lower the ratings, the clearer
the sound your new speakers
will produce. Usually Willi wat
tage increases, there will be a
subsequent decrease in distor
tion.
Often times it is possible to
get better specs lor the same
price by buying a separate amp
and tuner than to buy a re
ceiver. However, many man
ufacturers, including
Kenwood and Pioneer, are in
troducing new receivers this
year and might be your ideal
buy — 40 watts of power per
channel and a harmonic distor
tion rating as low as 0.1 per
cent.
The most important compo
nent, though, is the speakers.
Without them the rest of your
system would be ol no use.

Too many people believe thai
all speakers sound the same.
Each model of a manulactur
ers speaker line usually has its
own unique sound. Most
stereo stores will have a sound
room to listen to speakers, and
you will see a noticeable di I -
terence listening to ditterent
models side-by-side.
Some speakers might have a
more clear, crisper sound
while others could be more
mellow and place more of an
emphasis on bass. Pick a
speaker pair that meets your
personal sound taste and has a
wattage rating matching your
amp or receiver.
Accessories such as a turnta
ble and cassette tape deck .ire
other components you will
probably wish to add to your
system. Good quality turnta
bles usually start at $100 while
casette decks will start at $1 SO.
Again, the personal taste and
quality you are looking lor will
dictate your eventual purch
ase. But most systems will not
be complete without at least a
turntable.
These have been just a lewol
the factors you should con
sider when buying a stereo. Ot
course, your budget will be the
main lactor in determining the
tinal purchase, but be sure to
compare and contrast in mak
ing sure your purchase is
something you will not later
regret.
