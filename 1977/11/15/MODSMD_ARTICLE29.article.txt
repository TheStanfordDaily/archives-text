# Stanford carpenter runs record label
## 
### Tom Casciato 
"I figured that I was going to
be an English teacher it I didn't
get the hell out of there, and I
had about seven units to
go. . . ."
William Ackerman dropped
out of Stanford in 1971 to be
come a carpenter, though he
was only seven units short ot
graduation. Today, the son ot
former Stanford English pro

lessor Robert Ackerman is not
only a carpenter, but also over
sees his own record label,
Windham Hill, and has two
successful albums of steel
string guitar music, "In Search
of the Turtle's Navel" and"It
Takes A Year."
Released in November 1975,
"Turtle's Navel" was never in
tended to be more than a re
cording for Ackerman and his

friends. The LP was a commun
ity project, with friends provid
ing the layout, printing and
typesetting for free, and Ac
kerman and his wife Anne per
sonally pasting the covers onto
each copy. Three hundred
copies were printed originally,
and looking back, Ackerman
recalls, "I was thinking . . .
what are we going to do with all
these records?" But when an

acquaintance doing promo
tional work took 10 copies and
distributed them to local radio
stations, the response was
phenomenal. It was decided to
print up a new stock and . .
have another party and glue up
some more covers."
A good time
He has learned much about
the record business since then,
and has had a good lime doing
it. He says"The nicest thing
about this whole deal has been
meeting the people." The
"people" he speaks of are
those running other small re
cord companies which pro
duce quality music. Ackerman
cites Kicking Mule, Rounder,
Arhoolie, Philo and Bay Re
cords as among the best.
While he admits "there's not
much big money in it," Acker
man points out that people in
the business . . are begin
ning to figure out the potential
that the small labels have. The
days are really completely
gone when a small label re
lease will have this funky pro
duction and . . . everything
sort of cutting corners. The
quality that Philo Records and
Bay Records and I know what
ever we're (Windham Hill)
doing is more than the major
labels are doing."
He notes that large com
panies often press up to 50,000
records off one stamper while
a small label such as Windham
Hill presses only a maximum of
2000. And anyone who buys re
cords today can attest to the

fact that album durability is not
nearly as good as it was even
five years ago.
But how can small labels
compete with the larger ones?
They can't in terms of number
ot records produced and sold,
according to Ackerman. But
they are beginning to get a sig
nificant share ot the market.
"Having a decent product is
the main thing," says Acker
man. But Windham Hills pro
duct is more than just decent.
Ackerman's latest album, "It
Takes A Year," is one ol the
finer examples ot solo guitar
music around. It will inevitably
be compared with the work ot
Leo Kottke, who has done the
most to popularize steel string
picking, but "It Takes A Year"
has a much less commercial
sound than Kottke's recent of
terings.
While he admits that up
tempo music sells more re
cords, Ackerman plays mostly
slower, quiet tunes, the
melodious "A Tribute to the
Philosophy ot James Estelle
Bradley" and "Balancing"
being among the best. But he
also picks last and clean songs,
like "Townshend Shuttle" and
"The Rediscovery of Bug Creek
Arizona," which are no less
satisfying.
Linda Waterfall
Besides Ackerman's albums,
Windham Hill has one other re
lease to date, "Mary's Gar
den," by Linda Waterfall.
"Mary's Garden" is a perfect
example ot a small record
company's ability to turn out
imaginative, non-commercial
music. Waterfall's soaring voc
als and engaging lyrics are
complemented by her versatile
guitar playing, as she is equally
at home picking subtle acous
tic accompaniment, as on "The
Bird Song," or throwing out
the bluesy, electric lead ritts of
"Country Bar," and "Gary."
Unencumbered by the over
bearing arrangements a large
company would have no doubf
inflicted on the music, "Mary's
Garden" is a masterpiece of
simplicity.
Upcoming Windham Hill
projects include albums by
guitarist Alex DeGrassi ("abso
lutely thebes'," says Acker
man), ex-Takoma and Van
guard artist Robbie Basho, and
a Palo Alto group named Kid
dAtrika, two of whose mem
bers, Larry Ryan and Teddy |oe
Pollitzer are sons ot Stanford
(acuity members.
KiddAfrika's debut album,
which will be released in
January features tight musi
cianship in a rock/funk format,
along with Pollitzer's brilliant
arrangements ot harmonies
that are instantly reminiscent
ot the Persuasions.
Windham Hill is unique int
that it gives the artist, quite
simply, a better deal than most
record companies. The artist is
signed tor only one album at a
time, becomes sole owner ot
the master tape, and receives a

whopping 50 per cent ol the
profit trom copies sold, com
pared to, according to Acker
man, around 14 per cent Irom
other companies.
Does Ackerman have any
trouble reconciling his roles as
musician and businessman? "I
always sort of play down the art
thing," he says."I don't see
any reason why I can't play nice
music and run a business."
With Windham Hill Records,
Will Ackerman is not only
doing both quite well, but also
providing the public with an
exciting alternative to mass
produced music.

Arhoolie, Philo and Bay Re
cords as among the best.
While he admits "there's not
much big money in it," Acker
man points out that people in
the business . . are begin
ning to figure out the potential
that the small labels have. The
days are really completely
gone when a small label re
lease will have this funky pro
duction and . . . everything
sort of cutting corners. The
quality that Philo Records and
Bay Records and I know what
ever we're (Windham Hill)
doing is more than the major
labels are doing."
He notes that large com
panies often press up to 50,000
records off one stamper while
a small label such as Windham
Hill presses only a maximum of
2000. And anyone who buys re
cords today can attest to the

fact that album durability is not
nearly as good as it was even
five years ago.
But how can small labels
compete with the larger ones?
They can't in terms of number
ot records produced and sold,
according to Ackerman. But
they are beginning to get a sig
nificant share ot the market.
"Having a decent product is
the main thing," says Acker
man. But Windham Hills pro
duct is more than just decent.
Ackerman's latest album, "It
Takes A Year," is one ol the
finer examples ot solo guitar
music around. It will inevitably
be compared with the work ot
Leo Kottke, who has done the
most to popularize steel string
picking, but "It Takes A Year"
has a much less commercial
sound than Kottke's recent of
terings.
While he admits that up
tempo music sells more re
cords, Ackerman plays mostly
slower, quiet tunes, the
melodious "A Tribute to the
Philosophy ot James Estelle
Bradley" and "Balancing"
being among the best. But he
also picks last and clean songs,
like "Townshend Shuttle" and
"The Rediscovery of Bug Creek
Arizona," which are no less
satisfying.
Linda Waterfall
Besides Ackerman's albums,
Windham Hill has one other re
lease to date, "Mary's Gar
den," by Linda Waterfall.
"Mary's Garden" is a perfect
example ot a small record
company's ability to turn out
imaginative, non-commercial
music. Waterfall's soaring voc
als and engaging lyrics are
complemented by her versatile
guitar playing, as she is equally
at home picking subtle acous
tic accompaniment, as on "The
Bird Song," or throwing out
the bluesy, electric lead ritts of
"Country Bar," and "Gary."
Unencumbered by the over
bearing arrangements a large
company would have no doubf
inflicted on the music, "Mary's
Garden" is a masterpiece of
simplicity.
Upcoming Windham Hill
projects include albums by
guitarist Alex DeGrassi ("abso
lutely thebes'," says Acker
man), ex-Takoma and Van
guard artist Robbie Basho, and
a Palo Alto group named Kid
dAtrika, two of whose mem
bers, Larry Ryan and Teddy |oe
Pollitzer are sons ot Stanford
(acuity members.
KiddAfrika's debut album,
which will be released in
January features tight musi
cianship in a rock/funk format,
along with Pollitzer's brilliant
arrangements ot harmonies
that are instantly reminiscent
ot the Persuasions.
Windham Hill is unique int
that it gives the artist, quite
simply, a better deal than most
record companies. The artist is
signed tor only one album at a
time, becomes sole owner ot
the master tape, and receives a

whopping 50 per cent ol the
profit trom copies sold, com
pared to, according to Acker
man, around 14 per cent Irom
other companies.
Does Ackerman have any
trouble reconciling his roles as
musician and businessman? "I
always sort of play down the art
thing," he says."I don't see
any reason why I can't play nice
music and run a business."
With Windham Hill Records,
Will Ackerman is not only
doing both quite well, but also
providing the public with an
exciting alternative to mass
produced music.

William Ackerman dropped
out of Stanford in 1971 to be
come a carpenter, though he
was only seven units short ot
graduation. Today, the son ot
former Stanford English pro

only a carpenter, but also over
sees his own record label,
Windham Hill, and has two
successful albums of steel
string guitar music, "In Search
of the Turtle's Navel" and"It
Takes A Year."
Released in November 1975,
"Turtle's Navel" was never in
tended to be more than a re
cording for Ackerman and his

friends. The LP was a commun
ity project, with friends provid
ing the layout, printing and
typesetting for free, and Ac
kerman and his wife Anne per
sonally pasting the covers onto
each copy. Three hundred
copies were printed originally,
and looking back, Ackerman
recalls, "I was thinking . . .
what are we going to do with all
these records?" But when an

acquaintance doing promo
tional work took 10 copies and
distributed them to local radio
stations, the response was
phenomenal. It was decided to
print up a new stock and . .
have another party and glue up
some more covers."
A good time
He has learned much about
the record business since then,
and has had a good lime doing
it. He says"The nicest thing
about this whole deal has been
meeting the people." The
"people" he speaks of are
those running other small re

cites Kicking Mule, Rounder,

Philosophy ot James Estelle
Bradley" and "Balancing"
being among the best. But he
also picks last and clean songs,
like "Townshend Shuttle" and
"The Rediscovery of Bug Creek
Arizona," which are no less
satisfying.
Linda Waterfall
Besides Ackerman's albums,
Windham Hill has one other re
lease to date, "Mary's Gar
den," by Linda Waterfall.
"Mary's Garden" is a perfect
example ot a small record
company's ability to turn out
imaginative, non-commercial
music. Waterfall's soaring voc
als and engaging lyrics are
complemented by her versatile
guitar playing, as she is equally
at home picking subtle acous
tic accompaniment, as on "The
Bird Song," or throwing out
the bluesy, electric lead ritts of
"Country Bar," and "Gary."
Unencumbered by the over
bearing arrangements a large
company would have no doubf
inflicted on the music, "Mary's
Garden" is a masterpiece of
simplicity.
Upcoming Windham Hill
projects include albums by
guitarist Alex DeGrassi ("abso
lutely thebes'," says Acker
man), ex-Takoma and Van
guard artist Robbie Basho, and
a Palo Alto group named Kid
dAtrika, two of whose mem
bers, Larry Ryan and Teddy |oe
Pollitzer are sons ot Stanford
(acuity members.
KiddAfrika's debut album,
which will be released in
January features tight musi
cianship in a rock/funk format,
along with Pollitzer's brilliant
arrangements ot harmonies
that are instantly reminiscent
ot the Persuasions.
Windham Hill is unique int
that it gives the artist, quite
simply, a better deal than most
record companies. The artist is
signed tor only one album at a
time, becomes sole owner ot
the master tape, and receives a

whopping 50 per cent ol the
profit trom copies sold, com
pared to, according to Acker
man, around 14 per cent Irom
other companies.
Does Ackerman have any
trouble reconciling his roles as
musician and businessman? "I
always sort of play down the art
thing," he says."I don't see
any reason why I can't play nice
music and run a business."
With Windham Hill Records,
Will Ackerman is not only
doing both quite well, but also
providing the public with an
exciting alternative to mass
produced music.
"I figured that I was going to
be an English teacher it I didn't
get the hell out of there, and I
had about seven units to
go. . . ."
William Ackerman dropped
out of Stanford in 1971 to be
come a carpenter, though he
was only seven units short ot
graduation. Today, the son ot
former Stanford English pro

lessor Robert Ackerman is not
only a carpenter, but also over
sees his own record label,
Windham Hill, and has two
successful albums of steel
string guitar music, "In Search
of the Turtle's Navel" and"It
Takes A Year."
Released in November 1975,
"Turtle's Navel" was never in
tended to be more than a re
cording for Ackerman and his

friends. The LP was a commun
ity project, with friends provid
ing the layout, printing and
typesetting for free, and Ac
kerman and his wife Anne per
sonally pasting the covers onto
each copy. Three hundred
copies were printed originally,
and looking back, Ackerman
recalls, "I was thinking . . .
what are we going to do with all
these records?" But when an

acquaintance doing promo
tional work took 10 copies and
distributed them to local radio
stations, the response was
phenomenal. It was decided to
print up a new stock and . .
have another party and glue up
some more covers."
A good time
He has learned much about
the record business since then,
and has had a good lime doing
it. He says"The nicest thing
about this whole deal has been
meeting the people." The
"people" he speaks of are
those running other small re
cord companies which pro
duce quality music. Ackerman
cites Kicking Mule, Rounder,
Arhoolie, Philo and Bay Re
cords as among the best.
While he admits "there's not
much big money in it," Acker
man points out that people in
the business . . are begin
ning to figure out the potential
that the small labels have. The
days are really completely
gone when a small label re
lease will have this funky pro
duction and . . . everything
sort of cutting corners. The
quality that Philo Records and
Bay Records and I know what
ever we're (Windham Hill)
doing is more than the major
labels are doing."
He notes that large com
panies often press up to 50,000
records off one stamper while
a small label such as Windham
Hill presses only a maximum of
2000. And anyone who buys re
cords today can attest to the

fact that album durability is not
nearly as good as it was even
five years ago.
But how can small labels
compete with the larger ones?
They can't in terms of number
ot records produced and sold,
according to Ackerman. But
they are beginning to get a sig
nificant share ot the market.
"Having a decent product is
the main thing," says Acker
man. But Windham Hills pro
duct is more than just decent.
Ackerman's latest album, "It
Takes A Year," is one ol the
finer examples ot solo guitar
music around. It will inevitably
be compared with the work ot
Leo Kottke, who has done the
most to popularize steel string
picking, but "It Takes A Year"
has a much less commercial
sound than Kottke's recent of
terings.
While he admits that up
tempo music sells more re
cords, Ackerman plays mostly
slower, quiet tunes, the
melodious "A Tribute to the
Philosophy ot James Estelle
Bradley" and "Balancing"
being among the best. But he
also picks last and clean songs,
like "Townshend Shuttle" and
"The Rediscovery of Bug Creek
