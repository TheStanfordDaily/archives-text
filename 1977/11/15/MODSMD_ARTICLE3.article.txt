# Friedman says left uses 'double standard'
## 
### Bill Burger 
There is a strong tendency tor the
lett to use a "double standard" when
assessing and criticizing the political
performances of other nations, ac
cording to Milton Friedman, 1976
Nobel laureate in economics.
Friedman chastised the actions ot
protesters who picketed outside San
Francisco's Sheraton-Palace Hotel
where he was speaking to the Com
monwealth Club ot California late
Friday.
FHe called them "mindless pup
pets" pursuing the "Nazi tactics ot
demonstration and street marches
and chants instead of discussion and
persuasion and orderly proceed
ings."
Friedman then charged that the
"attitudes ot the predominantly lib
eral intellectual community ditter
only in degree trom the attitudes ot
these people who are in the halls
outside.
"The intellectual community tol
erates actions on the parts ot these
demonstrators that it would never to
lerate it they were chanting a diffe
rent set of slogans," said Friedman.
Nazi posters
"If their posters bore Nazi sym
bols, I doubt if they would have as
free a run of either the city streets or
the college campuses that they now
have."
Friedman called this double stan
dard "liberal McCarthyism ... It you
look around the world and ask:
Where are human rights being sup
pressed? you'd find, unfortunately,
all too many countries," said Fried
man.
"At the head ot that list must come
China, Russia, Yugoslavia, Cuba and
Cambodia. You must also include in
that list Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
You must be even-handed."
But today's liberals, according to

Friedman, tind tault only on the right
and not on the left.
Spanish executions
Friedman noted there "were
world-wide protests" concerning the
execution ot live people charged
with the assassination ot several
policemen in Spain when it was
under Franco's rule.
Friedman then cited a recent arti
cle in the Los Angeles Times which
claimed that almost 200 executions
have been documented in China
since Flua Kuo-Feng "seized power a
year ago."
The article further stated that
"some analysts have concluded that
the actual number of politically moti
vated executions could be more than
1000."
Friedman asked the audience it
there was "anyone here who thinks it
would be sate to hold his breath until
there are world-wide protests against
those 1000 executions."
Circular spectrum
The difterence between the reac
tions to these events "is because one
regime is labeled right and the other
regime is labeled left," said Fried
man. He termed these "meaningless
labels," however.
"We do not have a straight line in
this area," said Friedman, "we have a
circle. And the extreme lett and the
extreme right come together. There
is no significant difference between
Nazism and Stallnite communism.
They are both totalitarian
philosophies.
"If it is indeed true," said Fried
man, "as these statements say, the
executing ot a thousand people de
serves tbe same condemnation on
the appropriately larger scale as was
visited on Spain a tew years ago."
Friedman also said that he has
never heard of any public or private
protests about tbe "hundreds ot

thousands" who have been appa
rently "slaughtered" in Cambodia
while there are "many protests"
about the "unequal application ot
laws to dilterent races" in South At
rica.
Friedman noted that he was "not
condoning the injustice in South At
rica, because there is much injustice,
but only that it is injustice, whether it
is done by white or by black."
Racist attitude
Friedman said that the unwilling
ness of many people to criticize Idi
Amin's tactics in Uganda "retlects a

fundamentally racist attitude. When
a black-ruled country in Atrica viol
ates civil rights, executes people,
and the like, we have a tendency to
say, 'Oh we mustn't talk about that
because alter all they're only blacks
and they don't know better.' That's
true racism," Friedman said.
friedman said, "The standards ot
human conduct should be the same
tor everybody in the world, black,
white or yellow; and human decency
is the same tor all people, black,
white or yellow."
Explaining his role in Chile's
economic affairs, Friedman said, "I
have never been and I am not now an
economic adviser to the government
of Chile. 2 X U years ago I agreed, at the
behest of a private foundation in
Chile, to spend six days in Chile.
Chilean abuse
"Ever since I was in Chile, I have
been subjected to a storm of abuse in
which untrue statements have been

repeated despite attempts to correct
them.
"Although I have spoken and lec
tured in Yugoslavia, I have never
been abused tor having gone to
Yugoslavia."
Friedman quoted a letter he had
written to the New York Times reply
ing to the criticism of the Chile trip:
"Do you seriously suggest that a
scholar should not travel or give lec
tures in countries of whose political
regimes you disapprove?"

that list Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
You must be even-handed."
But today's liberals, according to

Friedman, tind tault only on the right
and not on the left.
Spanish executions
Friedman noted there "were
world-wide protests" concerning the
execution ot live people charged
with the assassination ot several
policemen in Spain when it was
under Franco's rule.
Friedman then cited a recent arti
cle in the Los Angeles Times which
claimed that almost 200 executions
have been documented in China
since Flua Kuo-Feng "seized power a
year ago."
The article further stated that
"some analysts have concluded that
the actual number of politically moti
vated executions could be more than
1000."
Friedman asked the audience it
there was "anyone here who thinks it
would be sate to hold his breath until
there are world-wide protests against
those 1000 executions."
Circular spectrum
The difterence between the reac
tions to these events "is because one
regime is labeled right and the other
regime is labeled left," said Fried
man. He termed these "meaningless
labels," however.
"We do not have a straight line in
this area," said Friedman, "we have a
circle. And the extreme lett and the
extreme right come together. There
is no significant difference between
Nazism and Stallnite communism.
They are both totalitarian
philosophies.
"If it is indeed true," said Fried
man, "as these statements say, the
executing ot a thousand people de
serves tbe same condemnation on
the appropriately larger scale as was
visited on Spain a tew years ago."
Friedman also said that he has
never heard of any public or private
protests about tbe "hundreds ot

thousands" who have been appa
rently "slaughtered" in Cambodia
while there are "many protests"
about the "unequal application ot
laws to dilterent races" in South At
rica.
Friedman noted that he was "not
condoning the injustice in South At
rica, because there is much injustice,
but only that it is injustice, whether it
is done by white or by black."
Racist attitude
Friedman said that the unwilling
ness of many people to criticize Idi
Amin's tactics in Uganda "retlects a

fundamentally racist attitude. When
a black-ruled country in Atrica viol
ates civil rights, executes people,
and the like, we have a tendency to
say, 'Oh we mustn't talk about that
because alter all they're only blacks
and they don't know better.' That's
true racism," Friedman said.
friedman said, "The standards ot
human conduct should be the same
tor everybody in the world, black,
white or yellow; and human decency
is the same tor all people, black,
white or yellow."
Explaining his role in Chile's
economic affairs, Friedman said, "I
have never been and I am not now an
economic adviser to the government
of Chile. 2 X U years ago I agreed, at the
behest of a private foundation in
Chile, to spend six days in Chile.
Chilean abuse
"Ever since I was in Chile, I have
been subjected to a storm of abuse in
which untrue statements have been

repeated despite attempts to correct
them.
"Although I have spoken and lec
tured in Yugoslavia, I have never
been abused tor having gone to
Yugoslavia."
Friedman quoted a letter he had
written to the New York Times reply
ing to the criticism of the Chile trip:
"Do you seriously suggest that a
scholar should not travel or give lec
tures in countries of whose political
regimes you disapprove?"
There is a strong tendency tor the
lett to use a "double standard" when
assessing and criticizing the political
performances of other nations, ac
cording to Milton Friedman, 1976
Nobel laureate in economics.
Friedman chastised the actions ot
protesters who picketed outside San
Francisco's Sheraton-Palace Hotel
where he was speaking to the Com
monwealth Club ot California late
Friday.
FHe called them "mindless pup
pets" pursuing the "Nazi tactics ot
demonstration and street marches
and chants instead of discussion and
persuasion and orderly proceed
ings."
Friedman then charged that the
"attitudes ot the predominantly lib
eral intellectual community ditter
only in degree trom the attitudes ot
these people who are in the halls
outside.
"The intellectual community tol
erates actions on the parts ot these
demonstrators that it would never to
lerate it they were chanting a diffe
rent set of slogans," said Friedman.
Nazi posters
"If their posters bore Nazi sym
bols, I doubt if they would have as
free a run of either the city streets or
the college campuses that they now
have."
Friedman called this double stan
dard "liberal McCarthyism ... It you
look around the world and ask:
Where are human rights being sup
pressed? you'd find, unfortunately,
all too many countries," said Fried
man.
"At the head ot that list must come
China, Russia, Yugoslavia, Cuba and
Cambodia. You must also include in

executing ot a thousand people de
serves tbe same condemnation on
the appropriately larger scale as was
visited on Spain a tew years ago."
Friedman also said that he has
never heard of any public or private
protests about tbe "hundreds ot

thousands" who have been appa
rently "slaughtered" in Cambodia
while there are "many protests"
about the "unequal application ot
laws to dilterent races" in South At
rica.
Friedman noted that he was "not
condoning the injustice in South At
rica, because there is much injustice,
but only that it is injustice, whether it
is done by white or by black."
Racist attitude
Friedman said that the unwilling
ness of many people to criticize Idi
Amin's tactics in Uganda "retlects a

fundamentally racist attitude. When
a black-ruled country in Atrica viol
ates civil rights, executes people,
and the like, we have a tendency to
say, 'Oh we mustn't talk about that
because alter all they're only blacks
and they don't know better.' That's
true racism," Friedman said.
friedman said, "The standards ot
human conduct should be the same
tor everybody in the world, black,
white or yellow; and human decency
is the same tor all people, black,
white or yellow."
Explaining his role in Chile's
economic affairs, Friedman said, "I
have never been and I am not now an
economic adviser to the government
of Chile. 2 X U years ago I agreed, at the
behest of a private foundation in
Chile, to spend six days in Chile.
Chilean abuse
"Ever since I was in Chile, I have
been subjected to a storm of abuse in
which untrue statements have been

repeated despite attempts to correct
them.
"Although I have spoken and lec
tured in Yugoslavia, I have never
been abused tor having gone to
Yugoslavia."
Friedman quoted a letter he had
written to the New York Times reply
ing to the criticism of the Chile trip:
"Do you seriously suggest that a
scholar should not travel or give lec
tures in countries of whose political
regimes you disapprove?"
There is a strong tendency tor the
lett to use a "double standard" when
assessing and criticizing the political
performances of other nations, ac
cording to Milton Friedman, 1976
Nobel laureate in economics.
Friedman chastised the actions ot
protesters who picketed outside San
Francisco's Sheraton-Palace Hotel
where he was speaking to the Com
monwealth Club ot California late
Friday.
FHe called them "mindless pup
pets" pursuing the "Nazi tactics ot
demonstration and street marches
and chants instead of discussion and
persuasion and orderly proceed
ings."
Friedman then charged that the
"attitudes ot the predominantly lib
eral intellectual community ditter
only in degree trom the attitudes ot
these people who are in the halls
outside.
"The intellectual community tol
erates actions on the parts ot these
demonstrators that it would never to
lerate it they were chanting a diffe
rent set of slogans," said Friedman.
Nazi posters
"If their posters bore Nazi sym
bols, I doubt if they would have as
free a run of either the city streets or
the college campuses that they now
have."
Friedman called this double stan
dard "liberal McCarthyism ... It you
look around the world and ask:
Where are human rights being sup
pressed? you'd find, unfortunately,
all too many countries," said Fried
man.
"At the head ot that list must come
China, Russia, Yugoslavia, Cuba and
Cambodia. You must also include in
that list Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
You must be even-handed."
But today's liberals, according to

Friedman, tind tault only on the right
and not on the left.
Spanish executions
Friedman noted there "were
world-wide protests" concerning the
execution ot live people charged
with the assassination ot several
policemen in Spain when it was
under Franco's rule.
Friedman then cited a recent arti
cle in the Los Angeles Times which
claimed that almost 200 executions
have been documented in China
since Flua Kuo-Feng "seized power a
year ago."
The article further stated that
"some analysts have concluded that
the actual number of politically moti
vated executions could be more than
1000."
Friedman asked the audience it
there was "anyone here who thinks it
would be sate to hold his breath until
there are world-wide protests against
those 1000 executions."
Circular spectrum
The difterence between the reac
tions to these events "is because one
regime is labeled right and the other
regime is labeled left," said Fried
man. He termed these "meaningless
labels," however.
"We do not have a straight line in
this area," said Friedman, "we have a
circle. And the extreme lett and the
extreme right come together. There
is no significant difference between
Nazism and Stallnite communism.
They are both totalitarian
philosophies.
"If it is indeed true," said Fried
man, "as these statements say, the
executing ot a thousand people de
serves tbe same condemnation on
the appropriately larger scale as was
visited on Spain a tew years ago."
Friedman also said that he has
