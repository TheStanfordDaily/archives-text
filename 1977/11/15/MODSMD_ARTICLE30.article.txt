# Cris Williamson, 'The Changer and the Changed'
## 
### 
In a world of tine women songwriters (Laura Nyro, Nina
Simone, Joni Mitchell, Holly Near, Margie Adam), Chris William
son gives us an uncompromisingly strong and graceful first al
bum, "The Changer and the Changed." Her voice is rich and
deep; and her delivery is full of the emotions and questions we
care about — raw, but within her control.
Here are words from a believer who asks us to join her in
expressing what we are experiencfhg, and who opens so we may
see more possibilities. The opening cut, "Waterfall," conveys the
spirit of the album — the re-birth ot women and the struggle:
"Sometimes it take* a rainy day
lust to let you know everything's gonna be all right.
I've been dreaming in the sun, won't you wake me up someone
I need a little peace of mind.
Wake me from this dream that I have dreamed so many times
I need a little peace ot mind, Oh I need a little peace ot mind.
When you open your life to the living, all things come spilling in
on you.
And you're flowing like a river, the Changer and the Changed.
You got to spill some over, spill some over, spill some over, over
all. ..."
All of the songs were written by Williamson (except for "Having
Been Touched Lady" which was written by Margie
Adam). "Sweet Woman" is a wonderful love song that gives
tribute to tenderness. The words are fine, but it is the melody that
finally pulis us in and the voice that embraces us, asking us to
listen closely to a woman seeing love.
"A Dream Child of Desire" is also a solid, but simple view ot
love, in this case physical love. The closing song, "Sister," brings
together Cris, Holly Near, Margie Adam and others in an uplifting
sharing of a blossoming tradition in women. Trust.
Fifty women were a part of making "The Changer and the
Changed." It was written, performed and recorded by women
only, and is a product of Olivia Records (a national women's
recording company). Money raised from the sale of this record
will be used to purchase a studio, for production ot records, and
tor company salaries.
