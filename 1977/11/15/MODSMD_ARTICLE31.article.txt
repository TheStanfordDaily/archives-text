Disco. A craze that has hit
the nation, swept the country,
and otherwise captured the
feet of much of a new genera
tion. Some say the music is
mindless; no matter, it's the
movement that counts.
And it movement is what one
is after, there's no real need to
journey to San Francisco to
find good disco. Plenty is avail
able here on the Peninsula,

and Mountain View's jumping
Frog Saloon is probably the
best.
lumping Frog, which
opened back in the tall, is lo
cated in the beautiful Old Mill
Shopping Center. The disco
carries a mixed motit, centered
around a large gazebo. Other
decor ranges from outdoor
furniture to huge plush velvet
arm chairs, intertwined in a
manner that is not too over
powering and blends well.
Cover charge on Saturday
night was a modest $2 (modest

if one intends to stay all even
ing), and there are in and out
priviledges available via hand
stamps. Only persons over 21
are allowed into the disco.
Posted signs announced a
one drink minimum for each
musical set, but this did not
appear to be strictly enforced.
Drinks were quite good, well
mixed and of reasonable
strength, at standard prices ot
about $1.25 each. No food is
available on weekends.
But on to the music. The
Jumping Frog Saloon features a

standard disco set-up: alternat
ing sets of recorded music and
live disco bands. On the par
ticular night we attended, the
records were normal tunk/rock
mixture and the band was
tight, achieving perhaps the
primary aim of all disco bands:
to sound no worse (and no bet
ter) than the records.
The crowd was a mixture ol
slick rock animals and normal
college kids, so those who
might be intimidated by horror
stories ot jewelled discos in
New York can rest easy. How
ever, a basic dress code (no
cords, no messy jeans) is
strictly entorced.
The single, but nevertheless
bothersome, problem at the
lumping Frog Saloon was its
size. There is simply not
enough room to accommodate

all the 350 persons the disco is
limited to. There was a more or
less constant press to the bar,
to the dance floor, from the
dance lloor and back.
Compounding the problem
was a very small dance floor
which would not accommo
date all the dancing feet, and
tar less than enough seating
room. Parking competition
from the six (count 'em) nearby
theatres made tor another has
sle as we ended up leaving our
car in the shopping center ac
ross the street.
But all in all — and especially
for the music (the sound sys
tem was in excellent condition)
— the Jumping Frog Saloon is
the place to go for disco, danc
ing and tun.
