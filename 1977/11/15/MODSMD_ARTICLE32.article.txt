It is presently popular to assume that Heart and the present
day edition of Fleetwood Mac are the first rock bands led by
women, but there was a critic ally well-received group in the early
70s known as )oy of Cooking that was led by two talented lemale
singer/songwriters, pianist Tom Brown and guitarist Terry Garth
waite. The two are now together again, and billing themselves
simply as The |oy, have just released an 11' of the same name on
fantasy Records.
"The )oy" is a vocally oriented album, with tew instrumental
passages (though Taj Mahal and Elvin Bishop make guest appear
ances on harmonica and slide guitar respectively), but the back
ing is solid all the way through, with a tight rhythm section
comprised ot Reggie Mcßride on bass and lames Cadson on
drums.
Side one opens with an unnecessary remake ot Van Morrison's
"Come Running," which is followed by one ol Brown's lesser
compositions, "You Don't Owe Me Spring.'' But the rest ol the
side is tilled with some tine bluesy material. "On the Natch" and
I eel Like Heaven" are perfect vehicles tor Garthwaite's versatile
voice, which jaz/es up the lormer and breezes through the latter
with equal precision and style.
Though she is highly regarded as a lyricist, Brown again shows
nothing spectacular on a trivial piece about a morning radio D.|.
called "Morning Man" that opens side two, though the song is
saved by Mcßride's loping bass lines and Garthwaite's blues
guitar licks. But on the next cut, Brown redeems herself, display
ing some wit on "Snow," an upbeat tune about a lover with a
letish tor cleanliness.
We met in the laundromat,
The day was white,
A toot ol fresh clean snow
Had fallen in the night.
And as I helped you fold up your sheets,
I knew it was right
That I would he the one
To help you mess them up again. *
"Snow" is especially complemented by the bouncy rhythm sec
tion, and is easily the album's most engaging cut.
"The )oy" is not as strong a product as might be expected trom
artists ot Tom Brown and Terry Garthwaite's stature, but it is, atter
all, their tirst studio effort together in some years. Overall, the
record is a positive step towards re-entry into the music business,
and with each woman planning a solo album, more will soon be
heard from both ot them.

"The )oy" is not as strong a product as might be expected trom
artists ot Tom Brown and Terry Garthwaite's stature, but it is, atter

It is presently popular to assume that Heart and the present
day edition of Fleetwood Mac are the first rock bands led by
women, but there was a critic ally well-received group in the early
70s known as )oy of Cooking that was led by two talented lemale
singer/songwriters, pianist Tom Brown and guitarist Terry Garth
waite. The two are now together again, and billing themselves
simply as The |oy, have just released an 11' of the same name on
fantasy Records.
"The )oy" is a vocally oriented album, with tew instrumental
passages (though Taj Mahal and Elvin Bishop make guest appear
ances on harmonica and slide guitar respectively), but the back
ing is solid all the way through, with a tight rhythm section
comprised ot Reggie Mcßride on bass and lames Cadson on
drums.
Side one opens with an unnecessary remake ot Van Morrison's
"Come Running," which is followed by one ol Brown's lesser
compositions, "You Don't Owe Me Spring.'' But the rest ol the
side is tilled with some tine bluesy material. "On the Natch" and
I eel Like Heaven" are perfect vehicles tor Garthwaite's versatile
voice, which jaz/es up the lormer and breezes through the latter
with equal precision and style.
Though she is highly regarded as a lyricist, Brown again shows
nothing spectacular on a trivial piece about a morning radio D.|.
called "Morning Man" that opens side two, though the song is
saved by Mcßride's loping bass lines and Garthwaite's blues
guitar licks. But on the next cut, Brown redeems herself, display
ing some wit on "Snow," an upbeat tune about a lover with a
letish tor cleanliness.
We met in the laundromat,
The day was white,
A toot ol fresh clean snow
Had fallen in the night.
And as I helped you fold up your sheets,
I knew it was right
That I would he the one
