# 'Rain Dance': only too short
## 
### 
What do you think ot when
you think of Camel? Humps?
Cigarettes? The new album by
the group Camel, "Rain
Dances," is going to change all
that. Camel consists of Andrew
Latimer, Peter Bardens, Andy
Ward, Richard Sinclair and
Mel Collins, and exhibits di
versity, musicianship, and an
ear tor melody which allow me
to unhesitantingly place this
album on my list of the year's
best.
Perhaps the only bad thing
one can say about this album is
that it is too short. With the
opening cut, "First Light," the
listener is transported, via

synthesizer and sax (the sax
almost "grows" out of the
music), to the future, or at least
to the future ol pop/rock. The
sound reflects many ot the
favorable attributes ol such
"space/mood rockers" as
Genesis, The Moody Blues,
Supertramp," and Ves, hut
Camel has added many of its
own dimensions, as well.
Moving through the remain
der of side one — "Metrog
nome," "Tell Me" and
"Highways of the Sun" — we
are treated to the none-too
common practice of using voc
als as soothing, smooth and
beautiful instruments. And

each of these ballads is as good
overall as Its vocals.
Side two takes a departure
from ballad-like tunes, and
opens with a more upbeat
number, "Unevensong,"
which best showcases the ta
lents of the group (with the ex
ception of the woodwind and
brass talents ot Collins, who is
not on this track). "One of
These Days I'll Get an Early
Night" is a modern jazz/pop
mixture which reveals yet
another ot Camel's talents: a
sense ot what makes jazz good
and listenable.
Dutch
The following two tracks,
"Skylines" and "Elke" are
much in the style of the Dutch
group Focus (noted tor its
complex rock/jazz/classical fu
sions) at its finest. "Skylines" is
another jazz influenced tune,
and "Elke" is a beautiful in
strumental which could easily
pass for the score to a ballet.
In all, this album is almost
complete. It has a bit of just
about everything: jazz; classi
cal; pop; and rock. What it
doesn't have is a track which
could just as well have been
left out. Truly excellent; I think
Camel is an animal we'll be se
eing a lot more of.

der of side one — "Metrog
nome," "Tell Me" and
"Highways of the Sun" — we
are treated to the none-too
common practice of using voc
als as soothing, smooth and
beautiful instruments. And

each of these ballads is as good
overall as Its vocals.
Side two takes a departure
from ballad-like tunes, and
opens with a more upbeat
number, "Unevensong,"
which best showcases the ta
lents of the group (with the ex
ception of the woodwind and
brass talents ot Collins, who is
not on this track). "One of
These Days I'll Get an Early
Night" is a modern jazz/pop
mixture which reveals yet
another ot Camel's talents: a
sense ot what makes jazz good
and listenable.

The following two tracks,
"Skylines" and "Elke" are
much in the style of the Dutch
group Focus (noted tor its
complex rock/jazz/classical fu
sions) at its finest. "Skylines" is
another jazz influenced tune,
and "Elke" is a beautiful in
strumental which could easily
pass for the score to a ballet.
In all, this album is almost
complete. It has a bit of just
about everything: jazz; classi
cal; pop; and rock. What it
doesn't have is a track which
could just as well have been
left out. Truly excellent; I think
Camel is an animal we'll be se
eing a lot more of.

What do you think ot when
you think of Camel? Humps?
Cigarettes? The new album by
the group Camel, "Rain
Dances," is going to change all
that. Camel consists of Andrew
Latimer, Peter Bardens, Andy
Ward, Richard Sinclair and
Mel Collins, and exhibits di
versity, musicianship, and an
ear tor melody which allow me
to unhesitantingly place this
album on my list of the year's
best.
Perhaps the only bad thing
one can say about this album is
that it is too short. With the
opening cut, "First Light," the
listener is transported, via

synthesizer and sax (the sax
almost "grows" out of the
music), to the future, or at least
to the future ol pop/rock. The
sound reflects many ot the
favorable attributes ol such
"space/mood rockers" as
Genesis, The Moody Blues,
Supertramp," and Ves, hut
Camel has added many of its
own dimensions, as well.
