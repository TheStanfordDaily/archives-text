# Sticky business when illegal copies of major films are copied
## Film pirates cost studios millions per year 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” Studios
and stars make millions ot dol
lars from the movies, but they
lose millions more to tilm pi
rates who raid the protit trea
sure chest of upwards ot $100
million annually through illegal
copying and distribution.
Thousands of bootlegged
prints, including such box of
fice giants as "Star Wars" and
"laws," are shipped around
the world every month. Studio
officials say the glut of bootleg
prints has cut box office pro
tits.
Pirates can put a print on the
market even before the origi
nal is released to theaters and
they also consistently outbid
studios tor lucrative toreign
distribution.
Little catching
The bootleggers are being
chased with the vengeance ot
Darth Vader going after Luke
Skywalker and his pals in "Star
Wars," but with somewhat less
success.
It's difficult to estimate how
much the pirates cost the in
dustry.
"Figure around $20 million
to the upside tigure of $100
million,"says Assistant U.S.
Atty. Vincent Marella, while
H.A. Porter, an FBI expert on
tilm piracy, said, "I just don't
know. I do know it's tremend
ous . . . and we have only

touched the tip ot the
iceberg."
'Millions'
"We're talking about mill
ions," says Richard Bloesure,
himself a retired FBI agent and
the Film Security Office's assis
tant director. "We figure that
the film collectors in the coun
try alone sell and trade $60 mill
ion in bootlegged tilms every
year."
Contesses former bootleg
ger Tom Dunnahoo: "It was
the biggest money-ma king
business I ever was in."
In 1975, the Motion Picture
Association of America set up
the Film Security Office to try
to cope with the problem and
industry officials say increased
security has helped.
Cheap
Still, it someone knows the
right person, he can see "Star
Wars" or "Looking tor Mr.
Goodbar." The going price tor
those hits is $1000 while films
such as "Annie Hall" cost $750.
But the big bootleg profits
come trom showcases such as
hotels, "speakeasy" theaters,
restaurants, condominiums
and even tuna fleets.
Recently, the FBI uncovered
a $4 million scheme at a Texas
motel where visitors paid to
watch closed-circuit screen
ings of movies that included

"Star Wars," "Rocky," and
"Jaws."
Easy access
Access to films is easy. Films
in transit disappear tor a time
and are copied, or prints are
made from film taken from the
salvage companies which buy
old films from studios. Boot
leggers also gain access
through film laboratories, ren
tal companies, and libraries at
TV stations and universities.
Another av*enue is via the
stars, directors, and studio
executives who once got cour
tesy prints of pictures in which
they were involved.
"It's like any business," Por
ter says. "Any product that is
handled by 200 different
people, trom the cutting
rooms to the projectionists to
those transporting the film,
somewhere along the line
someone is going to think
maybe he can smuggle the
print out, get it copied in an
underground lab and get the
original print back before any
one notices."
Borrowed films
Another way, said Porter, is
for someone to "approach a
projectionist or studio worker
and offer him $1000 so he can
'borrow' the film lor a couple
of hours. But that guy fully in
tends to make maybe three or
four copies. We've found

some pirates who have the
capability of making 10 copies
simultaneously."
"Pirates, tor the most part,
are on the genius level," said
Porter.
Most pirates deal in 16mm
film, reduced from the studios'
original 35mm. But videotape
has opened up the black mar
ket even wider with pirates re
ducing lilm to '/4-inch or
'/i-inch tape.
TV copies
Authorities know cases
where p'eople sit back, turn on
their videotape recorder and
copy films off the television
set.
"This is where the dam is
wide open," admits Bloesure.
"for example, there was a man
who purchased 100 current
teature films trom the captain
ot a Middle East oil tanker.
Most of the films had been
taped right off the ABC Friday
night movie. The station
breaks were still there."
Authorities admit it's impos
sible to completely wipe out
piracy. Yet more than $22 mill
ion has been spent on antip
iracy etforts, according to
MPAA figures, although some
say that estimate is high.
Collectors
One problem in hunting
down the pirates is the collec
tors, people whose hobby is
buying copies of films.
One collector, Kingsley
Candler, said the 112 Bl harassed
him, including a search of his
house, after he advertised in a
trade publication ottering to
sell or trade a package ot lilms.
The I Bl denies the harassment
charge.
The problem is that a person,
including a collector, doesn't
know whether the print he
buys is bootlegged.
Current copyright law makes
illegal the "wilitul inlringe
ment lor proiit." Thecourtsare
still struggling over the in
terpretation ot those lour
words.
Copyright expired
The only time it is legal to sell
prints is when that movie is in
the public domain after the
copyright expires or when
there has been a "tirst sale"
where studios have sold the
movie and its rights.
A copyright is issued lor 28
years and can be renewed lor
another 28. On )an. 1, 1978,
that will change to lite of the
author plus SO years.
The key word is "profit."
I ilm collectors say they deal in
movies only lor pleasure, but
authorities insist the word
"collector" is merely a
smokescreen lor pirates. To
them, the trench proverb "He
who profits by a crime is guilty
ot that crime" is applicable.
"There are JO,OOO collectors
in this country alone," Bloe
sure says."And a lot of them

leel it they pay good money for
a print, they should be able to
keep it and resell it if they want.
Stolen source
"There are legitimate film
collectors. But any film collec
tor can be a source ot stolen
tilms," Porter adds. "When
someone sells a copy ot a cur
rent movie for profit and puts
that film into the mainstream
where it is shown around the
world, then he is contributing
to film piracy."
Since the federal crackdown
began in 197J, Porter says there
have been about 100 prosecu
tions in Los Angeles tor both
civil and criminal infractions,
but only 25 convictions, many
of which are on appeal.
Those convictions resulted
trom guilty pleas to copyright
infringement, mail fraud and
interstate transportation ot sto
len property, he said.
Eoreign sales
for example, when a pirated
film is in demand all over the
world, chances are bootleg
gers will head tor Canada or
South America or Africa or
Europe to sell their wares.
The reason: Copyright laws
in other countries are either
too lax, non-existent, or are
not enforced. Exceptions are
Krance, where there is a Paris
branch of the film Security Ol
tice, and England, where Scot
land Yard has followed the U.S.
lead.
The federal government is
upset about the pirates be
cause they aren't paying in
come and export taxes.
Industry and law enforce
ment officials claim the
crackdown is making headway.
Studios are more inclined to
copyright what they produce.
The cost is minimal about $(>
per print, and have instituted
elaborate preventive measures
to make it harder to smuggle a
print out. Studios have even
destroyed classic prints trom
their vaults just so pirates can't
linger them.
Studio fines
Meanwhile, the MPAA can
levy $5000 tines on studios that
fail to keep a tight rein on who
receives accommodation
prints and it is developing a
movie coding system to de
termine a print's authenticity
and its source, it it is bogus.
Rut no one is overly optimis
tic.
Says Dunnahoo: "Hell, the
only reason the I Bl is still doing
anything is because the studios
have laid down so much pres
sure on them. It'll all subside
soon and pirates will still be
pirating."
Adds Porter: "There are
people who collect everything
and will sell it wherever they
can turn a buck.
"It's like prostitution: you're
gonna slow it down but you're
not gonna stop it."
