# Giants face off in video battle
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Like a
pair of Sumo wrestlers, two
Japanese industrial giants have
squared off in what may be
come the biggest battle of the
electronics industry since the
development of color televi
sion.
Most major American man
ufacturers already have lined
up in the corner of their favo
rite, angling tor authority to
distribute the lapanese sys
tems under U.S. brand names.
At the center of the dispute
are different versions ot the
home videotape recorder
the devices which allow televi
sion viewers to watch one
program while recording
another tor future viewing.
These versions are incom
patible — they lunction in a
slightly ditterent tashion and
tapes from one cannot be used
on the other. Thus, the winner
of the contest could reap mill
ions, not only in sales ot the
original machines, but in years
ot continuing sales of tape car
tridges — both those pre
recorded with movies or other
events and those lett blank tor
home recording.
The industry is hoping that
the recorders will live up to
their promise as the hottest
thing since color television
sales exploded in the early
19605.
According to Audio Video In
ternational magazine, sales ot
the units are expected to total
250,000 this year and a halt
million in 1978. An average
growth rate ot 50 per cent is
predicted in 1979 and 1980.
The recorders are a high
priced item, with listed prices
ranging trom $1000 to $1100
plus accessories. The tapes
aren't cheap either at $15 to $20
each. And extras such as a
black-and-white camera can
add as much as $500 to the cost.
The tapes can be reused, al
though dealers report that
many people are buying many
tapes in order to save some ot
their tavorite shows.
While various tirms have ex
perimented in the tield, the
sets appearing in volume on
pre-Christmas U.S. store
shelves are virtually all made by
two lapanese electronic giants
Sony's Betamax is perhaps
the best known of the brands
because of its extensive adver
tising campaign. That com
pany's product also is being
marketed under various other
names by Zenith, Sears, Sanyo
and Toshiba.
Matsushita sells its machines
in the United States under
three companies it controls —
Panasonic, JVC (lapan Victor
Company) and, in a slightly dit
terent version, Quasar. Its vid
eotape version also is mar
keted here by RCA, Magnavox,
Sylvania and Curtis Mathes.

many people are buying many
tapes in order to save some ot

shelves are virtually all made by
two lapanese electronic giants
Sony's Betamax is perhaps
the best known of the brands
because of its extensive adver

names by Zenith, Sears, Sanyo

in the United States under
three companies it controls —
Panasonic, JVC (lapan Victor

Washington (AP) — Like a
pair of Sumo wrestlers, two
Japanese industrial giants have
squared off in what may be
come the biggest battle of the
electronics industry since the
development of color televi
sion.
Most major American man
ufacturers already have lined
up in the corner of their favo
rite, angling tor authority to
distribute the lapanese sys
tems under U.S. brand names.
At the center of the dispute
are different versions ot the
home videotape recorder
the devices which allow televi
sion viewers to watch one
program while recording
another tor future viewing.
These versions are incom
patible — they lunction in a
slightly ditterent tashion and
tapes from one cannot be used
on the other. Thus, the winner
of the contest could reap mill
ions, not only in sales ot the
original machines, but in years
ot continuing sales of tape car
tridges — both those pre
recorded with movies or other
events and those lett blank tor
home recording.
The industry is hoping that
the recorders will live up to
their promise as the hottest
thing since color television
sales exploded in the early
19605.
According to Audio Video In
ternational magazine, sales ot
the units are expected to total
250,000 this year and a halt
million in 1978. An average
growth rate ot 50 per cent is
predicted in 1979 and 1980.
The recorders are a high
priced item, with listed prices
ranging trom $1000 to $1100
plus accessories. The tapes
aren't cheap either at $15 to $20
each. And extras such as a
black-and-white camera can
add as much as $500 to the cost.
The tapes can be reused, al
though dealers report that
many people are buying many
tapes in order to save some ot
their tavorite shows.
