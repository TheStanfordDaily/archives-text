This is the week that keeps the Band out of law school — it is the
week in which many are warped for life. Between guarding the
Band Shak from slimy Cal weenies and numbing the Peninsula
with "All Right Now" even the most diligent of their number will
find it hard to pursue the fruits of academia with anything re
sembling vigor. It is in short Big Game Week — a chapter Dante
forgot.
The LSJUMB schedule for the next week ranges from a Tuesday
night unisex function at the Palo Alto Men's Club to a mystery
appearance at a post-game bash; from a Friday Stickney's break
fast to a Daliesque Thursday all-campus rally. It should not be
boring. Those interested in partaking might find the following
schedule helpful.
Tuesday Nov. 15: established and exclusive luncheon at the Fair
mont in San Francisco; aforementioned dinner at the Palo
Alto Men's Club.
Wednesday: 11:30 a.m. assault on White Plaza; rehearsing and
carousing and much doing of evil things.
Thursday: 7:15 p.m. all-campus-primal-frenzy-rip-Cal-scum

Friday: Hallide Plaza rally in The City (Market Street) at 10:30
p.m.; Gaieties performances at 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.
Dark warm narcotic American Nighttime rally at various and

a.m. tailgate parties, late afternoon secret concert sur~
prise. Also, a football game.
