# Vance considering trip to Middle East
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Carter ad
ministration is considering a trip by
Secretary ot State Cyrus Vance to the
Middle East in )anuary it a Geneva
conference cannot be convened this
year.
Under consideration as well, otti
cials said yesterday, are meetings
next month in Europe between
Vance and Arab and Israeli foreign
ministers in an ettort to promote
peace talks.
These are only options .it this point
and no consultations have been held
with other governments. Administra
tion leaders still hope the internal
Arab dispute over Palestinian par
ticipation and other procedural obs
tacles can be overcome.
In this regard, they are awaiting the
outcome ot the meeting ot Arab
toreign ministers in Tunis and talks
later this week in Damascus between
Presidents Anwar Sadaf ot Egypt and
Hafez Assad ot Syria.
Meanwhile, in another develop
ment, the State Department rejected
a Palestinian proposal that the Un
ited Nations Security Council en

dorse a statement recognizing
"legitimate rights" of the Palesti
nians.
The statement, adopted by the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union on
Oct. 1, "is not to be taken as the
prescription tor getting to Geneva or
as the blueprint tor that confer
ence," said Nodding Carter, the de
partment spokesman.
Besides, he said, "we would not
lavor any new resolutions by the
Security Council which we believe
would complicate diplomatic con
tacts underway."
The spokesman's comments were
in response to an unotticial proposal
by Said Kamal, the deputy chiet of
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion's political department, tor gain
ing an invitation tor the PLO to
Geneva.
No invitation
Israel has agreed with the United
States that Pale .tinians should be in
cluded in an all-Arab delegation at
the opening ot the peace talks. Israel
has said it would not "check their
credentials" but has ruled out an in
vitation to the PLO.
Administration officials hope the
dispute can be resolved through
Sadat's initiative to sidestep remain
ing procedural problems and pro
ceed quickly to Geneva. But Syria,
the PLO's champion in Arab coun
cils, insists that the PLO be invited to
Geneva "on an equal tooting" with
the other parties.
It the meeting in Tunis and the
Sadat-Assad talks fail to overcome
this obstacle, officials here said,
Vance may meet in a neutral Euro
pean city with Arab and Israeli minis
ters.
A trip to the Middle East would de
pend on a collapse ot all hopes tor a
conference by Christmas and on a
judgment that Vance could find a
new basis lor compromise.
