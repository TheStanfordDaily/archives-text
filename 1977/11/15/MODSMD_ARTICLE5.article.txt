### Jim Tranquada 
The Board of Trustees, beginning in lanuary, will face
new shareholders' resolutions calling tor the non
expansion or withdrawal of American corporations in
South Africa, according to Tim Smith, director ot the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR).
Several corporations have withdrawn or curtailed
their activity in South Atrica recently, due in part to
current protest "which has caused more and more com
panies to reevaluate their position (in South Africa),"
Smith told the Daily last week.
The trustees' position on South African-related
shareholders' resolutions was a center ot controversy
last year. Some 294 persons were arrested during a May 9
sit-in in Old Union. They supported a demand that the
board reverse its previous abstentions and vote the Uni
versity's 94,000 Ford Motor Co. shares in favor of a resol
ution mandating withdrawal from South Atrica.
Texaco withdrawal
One of the principal resolutions likely to lace the
trustees this spring is one calling tor the withdrawal ot
Texaco investment in the nation, Smith said.
Stanford owns more than 150,000 shares of Texaco.
The resolution will be the same as the one presented
to the Texaco shareholders' meeting last year which
received almost tour percent of the vote, Smith said. It is
identical to the resolution presented to lord in May.
The University also has smaller holdings in Union

Carbide and Phelps Dodge, both of which will face
shareholder resolutions this year, Smith added.
Expanded operations
All three of these companies — Texaco, Union Car
bide, and Phelps Dodge — have either expanded their
operations recently or are planning to do so, said Smith.
Phelps Dodge, in conjunction with Consolidated Cold
Fields, a British tirm, decided in May to invest another
$100 million, Smith said.
Consolidated Gold Fields "is internationally known
tor having one of the most backward wage and labor
records in South Africa," he said
In contrast, Weyerhaeuser (a torest products tirm) has
sold its South African operation within the past tew
months, said Smith.
Government bonds
Due to government restrictions on the repatriation ot
capital instituted this past year, 50 per cent ot
Weyerhaeuser's money was invested in South Atrican
government bonds, which can be sold at any time, Smith
said.
Chrysler's South Atrican operation is down to a third
oi its tormer si/e, and International Telephone and
Telegraph has sold out to a South Atrican company.
Smith said.
Other companies have "quiet policies" ot non
expansion and |ust don't announce the tact, Smith s,ud.
Several banks have curtailed loans to South Atrica as
well, Smith said.

received almost tour percent of the vote, Smith said. It is
identical to the resolution presented to lord in May.

Carbide and Phelps Dodge, both of which will face
shareholder resolutions this year, Smith added.
Expanded operations
All three of these companies — Texaco, Union Car
bide, and Phelps Dodge — have either expanded their
operations recently or are planning to do so, said Smith.
Phelps Dodge, in conjunction with Consolidated Cold
Fields, a British tirm, decided in May to invest another
$100 million, Smith said.

tor having one of the most backward wage and labor
records in South Africa," he said

sold its South African operation within the past tew
months, said Smith.

government bonds, which can be sold at any time, Smith
said.

Several banks have curtailed loans to South Atrica as
well, Smith said.
The Board of Trustees, beginning in lanuary, will face
new shareholders' resolutions calling tor the non
expansion or withdrawal of American corporations in
South Africa, according to Tim Smith, director ot the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR).
Several corporations have withdrawn or curtailed
their activity in South Atrica recently, due in part to
current protest "which has caused more and more com
panies to reevaluate their position (in South Africa),"
Smith told the Daily last week.
The trustees' position on South African-related
shareholders' resolutions was a center ot controversy
last year. Some 294 persons were arrested during a May 9
sit-in in Old Union. They supported a demand that the
board reverse its previous abstentions and vote the Uni
versity's 94,000 Ford Motor Co. shares in favor of a resol
ution mandating withdrawal from South Atrica.
