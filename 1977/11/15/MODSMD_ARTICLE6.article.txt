# University not a trust fund
## 
### 
Randall Schutt

I would like to make a few com
ments on the 1971 Statement of In
vestment Responsibility and a few
suggestions for the new statement
and the new Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility:
The 1971 statement begins with the
sentence: "it is by law and tradition
the primary responsibility of Univer
sity trustees to invest the University's
endowment so as to maximize the
financial return on those resources."
This sentence establishes the tone
for the whole statement. As I underv
stand it, trust law only demands a
"reasonable return." But more to the
point, this sentence is fundamentally
wrong.
Stanford University was not estab
lished as a trust fund, with a primary
aim of increasing its wealth. Stan
ford is a university, dedicated to
education. Its primary goal is to its
students. As an institution it should
strive for implementation of these
truths, even the difficult-to-quantify
moral truths.
If it is worth teaching to students, it
is worth actually implementing.
Furthermore, as a major, prestigious
university, Stanford substantially af
fects the moral stance of the nation.
The world watches what Stanford
does, and often follows suit.
If, in its financial concerns, the
University puts away moral concerns

and only seeks to maximize monet
ary return, it denies these truths that
it teaches. Finances should be com
pletely secondary to the duties that
Stanford has as a moral agent in soci
ety. Only when the viability of the
institution is jeopardized should fi
nancial concerns be allowed to take
precedence.
As it is pointed out in the 1971
statement, it is virtually impossible to
monitor all the companies in which
the University owns or might own
stock, and then to decide what is the
morally "correct" way to vote pro
xies or to buy or sell stocks. This is
particularly difficult considering the
diversity of opinion that can arise
within the University community on
any issue.
For this reason, the University
should abstain on all votes for which
it cannot formulate an opinion. It
should not, as the 1971 statement
suggests, "vote proxies for manage
ment on routine matters." If the Uni
versity has no opinion, it should vote
"no opinion," not in favor of man
agement.
Since the trustees do not have the
time to do research into company ac
tions in which it owns stock or sort
out the opinions of the University
community on investment decision,
it has established the Committee on
Investment Responsibility to per-

form these tasks. This committee
should be entrusted to do the neces
sary background research and opin
ion surveys to make responsible in
vestment policy that adequately re
flects community opinion.
The CIR has not performed these
tasks well in the past as was clearly
shown last spring with the proxy
votes concerning South Africa.
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy ac
quired thousands of signatures on
petitions urging the University to
vote its proxies against corporate in
vestment in South Africa. SCRIP be
lieved that it was supported by a
community consensus and President
Richard Lyman agreed that if it was
possible to show a consensus, SCRIP
had done it. But then this consensus
was callously ignored by the CIR and
the trustees.
Decisions made by the trustees re
flect on Stanford as an institution and
also on all of the people associated
with it. If decisions are made by the
University that are contrary to the
desires of the community, and par
ticularly if these decisions utilize the
resources of the community (its per
sonpower and money), then the
University is acting as a dictatorship.
The CIR ought to have
members comprising all the active
constituencies of the Stanford com
munity: students, faculty, adminis
trators, and employees. The commit
tee should then do its best to solicit
input from alumni and all other in
terested parties.
Once recommendations have
been made by the CIR, they should
be acted on by the trustees. If, in
every important decision, the com
mittee recommendation is ignored,
the CIR is totally useless. The mem
bers will lose interest in doing a good
job and will decide that they can bet
ter convey their views to the trustees
by sitting in the Old Union.
If the trustees decide to vote con
trary to the CIR recommendation,
they should at the very least, provide
a written explanation of their vote
with all the criteria that they used in
making their decision clearly spelled
out.

endowment so as to maximize the
financial return on those resources."
This sentence establishes the tone
for the whole statement. As I underv
stand it, trust law only demands a
"reasonable return." But more to the
point, this sentence is fundamentally
wrong.
Stanford University was not estab
lished as a trust fund, with a primary
aim of increasing its wealth. Stan
ford is a university, dedicated to
education. Its primary goal is to its
students. As an institution it should
strive for implementation of these
truths, even the difficult-to-quantify
moral truths.
If it is worth teaching to students, it
is worth actually implementing.
Furthermore, as a major, prestigious
university, Stanford substantially af
fects the moral stance of the nation.
The world watches what Stanford
does, and often follows suit.
If, in its financial concerns, the
University puts away moral concerns

and only seeks to maximize monet
ary return, it denies these truths that
it teaches. Finances should be com
pletely secondary to the duties that
Stanford has as a moral agent in soci
ety. Only when the viability of the
institution is jeopardized should fi
nancial concerns be allowed to take
precedence.
As it is pointed out in the 1971
statement, it is virtually impossible to
monitor all the companies in which
the University owns or might own
stock, and then to decide what is the
morally "correct" way to vote pro
xies or to buy or sell stocks. This is
particularly difficult considering the
diversity of opinion that can arise
within the University community on
any issue.
For this reason, the University
should abstain on all votes for which
it cannot formulate an opinion. It
should not, as the 1971 statement
suggests, "vote proxies for manage
ment on routine matters." If the Uni
versity has no opinion, it should vote
"no opinion," not in favor of man
agement.
Since the trustees do not have the
time to do research into company ac
tions in which it owns stock or sort
out the opinions of the University
community on investment decision,
it has established the Committee on
Investment Responsibility to per-

form these tasks. This committee
should be entrusted to do the neces
sary background research and opin
ion surveys to make responsible in
vestment policy that adequately re
flects community opinion.
The CIR has not performed these
tasks well in the past as was clearly
shown last spring with the proxy
votes concerning South Africa.
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy ac
quired thousands of signatures on
petitions urging the University to
vote its proxies against corporate in
vestment in South Africa. SCRIP be
lieved that it was supported by a
community consensus and President
Richard Lyman agreed that if it was
possible to show a consensus, SCRIP
had done it. But then this consensus
was callously ignored by the CIR and
the trustees.
Decisions made by the trustees re
flect on Stanford as an institution and
also on all of the people associated
with it. If decisions are made by the
University that are contrary to the
desires of the community, and par
ticularly if these decisions utilize the
resources of the community (its per
sonpower and money), then the
University is acting as a dictatorship.
The CIR ought to have
members comprising all the active
constituencies of the Stanford com
munity: students, faculty, adminis
trators, and employees. The commit
tee should then do its best to solicit
input from alumni and all other in
terested parties.
Once recommendations have
been made by the CIR, they should
be acted on by the trustees. If, in
every important decision, the com
mittee recommendation is ignored,
the CIR is totally useless. The mem
bers will lose interest in doing a good
job and will decide that they can bet
ter convey their views to the trustees
by sitting in the Old Union.
If the trustees decide to vote con
trary to the CIR recommendation,
they should at the very least, provide
a written explanation of their vote
with all the criteria that they used in
making their decision clearly spelled
out.
