# 'Slap on the hand'
## SOC gets off free

A short time ago, the ASSU Senate
refused to support the creation of an
Elections Review Board. It was only
the reality of a student supported re
call that saw the senate make a
twenty-four hour turn around. Since
then, the ERB formed, met, and ren
dered a decision. Yet, justice has
been sent a step backward. Let's look
at the results.
Two senators are disqualified —
one due to "negligence" and the
other for failure to "cooperate
fully;" an alternate senator was put
on one-quarter suspension; and 15
senators and alternates were given a
"slap on the hand" (by means o! cen
sure and reprimand) tor "impeding
the election commission investiga
tion" i.e. cover-up and double stan
dard.
What is the objective lesson
learned? Not only does a dominate
slate virtually get away scot-free with
cover-up, but they gain additional
full senate seats for their slate.
I, for one, don't believe in reward
ing some, ignoring others, and
punishing a few. I believe in equal
justice for all. There should be, as
Thomas Jefferson stated in his tirst
inaugural address, "equal and exact
justice to all men, of whatever state
or persuasion, religious or politi
cal;.... (This principle) should be the
creed of our political taith — the text
of civil instruction — the touchstone
by which to try the service of those
we trust; and should we wander
trom (it) in moments of error or
alarm, let us hasten to retrace our
steps and to regain the road which
alone leads to peace, liberty, and
satety."
The ERB, and thus the students as a
whole, have clearly wandered from
principle. This double standard is not
only an injustice to those disqual
ified, but an injustice to each and
every student well. Thus, we must
"retrace our steps." There are two
basic paths to take;
1) The senators themselves can
take action to correct the injustice.
Those senators censured can resign
and those reprimanded can voluntar
ily suspend themselves for one quar
ter (as others were torced to do by
the ERB); or
2) We, the students, will be torced
to seek justice by constitutional
means available to us.
I preter the former path. For the
time being, the choice is up to the
Stanford Organizing Committee
members involved. It is up to them to
act in accordance with their cam
paign promises to honestly and
openly represent the students. It is
up to them to accept responsibility
for their actions. Ultimately, how-

ever, it is up to the students to be
informed and be active "watchdogs"
of government.
Will the SOC continue this cover
up? Will the SOC take the responsi
bility for their actions? These are
questions that I cannot answer. I can
point out however, that with every
freedom comes an equal responsibil
ity to that freedom, and that elected
representatives bear a responsibility
to the electorate.
