# Dangerous precedent set
## ERB's decisions biased, unfair 
### 
Wohl, DeLeers

As two politically aware students
who have followed the proceedings
involved with the election and seat
ing of this year's ASSU Senate, we are
compelled to comment on the gross
hypocrisy and dangerous precedent
that have arisen from Thursday
night's decisions.
During the senate campaign we
read all the candidates' official litera
ture, we read the blue flyer, and we
read the yellow insert. After the elec
tion, as charges of irregularities sur
faced, we made it our business to
attend all the senate meetings and to
read all the pertinent information
published in the Daily and distri
buted at the senate meetings.
Even though three out of four ot
the Council of Presidents have been
quoted as being sympathetic to the
Stanford Organizing Committe, and
even though SOC slate members
comprise a heavy majority of the se
nate, we felt certain, given the stu
dent body's dismal opinion of the
ASSU Senate, that the greatest ot
care would be taken to ensure that
any eventual decisions would be in
arguably tair.
This was not the case. Affecting an
image of impartiality, the SOC-COP
searched for, found, and nominated
the members of an Elections Review
Board who were all subsequently
confirmed by the SOC-Senate. This
ERB, after six days of review, arrived
at decisions that not only frustrated
this goal of fairness, but also re
flected the ERB's political origins.
The central injustice of the board's
decisions was the application of ex
post facto election rules to the recent
campaign. By subjectively reading
between the lines of the existing
election bylaws, the ERB mandated

the following as offenses against the
Stanford community: inadequate
communication within a slate, tailure
to cooperate "fully and openly" with
the elections commissioner (in what
most observers agree were his highly
irregular pre-election investigatory
tactics), lying to the elections com
missioner, and failure to cooperate
with the ERB.
In their verdict, the ERB found that
both Dan Livingston and the under
graduate SOC slate had not cooper
ated with the elections commis
sioner, and that five out ot six
graduate SOC slate members had
not cooperated with the ERB itselt.
Conviction under ex post facto
laws is in itself contrary to the stan
dards of American justice; but, more
chilling is the clear political bent ot
the punishment meted out. Dan
Livingston was disqualified. No SOC
slate members were disqualified.
The SOC thus strengthens its grip on
the senate by ridding itself of its
major ideological opponent.
Though the immediate effect of
these decisions is to stain this year's

senate, the long-term implications
bode ill tor senates to come. A
dangerous precedent has been set:
through the creation ot ex post facto
laws, an ideological group in the
majority can overpower the minority
and leave them with no avenue of
appeal.
just betore adjournment, the new
senate subjected us to the ultimate
hypocrisy. Its first resolution was to
deny that the ERB's final action in any
way reflected upon the integrity ol
the convicted.
The SOC's own Senator Don
Moonshine openly confirmed the
inherent hypocrisy ot this group,
which calls itselt non-political. He
summed up the perverse methodol
ogy of an organization which advo
cates social change through "demo
cracy by the people," yet uses the
odious concept of the political
machine to accomplish it:"I was
elected on a political slate â€” I can't
even approve of anyone tor a com
mittee until I know what their politics
are."
