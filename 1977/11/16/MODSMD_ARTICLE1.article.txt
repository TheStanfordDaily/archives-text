# Shah's arrival draws protests in Washington, San Francisco

### 
Washington (AP) — The Shah of
Iran was greeted at the White House
by a 21-gun salute and the sting of
tear gas yesterday as rival groups of
demonstrators clashed near the pres
idential gates in the capital's largest
and bloodiest street protest since the
end of the Vietnam war.
President jimmy Carter, his wife
Rosalynn, the Shah and Empress
Farah forged coolly through formal
welcoming ceremonies on the south
lawn of the White House despite the
raucous disturbance within earshot
and a cloud of tear gas that per
meated the offices of the mansion
and surrounding buildings.
At least 20 police officers and 86
demonstrators from among
thousands of both supporters and
critics of the shah were injured in a
melee, which erupted on the Ellipse
just south of the White House, as the
Iranian leader arrived via helicopter.

A dozen persons were arrested,
two for assault on a police officer and
the others for disorderly conduct.
San Francisco march
Meanwhile, a march through the
heart of San Francisco's government
and financial centers by some 2000
opponents of the Shah of Iran's U.S.
visit culminated in a noisy and
feverish rally in front of the Iranian
consulate.
The marchers, protesting
"tyranny" and "American im
perialism" in Iran, shouted slogans
in unison through megaphones and
waved banners during the
walk depicting the shah as a puppet
manipulated by Carter.
There were no violent confronta
tions in San Francisco, however.
Some 30 helmeted riot police, carry
ing nightsticks, protected the
ground floor mall in the building
housing the consulate.

Many of the marchers wore paper
masks on which were printed "Down
with the Shah." Two demonstrators
walked arm-in-arm wearing papier
mache masks of the shah and Carter.
An effigy of the shah was burned in
front of the consulate.
President gassed
Back in Washington, President
Carter dabbed his eyes with his
thumb, and the shah used a silk
handkerchief as they exchanged
words of greeting and friendship be
fore heading inside the White House
for private talks. Carter apologized
for "the temporary air pollution in
Washington" as the shah presented
him with a tapestry portrait of
George Washington.
After the shah and empress re
turned to the White House last night
for a lavish state dinner, the de
monstrators across the street from
the executive mansion ended their
day-long protest, vowing to return
today.
"There's one thing I have to say
about the shah," Carter said in an
after-dinner toast. "He sure knows
how to draw a crowd."
Most of the injuries to de
monstrators and police did not ap
pear serious, though a hospital
spokesman declared, "We've got a
lot of bloody faces."
One older man, however, was
taken to surgery with a fractured
skull and was described as in serious
condition.
