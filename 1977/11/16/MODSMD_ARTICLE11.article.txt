# Forum focuses on concerns of women
## 
### 
Cohn, O'Rourke

The national International Wo
men's Year Conference in Houston,
Nov. 18-21, is a government
sponsored forum which will propose
legislative guidelines to Congress on
issues of concern to women.
This confernce will be a potentially
explosive battleground for such
heated, vital issues as: the Equal
Rights Amendment, women's repro
ductive rights, lesbian civil rights,
and legislation for comprehensive
employment and childcare prog
rams.
Forty thousand women are ex
pected to be in Houston next

weekend. Diverse backgrounds are
represented: from the migrant
farmer to the ex-regent, from lesbian
activists to Mormon church-goers,
from Stanford students to the wife of
the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan.
Among the 2200 delegates elected
at State Women's Meetings, 64.5 per
cent are caucasian, 17.2 per cent are
black, 8.3 per cent are Hispanic, 2.7
per cent are Asian American and 3.4
per are native American.
Twenty-three per cent list them
selves as low income; 14 per cent in
dicated high incomes (over $20,000).

While we recognize this diversity
as a commendable facet of the
democratic process, we anticipate
the head-on confrontation between
progressive groups and the new right
wing backlash.
Right wing
This group of right wing delegates
is very organized and well-financed.
The backlash they encourage is real
and potent. Equal rights forwomen is
not yet a part of our constitution;
there is very little time left to have the
ERA ratified in three more states. Gay
teachers are being denied their jobs;
lesbian mothers are' being denied
their children. Federal funding of
Medicare abortions for poor women
has halted; soon many states will try
to rescind state aid as well. Countless
women are undergoing forced
sterilization in a country priding it
self for human rights.
If the resolutions passed in Houston
come out against equal rights for
women, against lesbian rights,
against each woman's right to con
trol her own reproductive system,
and against meeting the needs of
disabled and Third World women,
then the monumental achievements
of the women's movement in the late
'60s and early '70s will have suffered a
devastating setback.
We support the National Plan of
Action, which is the proposed
agenda for the conference, although
it is not as comprehensive as the
) California State Plan. The national

plan includes any resolutions which
were proposed by at least 10 states,
and serves as an effective way to get
the most essential resolutions rec
ognized and past right-wing par
liamentary stall tactics.
Joined local coalition
We have also joined the Northern
California IWY Support Coalition in
their efforts to send poor, feminist,
Third World, disabled and lesbian
women to the IWY conference.
Their platform of non-negotiable
points of unity are the following:
ratification of the ERA, reproductive
rights for women including abortion
on request and the elimination of
forced sterilization, legislative pro
tection for gay rights, child care cen
ters financially accessible to all wo
men and a commitment to meet the
needs of disabled and Third World
women.
We can't overemphasize the his
torical significance of this confer
ence. We are two Stanford students
who have chosen to attend this con
ference as an expression of our
commitment to the women's move
ment. We concourage you to follow
these events in the media, reflect on
the accuracy of the media's presenta
tion, write your legislators your
views on these issues, and convince
others to do the same.

not yet a part of our constitution;
there is very little time left to have the
ERA ratified in three more states. Gay
teachers are being denied their jobs;
lesbian mothers are' being denied
their children. Federal funding of
Medicare abortions for poor women
has halted; soon many states will try
to rescind state aid as well. Countless
women are undergoing forced
sterilization in a country priding it
self for human rights.
If the resolutions passed in Houston
come out against equal rights for
women, against lesbian rights,
against each woman's right to con
trol her own reproductive system,
and against meeting the needs of
disabled and Third World women,
then the monumental achievements
of the women's movement in the late
'60s and early '70s will have suffered a
devastating setback.
We support the National Plan of
Action, which is the proposed
agenda for the conference, although
it is not as comprehensive as the
) California State Plan. The national

plan includes any resolutions which
were proposed by at least 10 states,
and serves as an effective way to get
the most essential resolutions rec
ognized and past right-wing par
liamentary stall tactics.
Joined local coalition
We have also joined the Northern
California IWY Support Coalition in
their efforts to send poor, feminist,
Third World, disabled and lesbian
women to the IWY conference.
Their platform of non-negotiable
points of unity are the following:
ratification of the ERA, reproductive
rights for women including abortion
on request and the elimination of
forced sterilization, legislative pro
tection for gay rights, child care cen
ters financially accessible to all wo
men and a commitment to meet the
needs of disabled and Third World
women.
We can't overemphasize the his
torical significance of this confer
ence. We are two Stanford students
who have chosen to attend this con
ference as an expression of our
commitment to the women's move
ment. We concourage you to follow
these events in the media, reflect on
the accuracy of the media's presenta
tion, write your legislators your
views on these issues, and convince
others to do the same.

The national International Wo
men's Year Conference in Houston,
Nov. 18-21, is a government
sponsored forum which will propose
legislative guidelines to Congress on
issues of concern to women.
This confernce will be a potentially
explosive battleground for such
heated, vital issues as: the Equal
Rights Amendment, women's repro
ductive rights, lesbian civil rights,
and legislation for comprehensive
employment and childcare prog
rams.
Forty thousand women are ex
pected to be in Houston next

weekend. Diverse backgrounds are
represented: from the migrant
farmer to the ex-regent, from lesbian
activists to Mormon church-goers,
from Stanford students to the wife of
the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan.
Among the 2200 delegates elected
at State Women's Meetings, 64.5 per
cent are caucasian, 17.2 per cent are
black, 8.3 per cent are Hispanic, 2.7
per cent are Asian American and 3.4
per are native American.
Twenty-three per cent list them
selves as low income; 14 per cent in
dicated high incomes (over $20,000).

While we recognize this diversity
as a commendable facet of the
democratic process, we anticipate
the head-on confrontation between
progressive groups and the new right
wing backlash.
Right wing
This group of right wing delegates
is very organized and well-financed.
The backlash they encourage is real
and potent. Equal rights forwomen is
not yet a part of our constitution;
there is very little time left to have the
ERA ratified in three more states. Gay
teachers are being denied their jobs;
lesbian mothers are' being denied
their children. Federal funding of
