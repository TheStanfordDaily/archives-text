Nabti talk
When Michel Nabti spoke on
Lebanon and the Middle East at the
Bechtel International Center Nov. 2,
he was introduced as Stanford's
foremost authority on Mid-Eastern
Affairs. If it is Nabti whom Stanford
consults for information, counsel
and wisdom on the Mid-East, I feel
the students and the University at
large are being misled and misin
formed.
I found his talk biased, full of un
truths, unsubstantiated allegations
and one of the most anti-Israel talks
anyone could hope to hear. As a
member of Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, I de
plore the fact that Nabti was spon
sored by my organization!

ASSU Lecture Notes
We are writing in regards to the
covers of the ASSU Lecture Notes,
especially the covers for the weeks of
Oct. 17-21 and Nov. 7-11.
The cover for Oct. 17-21 depicts a
woman on a bicycle about to be
grabbed from behind by a hairy
man's arm sticking out of a passing
volkswagon. The stereotypes of
women as a sex object and man as a
constant, indiscriminate aggressor
are demeaning to both men and
women. Especially ironic is that the
notes cover classes which occurred
during Women's Week, a week de
signed, among other things, to
heighten awareness of the negative
consequences of sex role
stereotypes.
The Nov. 7-11 cover shows a
woman on the toilet scribbling graf
fiti while one stall away a custodiun is
scrubbing the wall. This cover is gen
erally tasteless and would be regard
less of the sex of the person on the
toilet. However, in light of the other

covers, the fact that the artist has
chosen a woman continues to evi
dence his negative view of them.
People buy the ASSU Lecture
Notes for their content,not theircov
ers. They buy them in advance and
realistically cannot boycott them to
show their displeasure at the covers.
In light of this and because the notes
serve a diverse community, we feel
that the manager of the lecture notes
has a responsibility to be non-sexist
as well as non-racist and generally
non-disgusting. Covers such as the
ones described above certainly do
not enhance the lecture notes.

In a series of three articles appear
ing in the Daily (Nov. 8, 9 and 11),
Prof. Judy Wubnig of Canada at
tempts to provide a philosophical
justification for racism. What her ar
ticles amount to are thinly veiled ver
sions of "benign neglect." Wubnig
constructs a theoretical tent in which
to shelter herself from the racial
realities that have plagued our soci
ety. What Wubnig doesn't realize is
that her tent has several holes and
exposure is inevitable.
Wubnig argues that affirmative ac
tion is based on a confused notion of
compensation. The essence of this
argument is that compensation of
blacks in general does nothing for
particular blacks who have suffered
from discrimination in the past.
Wubnig must be ignorant of the so
cial realities of America to think that
the condition of contemporary
blacks has no rational relationship to
previous discrimination and almost
250 years of involuntary servitude.
Nowhere does Wubnig offer a sol
ution to racial inequality. She seems
to be saying that if we ignore the
problem, it might go away. The prob

lem will not magically disappear. If
questions regarding inequality re
main unaddressed, the only magic
we will see is the magic that hit De
troit, Newark and Watts in the 19605.

Bicycle Safety
I read with interest and concern
Barry Bakin's letter (Daily, Nov. 15).
For the past two or three weeks,
we've been mulling over the idea of
Tresidder's sponsoring a bicycle
safety campaign, and have had one
meeting with a representative of
Police Services on the subject.
Ironically, during the past week,
there have been two bike accidents
on campus that we know of (and I
myself had a near miss on the way
home the other evening, when a per
son clad totally in black or navy blue,
with no lights or reflectors on his/her
bike, ran a stop sign and crossed my
path as I was starting into the interse
ction. Fortunately, my headlights
caught him/her before my front
bumper did.)
In short, we couldn't agree more
with Barry Bakin on the need for
something to be done about bicycle
safety on campus. We would like to
begin now to work on such a prog
ram, and would welcome the sup
port and assistance of anyone on
campus who is concerned with this
problem.
We have scheduled an open meet
ing at noon Tuesday, November 22,
in Tresidder room 132, and sincerely
hope that anyone who has some
thing to say will be there. Since it is
during the lunch hour, brown
baggers are more than welcome, and
coffee and tea will be provided cour
tesy of Tresidder.

ASSU Lecture Notes
We are writing in regards to the
covers of the ASSU Lecture Notes,
especially the covers for the weeks of
Oct. 17-21 and Nov. 7-11.
The cover for Oct. 17-21 depicts a
woman on a bicycle about to be
grabbed from behind by a hairy
man's arm sticking out of a passing
volkswagon. The stereotypes of
women as a sex object and man as a
constant, indiscriminate aggressor
are demeaning to both men and
women. Especially ironic is that the
notes cover classes which occurred
during Women's Week, a week de
signed, among other things, to
heighten awareness of the negative
consequences of sex role
stereotypes.
The Nov. 7-11 cover shows a
woman on the toilet scribbling graf
fiti while one stall away a custodiun is
scrubbing the wall. This cover is gen
erally tasteless and would be regard
less of the sex of the person on the
toilet. However, in light of the other

covers, the fact that the artist has
chosen a woman continues to evi
dence his negative view of them.
People buy the ASSU Lecture
Notes for their content,not theircov
ers. They buy them in advance and
realistically cannot boycott them to
show their displeasure at the covers.
In light of this and because the notes
serve a diverse community, we feel
that the manager of the lecture notes
has a responsibility to be non-sexist
as well as non-racist and generally
non-disgusting. Covers such as the
ones described above certainly do
not enhance the lecture notes.

In a series of three articles appear
ing in the Daily (Nov. 8, 9 and 11),
Prof. Judy Wubnig of Canada at
tempts to provide a philosophical
justification for racism. What her ar
ticles amount to are thinly veiled ver
sions of "benign neglect." Wubnig
constructs a theoretical tent in which
to shelter herself from the racial
realities that have plagued our soci
ety. What Wubnig doesn't realize is
that her tent has several holes and
exposure is inevitable.
Wubnig argues that affirmative ac
tion is based on a confused notion of
compensation. The essence of this
argument is that compensation of
blacks in general does nothing for
particular blacks who have suffered
from discrimination in the past.
Wubnig must be ignorant of the so
cial realities of America to think that
the condition of contemporary
blacks has no rational relationship to
previous discrimination and almost
250 years of involuntary servitude.
Nowhere does Wubnig offer a sol
ution to racial inequality. She seems
to be saying that if we ignore the
problem, it might go away. The prob

lem will not magically disappear. If
questions regarding inequality re
main unaddressed, the only magic
we will see is the magic that hit De
troit, Newark and Watts in the 19605.

Bicycle Safety
I read with interest and concern
Barry Bakin's letter (Daily, Nov. 15).
For the past two or three weeks,
we've been mulling over the idea of
Tresidder's sponsoring a bicycle
safety campaign, and have had one
meeting with a representative of
Police Services on the subject.
Ironically, during the past week,
there have been two bike accidents
on campus that we know of (and I
myself had a near miss on the way
home the other evening, when a per
son clad totally in black or navy blue,
with no lights or reflectors on his/her
bike, ran a stop sign and crossed my
path as I was starting into the interse
ction. Fortunately, my headlights
caught him/her before my front
bumper did.)
In short, we couldn't agree more
with Barry Bakin on the need for
something to be done about bicycle
safety on campus. We would like to
begin now to work on such a prog
ram, and would welcome the sup
port and assistance of anyone on
campus who is concerned with this
problem.
We have scheduled an open meet
ing at noon Tuesday, November 22,
in Tresidder room 132, and sincerely
hope that anyone who has some
thing to say will be there. Since it is
during the lunch hour, brown
baggers are more than welcome, and
coffee and tea will be provided cour
tesy of Tresidder.

Nabti talk
When Michel Nabti spoke on
Lebanon and the Middle East at the
Bechtel International Center Nov. 2,
he was introduced as Stanford's
foremost authority on Mid-Eastern
Affairs. If it is Nabti whom Stanford
consults for information, counsel
and wisdom on the Mid-East, I feel
the students and the University at
large are being misled and misin
formed.
I found his talk biased, full of un
truths, unsubstantiated allegations
and one of the most anti-Israel talks
anyone could hope to hear. As a
member of Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, I de
plore the fact that Nabti was spon

during Women's Week, a week de
signed, among other things, to
heighten awareness of the negative
consequences of sex role
stereotypes.
The Nov. 7-11 cover shows a
woman on the toilet scribbling graf
fiti while one stall away a custodiun is
scrubbing the wall. This cover is gen
erally tasteless and would be regard
less of the sex of the person on the
toilet. However, in light of the other

covers, the fact that the artist has
chosen a woman continues to evi
dence his negative view of them.
People buy the ASSU Lecture
Notes for their content,not theircov
ers. They buy them in advance and
realistically cannot boycott them to
show their displeasure at the covers.
In light of this and because the notes
serve a diverse community, we feel
that the manager of the lecture notes
has a responsibility to be non-sexist
as well as non-racist and generally
non-disgusting. Covers such as the
ones described above certainly do
not enhance the lecture notes.

Affirmative action
In a series of three articles appear
ing in the Daily (Nov. 8, 9 and 11),
Prof. Judy Wubnig of Canada at
tempts to provide a philosophical
justification for racism. What her ar
ticles amount to are thinly veiled ver
sions of "benign neglect." Wubnig
constructs a theoretical tent in which
to shelter herself from the racial
realities that have plagued our soci
ety. What Wubnig doesn't realize is
that her tent has several holes and
exposure is inevitable.
Wubnig argues that affirmative ac
tion is based on a confused notion of
compensation. The essence of this
argument is that compensation of
blacks in general does nothing for
particular blacks who have suffered
from discrimination in the past.
Wubnig must be ignorant of the so
cial realities of America to think that
the condition of contemporary
blacks has no rational relationship to
previous discrimination and almost
250 years of involuntary servitude.
Nowhere does Wubnig offer a sol
ution to racial inequality. She seems
to be saying that if we ignore the
problem, it might go away. The prob

lem will not magically disappear. If
questions regarding inequality re
main unaddressed, the only magic
we will see is the magic that hit De
troit, Newark and Watts in the 19605.

Bicycle Safety
I read with interest and concern
Barry Bakin's letter (Daily, Nov. 15).
For the past two or three weeks,
we've been mulling over the idea of
Tresidder's sponsoring a bicycle
safety campaign, and have had one
meeting with a representative of
Police Services on the subject.
Ironically, during the past week,
there have been two bike accidents
on campus that we know of (and I
myself had a near miss on the way
home the other evening, when a per
son clad totally in black or navy blue,
with no lights or reflectors on his/her
bike, ran a stop sign and crossed my
path as I was starting into the interse
ction. Fortunately, my headlights
caught him/her before my front
bumper did.)
In short, we couldn't agree more
with Barry Bakin on the need for
something to be done about bicycle
safety on campus. We would like to
begin now to work on such a prog
ram, and would welcome the sup
port and assistance of anyone on
campus who is concerned with this
problem.
We have scheduled an open meet
ing at noon Tuesday, November 22,
in Tresidder room 132, and sincerely
hope that anyone who has some
thing to say will be there. Since it is
during the lunch hour, brown
baggers are more than welcome, and
coffee and tea will be provided cour
tesy of Tresidder.

Nabti talk
When Michel Nabti spoke on
Lebanon and the Middle East at the
Bechtel International Center Nov. 2,
he was introduced as Stanford's
foremost authority on Mid-Eastern
Affairs. If it is Nabti whom Stanford
consults for information, counsel
and wisdom on the Mid-East, I feel
the students and the University at
large are being misled and misin
formed.
I found his talk biased, full of un
truths, unsubstantiated allegations
and one of the most anti-Israel talks
anyone could hope to hear. As a
member of Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, I de
plore the fact that Nabti was spon
sored by my organization!

ASSU Lecture Notes
We are writing in regards to the
covers of the ASSU Lecture Notes,
especially the covers for the weeks of
Oct. 17-21 and Nov. 7-11.
The cover for Oct. 17-21 depicts a
woman on a bicycle about to be
grabbed from behind by a hairy
man's arm sticking out of a passing
volkswagon. The stereotypes of
women as a sex object and man as a
constant, indiscriminate aggressor
are demeaning to both men and
women. Especially ironic is that the
notes cover classes which occurred
during Women's Week, a week de
signed, among other things, to
heighten awareness of the negative
consequences of sex role
stereotypes.
The Nov. 7-11 cover shows a
