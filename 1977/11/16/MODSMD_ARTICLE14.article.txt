# Card defensive line coach vociferous, respected
## A 						fervid testimony to Mr. Fred von Appen 
### John Nielsen 
Look to the Stanford sideline
during the football game —
notice the large defensive line
coach with the windbreaker
and wad of tobacco. Notice the
relatively inconspicuous way in
which the man carries himself;
then repeat out loud the fol
lowing questions:
—Could this be the man
whose maniacal enthusiasm
and festering wit can be heard
by anyone wandering into a
time zone containing a Stan
ford football practice?
—Could this be the man who
nicknames his players "the
Human Hemorrhoid," and
"Burlunn Skruggs"?
—Is this really "The Baron"?
Isthis really "the growl"? Isthis
the man who spit bv mistake on
coach Bill Walsh's leg?
The answers, in order, are
yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-but-1
wait. It is true that the Fred
vonAppen fits all of the above
descriptions, and it is true that
there are others we must with
hold for lack of euphemistic
expertise.
He is at least a colorful
character, and at most has ter

minal zest. Fred vonAppen is
the type about which features
writers dream.
Still, it would do the Baron a
great injustice if we described
him as nothing more than a
human megaphone. Players
and fellow coaches quickly cite
his technical expertise; anyone
who talks to him notices
eloquence and brains.
He doesn't perform for
people, and he doesn't
overdo. He simply believes
that "you have to try and coach
according to your personality
— if you fabricate a style based
on someone else's nerve end
ings you will not meet with
good results."
We talked to vonAppen re
cently about his style, and
reputation. "I have to coach
with a sense of humor," he
said, "or else it can becomedif
ficult for the players who have
to bust their gluttial group on a
regular basis for me. I believe
that the only way to success in
football is through pure, un
adulterated hard work, and I
try to put some stress on
mechanical know how and
savvy. Still, you must be a

coach with excitement if you
expect that in return."
It seems an excellent
philosophy, and it is well re
ceived. At the beginning of the
season, for example, the Baron
(or "Fred," as the more daring
250 pounders are wont to call
him) decided that his players
would be more comfortable if
they stopped sublimating their
grunts. Accordingly he had
them roar slightly louder than
was humanly possible every
time they moved more than an
inch in any direction.
"He wouldn't take high
growls, either," says defensive
end Dean Wilson, "only
grunts."
VonAppen's instructions
seemed odd to several of the
players, but they did their best.
Before long they were loving it
— so much so that the other
football groups began watch
ing whenever it happened.
"They must have thought we
were dying," said Wilson.
When vonAppen noticed the
disturbance caused by his
groups actions, he had the
noises stopped. He'd made his
point, though — from that

point on his linemen worked
lifo madmen; what's more,
they nearly enjoy it.
"Fred has a tremendous feel
for players," said Geoff
Kieburtz. "For all the noise he
makes he never yells with
malice. And he yells with a
purpose every time. There
aren't any secrets between the
players and the coach, and that
kind of action helps us loosen
up and listen. He knows his
stuff, and he knows himself."

Remember that when you
look at the back of vonAppen
during the game. Do not read
into his movements there a
coldness and detachment. Do
not interpret his actions as
purposeless or mean. The
Baron may be easier to under
stand if he is seen as the man
on the sideline — outthere you
find the brains behind the
mouth that moves the line.
We can't possibly lose.

It seems an excellent
philosophy, and it is well re
ceived. At the beginning of the
season, for example, the Baron
(or "Fred," as the more daring
250 pounders are wont to call
him) decided that his players
would be more comfortable if
they stopped sublimating their
grunts. Accordingly he had
them roar slightly louder than
was humanly possible every
time they moved more than an
inch in any direction.
"He wouldn't take high
growls, either," says defensive
end Dean Wilson, "only
grunts."
VonAppen's instructions
seemed odd to several of the
players, but they did their best.
Before long they were loving it
— so much so that the other
football groups began watch
ing whenever it happened.
"They must have thought we
were dying," said Wilson.
When vonAppen noticed the
disturbance caused by his
groups actions, he had the
noises stopped. He'd made his
point, though — from that

point on his linemen worked
lifo madmen; what's more,
they nearly enjoy it.
"Fred has a tremendous feel
for players," said Geoff
Kieburtz. "For all the noise he
makes he never yells with
malice. And he yells with a
purpose every time. There
aren't any secrets between the
players and the coach, and that
kind of action helps us loosen
up and listen. He knows his
stuff, and he knows himself."

Remember that when you
look at the back of vonAppen
during the game. Do not read
into his movements there a
coldness and detachment. Do
not interpret his actions as
purposeless or mean. The
Baron may be easier to under
stand if he is seen as the man
on the sideline — outthere you
find the brains behind the
mouth that moves the line.
We can't possibly lose.

Look to the Stanford sideline
during the football game —
notice the large defensive line
coach with the windbreaker
and wad of tobacco. Notice the
relatively inconspicuous way in
which the man carries himself;
then repeat out loud the fol
lowing questions:
—Could this be the man
whose maniacal enthusiasm
and festering wit can be heard
by anyone wandering into a
time zone containing a Stan
ford football practice?
—Could this be the man who
nicknames his players "the
Human Hemorrhoid," and
"Burlunn Skruggs"?
—Is this really "The Baron"?
Isthis really "the growl"? Isthis
the man who spit bv mistake on
coach Bill Walsh's leg?
The answers, in order, are
yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-but-1
wait. It is true that the Fred
vonAppen fits all of the above
descriptions, and it is true that
there are others we must with
hold for lack of euphemistic
expertise.
He is at least a colorful
character, and at most has ter

minal zest. Fred vonAppen is
the type about which features
writers dream.
Still, it would do the Baron a
great injustice if we described
him as nothing more than a
human megaphone. Players
and fellow coaches quickly cite
his technical expertise; anyone
who talks to him notices
eloquence and brains.
He doesn't perform for
people, and he doesn't
overdo. He simply believes
that "you have to try and coach
according to your personality
— if you fabricate a style based
on someone else's nerve end
ings you will not meet with
good results."
We talked to vonAppen re
cently about his style, and
reputation. "I have to coach
with a sense of humor," he
said, "or else it can becomedif
ficult for the players who have
to bust their gluttial group on a
regular basis for me. I believe
that the only way to success in
football is through pure, un
adulterated hard work, and I
try to put some stress on
mechanical know how and
savvy. Still, you must be a

coach with excitement if you
expect that in return."

philosophy, and it is well re
ceived. At the beginning of the
