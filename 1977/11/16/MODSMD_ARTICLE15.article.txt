# Cal's White faces tough quarterback choice
## 
### Jay Roach 
What is it that California head coach
Mike White is doing now, that Bill
Walsh has been tempted to do, and that
Jack Christiansen did frequently?
The Quarterback Juggle.
It seems that outstanding quarter
backs don't arrive one at a time, for
either California or Stanford. They ar
rive on the scene in numbers. For Cal
this year, the number is four.
First there is Charlie Young, a junior
who has thrown for 1836 yards this sea
son and who was the eighth ranked
passer in the nation before the Oregon
game.
Then there is Gary Graumann, a smal
ler but apparently more consistent
junior walk-on, who came off the
bench to mount several important scor
ing drives against Missouri and
Washington. He won the starting posi
tion for the Oregon game last weekend
and completed 14 of 24 passes for 195
yards in the Bear's 48-16 victory.
And if those two aren't enough,
another junior, Eric Anderson, and a
freshman, Rich Campbell can both
throw too.
Now if one good quarterback can do
a team some good, then fourgoodQß's
ought to be four times as valuable,
right?

Well . . . no. If John Maynard Keynes
had been a football fan, he could have
explained the problem by citing The
Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
on Great Quarterbacks: only one can
play at a time, and though depth is nice,
each additional star has comparatively
less additional value to the team.
The coach's decision to play one
quarterback and bench the other(s) is
never an easy one, is only sometimes
the right one, and rarely pleases
everyone.
So there is a tendency to juggle. And
juggling on the win-or-fall tightrope of
college football is always interesting,
sometimes dangerous. Ask jack Christ
iansen, who hit the nets the day before
last year's Big Came.
Ask Mike White, who is an old hand
at this act.
"I've learned through the years,"
White said yesterday. "There was a time
when I had Ferragamo and Bartkowski.
I never had any problems, but I didn't
handle that situation as well as the cur
rent one.
White is now convinced that rotating
quarterbacks is a good policy in gen
eral. "A fresh football player with a little
less ability can play at least as well as
one with greater ability who's tired."
Stanford's Bill Walsh is not con

vinced. After Steve Dils' outstanding
performance against UCLA this season,
the question of more playing time for
the reserve quarterback was quickly
answered.
"We have one quarterback at Stan
ford," Walsh said. "If you try to practice
three or four guys, you end up getting
nothing accomplished.
"We do practice the substitutes,"
Walsh continued, "but since 75 per
cent of the work goes to our starter, we
can't be quick to make changes unless
problems arise time after time."
Guy Benjamin gave similar advice. "If
you have two quarterbacks, get rid of
one or designate one as the quarter
back. At least three-quarters of the of
fense's practice time has to go to tha,t
person."
In response to this, White said, "I
agree with that thinking. However,
Gary Graumann didn't get much prac
tice until before the Oregon game and
he still performed. He is one of those
guys who gets a lot of stuff by osmosis."
Graumann is practicing now, how
ever, as White intends to start him
against Stanford Saturday. White
explained how Graumann earned the
starting job.
"After a point, we just decided Gary
Graumann deserved to start because

he's performed well off the bench and
because he'd done a few things better
than Charlie had."
But that doesn't mean Young won't
play Saturday. Against Oregon, he went
in on previously designated series. A
similar strategy will probably be fol
lowed against Stanford.
Why designate the series before the
game? White says there "are just too
many decisions to make during a game,
and substitutions shouldn't be one of
them.
"To make the decision during the
game makes it too easy to renege. If you
make a decision you've got to go with it.
Otherwise, you start talking out of both
sides of your mouth."
There are some obvious parallels be
tween what Mike White is doing now
and what jack Christiansen did in the
last years of his Stanford coaching
career.
White draws some of these himself,
saying, "To give people an opportunity
to play certainly shouldn't be a sin. It
should be looked on as an opportunity
for people to have a positive experi
ence in a great situation.
"I'm just disappointed they didn't
realize it in Jack's (Christiansen) case.
I'm sure my philosophy isn't any diffe
rent than his was."

performance against UCLA this season,
the question of more playing time for
the reserve quarterback was quickly
answered.
"We have one quarterback at Stan
ford," Walsh said. "If you try to practice
three or four guys, you end up getting
nothing accomplished.
"We do practice the substitutes,"
Walsh continued, "but since 75 per
cent of the work goes to our starter, we
can't be quick to make changes unless
problems arise time after time."
Guy Benjamin gave similar advice. "If
you have two quarterbacks, get rid of
one or designate one as the quarter
back. At least three-quarters of the of
fense's practice time has to go to tha,t
person."
In response to this, White said, "I
agree with that thinking. However,
Gary Graumann didn't get much prac
tice until before the Oregon game and
he still performed. He is one of those
guys who gets a lot of stuff by osmosis."
Graumann is practicing now, how
ever, as White intends to start him
against Stanford Saturday. White
explained how Graumann earned the
starting job.
"After a point, we just decided Gary
Graumann deserved to start because

he's performed well off the bench and
because he'd done a few things better
than Charlie had."
But that doesn't mean Young won't
play Saturday. Against Oregon, he went
in on previously designated series. A
similar strategy will probably be fol
lowed against Stanford.
Why designate the series before the
game? White says there "are just too
many decisions to make during a game,
and substitutions shouldn't be one of
them.
"To make the decision during the
game makes it too easy to renege. If you
make a decision you've got to go with it.
Otherwise, you start talking out of both
sides of your mouth."
There are some obvious parallels be
tween what Mike White is doing now
and what jack Christiansen did in the
last years of his Stanford coaching
career.
White draws some of these himself,
saying, "To give people an opportunity
to play certainly shouldn't be a sin. It
should be looked on as an opportunity
for people to have a positive experi
ence in a great situation.
"I'm just disappointed they didn't
realize it in Jack's (Christiansen) case.
I'm sure my philosophy isn't any diffe
rent than his was."
What is it that California head coach
Mike White is doing now, that Bill
Walsh has been tempted to do, and that
Jack Christiansen did frequently?
The Quarterback Juggle.
It seems that outstanding quarter
backs don't arrive one at a time, for
either California or Stanford. They ar
rive on the scene in numbers. For Cal
this year, the number is four.
First there is Charlie Young, a junior
who has thrown for 1836 yards this sea
son and who was the eighth ranked
passer in the nation before the Oregon
game.
Then there is Gary Graumann, a smal
ler but apparently more consistent
junior walk-on, who came off the
bench to mount several important scor
ing drives against Missouri and
Washington. He won the starting posi
tion for the Oregon game last weekend
and completed 14 of 24 passes for 195
yards in the Bear's 48-16 victory.
And if those two aren't enough,
another junior, Eric Anderson, and a
freshman, Rich Campbell can both
throw too.
Now if one good quarterback can do
a team some good, then fourgoodQß's
ought to be four times as valuable,
right?

Well . . . no. If John Maynard Keynes
had been a football fan, he could have
explained the problem by citing The
Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
on Great Quarterbacks: only one can
play at a time, and though depth is nice,
each additional star has comparatively
less additional value to the team.
The coach's decision to play one
quarterback and bench the other(s) is
never an easy one, is only sometimes
the right one, and rarely pleases
everyone.
So there is a tendency to juggle. And
juggling on the win-or-fall tightrope of
college football is always interesting,
sometimes dangerous. Ask jack Christ
iansen, who hit the nets the day before
last year's Big Came.
Ask Mike White, who is an old hand
at this act.
"I've learned through the years,"
White said yesterday. "There was a time
when I had Ferragamo and Bartkowski.
I never had any problems, but I didn't
handle that situation as well as the cur
rent one.
White is now convinced that rotating
quarterbacks is a good policy in gen
eral. "A fresh football player with a little
less ability can play at least as well as
one with greater ability who's tired."

Jack Christiansen did frequently?
The Quarterback Juggle.
It seems that outstanding quarter
backs don't arrive one at a time, for
either California or Stanford. They ar
rive on the scene in numbers. For Cal
this year, the number is four.
First there is Charlie Young, a junior
who has thrown for 1836 yards this sea
son and who was the eighth ranked
passer in the nation before the Oregon
game.
Then there is Gary Graumann, a smal
ler but apparently more consistent
junior walk-on, who came off the
bench to mount several important scor
ing drives against Missouri and
Washington. He won the starting posi
tion for the Oregon game last weekend
and completed 14 of 24 passes for 195
yards in the Bear's 48-16 victory.
And if those two aren't enough,
another junior, Eric Anderson, and a
freshman, Rich Campbell can both
throw too.
Now if one good quarterback can do
a team some good, then fourgoodQß's
ought to be four times as valuable,
right?

Well . . . no. If John Maynard Keynes
had been a football fan, he could have
explained the problem by citing The
Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
on Great Quarterbacks: only one can
play at a time, and though depth is nice,
each additional star has comparatively
less additional value to the team.
The coach's decision to play one
quarterback and bench the other(s) is
never an easy one, is only sometimes
the right one, and rarely pleases
everyone.
So there is a tendency to juggle. And
juggling on the win-or-fall tightrope of
college football is always interesting,
sometimes dangerous. Ask jack Christ
iansen, who hit the nets the day before
last year's Big Came.
Ask Mike White, who is an old hand
at this act.
"I've learned through the years,"
White said yesterday. "There was a time
when I had Ferragamo and Bartkowski.
I never had any problems, but I didn't
handle that situation as well as the cur
rent one.
White is now convinced that rotating
quarterbacks is a good policy in gen
eral. "A fresh football player with a little
less ability can play at least as well as
one with greater ability who's tired."
Stanford's Bill Walsh is not con

vinced. After Steve Dils' outstanding
performance against UCLA this season,
the question of more playing time for
the reserve quarterback was quickly
answered.
"We have one quarterback at Stan
ford," Walsh said. "If you try to practice
three or four guys, you end up getting
nothing accomplished.
"We do practice the substitutes,"
Walsh continued, "but since 75 per
cent of the work goes to our starter, we
can't be quick to make changes unless
problems arise time after time."
Guy Benjamin gave similar advice. "If
you have two quarterbacks, get rid of
one or designate one as the quarter
back. At least three-quarters of the of
fense's practice time has to go to tha,t
person."
In response to this, White said, "I
agree with that thinking. However,
Gary Graumann didn't get much prac
tice until before the Oregon game and
he still performed. He is one of those
guys who gets a lot of stuff by osmosis."
Graumann is practicing now, how
ever, as White intends to start him
against Stanford Saturday. White
explained how Graumann earned the
starting job.
"After a point, we just decided Gary
Graumann deserved to start because

he's performed well off the bench and
because he'd done a few things better
than Charlie had."
But that doesn't mean Young won't
play Saturday. Against Oregon, he went
in on previously designated series. A
similar strategy will probably be fol
lowed against Stanford.
Why designate the series before the
game? White says there "are just too
many decisions to make during a game,
and substitutions shouldn't be one of
them.
"To make the decision during the
game makes it too easy to renege. If you
make a decision you've got to go with it.
Otherwise, you start talking out of both
sides of your mouth."
There are some obvious parallels be
tween what Mike White is doing now
and what jack Christiansen did in the
last years of his Stanford coaching
career.
White draws some of these himself,
saying, "To give people an opportunity
to play certainly shouldn't be a sin. It
should be looked on as an opportunity
for people to have a positive experi
ence in a great situation.
"I'm just disappointed they didn't
realize it in Jack's (Christiansen) case.
I'm sure my philosophy isn't any diffe
rent than his was."
