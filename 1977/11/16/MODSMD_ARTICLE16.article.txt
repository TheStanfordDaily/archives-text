# Cards' ultimate frisbee squad falls to Cal, 6-4
## 
### Alison Smale 
California 6, Stanford 4.
Certainly Stanford suppor
ters hope for a more favorable
outcome in the Big Came
Saturday, but this was how
things turned out in the mini
version of the Stanford-Cal
clash at the California State Ul
timate Frisbee Championships
in San lose Sunday.
Ultimate frisbee, for the un
initiated, is a team version of
that game people used to play
casually in public parks. Op
posing teams stand at opposite
ends of a playing field, one
team hurls the frisbee toward
the other, and both run for it.
Thereafter, the main object in
the ultimate frisbee player's
life is to help his team get the
disk past the goal lines at the
ends of the field.
Stanford was one of 10 col
lege teams taking part in the
championships. Unlike some
others (notably Sonoma and
Santa Barbara) the frisbee
Cards took things lightly.
"Frisbee is fun," said Jo Ash,
one of the eight players who
eventually turned up to flip the
disk through the air for Stan
ford. But, he added, "we're the
epitome of disorganization." It
would seem so â€” Stanford
started the first game with only
six players. Stanford seemed to
have a good time, though, and
ended the day with two wins

and one tie in nine games.
In the same casual way,
some spectators spun their
colored frisbees on their fin
gers or tossed them in the air,
casting only a fleeting glance at
the more serious action on the
field. Despite the relaxed ap
pearance of the long-haired
frisbee freaks on the teams, fai
lure to score was not taken
lightly.
Four-letter expletives
abounded when the Sonoma
team was thwarted in its dash
for the line. The San Jose Cling
On supporters groaned when
their team didn't hold on to the
elusive plastic disk.
But the casual Stanford ap
proach seemed to fit better
with the sun and blue skies,
and the rock music blaring
from "Frisbee Central," the
makeshift headquarters for the
organizers of the champion
ships. "We fly high" is the
Stanford team's motto, and
certainly frisbees weren't the
only things that were soaring in
the air. Spirits were high, too.
All the Stanford players want
others to share in their fun. For
anyone that wants to fly high
with them, there's Frisbee
every Friday afternoon on
Roble Field. "We're develop
ing a cult," said Ash.
Maybe that "cult" can aid the
frisbee-flying Cards in their
next mini-Big Game against
Cal.
