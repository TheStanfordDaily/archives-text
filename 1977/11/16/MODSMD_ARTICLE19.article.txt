Begin asks Sadat to visit Israel
lerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin yesterday formally invited Anwar Sadat to
Israel in response to the Egyptian president's offer
to make sure a trip to try to end the "vicious circle"
that has kept the Middle East at war for three de
cades.
In Cairo, Sadat called the proposed visit, which
would break the Arab taboo against any leader
visiting Israel, a "sacred duty."
Begin told the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
that he had sent the written invitation to Sadat
through the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. A dip
lomatic source said the message had reached
Cairo within three hours of Begin's speech.
The source said the invitation mentioned no
specific date but was phrased along the idea of
"come as soon as you can." He said it was "wel
coming, forthcoming and open."
Begin also invited the leaders of Syria, )ordan
and Lebanon to follow Sadat's visit, reiterating
standing invitations for them to meet him for
peace talks.
Sadat told reporters yesterday at his Barrages
retreat outside of Cairo, where he had received a
U.S. congressional delegation:
"I consider this trip as a sacred duty and that this
vicious circle we are turning around in . . . has to
be broken.
"If I can break it and do not break it, I shall be
questioned about it. . . . Questioned by whom?
By God, and that is why it is sacred."
In Washington, Egyptian Ambassador Ashraf
Ghorbal ruled out any separate peace with Israel
resulting from Sadat's visit. "That is not in the
cards," he said, pointing out that Sadat still insists
on Israel returning all land taken from Syria and
Jordan, as well as from Egypt, in the Six-Day War of
1%7 and on a Palestinian state being set up on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza.

L.A. fire stopped short of Malibu
Los Angeles — Dry desert winds transformed a
smoldering fire in an illegal dump into a wall of
flame that raced toward expensive homes along
the Pacific coastline near Malibu yesterday.
But firefighters from two counties and the state
Department of Forestry said they believed they
had stopped the fire's march about three miles
from the beach.
By late Monday, the flames had burned an esti
mated 2000 acres of dense, highly combustible
brush in the drought-parched Santa Monica
Mountains, a fire official said.
It was the third brush fire in the mountains in
two days.
The new fire began when winds fanned flames
from an untended fire in the illegal dump, said
county fire inspector Dennis Miller.
"The fire in the dump had been burning for
several weeks, and the increased winds blew it out
of control," Miller said
The fire started Monday afternoon at the head of
Topanga Canyon, about 25 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles. It jumped across a small
residential area, Sylvia Park, where three houses,
two outbuildings and a trailer were destroyed, said
county Fire Chief Clyde Bragdon Jr.
HEW says welfare files secure
Washington — The head of the government's
computerized search for welfare cheats insisted
yesterday his sensitive files on millions of Ameri
cans are safe despite a report that the computer
system fails to meet even minimum security stan
dards.
Thomas Morris, inspector general of the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare, made
the assertion after HtW Secretary Joseph Califano
Jr.'s office acknowledged that an investigation
showed "no unit of the department was in com
pliance with the computer security standards that
we established for ourselves."
Morris' office has obtained the personnel files
of about 2.8 million government employes and is

comparing them with state welfare rolls.
Privacy experts have expressed concern in re
cent weeks that the sensitive files could fall into
the wrong hands, possibly subjecting innocent
employes to harrassment, embarrassment or ac
tual harm.
Asked about the implications of the task force
findings for Project Match, Inspector General
Morris issued a statement saying: "Computer
tapes and records being used in Project Match are
subject to a virtually unique security system de
signed to fully protect the privacy of individuals."
Princess Anne gives birth to boy
London — A 7-pound, 9-ounce boy was born
yesterday to Britain's Princess Anne, giving Queen
Elizabeth II her first grandchild and crowning the
queen's Silver jubilee year. But the royal baby,
born a commoner, will be known just as Master
Phillips.
The queen spent half an hour at Anne's bedside,
seeing the baby and chatting with Anne's proud
husband, army Capt. Mark Phillips.
Earlier, champagne flowed, flags were raised
and a 41-gun salute was fired as word reached the
pageantry-loving British public that the baby had
been born at I0:4b a.m.
Both the 27-year-old princess and son were re
ported doing tine in a $100-a-day private room.
Capt. Phillips told a throng of reporters: "She is
very well and the baby is very well."
It was the tirst time in history that an English
monarch's grandchild was born without a title.
The strong-willed princess and husband did not
want traditional courtesy titles passed onto their
children.
The newborn is fifth in the line of succession to
the throne, after the queen's three sons and his
mother. Since any sons born to his three uncles
will take precedence, his chances of becoming
king are remote.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with sunny mild days.
Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs 60s to low 70s.

Begin asks Sadat to visit Israel
lerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin yesterday formally invited Anwar Sadat to
Israel in response to the Egyptian president's offer
to make sure a trip to try to end the "vicious circle"
that has kept the Middle East at war for three de
cades.
In Cairo, Sadat called the proposed visit, which
would break the Arab taboo against any leader
visiting Israel, a "sacred duty."
Begin told the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
that he had sent the written invitation to Sadat
through the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. A dip
lomatic source said the message had reached
Cairo within three hours of Begin's speech.
The source said the invitation mentioned no
specific date but was phrased along the idea of
"come as soon as you can." He said it was "wel
coming, forthcoming and open."
Begin also invited the leaders of Syria, )ordan
and Lebanon to follow Sadat's visit, reiterating
standing invitations for them to meet him for
peace talks.
Sadat told reporters yesterday at his Barrages
retreat outside of Cairo, where he had received a
U.S. congressional delegation:
"I consider this trip as a sacred duty and that this
vicious circle we are turning around in . . . has to
be broken.
"If I can break it and do not break it, I shall be
questioned about it. . . . Questioned by whom?
By God, and that is why it is sacred."
In Washington, Egyptian Ambassador Ashraf
Ghorbal ruled out any separate peace with Israel
resulting from Sadat's visit. "That is not in the
cards," he said, pointing out that Sadat still insists
on Israel returning all land taken from Syria and
Jordan, as well as from Egypt, in the Six-Day War of
1%7 and on a Palestinian state being set up on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza.

L.A. fire stopped short of Malibu
Los Angeles — Dry desert winds transformed a
smoldering fire in an illegal dump into a wall of
flame that raced toward expensive homes along
the Pacific coastline near Malibu yesterday.
But firefighters from two counties and the state
Department of Forestry said they believed they
had stopped the fire's march about three miles
from the beach.
By late Monday, the flames had burned an esti
mated 2000 acres of dense, highly combustible
brush in the drought-parched Santa Monica
Mountains, a fire official said.
It was the third brush fire in the mountains in
two days.
The new fire began when winds fanned flames
from an untended fire in the illegal dump, said
county fire inspector Dennis Miller.
"The fire in the dump had been burning for
several weeks, and the increased winds blew it out
of control," Miller said
The fire started Monday afternoon at the head of
Topanga Canyon, about 25 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles. It jumped across a small
residential area, Sylvia Park, where three houses,
two outbuildings and a trailer were destroyed, said
county Fire Chief Clyde Bragdon Jr.
HEW says welfare files secure
Washington — The head of the government's
computerized search for welfare cheats insisted
yesterday his sensitive files on millions of Ameri
cans are safe despite a report that the computer
system fails to meet even minimum security stan
dards.
Thomas Morris, inspector general of the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare, made
the assertion after HtW Secretary Joseph Califano
Jr.'s office acknowledged that an investigation
showed "no unit of the department was in com
pliance with the computer security standards that
we established for ourselves."
Morris' office has obtained the personnel files
of about 2.8 million government employes and is

comparing them with state welfare rolls.
Privacy experts have expressed concern in re
cent weeks that the sensitive files could fall into
the wrong hands, possibly subjecting innocent
employes to harrassment, embarrassment or ac
tual harm.
Asked about the implications of the task force
findings for Project Match, Inspector General
Morris issued a statement saying: "Computer
tapes and records being used in Project Match are
subject to a virtually unique security system de
signed to fully protect the privacy of individuals."
Princess Anne gives birth to boy
London — A 7-pound, 9-ounce boy was born
yesterday to Britain's Princess Anne, giving Queen
Elizabeth II her first grandchild and crowning the
queen's Silver jubilee year. But the royal baby,
born a commoner, will be known just as Master
Phillips.
The queen spent half an hour at Anne's bedside,
seeing the baby and chatting with Anne's proud
husband, army Capt. Mark Phillips.
Earlier, champagne flowed, flags were raised

Princess Anne gives birth to boy
London — A 7-pound, 9-ounce boy was born
yesterday to Britain's Princess Anne, giving Queen
Elizabeth II her first grandchild and crowning the
queen's Silver jubilee year. But the royal baby,
born a commoner, will be known just as Master
Phillips.
The queen spent half an hour at Anne's bedside,
seeing the baby and chatting with Anne's proud
husband, army Capt. Mark Phillips.
Earlier, champagne flowed, flags were raised
and a 41-gun salute was fired as word reached the
pageantry-loving British public that the baby had
been born at I0:4b a.m.
Both the 27-year-old princess and son were re
ported doing tine in a $100-a-day private room.
Capt. Phillips told a throng of reporters: "She is
very well and the baby is very well."
It was the tirst time in history that an English
monarch's grandchild was born without a title.
The strong-willed princess and husband did not
want traditional courtesy titles passed onto their
children.
The newborn is fifth in the line of succession to
the throne, after the queen's three sons and his
mother. Since any sons born to his three uncles
will take precedence, his chances of becoming
king are remote.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with sunny mild days.
Lows 40s to low 50s. Highs 60s to low 70s.
Begin asks Sadat to visit Israel
lerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin yesterday formally invited Anwar Sadat to
Israel in response to the Egyptian president's offer
to make sure a trip to try to end the "vicious circle"
that has kept the Middle East at war for three de
cades.
In Cairo, Sadat called the proposed visit, which
would break the Arab taboo against any leader
visiting Israel, a "sacred duty."
Begin told the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
that he had sent the written invitation to Sadat
through the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. A dip
lomatic source said the message had reached
Cairo within three hours of Begin's speech.
The source said the invitation mentioned no
specific date but was phrased along the idea of
"come as soon as you can." He said it was "wel
coming, forthcoming and open."
Begin also invited the leaders of Syria, )ordan
and Lebanon to follow Sadat's visit, reiterating
standing invitations for them to meet him for
peace talks.
Sadat told reporters yesterday at his Barrages
retreat outside of Cairo, where he had received a
U.S. congressional delegation:
"I consider this trip as a sacred duty and that this
vicious circle we are turning around in . . . has to
be broken.
"If I can break it and do not break it, I shall be
questioned about it. . . . Questioned by whom?
By God, and that is why it is sacred."
In Washington, Egyptian Ambassador Ashraf
Ghorbal ruled out any separate peace with Israel
resulting from Sadat's visit. "That is not in the
cards," he said, pointing out that Sadat still insists
on Israel returning all land taken from Syria and
Jordan, as well as from Egypt, in the Six-Day War of
1%7 and on a Palestinian state being set up on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza.

L.A. fire stopped short of Malibu
Los Angeles — Dry desert winds transformed a
smoldering fire in an illegal dump into a wall of
flame that raced toward expensive homes along
the Pacific coastline near Malibu yesterday.
But firefighters from two counties and the state
Department of Forestry said they believed they
had stopped the fire's march about three miles
from the beach.
By late Monday, the flames had burned an esti
mated 2000 acres of dense, highly combustible
brush in the drought-parched Santa Monica
Mountains, a fire official said.
It was the third brush fire in the mountains in
two days.
The new fire began when winds fanned flames
from an untended fire in the illegal dump, said
county fire inspector Dennis Miller.
"The fire in the dump had been burning for
several weeks, and the increased winds blew it out
of control," Miller said
The fire started Monday afternoon at the head of
Topanga Canyon, about 25 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles. It jumped across a small
residential area, Sylvia Park, where three houses,
two outbuildings and a trailer were destroyed, said
county Fire Chief Clyde Bragdon Jr.
HEW says welfare files secure
Washington — The head of the government's
computerized search for welfare cheats insisted
yesterday his sensitive files on millions of Ameri
cans are safe despite a report that the computer
system fails to meet even minimum security stan
dards.
Thomas Morris, inspector general of the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare, made
the assertion after HtW Secretary Joseph Califano
Jr.'s office acknowledged that an investigation
showed "no unit of the department was in com
pliance with the computer security standards that
we established for ourselves."
Morris' office has obtained the personnel files
of about 2.8 million government employes and is

comparing them with state welfare rolls.
