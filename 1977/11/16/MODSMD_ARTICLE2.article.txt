### Adrian Tamimi 
Two Paraguayans, the father and
brother of a lecturer in the Spanish
and Portugese Department here,
have been released from an Argenti
nian prison where they have been
held since Oct. 7.
The lecturer, Teresa Faith, said the
U.S. State Department unofficially
informed her Monday of the release
of her father, Epifanio Fleitas, and
brother Epifanio Mendez, from
prison in Resistencia on Nov. 13.
Faith said the two indicated they
were in good health when she spoke
to them at her family home in Buenos
Aires yesterday.
Fleitas, 60, has been active in exile
as one of the principal opponents to
the Stroessner regime in Paraguay
since he fled the country after
Stroessner took power in 1956.
Mendez, a professional photo
grapher, is not very active politically,
Faith said. Probably the only reason
he was arrested is because of their
father's activism, she said.
The two men were arrested in
Buenos Aires without warning, appa
rently after phony charges had been
filed by some low-level Argentinian
officials at the insistance of the
Paraguayan government, Faith said.
The two were later transferred to
Resistencia, near the Paraguayan
border, evidently with the purpose
of extraditing the two to Paraguay,
Faith said. Their family was then in
formed the two men were accused of
being members of the leftist ex
tremist Ejercito Revolucionario del
Pueblo.
The two men were held incom

municado until Faith finally got an
opportunity to speak with them Oct.
31. They indicated at the time they
had been treated well and indicated
they expected to be released soon.
Faith credits the efforts of Rep.
Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park),
Amnesty International, The United
Nations High Commissioner for Re
fugees and the U.S. State Depart
ment with the release of her father
and brother.
In July 1976, Fleitas was arrested
and held briefly in Buenos Aires and
placed in solitary confinement on
false charges, apparently the result
of a bribe by the Paraguayan gov
ernment, Faith said.
The Argentinian government has
promised to be more careful in its
treatment ot Fleitas in future, now
that it is cognizant of the attitude of
the Paraguayan government, she
said.
Faith said she still fears for her
father's life and will continue her ef
forts to persuade him to leave Argen
tina.

ernment, Faith said.
The Argentinian government has
promised to be more careful in its
treatment ot Fleitas in future, now
that it is cognizant of the attitude of
the Paraguayan government, she
said.
Faith said she still fears for her
father's life and will continue her ef
forts to persuade him to leave Argen
tina.
Two Paraguayans, the father and
brother of a lecturer in the Spanish
and Portugese Department here,
have been released from an Argenti
nian prison where they have been
held since Oct. 7.
The lecturer, Teresa Faith, said the
U.S. State Department unofficially
informed her Monday of the release
of her father, Epifanio Fleitas, and
brother Epifanio Mendez, from
prison in Resistencia on Nov. 13.
Faith said the two indicated they
were in good health when she spoke
to them at her family home in Buenos
Aires yesterday.
Fleitas, 60, has been active in exile
as one of the principal opponents to
the Stroessner regime in Paraguay
since he fled the country after
Stroessner took power in 1956.
Mendez, a professional photo
grapher, is not very active politically,
Faith said. Probably the only reason
he was arrested is because of their
father's activism, she said.
The two men were arrested in
Buenos Aires without warning, appa
rently after phony charges had been
filed by some low-level Argentinian
officials at the insistance of the
Paraguayan government, Faith said.
The two were later transferred to
Resistencia, near the Paraguayan
border, evidently with the purpose
of extraditing the two to Paraguay,
Faith said. Their family was then in
formed the two men were accused of
being members of the leftist ex
tremist Ejercito Revolucionario del
Pueblo.
The two men were held incom

municado until Faith finally got an
opportunity to speak with them Oct.
31. They indicated at the time they
had been treated well and indicated
they expected to be released soon.
Faith credits the efforts of Rep.
Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park),
Amnesty International, The United
Nations High Commissioner for Re
fugees and the U.S. State Depart
ment with the release of her father
and brother.
In July 1976, Fleitas was arrested
and held briefly in Buenos Aires and
placed in solitary confinement on
false charges, apparently the result
of a bribe by the Paraguayan gov
ernment, Faith said.
The Argentinian government has
promised to be more careful in its
treatment ot Fleitas in future, now
that it is cognizant of the attitude of
the Paraguayan government, she
said.
Faith said she still fears for her
father's life and will continue her ef
forts to persuade him to leave Argen
tina.
