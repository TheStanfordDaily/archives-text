# Tom Hayden views solar energy

Proposed sweeping legislation to
create a solar energy industry in
California was described yesterday
by Tom Hayden, in the final speech
of the Stanford Energy Action Pro
ject.
Havden is one of the prime movers
behind the California Campaign for
Economic Democracy (CED), which
is working for the creation of a public
solar energy agency in California.
"I believe that solar energy is the
answer to our problems with un
employment, energy and life-style,"
he said.
Hayden's speech focused on what
he described as the "social and
economic crises" centering around
the energy shortage, unemployment
and inflation.
"The cost of energy," he said,
"purely from an economic
standpoint, is going to cause the
economic bankruptcy of this country
in the next 50 years. What we have is
the simultaneous occurrence of un
employment, inflation and very high
costs for very dangerous energy," he
said.
The CED's legislative proposal for a

public solar energy agency in
California, called SolarCal, would al
leviate both energy and economic
problems at once, Hayden said.
"The problem of unemployment is
solved," he said, "by putting tens of
thousands of unemployed to work
manufacturing. nd maintaining solar
panels." The solar energy produced
would be inexpensive and non
inflationary. "Solar energy does not
have to be tied to the existing in
flationary spiral in the cost of fuel,"
he said.
Hayden asserted that the main bar
rier to solar energy is the opposition
of utilities and energy companies,
which have large investments tied up
in nuclear research and fossil fuels.
"The problem is a profit problem,"
he said. "Those companies now in
vesting in (other energy sources)
want those investments to be sec
ured, they want to make their profits
off them."
Hayden suggested that corpora
tions are also opposed to solar
energy in principle because apart
from the initial sale, it is hard to make
money from it; "It's hard to package
sunlight," he observed.

According to Hayden, the SolarCal
proposal would establish an agency
to find out "what it would take over a
10-year period to do the maximum
feasible job of solarization."
If given backing in a referendum,
the agency would sell a bond issue to
provide loans to enable
businessmen and consumers to set
up manufacturing and installation of
solar energy units.
"The loan section," he said,
"would exclude utilities or corpora
tions that had investments in com
peting energy sources."
Hayden emphasized his opposi
tion to the energy giants. "I would
like to keep (the utilities) out of the
market because as far as I can see
they only want to get into the market
to slow it down," he said.
Four small companies
"What I am most worried about are
the corporations that will make solar
collectors in Taiwan and sell them
here," he said. He indicated that Sol
arCal loans would favor small man
ufacturing outfits, and require the
use of in-state labor.
"People will say, 'Isn't that another
