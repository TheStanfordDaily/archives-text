# Archivist on Campus Conference
## Hansen hashes past Big Weeks

"The police wiped the blotter
clean" on the youth charged with
stealing the Cal banner two weeks
ago, according to Ralph Hansen,
University archivist.
Hansen, heard on Campus Con
ference last night, said that the stu
dent's mother told him the banner
had been returned and all charges
dropped.
(The 20-foot Stanford banner sto
len two years ago by the Cal band was
clandestinely returned after an

LSJUMB performance in Palo Alto
last night, according to Band mem
bers.)
The history of pre-game activities
was discussed by Hansen, including
the giant bonfire traditionally spon
sored by the Intra-Fraternity Council.
Although the bonfire was cancel
led this year, Hansen said he felt that
"there will be activities that will take
the place of the bonfire. It was a lot of
fun . . . but they were having prob
lems with non-Stanford people com
ing, and some rather nasty incidents

used to occur."
The blaze "was first built by some
students returning from Berkeley
after a victory in a baseball game." It
turned out to be "so much fun" it
was adopted as an annual Big Game
event.
Asked what other spirit-raising ac
tivities of the past he would like to
see reinstated, Hansen recalled the
"red-hot professor" election, in
which a favorite professor was cho
sen at a penny-a-vote. The money
raised was donated to the Children's
Convalescent Hospital. "I think
that's something that would be nice
to bring back again," he com
mented.
Hansen voiced doubts about the
staying power of cheerleaders at the
football games. "Stanford students
don't react favorably to leadership
on the football field," he said, except
for a red-hot prof who dressed up in
a white lab coat years ago to lead
cheers and received a big response
from the crowd.

The incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) was enthusiastically en
dorsed by Hansen as a major part of
Big Game spirit-raising. "I find it (the
Band) frankly exciting and enjoy it
immensely. I find they add some
thing to Stanford's football games
that no other school can claim," he
said.
Looking back in search of his all
time favorite Big Game, Hansen
stated that he was looking forward to
this Saturday's contest as being the
most memorable, because Stanford
"has never had as well-rounded a
team as it has this year."
He predicted that the Cardinals
would win the game, 27-14.

fun . . . but they were having prob
lems with non-Stanford people com
ing, and some rather nasty incidents

used to occur."
The blaze "was first built by some
students returning from Berkeley
after a victory in a baseball game." It
turned out to be "so much fun" it
was adopted as an annual Big Game
event.
Asked what other spirit-raising ac
tivities of the past he would like to
see reinstated, Hansen recalled the
"red-hot professor" election, in
which a favorite professor was cho
sen at a penny-a-vote. The money
raised was donated to the Children's
Convalescent Hospital. "I think
that's something that would be nice
to bring back again," he com
mented.
Hansen voiced doubts about the
staying power of cheerleaders at the
football games. "Stanford students
don't react favorably to leadership
on the football field," he said, except
for a red-hot prof who dressed up in
a white lab coat years ago to lead
cheers and received a big response
from the crowd.
Worse uniforms
The incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) was enthusiastically en
dorsed by Hansen as a major part of
Big Game spirit-raising. "I find it (the
Band) frankly exciting and enjoy it
immensely. I find they add some
thing to Stanford's football games
that no other school can claim," he
said.
Looking back in search of his all
time favorite Big Game, Hansen
stated that he was looking forward to
this Saturday's contest as being the
most memorable, because Stanford
"has never had as well-rounded a
team as it has this year."
He predicted that the Cardinals
would win the game, 27-14.
"The police wiped the blotter
clean" on the youth charged with
stealing the Cal banner two weeks
ago, according to Ralph Hansen,
University archivist.
Hansen, heard on Campus Con
ference last night, said that the stu
dent's mother told him the banner
had been returned and all charges
dropped.
(The 20-foot Stanford banner sto
len two years ago by the Cal band was
clandestinely returned after an

LSJUMB performance in Palo Alto
last night, according to Band mem
bers.)
The history of pre-game activities
was discussed by Hansen, including
the giant bonfire traditionally spon
sored by the Intra-Fraternity Council.
Although the bonfire was cancel
led this year, Hansen said he felt that
"there will be activities that will take
the place of the bonfire. It was a lot of
fun . . . but they were having prob
lems with non-Stanford people com
ing, and some rather nasty incidents

used to occur."
