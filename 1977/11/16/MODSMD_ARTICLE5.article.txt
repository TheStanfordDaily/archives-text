# CIR calls for maximum financial return on stocks
## 
### Will Nixon 
Tne "primary fiduciary responsibil
ity" of the trustees in managing Stan
ford's endowment is still "to
maximize the financial return on
those resources," according to the
statement submitted to the trustees
today by the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The report continues: when com
pany policies cause "substantial so
cial injury," the trustees shall give
"independent" consideration to this
factor.
Social injury
If a company's actions are found to
cause substantial social injury, the
trustees will be required to vote on
proxy issues rectifying the situation,
the report proposes.
The new statement also sets up
criteria for divestment.
The ad hoc CIR was set up last June
by the trustees in response to a de
mand made by the 294 people ar
rested last May 9 in Old Union.
The ad hoc CIR met nine times; its
report goes to the trustees for dis
cussion at the December trustee
meeting.
This statement represents a step
forward for ethical considerations,
according to an accompanying letter
signed by ad hoc CIR members Nel
son Dong, Rodney Adams and Tully
Friedman.
Comparing the new document to
the statement on investment respon
sibility adopted by the trustees in
1971, the letter says,"The 1971
statement, which was a pioneering
document, was framed in a time
when it was necessary to be defen
sive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited accep
tance. Today, that kind of negative
and tentative tone in the 1971 state
ment is not only unnecessary but in
appropriate."
Representations
The report adds that "the Univer
sity may make formal or informal
representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its
position on proxy issues and on is
sues where no proxy is presented."
The new statement defines social
injury as, "the injurious impact
which the activities of a company are
found to have on consumers,
employes or other persons, particu
larly including activities which frus
trate the enforcement of rules of
domestic or international law in
tended to protect individuals against
deprivation of health, safety or basic
freedoms. . .
Speaking on the "substantial social
injury" criterion for initiating trustee
action, the letter points out, "We
have abandoned the concept of

'substantial consensus within the
Stanford community' because that
concept has proven difficult to de
fine and impossible to assess."
Recommendations
The report recommends that the
University divest itself of holdings in
a company if it finds:
— that a change in the company's
activities could alleviate the social
harm being caused,
— that the University has
exhausted its rights as a shareholder,
— that the company has been
granted "maximum reasonable op
portunity" to change its actions, and
— that "no alleviation of the sub
stantial injury by the company is
likely within a reasonable time."
The new statement would also re
quire the trustees to make a report to
the CIR of their reasoning should
they "decide not to accept a recom
mendation of the CIR."
Student letters
In another letter, written by the
three student members of the ad hoc
CIR (Lloyd Dixon, Anne Henkles and

Ellen Byrne), the report is criticized
for making no provision tor the trus
tees to initiate or cosponsor a proxy
issue.
They explain that proxies are a
shareholder right. "We believe using
this right could be useful to the Uni
versity, which (as we are led to be
lieve) sometimes abstains on resolu
tions for the reason that while agre
eing with the proxy in principle, the
board finds certain language in the
proxy objectionable."
In the third and final letter accom
panying the new statement, ad hoc
CIR member Prof. David Abernethy
wrote, "What has emerged does not
represent a clear victory for the stu
dents, who had far-reaching aspira
tions to change the status quo.
"However, it should definitely not
be considered a defeat for them, or
for the many others whose Spring
Quarter protests against decisions
on South African proxy issues led di
rectly to the formation of the ad hoc
committee."
The new Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility being recom
mended to the trustees would con
sist of one administrator, and two
tull-time staff in addition to the cur
rent CIR, which consists of three stu
dents, three faculty members and
three alumni. One trustee and the
director of finance would also be
non-voting ex-officio members of
the CIR.
Meeting at least twice a quarter
during the academic year, the new
CIR would also have staff and re
search time available to it. Any
member ol the Stanford community
would have the right to submit a writ
ten proposal for inclusion on the
ClR's agenda.
Reports from the CIR will go to the
trustees, the University president,
and the vice president for business
and finance, in addition to being
made public.
The Dong, Adams, Friedman letter
strongly urged that the reports go to
all three recipients "concurrently"
stating, "Our committee noted the
perceived impotence of the present
CIR because its reports and recom
mendations, under the present plan,
may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort
that may have been invested by the
CIR."

Hayden said that whether or not
the SolarCal proposal is approved,
the CED campaign for solar energy
will have a beneficial effect. "This is
the only proposal. . . anyone I know
of has thought of to get a solar indus
try started," he said.
Self-sufficiency
The technology involved is rela
tively simple. He said a small solar
heating unit had been erected in less
than a week by a couple of teenagers
at a CED-run summer camp.
Hayden pointed out that the solar
technology offers greater self
sufficiency to the consumer and the
potential for smaller-scale manufac
turing outfits.
"There are two futures open to
us," Hayden said. "One is a corpo
rate future with continued un
employment, inflation and higher
energy costs, with resultant higher
crime rates and environmental de
terioration.
"The alternative is a future in
which the people have control of
capital and where it is invested; a
future where pollution is drastically
reduced, where institutions are
more in line with human scale and
where people live in harmony with
their environment through solar
power."

The report continues: when com
pany policies cause "substantial so
cial injury," the trustees shall give
"independent" consideration to this
factor.
Social injury
If a company's actions are found to
cause substantial social injury, the
trustees will be required to vote on
proxy issues rectifying the situation,
the report proposes.
The new statement also sets up
criteria for divestment.
The ad hoc CIR was set up last June
by the trustees in response to a de
mand made by the 294 people ar
rested last May 9 in Old Union.
The ad hoc CIR met nine times; its
report goes to the trustees for dis
cussion at the December trustee
meeting.
This statement represents a step
forward for ethical considerations,
according to an accompanying letter
signed by ad hoc CIR members Nel
son Dong, Rodney Adams and Tully
Friedman.
Comparing the new document to
the statement on investment respon
sibility adopted by the trustees in
1971, the letter says,"The 1971
statement, which was a pioneering
document, was framed in a time
when it was necessary to be defen
sive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited accep
tance. Today, that kind of negative
and tentative tone in the 1971 state
ment is not only unnecessary but in
appropriate."
Representations
The report adds that "the Univer
sity may make formal or informal
representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its
position on proxy issues and on is
sues where no proxy is presented."
The new statement defines social
injury as, "the injurious impact
which the activities of a company are
found to have on consumers,
employes or other persons, particu
larly including activities which frus
trate the enforcement of rules of
domestic or international law in
tended to protect individuals against
deprivation of health, safety or basic
freedoms. . .
Speaking on the "substantial social
injury" criterion for initiating trustee
action, the letter points out, "We
have abandoned the concept of

'substantial consensus within the
Stanford community' because that
concept has proven difficult to de
fine and impossible to assess."
Recommendations
The report recommends that the
University divest itself of holdings in
a company if it finds:
— that a change in the company's
activities could alleviate the social
harm being caused,
— that the University has
exhausted its rights as a shareholder,
— that the company has been
granted "maximum reasonable op
portunity" to change its actions, and
— that "no alleviation of the sub
stantial injury by the company is
likely within a reasonable time."
The new statement would also re
quire the trustees to make a report to
the CIR of their reasoning should
they "decide not to accept a recom
mendation of the CIR."
Student letters
In another letter, written by the
three student members of the ad hoc
CIR (Lloyd Dixon, Anne Henkles and

Ellen Byrne), the report is criticized
for making no provision tor the trus
tees to initiate or cosponsor a proxy
issue.
They explain that proxies are a
shareholder right. "We believe using
this right could be useful to the Uni
versity, which (as we are led to be
lieve) sometimes abstains on resolu
tions for the reason that while agre
eing with the proxy in principle, the
board finds certain language in the
proxy objectionable."
In the third and final letter accom
panying the new statement, ad hoc
CIR member Prof. David Abernethy
wrote, "What has emerged does not
represent a clear victory for the stu
dents, who had far-reaching aspira
tions to change the status quo.
"However, it should definitely not
be considered a defeat for them, or
for the many others whose Spring
Quarter protests against decisions
on South African proxy issues led di
rectly to the formation of the ad hoc
committee."
The new Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility being recom
mended to the trustees would con
sist of one administrator, and two
tull-time staff in addition to the cur
rent CIR, which consists of three stu
dents, three faculty members and
three alumni. One trustee and the
director of finance would also be
non-voting ex-officio members of
the CIR.
Meeting at least twice a quarter
during the academic year, the new
CIR would also have staff and re
search time available to it. Any
member ol the Stanford community
would have the right to submit a writ
ten proposal for inclusion on the
ClR's agenda.
Reports from the CIR will go to the
trustees, the University president,
and the vice president for business
and finance, in addition to being
made public.
The Dong, Adams, Friedman letter
strongly urged that the reports go to
all three recipients "concurrently"
stating, "Our committee noted the
perceived impotence of the present
CIR because its reports and recom
mendations, under the present plan,
may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort
that may have been invested by the
CIR."

Hayden said that whether or not
the SolarCal proposal is approved,
the CED campaign for solar energy
will have a beneficial effect. "This is
the only proposal. . . anyone I know
of has thought of to get a solar indus
try started," he said.
Self-sufficiency
The technology involved is rela
tively simple. He said a small solar
heating unit had been erected in less
than a week by a couple of teenagers
at a CED-run summer camp.
Hayden pointed out that the solar
technology offers greater self
sufficiency to the consumer and the
potential for smaller-scale manufac
turing outfits.
"There are two futures open to
us," Hayden said. "One is a corpo
rate future with continued un
employment, inflation and higher
energy costs, with resultant higher
crime rates and environmental de
terioration.
"The alternative is a future in
which the people have control of
capital and where it is invested; a
future where pollution is drastically
reduced, where institutions are
more in line with human scale and
where people live in harmony with
their environment through solar
power."
Tne "primary fiduciary responsibil
ity" of the trustees in managing Stan
ford's endowment is still "to
maximize the financial return on
those resources," according to the
statement submitted to the trustees
today by the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR).

proxy issues rectifying the situation,
the report proposes.
The new statement also sets up
criteria for divestment.
The ad hoc CIR was set up last June
by the trustees in response to a de
mand made by the 294 people ar
rested last May 9 in Old Union.
The ad hoc CIR met nine times; its
report goes to the trustees for dis
cussion at the December trustee
meeting.
This statement represents a step
forward for ethical considerations,
according to an accompanying letter
signed by ad hoc CIR members Nel
son Dong, Rodney Adams and Tully
Friedman.
Comparing the new document to
the statement on investment respon
sibility adopted by the trustees in
1971, the letter says,"The 1971
statement, which was a pioneering
document, was framed in a time
when it was necessary to be defen
sive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited accep
tance. Today, that kind of negative
and tentative tone in the 1971 state
ment is not only unnecessary but in
appropriate."
Representations
The report adds that "the Univer
sity may make formal or informal
representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its
position on proxy issues and on is
sues where no proxy is presented."
The new statement defines social
injury as, "the injurious impact
which the activities of a company are
found to have on consumers,
employes or other persons, particu
larly including activities which frus
trate the enforcement of rules of
domestic or international law in
tended to protect individuals against
deprivation of health, safety or basic
freedoms. . .
Speaking on the "substantial social
injury" criterion for initiating trustee
action, the letter points out, "We
have abandoned the concept of

'substantial consensus within the
Stanford community' because that
concept has proven difficult to de
fine and impossible to assess."
Recommendations
The report recommends that the
University divest itself of holdings in
a company if it finds:
— that a change in the company's
activities could alleviate the social
harm being caused,
— that the University has
exhausted its rights as a shareholder,
— that the company has been
granted "maximum reasonable op
portunity" to change its actions, and
— that "no alleviation of the sub
stantial injury by the company is
likely within a reasonable time."
The new statement would also re
quire the trustees to make a report to
the CIR of their reasoning should
they "decide not to accept a recom
mendation of the CIR."
Student letters
In another letter, written by the
three student members of the ad hoc
CIR (Lloyd Dixon, Anne Henkles and

Ellen Byrne), the report is criticized
for making no provision tor the trus
tees to initiate or cosponsor a proxy
issue.
They explain that proxies are a
shareholder right. "We believe using
this right could be useful to the Uni
versity, which (as we are led to be
lieve) sometimes abstains on resolu
tions for the reason that while agre
eing with the proxy in principle, the
board finds certain language in the
proxy objectionable."
In the third and final letter accom
panying the new statement, ad hoc
CIR member Prof. David Abernethy
wrote, "What has emerged does not
represent a clear victory for the stu
dents, who had far-reaching aspira
tions to change the status quo.
"However, it should definitely not
be considered a defeat for them, or
for the many others whose Spring
Quarter protests against decisions
on South African proxy issues led di
rectly to the formation of the ad hoc
committee."
The new Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility being recom
mended to the trustees would con
sist of one administrator, and two
tull-time staff in addition to the cur
rent CIR, which consists of three stu
dents, three faculty members and
three alumni. One trustee and the
director of finance would also be
non-voting ex-officio members of
the CIR.
Meeting at least twice a quarter
during the academic year, the new
CIR would also have staff and re
search time available to it. Any
member ol the Stanford community
would have the right to submit a writ
ten proposal for inclusion on the
ClR's agenda.
Reports from the CIR will go to the
trustees, the University president,
and the vice president for business
and finance, in addition to being
made public.
The Dong, Adams, Friedman letter
strongly urged that the reports go to
all three recipients "concurrently"
stating, "Our committee noted the
perceived impotence of the present
CIR because its reports and recom
mendations, under the present plan,
may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort
that may have been invested by the
CIR."

Hayden said that whether or not
the SolarCal proposal is approved,
the CED campaign for solar energy
will have a beneficial effect. "This is
the only proposal. . . anyone I know
of has thought of to get a solar indus
try started," he said.
Self-sufficiency
The technology involved is rela
tively simple. He said a small solar
heating unit had been erected in less
than a week by a couple of teenagers
at a CED-run summer camp.
Hayden pointed out that the solar
technology offers greater self
sufficiency to the consumer and the
potential for smaller-scale manufac
turing outfits.
"There are two futures open to
us," Hayden said. "One is a corpo
rate future with continued un
employment, inflation and higher
energy costs, with resultant higher
crime rates and environmental de
terioration.
"The alternative is a future in
which the people have control of
capital and where it is invested; a
future where pollution is drastically
reduced, where institutions are
more in line with human scale and
where people live in harmony with
their environment through solar
power."
Tne "primary fiduciary responsibil
ity" of the trustees in managing Stan
ford's endowment is still "to
maximize the financial return on
those resources," according to the
statement submitted to the trustees
today by the ad hoc Committee on
Investment Responsibility (CIR).
The report continues: when com
pany policies cause "substantial so
cial injury," the trustees shall give
"independent" consideration to this
factor.
