# Blanco calls Carter contradictory on rights
## 
### Juan Zuniga 
President Jimmy Carter has con
tradicted the findings of several
groups regarding the defense of
human rights in Latin America, ac
cording to Hugo Blanco, a Latin
American revolutionary.
Blanco, who spoke to a crowd of
200 in Kresge Auditorium yesterday,
was a leader of peasant movements
in Peru, Argentina and Chile and is
well-known in Latin American re
volutionary circles.
As an example of Carter's con
tradictory stances, Blanco quoted
Terrance Toddman, assistant secret
ary for inter-American affairs, as say
ing that reports of arrests, tortures
and disappearances have gone down
in Uruguay.
Reports by other organizations like
Amnesty International show this
kind of repression have increased,
Blanco said.
Evidence
Blanco said that there is evidence
that in Uruguay today a prisoner may
not be set free unless he pays for the
room and board accrued while held
prisoner.
Blanco criticized the control that
the U.S. has over the economies of
Latin American countries through
the International Monetary Fund in
which U.S. corporate interests

dominate.
"The U.S. has $30 billion invested
in trade, $16 billion in direct invest
ments, and $25 billion in loans, to
Latin American countries," Blanco
said.
"These figures carry more weight
than Carter's smile," he added.
Of his homeland, Peru, Blanco re
called that in the I%os Peru was first
in the world's fish exports, yet
people in Peru suffered trom protein
deficiencies.
Exporter
"In those days, we were left with
the pride of being number one ex
porter, but now we have neither fish
nor pride," he added.
Blanco said Peru's domestic
economy suffers because of the
necessity of borrowing $250 million
to pay the interest on the $4.1 billion
debt Peru already owes to foreign in
vestors.
Blanco asserted that U.S. im
perialism had deep roots in Latin
America, and despite "economic
booms" the people of Latin America
never really shared equally in the
profits generated by foreign inves
tors.
Blanco claimed that U.S. ambas
sadors to Latin American govern
ments discount Carter's human
rights stand, saying it is for internal
consumption only.
"Who is Carter trying to fool? He is
not trying to fool the starving people
of Peru, nor the tortured
Uruguayans. It is the people of the
United States that he is trying to
fool," said Blanco.
"The worst thing that could hap
pen to the corporate interests in
Latin America would be for a con
scious effort by the American public
to act in a direct fashion to protect
the human rights of Latin Ameri
cans," he said.
Blanco was originally banned from
coming to the United States im
mediately after he gained asylum in
Sweden after the 1973 coup in Chile.
Swedish Ambassador Harald
Edelstam made it possible for Blanco
to escape from the Chilean Junta
which allegedly had Blanco on their
"death list" after the coup of 1973
when Salvador Allende's
Democratic-Socialist regime was
toppled.
"It took massive public pressure
demanding our rights which, accord
ing to the Helsinki Accords, says that
publishers and authors have rights to
express their thoughts in other coun
tries," said Barry Fatland of the U.S.
Committee for lustice to Latin
American Political Prisoners.
