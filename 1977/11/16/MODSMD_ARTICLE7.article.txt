# Valid in narrow circumstances
## Death penalty is overused 
### 
Doug Bandow

The death penalty is a polarizing
and emotional issue, which tends to
push people into extreme positions
that are not intellectually satisfying.
Where life is being taken, we should
tread carefully; I personally believe
that the death penalty is valid and
legitimate, but only in certain very
narrow circumstances.
Unfortunately, some of its propo
nents myopically (and literally) seek
to create an "overkill" effect. They
seem to think the death penalty is a
panacea, and is proper punishment
for everyone committing any sort of
killing under any circumstances,
while forgetting the fundamental
principles that should underlie its
imposition. Such an attitude is dis
turbing, both for its philosophical in
adequacy, and for its debilitating ef
fects on the legitimate imposition of
the death penalty.
A good example of this is a case
which the Supreme Court recently
agreed to hear. Lockett v. Ohio
concerns "felony murder" — that is,
a killing which is first degree murder
simply because it was committed
during some other crime (in this
case, an armed robbery). The rule is
ill-considered at best, but its use in
conjunction with the death penalty is
outrageous.
In Lockett v. Ohio, Sandra Lockett
was driving the get-away car for a
pawnshop robbery during which the
proprietor was killed. Since she took
part in the underlying hold-up, she
was convicted of first degree mur
der, and sentenced to death.
Such a sentence is disproportion
ate and barbaric; she bears some
moral responsibility for the killing,
but she should not be held ultimately
responsible for a murder which she
didn't commit, and over which she
had no control.
Is it deserved?
In my opinion, the threshold issue
must be whether the person de
serves it. This stems from the theory
that punishment is justified as a re
turn for a moral evil. Though fre
quently attacked as atavistic, it
should not be forgotten that there
must be a nexus between the crime
and the punishment.
Unbridled utilitarianism would in
flict punishment irrespective of guilt.

as long as a social good was served.
This attitude is repulsive and truly
barbaric; justice is a travesty if
people don't deserve their punish
ment.
Given the severity of capital
punishment, its use should be li
mited to truly egregious cases. There
are some cases where the sanctity of
life is cheapened unless the ultimate
sanction is exacted; in these cases,
the death penalty is an appropriate
and just punishment for cruel and
unusual people. Some people have
implicitly agreed to forfeit their lives
by their egregious transgressions of
basic societal values.
Cases limited
However, these cases are limited.
A necessary element should be an
intentional killing — where the in
tent is premeditated, willful and de
liberated. Some aggravating cir
cumstances should also be required,
before the requisite moral culpability
is present. Premeditated murder is a
horrible crime, but the death penalty
is the ultimate punishment.
The death penalty should be li
mited to cases where the murder was
committed: during the course of a
rape, sexual molestation or kidnap
ping; by a contract killer or previ
ously convicted murderer; as part of
a multiple murder or a real torture
murder; or, for the purpose of
eliminating witnesses.
Even deciding that the death pen
alty is deserved should not be
enough; some additional societal
benefit should be served by its im
position. Such additional utility is
provided by the specific deterrence
of the penalty, that is, deterring the
specific criminal being punished. Ex
ceedingly dangerous criminals must
be severely dealt with, and death re
sults in total incapacitation. The fu
ture risk of some individuals may
simply be too great.
Deterrent effect
There is a substantial debate over
whether the death penalty has any
general deterrent effect. Since it is
doubtful that this controversy will
ever be fully resolved, we must
realize that we are balancing two
risks. The first is that we have need
lessly killed a convicted and deserv
ing murderer, without adding to de-

terrence, and thereby sparing future
victims.
The latter is ili?t we may have
spared the life of a convicted, and
deserving, murderer, thereby cost
ing the lives of future, innocent vic
tims. As long as the criminal deserves
the punishment, I think we should
be more willing to accept the former,
rather than the latter, risk.
However, in the case of Lockett v.
Ohio, discussed earlier, the
threshold issue of "deserving it" is
not even close to being met. Even if
she deserved it, specific deterrence
is not validly served since she didn't
kill this time, and general deterrence
is not served since her activity was so
attenuated from the killing itself.
In short, this case is a great miscar
riage of justice. Proponents of capital
punishment should join with oppo
nents in situations like this, to reform
the law. Such barbaric and dispro
portionate use is not only unjust to
the criminal involved and damaging
to society itself, but it also denigrates
the moral foundation, and utiliza
tion, of the death penalty in cases
where it is justified.

nents myopically (and literally) seek
to create an "overkill" effect. They
seem to think the death penalty is a
panacea, and is proper punishment
for everyone committing any sort of
killing under any circumstances,
while forgetting the fundamental
principles that should underlie its
imposition. Such an attitude is dis
turbing, both for its philosophical in
adequacy, and for its debilitating ef
fects on the legitimate imposition of
the death penalty.
A good example of this is a case
which the Supreme Court recently
agreed to hear. Lockett v. Ohio
concerns "felony murder" — that is,
a killing which is first degree murder
simply because it was committed
during some other crime (in this
case, an armed robbery). The rule is
ill-considered at best, but its use in
conjunction with the death penalty is
outrageous.
In Lockett v. Ohio, Sandra Lockett
was driving the get-away car for a
pawnshop robbery during which the
proprietor was killed. Since she took
part in the underlying hold-up, she
was convicted of first degree mur
der, and sentenced to death.
Such a sentence is disproportion
ate and barbaric; she bears some
moral responsibility for the killing,
but she should not be held ultimately
responsible for a murder which she
didn't commit, and over which she
had no control.
Is it deserved?
In my opinion, the threshold issue
must be whether the person de
serves it. This stems from the theory
that punishment is justified as a re
turn for a moral evil. Though fre
quently attacked as atavistic, it
should not be forgotten that there
must be a nexus between the crime
and the punishment.
Unbridled utilitarianism would in
flict punishment irrespective of guilt.

as long as a social good was served.
This attitude is repulsive and truly
barbaric; justice is a travesty if
people don't deserve their punish
ment.
Given the severity of capital
punishment, its use should be li
mited to truly egregious cases. There
are some cases where the sanctity of
life is cheapened unless the ultimate
sanction is exacted; in these cases,
the death penalty is an appropriate
and just punishment for cruel and
unusual people. Some people have
implicitly agreed to forfeit their lives
by their egregious transgressions of
basic societal values.
Cases limited
However, these cases are limited.
A necessary element should be an
intentional killing — where the in
tent is premeditated, willful and de
liberated. Some aggravating cir
cumstances should also be required,
before the requisite moral culpability
is present. Premeditated murder is a
horrible crime, but the death penalty
is the ultimate punishment.
The death penalty should be li
mited to cases where the murder was
committed: during the course of a
rape, sexual molestation or kidnap
ping; by a contract killer or previ
ously convicted murderer; as part of
a multiple murder or a real torture
murder; or, for the purpose of
eliminating witnesses.
Even deciding that the death pen
alty is deserved should not be
enough; some additional societal
benefit should be served by its im
position. Such additional utility is
provided by the specific deterrence
of the penalty, that is, deterring the
specific criminal being punished. Ex
ceedingly dangerous criminals must
be severely dealt with, and death re
sults in total incapacitation. The fu
ture risk of some individuals may
simply be too great.
Deterrent effect
There is a substantial debate over
whether the death penalty has any
general deterrent effect. Since it is
doubtful that this controversy will
ever be fully resolved, we must
realize that we are balancing two
risks. The first is that we have need
lessly killed a convicted and deserv
ing murderer, without adding to de-

terrence, and thereby sparing future
victims.
The latter is ili?t we may have
spared the life of a convicted, and
deserving, murderer, thereby cost
ing the lives of future, innocent vic
tims. As long as the criminal deserves
the punishment, I think we should
be more willing to accept the former,
rather than the latter, risk.
However, in the case of Lockett v.
Ohio, discussed earlier, the
threshold issue of "deserving it" is
not even close to being met. Even if
she deserved it, specific deterrence
is not validly served since she didn't
kill this time, and general deterrence
is not served since her activity was so
attenuated from the killing itself.
In short, this case is a great miscar
riage of justice. Proponents of capital
punishment should join with oppo
nents in situations like this, to reform
the law. Such barbaric and dispro
portionate use is not only unjust to
the criminal involved and damaging
to society itself, but it also denigrates
the moral foundation, and utiliza
tion, of the death penalty in cases
where it is justified.

The death penalty is a polarizing
and emotional issue, which tends to
push people into extreme positions
that are not intellectually satisfying.
Where life is being taken, we should
tread carefully; I personally believe
that the death penalty is valid and
legitimate, but only in certain very
narrow circumstances.

fects on the legitimate imposition of
the death penalty.
A good example of this is a case
which the Supreme Court recently
agreed to hear. Lockett v. Ohio
concerns "felony murder" — that is,
a killing which is first degree murder
simply because it was committed
during some other crime (in this
case, an armed robbery). The rule is
ill-considered at best, but its use in
conjunction with the death penalty is
outrageous.
In Lockett v. Ohio, Sandra Lockett
was driving the get-away car for a
pawnshop robbery during which the
proprietor was killed. Since she took
part in the underlying hold-up, she
was convicted of first degree mur
der, and sentenced to death.
Such a sentence is disproportion
ate and barbaric; she bears some
moral responsibility for the killing,
but she should not be held ultimately
responsible for a murder which she
didn't commit, and over which she
had no control.
Is it deserved?
In my opinion, the threshold issue
must be whether the person de
serves it. This stems from the theory
that punishment is justified as a re
turn for a moral evil. Though fre
quently attacked as atavistic, it
should not be forgotten that there
must be a nexus between the crime
and the punishment.
Unbridled utilitarianism would in
flict punishment irrespective of guilt.

as long as a social good was served.
This attitude is repulsive and truly
barbaric; justice is a travesty if
people don't deserve their punish
ment.
Given the severity of capital
punishment, its use should be li
mited to truly egregious cases. There
are some cases where the sanctity of
life is cheapened unless the ultimate
sanction is exacted; in these cases,
the death penalty is an appropriate
and just punishment for cruel and
unusual people. Some people have
implicitly agreed to forfeit their lives
by their egregious transgressions of
basic societal values.
Cases limited
However, these cases are limited.
A necessary element should be an
intentional killing — where the in
tent is premeditated, willful and de
liberated. Some aggravating cir
cumstances should also be required,
before the requisite moral culpability
is present. Premeditated murder is a
horrible crime, but the death penalty
is the ultimate punishment.
The death penalty should be li
mited to cases where the murder was
committed: during the course of a
rape, sexual molestation or kidnap
ping; by a contract killer or previ
ously convicted murderer; as part of
a multiple murder or a real torture
murder; or, for the purpose of
eliminating witnesses.
Even deciding that the death pen
alty is deserved should not be
enough; some additional societal
benefit should be served by its im
position. Such additional utility is
provided by the specific deterrence
of the penalty, that is, deterring the
specific criminal being punished. Ex
ceedingly dangerous criminals must
be severely dealt with, and death re
sults in total incapacitation. The fu
ture risk of some individuals may
simply be too great.
Deterrent effect
There is a substantial debate over
whether the death penalty has any
general deterrent effect. Since it is
doubtful that this controversy will
ever be fully resolved, we must
realize that we are balancing two
risks. The first is that we have need
lessly killed a convicted and deserv
ing murderer, without adding to de-

terrence, and thereby sparing future
victims.
The latter is ili?t we may have
spared the life of a convicted, and
deserving, murderer, thereby cost
ing the lives of future, innocent vic
tims. As long as the criminal deserves
the punishment, I think we should
be more willing to accept the former,
rather than the latter, risk.
However, in the case of Lockett v.
Ohio, discussed earlier, the
threshold issue of "deserving it" is
not even close to being met. Even if
she deserved it, specific deterrence
is not validly served since she didn't
kill this time, and general deterrence
is not served since her activity was so
attenuated from the killing itself.
In short, this case is a great miscar
riage of justice. Proponents of capital
punishment should join with oppo
nents in situations like this, to reform
the law. Such barbaric and dispro
portionate use is not only unjust to
the criminal involved and damaging
to society itself, but it also denigrates
the moral foundation, and utiliza
tion, of the death penalty in cases
where it is justified.

The death penalty is a polarizing
and emotional issue, which tends to
push people into extreme positions
that are not intellectually satisfying.
Where life is being taken, we should
tread carefully; I personally believe
that the death penalty is valid and
legitimate, but only in certain very
narrow circumstances.
Unfortunately, some of its propo
nents myopically (and literally) seek
to create an "overkill" effect. They
seem to think the death penalty is a
panacea, and is proper punishment
for everyone committing any sort of
killing under any circumstances,
while forgetting the fundamental
principles that should underlie its
imposition. Such an attitude is dis
turbing, both for its philosophical in
adequacy, and for its debilitating ef
fects on the legitimate imposition of
the death penalty.
