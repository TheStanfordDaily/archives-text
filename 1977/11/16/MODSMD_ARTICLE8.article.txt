## Students need to learn how to learn 
### 
Michel Raoust

Students yawning in class, nerv
ously twitching, chewing their pens,
doodling, or sprawling on a library
table feeling mass all over their
head ... .Students introverted, not
really looking at things nor enjoying
time as it passes by. Dizziness,
headaches ... .There's got to be
something wrong .. .isn't it obvious?
But what? Well, as study seems to be
the common denominator, let's take
a closer look at it.
First, do we have a goal in mind
when we study or do we do it be
cause it's part of a whole process
forced upon ourselves? Coals are
very interesting because one has to
be creative in order to have a goal;
"What will this course enable me to
do?"
And one has to imagine situations
in which one applies what one has
learned and picture an ideal scene
(like "being able to design efficient
windmills") which will be one's goal
for the course.
Now, another thing that we should
do when studying is be very "criti
cal." When given a new idea we
should always ask ourselves: "Have I
seen this happen in life? Does it
make sense? How can I apply this
idea? How can I use it?" Once again it
is a creative process and it requires
that you invest part of yourself into it.
We are used to swallowing huge
amounts of data. So, in order to ba
lance this tremendous inflow we
need to "outflow" in some way by
observing, comparing, and evaluat
ing, thinking of situations in which
these data apply. People go on and

on saying: "Marx has written ...
Freud has said... Prof. Somebody
does it this way.
Let me quote Buddha: "Do not be
lieve something simply on hearsay or
by the faith of traditions just because
they have been in favor for many
generations. Do not believe anything
by the sole authority of masters or
priests. That which you will have ex
perienced, tested, or recognized
yourself as true, that which will con
form your good and others' too, that,
believe it and behave accordingly."
(Mahaparinirvana Sutra for the
reference-minded ones!)
L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scien
tology, in an attempt to understand
why highly educated people could
not apply what they had learned or
did so with low efficiency, disco
vered three basic barriers to study:
The first one is lack of "mass."
Theory without mass can be very
hard on a student. Mass is anything
which has got mass and is related to
the theory. For instance, if you study
airplanes and have never seen one,
you are in bad shape! Pictures can be
a substitute for mass, but if real ob
jects can be provided, it will be far
better.
Mass has to do with doingness. A
balance between theory and signifi
cation should always be kept: always
do as much as you can when you
study or at least have someone give
you many examples of how the
theory can be applied.
You start feeling squashed, bent
and bored while studying? Take pen
cils, bits of wood or paper clips and

demonstrate what you are learning in
two or three dimensions. Get doing
ness balanced with signification! Not
only you will understand more fully,
but you will memorize more easily;
and it will break down your study
automaticities.
The second barrier is skipped gra
dients. Whenever you study or do
something, do it on a gradient scale.
Do step two when you have fully
mastered step one. If you hit too
steep a gradient, confusion occurs
and very often you stay stuck on the
last step thinking it's the source of all
your problems. Well, go back and
find out the simpler thingf you didn't
feel confident doing, or find out the
more basic principles you didn't un
derstand.
The third barrier is by far the most
important one because of its huge
variety of effects. Have you had the
experience of reading a page and not
being able to tell what was in it? Well,
it's because you have gone past a
word that you didn't understand cor
rectly; your attention dropped at that
very instant.
A word is just a carrier wave for a
concept and unless this concept is
not fully grasped the word is misun
derstood. You may think I am only
talking about big words such as
nympholepsy (I like this one),
panegyric, charismatic .. .No! Sim
ple words such as study, understand,
know, or even a, the and for can be
misunderstood.
Now, why has this been un
noticed? Well, in our educational
system, you can get along very well
even if you pile up huge amounts of
misunderstoods. You can set up
mental automaticities which assimi
late and give back data withou you
conceptually knowing these data or
even confronting your books. And
you will still get an A-plus on your
exams. That's what being "bright" is
all about.
I was a bright student until last
year, when I started breaking down
all my automaticities. You can't be
lieve how many simple words I found
that I misunderstood or didn't fully
understand! As I clarified very early
words, whole chunks of data came
back to my memory.
There are schools in the United
States, France, Denmark and Ger
many using Hubbard study technol
ogy, that handle "stupid, hopeless"
children and make them successful
students just by finding and defining
their misunderstood words. So,
whenever an idea seems confused,
look for the misunderstood just be
fore confusion occured. Mental ef
fects involved are blank, washed-

out, not-there feelings, or yawning
as a release of small unconscious
ness.
There are many ways education at
Stanford could be improved. Here
are some recipes which only require
personal involvement and a good
dictionary. Why don't you try them?
Education is too precious to be
wasted.
