# Food and energy — two related crises
## 
### 
Energy plays a key role in the
production of food in modern
industrial societies. During the
past 50 years, American farm
ing has become more and
more mechanized, resulting in
a highly energy-intensive in
dustry. Technological society
has achieved the conversion of a
low-energy, solar-powered

food system into one which
requires nine units of fossil
fuel energy to produce one
unit of food energy. The U.S.
has also tried to implement
similar high-energy systems of
agriculture in developing na
tions, usually benefiting
American multinational corpo
rations and disregarding the
needs of those countries' in
habitants.
More than 16 per cent of U.S.
energy consumption results

from the production, transpor
tation, processing, preparation
and waste of our daily food (to
taling three quadrillion
calories per year). The high
yield system of production
used on American farms de
pends upon petroleum based
technology. The manufacture
of fertilizer accounts for 40 per

cent of the energy used in the
farming industry. The applica
tion of fertilizers and pes
ticides requires fuel to run trac
tors and airplanes. In addition,
energy is consumed in the
manufacturer of this farm
equipment.
Canned, frozen and highly
processed foods have become
the principal items in our diet.
Food is transported to factories
where it is frozen, canned or
refined. These products are

then packaged in aluminum,
paper and glass containers.
Each of these steps adds to the
energy bill paid for our food. At
present the food processing
industry is the fourth largest
energy consumer in the U.S.
In our efforts to "help" the
developing nations we have
tried to export this type of
high-energy technology. This
decade has seen the introduc
tion of high yield varieties of
rice, wheat and other grains in
many impoverished coun
tries. Despite initial increase in
the production of food, these
crops have failed to solve the
problem of famine. Their pro
duction requires fertilizers,
pesticides, machinery and
often irrigation. When the
price of pelroleum products
rose in 1972 and 1973, the de
veloping countries could not
afford to pay tor the energy
necessary to sustain the new
food system. Thus, the poorest
were hurt the most, and it be
came obvious that the "green
revolution" had been up
rooted. Only the rich Western
countries could afford to pro
duce food with its high
technology system at such high
energy prices.
The dependence of our

sustenance on non-renewable
energy sources leaves us at the
mercy of continually increas
ing oil imports, and the fact
that these imports could be
stopped at any time by an oil
embargo. The fact that oil will
in fact run out someday is a
stimulus for us to reconsider
our present food system and
how we relate to that system.
Farmers, especially in the
U.S. and Canada, do not be
lieve they can afford to change
their present production
scheme in the near future. Nor
will the processors, packagers
and transporters of food curtail
their activities as long as con

sumers demand the same
highly processed foods.
Until something impedes
our energy inefficient food sys
tem, however, our best hope is
that consumers will begin the
transition towards a less
energy-intensive system by
demanding fewer processed
and artificially "pretty" foods,
as well as wasting less food.
Stanford students, for exam
ple, waste approximately 10 to
15 per cent of all food pre
pared. This waste increases the
energy required to produce
food from 9 to 11 calories per
consumed calorie.
