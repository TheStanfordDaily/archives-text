# Tom Waits: cutting culture to the bone
## 
### 
The crowd tonight is a
fawning sort. It wears art
fully soiled clothing and old
hats bent at just the right
angle. It laughs at the
warm-up and explodes in
mirth when the lead act
staggers on stage and
squints in an effort to find
the piano. The lead act rec
ognizes it for what it is. He
staggers again, and it
explodes again, completely
ignoring the words to his
song. Being a good sort, the
lead act gives the crowd
what it wants. He plays all
the favorites for all of their
comic value; he staggers off,
and on stage for several en
cores. The crowd loves it,
and plans to stay loyal. Only
later does it realize that the
songs were sad. . .
Tom Waits is becoming
something of a cult-head in
the Bay Area, and his fans
here have put him in a curi
ous position. Some may
enjoy Waits because they
enjoy seeing a grown man
degrade himself on stage in
pseudo-inebriated splen
dor; others may go to his
concerts because he is a
consummate professional.
Some may watch Waits be
cause he seems a perfect
candidate for "Stop Dyp
somania" posters; others
may find sustenance in his
careful, intelligent lyrics.
The result is that there are
two relatively distinct var
ieties of Tom Waits fans in
these parts, with occasion
ally contradictory ideas as
to what constitutes a good
performance.
On his albums Waits has
managed to meet both sets
of demands. First, they al
ways feature the finest
studio musicians in the bus
iness; among others, Shelly
Manne does the drumming
and Pete Christlieb, who is
also featured on Steely
Dan's latest, plays
saxophone. If that's not
enough, the backup or
chestra for his best album
thus far ("Small Change")

included Israel Baker, the
Soloist known until recently
only as the first violinist to
master Schoenberg's violin
concerto on a record.
Further, the albums make
just the right use of Waits'
own musical skills. Al
though he is a fair pianist
and guitarist, his songs are
not designed to show off
anyone's talents at the ex
pense of lyrical coherence.
The music itself summons
old blues nostalgia — rather
than mimicking the
medium they reflect a
• genuine affection for it.
The effect of his records
then^^onsistentl^hree-

dimensional. Waits directs
every facet of his art
(gravelly, dirty voice;
brooding, disheveled de
livery; smart, consistent
tone) toward substantive ef
fect: going beyond the
humor, the dedicated lis
tener is rewarded with the
full irony of the poetry. On
"Eggs and Sausage," for
example, the pungency

comes not so much from
the innocuous laundry-list
dialogue, as from the reali
zation that the narrator is
sitting in an all-night cafe,
and that all he has to live for
is a waitress and her menu.
It is the sort of banter you'd
expect to hear in a Pinter
play; seemingly ridiculous
and secretly pathetic.
\Most of Waits' songs cut
our culture to the bone, yet
they never abandon the
personal immediacy which
keeps such statements from
becoming socio- .
economically shrill. His
songs take as their themes
the sore spots of American
life — his effect is one of
empathy, of close participa
tion. He is dead serious.
Unfortunately this is only
sporadically the Tom Waits
who appears live. His
crowds have shown an in
creasing tendency to ap
preciate parody and carica
ture above all else: Waits
often responds to these
crowds by abandoning the
character on his albums for

that of an unbearably
funny, seemingly satisfied
wino. He tends to forget
about pronouncing the
words correctly, and occa
sionally displays considera
ble talent blowing smoke
rings. Such Waits concerts
are most often seen in large
auditoriums such as Ber
keley's Zellerbach. Though
they are well worth the
while of those who attend,
they inevitably leave many
feeling they have been de
nied more potent stuff. In
concert Waits is potentially
better than he is on his al
bums, for the obvious
reason that in concert he is
there before your eyes.
The question, then, is
finding him a suitable
locale.
Well.
It just so happens that
Tom Waits will be at the
Great American Music Hall
on November 27 and 29. It is
also true that the CAMH is
just about perfect for Waits.
It is comparatively small;
like the Troubador in Los
Angeles it has the kind of
atmosphere which can
bring out the best in Waits.
It would be a good idea,
then, for those who ap
preciate him best to turn
out in full-force.

included Israel Baker, the
Soloist known until recently
only as the first violinist to
master Schoenberg's violin
concerto on a record.
Further, the albums make
just the right use of Waits'
own musical skills. Al
though he is a fair pianist
and guitarist, his songs are
not designed to show off
anyone's talents at the ex
pense of lyrical coherence.
The music itself summons
old blues nostalgia — rather
than mimicking the
medium they reflect a

The effect of his records

dimensional. Waits directs
every facet of his art
(gravelly, dirty voice;
brooding, disheveled de
livery; smart, consistent
tone) toward substantive ef
fect: going beyond the
humor, the dedicated lis
tener is rewarded with the
full irony of the poetry. On
"Eggs and Sausage," for
example, the pungency

comes not so much from
the innocuous laundry-list
dialogue, as from the reali
zation that the narrator is
sitting in an all-night cafe,
and that all he has to live for
is a waitress and her menu.
It is the sort of banter you'd
expect to hear in a Pinter
play; seemingly ridiculous
and secretly pathetic.
\Most of Waits' songs cut
our culture to the bone, yet
they never abandon the
personal immediacy which
keeps such statements from
becoming socio- .
economically shrill. His
songs take as their themes
the sore spots of American
life — his effect is one of
empathy, of close participa
tion. He is dead serious.
Unfortunately this is only
sporadically the Tom Waits
who appears live. His
crowds have shown an in
creasing tendency to ap
preciate parody and carica
ture above all else: Waits
often responds to these
crowds by abandoning the
character on his albums for

that of an unbearably
funny, seemingly satisfied
wino. He tends to forget
about pronouncing the
words correctly, and occa
sionally displays considera
ble talent blowing smoke
rings. Such Waits concerts
are most often seen in large
auditoriums such as Ber
keley's Zellerbach. Though
they are well worth the
while of those who attend,
they inevitably leave many
feeling they have been de
nied more potent stuff. In
concert Waits is potentially
better than he is on his al
bums, for the obvious
reason that in concert he is
there before your eyes.
The question, then, is
finding him a suitable
locale.
Well.
It just so happens that
Tom Waits will be at the
Great American Music Hall
on November 27 and 29. It is
also true that the CAMH is
just about perfect for Waits.
It is comparatively small;
like the Troubador in Los
Angeles it has the kind of
atmosphere which can
bring out the best in Waits.
It would be a good idea,
then, for those who ap
preciate him best to turn
out in full-force.

The crowd tonight is a
fawning sort. It wears art
fully soiled clothing and old
hats bent at just the right
angle. It laughs at the
warm-up and explodes in
mirth when the lead act
staggers on stage and
squints in an effort to find
the piano. The lead act rec
ognizes it for what it is. He
staggers again, and it
explodes again, completely
ignoring the words to his
song. Being a good sort, the
lead act gives the crowd
what it wants. He plays all
the favorites for all of their
comic value; he staggers off,
and on stage for several en
cores. The crowd loves it,
and plans to stay loyal. Only
later does it realize that the
songs were sad. . .
Tom Waits is becoming
something of a cult-head in
the Bay Area, and his fans
here have put him in a curi
ous position. Some may
enjoy Waits because they
enjoy seeing a grown man
degrade himself on stage in
pseudo-inebriated splen
dor; others may go to his
concerts because he is a
consummate professional.
Some may watch Waits be
cause he seems a perfect
candidate for "Stop Dyp
somania" posters; others
may find sustenance in his
careful, intelligent lyrics.
The result is that there are
two relatively distinct var
ieties of Tom Waits fans in
these parts, with occasion
ally contradictory ideas as
to what constitutes a good
performance.
On his albums Waits has
managed to meet both sets
of demands. First, they al
ways feature the finest
studio musicians in the bus
iness; among others, Shelly
Manne does the drumming
and Pete Christlieb, who is
also featured on Steely
Dan's latest, plays
saxophone. If that's not

The crowd tonight is a
fawning sort. It wears art
fully soiled clothing and old
hats bent at just the right
angle. It laughs at the
warm-up and explodes in
mirth when the lead act
staggers on stage and
squints in an effort to find
the piano. The lead act rec
ognizes it for what it is. He
staggers again, and it
explodes again, completely
ignoring the words to his
song. Being a good sort, the
lead act gives the crowd
what it wants. He plays all
the favorites for all of their
comic value; he staggers off,
and on stage for several en
cores. The crowd loves it,
and plans to stay loyal. Only
later does it realize that the
songs were sad. . .
Tom Waits is becoming
something of a cult-head in
the Bay Area, and his fans
here have put him in a curi
ous position. Some may
enjoy Waits because they
enjoy seeing a grown man
degrade himself on stage in
pseudo-inebriated splen
dor; others may go to his
concerts because he is a
consummate professional.
Some may watch Waits be
cause he seems a perfect
candidate for "Stop Dyp
somania" posters; others
may find sustenance in his
careful, intelligent lyrics.
The result is that there are
two relatively distinct var
ieties of Tom Waits fans in
these parts, with occasion
ally contradictory ideas as
to what constitutes a good
performance.
On his albums Waits has
managed to meet both sets
of demands. First, they al
ways feature the finest
studio musicians in the bus
iness; among others, Shelly
Manne does the drumming
and Pete Christlieb, who is
also featured on Steely
Dan's latest, plays
saxophone. If that's not
enough, the backup or
chestra for his best album
thus far ("Small Change")

included Israel Baker, the
Soloist known until recently
only as the first violinist to
master Schoenberg's violin
concerto on a record.
Further, the albums make
just the right use of Waits'
own musical skills. Al
though he is a fair pianist
and guitarist, his songs are
not designed to show off
anyone's talents at the ex
pense of lyrical coherence.
The music itself summons
old blues nostalgia — rather
than mimicking the
medium they reflect a
• genuine affection for it.
The effect of his records
then^^onsistentl^hree-

dimensional. Waits directs
every facet of his art
(gravelly, dirty voice;
brooding, disheveled de
livery; smart, consistent
tone) toward substantive ef
fect: going beyond the
humor, the dedicated lis
tener is rewarded with the
full irony of the poetry. On
"Eggs and Sausage," for
example, the pungency

comes not so much from
the innocuous laundry-list
dialogue, as from the reali
zation that the narrator is
sitting in an all-night cafe,
and that all he has to live for
is a waitress and her menu.
It is the sort of banter you'd
expect to hear in a Pinter
play; seemingly ridiculous
and secretly pathetic.
\Most of Waits' songs cut
our culture to the bone, yet
they never abandon the
personal immediacy which
keeps such statements from
becoming socio- .
economically shrill. His
songs take as their themes
the sore spots of American
life — his effect is one of
empathy, of close participa
tion. He is dead serious.
Unfortunately this is only
sporadically the Tom Waits
who appears live. His
crowds have shown an in
creasing tendency to ap
preciate parody and carica
ture above all else: Waits
often responds to these
crowds by abandoning the
character on his albums for

that of an unbearably
funny, seemingly satisfied
wino. He tends to forget
