# Wallstrom shines in Pacific's 'Firebird'
## 
### 
Sunday was couples' night at
the Pacific Ballet. Program 5 in
the company's fall season con
tains three very different bal
lets, but all three focus on
couples in some way.
"Seasons" is a difficult mod
ern work, performed with im
pressive athleticism and grace
by Deborah Frates, Eva Sarry,
Brian Bullard and Peter Reed.
Choreographer John Pas
qualetti engages the two
couples in complementary pas
de deux set to a modern per
cussive piece by Toru
Takemitsu. The suggestion of
oriental gongs, bells and
drums in the music reinforce
the ceremonial effect of the
dancers' poses. They move to
gether and away from each
other with great stateliness and
tension, stretching their
bodies and the invisible links
between them to the utmost.

Dance

The solemnity of "Seasons"
is followed by another sort of
stateliness in "Air," a premiere
for resident choreographer
Henry Berg. Its mood of up
beat gentleness flows naturally
from the music, the familiar
"Air from Orchestral Suit No.
3" by Bach.
Again, two sets of couples
dance together and apart. The
connection between them is
stronger than in "Seasons."
The four weave the intricate
patterns Berg seems to like so
much. Cay Wallstrom stands
out, as she usually does,
though the ensemble work is
beautiful. The effect is pleasant
and relaxed, like spending an
afternoon drinking tea and
talking with friends about ev
erything in the world.
Relaxation has no place in
Pasqualetti's version of "The
Firebird." This ballet, with
music by Stravinsky, has gone
through three versions before
this. The first two, by Michel
Fokine (1910) and George
Balanchine (1949), tell the Rus
sian folktale of the mythical
Firebird who helps Prince Ivan

save a beautiful princess from
the evil wizard Katchei. The
third, by ballet revolutionary
Maurice Bejart (1970), ignores
the story and uses the exciting
music as a backdrop for the
struggles of a band of young
rebels in blue jeans.
Pasqualetti restores the
legend without undue em
phasis on plot. The Prince and
Princess (Peter Reed, Gay
Wallstrom) meet, fall in love,
are tormented by two evil
spirits, are saved and reunited
by two Firebirds. Again the for
cus is on couples, interacting
privately and collectively
throughout the action All six
characters are equally impor
tant. Even the evil spirits come
back in the end, their colors
changed from blue-and-black
to yellow-and-orange, to
dance with the happy lovers
and the high-spirited Firebirds.
The highlight of this version
is a lovely pas de deux by the
Prince and Princess when they
first met. The music, after a
rousing introductory episode,
is now quiet and languorous.
Wallstron is the image of the
classical ballerina: lovely, per
fectly formed, doll-like and
graceful. Her lack of fire is an
asset or a liability depending
on your taste in princesses.
Plenty of sparks fly out of Peter
Reed as the Prince. If you be
lieve in the opposites attract
theory, their counterpoint
confirms it for you in a most
attractive way.
It's interesting to note here
that the Pacific Ballet does not
suffer from the dearth of good
male dancers that afflicts many
small American companies.
There is an equal number of
outstanding male and female
dancers, and all six men hold
their own on stage with the
seven women currently in the
company. The freedom this al
lows the resident choreog
raphers should not be undere
stimated.
