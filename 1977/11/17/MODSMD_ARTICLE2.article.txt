Iran to seek price freeze on oil
Washington (AP) — The shah of Iran disclosed last
night that his country will seek a price freeze when
the 13-nation OPEC cartel meets next month in Ven
ezuela to decide whether to increase world oil prices.
The shah made the announcement at a news con
ference which wound up his violence-marred state
visit here. Heavy police forces kept rival groups of
Iranian demonstrators from a second day of violent
clashes yesterday as the shah and President )immy
Carter concluded their talks.
Because Iran wields considerable influence within
the oil cartel, the shah's announcement represented
a victory for President Carter's hopes for a price
freeze.
Carter has said that any price increase would be
disruptive to world economic stability, and the shah
said the president's arguments over the past two days
convinced him to change his policy of neutrality in
the upcoming talks.
Only last week, the shah had told interviewers that
Iran would remain neutral on the oil price question at
the Caracas, Venezuela, meeting.
The shah said he would be willing to support a
12-month freeze on prices. The current world price of
oil is about $12.50 per barrel and most other oil pro
ducing states will seek a price increase.
U.S. oil costs expected to rise
Houston (AP) — The price increase expected to be
approved next month by the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will boost the
cost of U.S. gasoline and heating oil by one cent to
three cents per gallon, oil industry officials said yes
terday.
As OPEC prepares for a Dec. 20 meeting in Caracas,
Venezuela, reports from the Middle East indicate that
the 13-nation cartel is planning to impose a price
increase ranging from five to 15 per cent.
Most authorities believe the increase will be five
per cent, reflecting the recent decline in the worth.of
the dollar — the currency with which OPEC members
are paid.
J.C. Burton, general manager for crude oil supply
for the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), said the U.S. price
of gasoline and other refined petroleum products
would increase by one cent per gallon for every five
per cent increase imposed by OPEC.
Inventories of crude oil and refined products are at
record levels, resulting in a short-term glut in the
midst of the nation's long-term energy problems.
Industry officials say the glut has resulted from in
creased production by non-OPEC members, slower
than expected growth in demand, and stockpiling last
spring in advance of an expected price increase in

July by OPEC.
Inherited killer disease identified
Boston (AP) — Researchers say they have disco
vered a disease inherited by some male children that
can turn a common virus into a cause of cancer or
make a killer out of mononucleosis.
The disease, identified at the University of Mas
sachusetts Medical School, is a deficiency that leaves
the body open to a fatal attack by the Epstein-Barr
virus. That germ infects up to 90 per cent of the
population, usually with mild flu-like symptoms. It
also causes mononucleosis, the "kissing disease" of
young adults.
The doctors say that victims of the disease who are
infected by the virus can develop cancer of the lymph
glands, suffer a fatal form of mononucleosis or have a
breakdown of the body's immune defenses. The dis
ease can also cause birth defects, including mal
formed hearts.
Over five generations in one family in Vermont,
researchers found 20 cases of the disease among
brothers, cousins and uncles. Of these, all but five
died from the disorder.
L.A. brush fire finally extinguished
Los Angeles (AP) — Given a break by the wind,
firefighters put out a 1350-acre brush fire yesterday

that had threatened to burn unchecked to the Pacific
Ocean.
Winds were calm as about 700 firefighters halted
the blaze about three miles from the coast and the
expensive beachfront homes in the Malibu area.
After the fire broke out Tuesday in tinder dry hill
sides of the Santa Monica Mountains 30 miles north
west of downtown Los Angeles, fire-officials watched
it blacken hundreds of acres in a few hours and pre
dicted it would burn to the ocean.
Although the flames were out, county fire inspec
tor Dennis Miller said some spots were still smolder
ing and that the fire would not be completely control
led until tomorrow morning — and only if the
weather cooperates.
Bishops dislike easing sex rules
Washington (AP) — Roman Catholic bishops yes
terday condemned a report that urges an easing of
religious rules on sex and concludes that activities
presently forbidden by the church, such as adultery,
premarital sex, homosexuality and masturbation, can
be condoned in some circumstances.
Speaking through their important doctrinal com
mittee, the bishops said the study by Catholic theolo
gians "departs from the teaching of the church,"
abandons "objective criteria" of evaluating sex acts
and weakens "the demands of sound morality."
Auxiliary Bishop Daniel Pilarczwk of Cincinnati said
the doctrinal committee had assurances that its posi
tion represented the view of the entire National Con
ference of Catholic Bishops, which is meeting here.
However, the conference took no vote on the matter.
Davis called 'cold-blooded killer'
Amarillo, Texas (AP) — Prosecutors branded mil
lionaire industrialist Cullen Davis a cold-blooded kil
ler last night and exhorted a jury to convict him for the
"slaughter" of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
"This man was the judge, jury and executioner of
Andrea Wilborn," said chief prosecutor Joe Shan
non.
The marathon murder case reached the jury yes
terday night after seven hours of stormy closing ar
guments. The jurors chose to wait until this morning
to begin deliberations.
The defense worked to convince the jury that the
defendant's estranged wife Priscilla was a dpug-using
"Jekyll and Hyde" who tried to frame the Port Worth
businessman.

J.C. Burton, general manager for crude oil supply
for the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), said the U.S. price
of gasoline and other refined petroleum products
would increase by one cent per gallon for every five
per cent increase imposed by OPEC.
Inventories of crude oil and refined products are at
record levels, resulting in a short-term glut in the
midst of the nation's long-term energy problems.
Industry officials say the glut has resulted from in
creased production by non-OPEC members, slower
than expected growth in demand, and stockpiling last
spring in advance of an expected price increase in

July by OPEC.
Inherited killer disease identified
Boston (AP) — Researchers say they have disco
vered a disease inherited by some male children that
can turn a common virus into a cause of cancer or
make a killer out of mononucleosis.
The disease, identified at the University of Mas
sachusetts Medical School, is a deficiency that leaves
the body open to a fatal attack by the Epstein-Barr
virus. That germ infects up to 90 per cent of the
population, usually with mild flu-like symptoms. It
also causes mononucleosis, the "kissing disease" of
young adults.
The doctors say that victims of the disease who are
infected by the virus can develop cancer of the lymph
glands, suffer a fatal form of mononucleosis or have a
breakdown of the body's immune defenses. The dis
ease can also cause birth defects, including mal
formed hearts.
Over five generations in one family in Vermont,
researchers found 20 cases of the disease among
brothers, cousins and uncles. Of these, all but five
died from the disorder.
L.A. brush fire finally extinguished
Los Angeles (AP) — Given a break by the wind,
firefighters put out a 1350-acre brush fire yesterday

that had threatened to burn unchecked to the Pacific
Ocean.
Winds were calm as about 700 firefighters halted
the blaze about three miles from the coast and the
expensive beachfront homes in the Malibu area.
After the fire broke out Tuesday in tinder dry hill
sides of the Santa Monica Mountains 30 miles north
west of downtown Los Angeles, fire-officials watched
it blacken hundreds of acres in a few hours and pre
dicted it would burn to the ocean.
Although the flames were out, county fire inspec
tor Dennis Miller said some spots were still smolder
ing and that the fire would not be completely control
led until tomorrow morning — and only if the
weather cooperates.
Bishops dislike easing sex rules
Washington (AP) — Roman Catholic bishops yes
terday condemned a report that urges an easing of
religious rules on sex and concludes that activities
presently forbidden by the church, such as adultery,
premarital sex, homosexuality and masturbation, can
be condoned in some circumstances.
Speaking through their important doctrinal com
mittee, the bishops said the study by Catholic theolo
gians "departs from the teaching of the church,"
abandons "objective criteria" of evaluating sex acts
and weakens "the demands of sound morality."
Auxiliary Bishop Daniel Pilarczwk of Cincinnati said
the doctrinal committee had assurances that its posi
tion represented the view of the entire National Con
ference of Catholic Bishops, which is meeting here.
However, the conference took no vote on the matter.
Davis called 'cold-blooded killer'
Amarillo, Texas (AP) — Prosecutors branded mil
lionaire industrialist Cullen Davis a cold-blooded kil

"slaughter" of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
"This man was the judge, jury and executioner of
Andrea Wilborn," said chief prosecutor Joe Shan
non.
The marathon murder case reached the jury yes
terday night after seven hours of stormy closing ar

to begin deliberations.
The defense worked to convince the jury that the

Iran to seek price freeze on oil
Washington (AP) — The shah of Iran disclosed last
night that his country will seek a price freeze when
the 13-nation OPEC cartel meets next month in Ven
ezuela to decide whether to increase world oil prices.
The shah made the announcement at a news con
ference which wound up his violence-marred state
visit here. Heavy police forces kept rival groups of
Iranian demonstrators from a second day of violent
clashes yesterday as the shah and President )immy
Carter concluded their talks.
Because Iran wields considerable influence within
the oil cartel, the shah's announcement represented
a victory for President Carter's hopes for a price
freeze.
Carter has said that any price increase would be
disruptive to world economic stability, and the shah
said the president's arguments over the past two days
convinced him to change his policy of neutrality in
the upcoming talks.
Only last week, the shah had told interviewers that
Iran would remain neutral on the oil price question at
the Caracas, Venezuela, meeting.
The shah said he would be willing to support a
12-month freeze on prices. The current world price of
oil is about $12.50 per barrel and most other oil pro
ducing states will seek a price increase.
U.S. oil costs expected to rise
Houston (AP) — The price increase expected to be
approved next month by the Organization of Pet

cost of U.S. gasoline and heating oil by one cent to
three cents per gallon, oil industry officials said yes
terday.
As OPEC prepares for a Dec. 20 meeting in Caracas,
Venezuela, reports from the Middle East indicate that
the 13-nation cartel is planning to impose a price
increase ranging from five to 15 per cent.
Most authorities believe the increase will be five
per cent, reflecting the recent decline in the worth.of
the dollar — the currency with which OPEC members
are paid.

expensive beachfront homes in the Malibu area.
After the fire broke out Tuesday in tinder dry hill

it blacken hundreds of acres in a few hours and pre

Although the flames were out, county fire inspec

Bishops dislike easing sex rules
Washington (AP) — Roman Catholic bishops yes
terday condemned a report that urges an easing of
religious rules on sex and concludes that activities
presently forbidden by the church, such as adultery,
premarital sex, homosexuality and masturbation, can
be condoned in some circumstances.
Speaking through their important doctrinal com
mittee, the bishops said the study by Catholic theolo
gians "departs from the teaching of the church,"
abandons "objective criteria" of evaluating sex acts
and weakens "the demands of sound morality."
Auxiliary Bishop Daniel Pilarczwk of Cincinnati said
the doctrinal committee had assurances that its posi
tion represented the view of the entire National Con
ference of Catholic Bishops, which is meeting here.
However, the conference took no vote on the matter.
Davis called 'cold-blooded killer'
Amarillo, Texas (AP) — Prosecutors branded mil
lionaire industrialist Cullen Davis a cold-blooded kil
ler last night and exhorted a jury to convict him for the
"slaughter" of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
"This man was the judge, jury and executioner of
Andrea Wilborn," said chief prosecutor Joe Shan
non.
The marathon murder case reached the jury yes
terday night after seven hours of stormy closing ar
guments. The jurors chose to wait until this morning
to begin deliberations.
The defense worked to convince the jury that the
defendant's estranged wife Priscilla was a dpug-using
"Jekyll and Hyde" who tried to frame the Port Worth
businessman.

Iran to seek price freeze on oil
Washington (AP) — The shah of Iran disclosed last
night that his country will seek a price freeze when
the 13-nation OPEC cartel meets next month in Ven
ezuela to decide whether to increase world oil prices.
The shah made the announcement at a news con
ference which wound up his violence-marred state
visit here. Heavy police forces kept rival groups of
Iranian demonstrators from a second day of violent
clashes yesterday as the shah and President )immy
Carter concluded their talks.
Because Iran wields considerable influence within
the oil cartel, the shah's announcement represented
a victory for President Carter's hopes for a price
freeze.
Carter has said that any price increase would be
disruptive to world economic stability, and the shah
said the president's arguments over the past two days
convinced him to change his policy of neutrality in
the upcoming talks.
Only last week, the shah had told interviewers that
Iran would remain neutral on the oil price question at
the Caracas, Venezuela, meeting.
The shah said he would be willing to support a
12-month freeze on prices. The current world price of
oil is about $12.50 per barrel and most other oil pro
ducing states will seek a price increase.
U.S. oil costs expected to rise
Houston (AP) — The price increase expected to be
approved next month by the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will boost the
cost of U.S. gasoline and heating oil by one cent to
three cents per gallon, oil industry officials said yes
terday.
As OPEC prepares for a Dec. 20 meeting in Caracas,
Venezuela, reports from the Middle East indicate that
the 13-nation cartel is planning to impose a price
increase ranging from five to 15 per cent.
Most authorities believe the increase will be five
per cent, reflecting the recent decline in the worth.of
the dollar — the currency with which OPEC members
are paid.
J.C. Burton, general manager for crude oil supply
for the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), said the U.S. price
of gasoline and other refined petroleum products
would increase by one cent per gallon for every five
per cent increase imposed by OPEC.
Inventories of crude oil and refined products are at
record levels, resulting in a short-term glut in the
midst of the nation's long-term energy problems.
Industry officials say the glut has resulted from in
creased production by non-OPEC members, slower
than expected growth in demand, and stockpiling last
spring in advance of an expected price increase in

July by OPEC.
Inherited killer disease identified
Boston (AP) — Researchers say they have disco
vered a disease inherited by some male children that
can turn a common virus into a cause of cancer or
make a killer out of mononucleosis.
The disease, identified at the University of Mas
sachusetts Medical School, is a deficiency that leaves
the body open to a fatal attack by the Epstein-Barr
virus. That germ infects up to 90 per cent of the
population, usually with mild flu-like symptoms. It
also causes mononucleosis, the "kissing disease" of
young adults.
The doctors say that victims of the disease who are
infected by the virus can develop cancer of the lymph
glands, suffer a fatal form of mononucleosis or have a
breakdown of the body's immune defenses. The dis
ease can also cause birth defects, including mal
formed hearts.
Over five generations in one family in Vermont,
researchers found 20 cases of the disease among
brothers, cousins and uncles. Of these, all but five
died from the disorder.
L.A. brush fire finally extinguished
Los Angeles (AP) — Given a break by the wind,
