# Jarrett at Berkeley
## 
### 
During the past several years Keith Jarrett
has presented himself in many different
formats to Bay Area audiences. He has per
formed as a piano soloist, with a string or
chestra, with his old quartet and now with a
new quartet which features jarrett along
with three Europeans from the ECM label.
Although Jarrett's format was different at
his concert Tuesday at the Berkeley Com
munity Theater, his music retained the vir
tuosity and general excellence which has
been associated with him in the past.
Jarrett began by announcing that
the management wanted the group to wait
five minutes to give everyone a chance to be
seated but that they were so anxious to make
music that they wouldn't wait.
They immediately broke into a medium
tempo which featured jarrett and his
saxophonist Garberak; this number led,
without pause, into a beautiful jarrett piano
solo which began as a ballad and ended up
as a gospel-blues piece.
Again, the rest of the group stopped and
jarrett began playing a very slow figuration
in the upper register which entailed both
hands crossing and recrossing. Here Gar
barek joined in for a duet which was one of
the concert's highlights.
As is his custom, jarrett had the piano re

tuned during the intermission and then the
group returned for an equally excellent sec
ond half. Here, Jarrett went into the piano
and played the strings, a practice which he
recently claimed to have abandoned. Also,
he would hit a note on the piano and at the
same time strike the string with his hand
thus producing a muted sound.
Interestingly Jarrett has adapted these
practices from the classical music of Henry
Cowell, a very innovative composer who for
years made his home in Palo Alto.
The quartet closed the concert with an
encore that was the most relaxed and
melodic piece of the evening. Unlike many
artists who prefer to close with an up-tempo
number, Jarrett always chooses to close with
a ballad. Here Jarrett's playing, as well as
Garbarek's was crisp and cool.
Although Jarrett has not played with this
group often, they can be heard on the ECM
release, "Belonging," released about two years
ago. In many respects they must be consi
dered superior to Jarrett's past groups al
though I would have welcomed the pre
sence of Jarrett's other drummer, Paul Mo
tian, at Tuesday's concert.
In the rapidly changing world of Keith Jar
rett it will be interesting to see how long he
plays with this present group. —TED GIOIA

new quartet which features jarrett along
with three Europeans from the ECM label.
Although Jarrett's format was different at
his concert Tuesday at the Berkeley Com
munity Theater, his music retained the vir
tuosity and general excellence which has
been associated with him in the past.
Jarrett began by announcing that
the management wanted the group to wait
five minutes to give everyone a chance to be
seated but that they were so anxious to make
music that they wouldn't wait.
They immediately broke into a medium
tempo which featured jarrett and his
saxophonist Garberak; this number led,
without pause, into a beautiful jarrett piano
solo which began as a ballad and ended up
as a gospel-blues piece.
Again, the rest of the group stopped and
jarrett began playing a very slow figuration
in the upper register which entailed both
hands crossing and recrossing. Here Gar
barek joined in for a duet which was one of
the concert's highlights.
As is his custom, jarrett had the piano re

tuned during the intermission and then the
group returned for an equally excellent sec
ond half. Here, Jarrett went into the piano
and played the strings, a practice which he
recently claimed to have abandoned. Also,
he would hit a note on the piano and at the
same time strike the string with his hand
thus producing a muted sound.
Interestingly Jarrett has adapted these
practices from the classical music of Henry
Cowell, a very innovative composer who for
years made his home in Palo Alto.
The quartet closed the concert with an
encore that was the most relaxed and
melodic piece of the evening. Unlike many
artists who prefer to close with an up-tempo
number, Jarrett always chooses to close with
a ballad. Here Jarrett's playing, as well as
Garbarek's was crisp and cool.
Although Jarrett has not played with this
group often, they can be heard on the ECM
release, "Belonging," released about two years
ago. In many respects they must be consi
dered superior to Jarrett's past groups al
though I would have welcomed the pre
sence of Jarrett's other drummer, Paul Mo
tian, at Tuesday's concert.
In the rapidly changing world of Keith Jar
rett it will be interesting to see how long he
plays with this present group. —TED GIOIA
