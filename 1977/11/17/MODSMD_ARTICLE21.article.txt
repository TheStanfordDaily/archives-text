# Misadventure in 'The Valley'
## 
### 
It is discouraging to see a
movie with interesting pos
sibilities turn out poorly, but
such is the case with "The Val
ley," directed by Barbet
Schroeder. Filmed entirely in
New Guinea, with an overpub
licized sound tack by Pink
Floyd, it is an overambitious at
tempt to "trace the sexual and
spiritual evolution of a very
proper and sophisticated Fren
chwoman."
Viviane (Bulle Ogier) is mar
ried to the French consul in
Melbourne and is in New
Guinea to purchase exotic
feathers for a Paris boutique.
She becomes sexually involved
with Olivier (Michael
Gothard), one of a small group
of hippie wanderers planning a
trip into the unexplored in
terior of the island. Their goal
is to reach a valley, rumored to
be a paradise, about which lit
tle is known, because no one
has ever left after finding it.

This plot has possibilities,
but it fails to come off. The so
called "sexual and spiritual
evolution" is an abrupt change
in an undeveloped character.
The two changes each involve a
very short scene in which Viv
iane's actions seem totally out
of character. Except for these
two sequences, she remains
the same throughout the
movie. Add to that the unemo
tional style of the film and vie
wer empathy becomes difficult
at best.
New Guinea is a beautiful
and impressive natural setting
and the Mapuga tribe of na
tives, with whom the adven
turers live for a time, are fas
cinating. These aspects make
us feel we are watching a
documentary, in which the
strong sexual overtones of the

main plot seem inappropriate.
Two ideas about paradise are
expressed late in the movie,
but by then the film drags and it
is too late to recapture viewer
interest. Paradise certainly is
an elusive concept and a Bibli
cal allegory to the apple and
loss of innocence is well taken,
but in a film trying to do too
many things, the point just fails
to come across.
Another inconsistency in
volves the carefree manner of
the group's adventure. A cer
tain degree of irresponsibility
fits the characters, but this ex

pedition should never even ar
rive in New Guinea, much less
reach the inner regions of the
island. None of the group
seems involved with practical
necessities, yet miraculously,
no major difficulties are en
countered.
This movie obviously has
good potential, but by trying to

do so much, "The Valley"
failed to be effective.
Schroeder has no real message
of value and is overly subtle
even with that. His film drags
out much longer than the hour
and 45 minute running time
and is definitely not worth
wasting any effort.
