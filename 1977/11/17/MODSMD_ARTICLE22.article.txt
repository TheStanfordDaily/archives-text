# Reardon, Mallory and CLO's 'Kismet'
## 
### 
It's corny and fluffy and
very romantic. The music
soars, but most of the
lyrics are lost after the first
line.
That's "Kismet" — and
there's no better way to
handle this kind of show
than the Civic Light Op
era's stylish, solid produc
tion.
Though it never hits the
exceptional, the CLO
scores highly in all areas.
From Albert Marre's direc
tion to its incredible sing
ing to its stage designs, the
show makes Forrest and
Wright's "musical Arabian
Nights" glow.
In Arabic, "Kismet"
means resigning oneself
to fate and Marre takes ti .e
title to heart. This produc
tion flows (sometimes too
slowly) with a nonchalant
if-you-like-me-you-like-me,
if-you-don't-you-don't
spirit. That attitude works
well with a book which
might otherwise seem
ridiculous.
John Reardon (Hajj the
poet) holds the stage with
this same tongue-in
cheek. As the phony magi
cian who restores love and
happiness to Baghdad, he
sings magnificently and
fires witty jabs and asides
with delightful shrugs of
surprise over his ability to
conjure miracles out of
confusing coincidences.
The Metropolitan Opera
baritone delivers clear, full
notes, so strong they es
cape being garbled by the
Orpheum Theater's sound
system. Reardon's comic
timing and body language
are sharp enough to earn
guffaws with one cough or
an offstage glance. He is
magnetic and masterful,
but most importantly, he
doesn't take anything (in
cluding himself) too seri
ously.
As Hajj's daughter, Mar
sinah, Victoria Mallory

also shines. Though she is
uneasy in the first three
scenes, by the second act
she matches Reardon's
strength with ingenuous
defiance and an elegant
soprano. Together, Rear
don and Mallory are
magic, though at times
they seem more like lovers
than father and daughter.
George Gaynes' evil
Wazir of Police is too
much the cartoon villain.
The Wazir is supposed to
be a satirical buffoon but
his Dick Dastardlyness
pops up even when the ac
tion has gone from farcical
fantasy to romantic fairy
tale. He rumbles through
his songs, his voice clear
ing only in "And This is My
Beloved," the produc
tion's showstopper, in
which Gaynes, Reardon,
Mallory and David Eisley
weave four melodies into a
revelry on love.
Eisley (the noble Caliph
and Marsinah's lover) has
a tight, clear tenor, espe
cially beautiful in "Night of
Nights" and "Stranger in
Paradise," a song difficult
to win with because of its
tricky construction and its
reputation as the play's
showpiece. Eisley's acting
suffers, though, from
aloofness. His Caliph
never descends from a
silver cloud and though
this character might be in
tended to be as flat a
stereotype as the Wazir, at
least the Wazir comes off
funny. The Caliph is sup
posed to be the romantic
hero but in him we find
neither romance nor
heroism. When he first
meets Marsinah, for in
stance, he sings gloriously
but embraces her as if he
were prepraing for public
ity photos.
Bernice Massi plays a
Mae West of a Wazir's
Head Wife, who trades
strokes and sexual in
nuendo with Hajj. Murray

Atheson's Omar Khayyam
is a dry, wry and hilarious
victim-observer of
Baghdad court life.
Beyond the principals,
the cast sings and dances
and dances and dances.
Bonnie Evans' choreog
raphy (adapted from Jack
Cole's original work)
shimmies as wildly as her
belly dancers. It runs from
the savagery of the three
fireball Princesses of
Ababu (Virginia Ann
Latimer, Aulani, Jeri Ellen
Sparkman) to tableaux,
rippling with dance
movements involving the
entire cast.
Ross Reimueller directs
an orchestra, which plays
spotlessly.
Oliver Smith, the
seven-time Tony winner,
uses scrims, his familiar
flats and the glittering
backdrops usually used by
ballet companies to create
straightforward designs
that showcase rather than
bury the action. Robert
Randolph's lighting de
sign, unlike those of a few
recent CLO shows, con
tributes more than per
functorily to the musical's
dramatic and theatrical ac
tions.
Yes, the pieces fall to
gether too neatly here, the
action drags a little — and
most of the songs end with
traditional arms-raised
or romantically inter
twined poses. But this
"Kismet" has Reardon and
Mallory, tremendous sing
ing, strong supporting
players, and a devil-may
care polish which can't be
ignored.

"Kismet" runs through
Dec. 10 at the Orpheum
Theatre in San Francisco.
The musical, which adapts
the music of Alexander
Borodin, was introduced
by the San Francisco and
Los Angeles CLOs in 1953.
