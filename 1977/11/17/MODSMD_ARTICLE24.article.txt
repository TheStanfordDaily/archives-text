# Two solid, lively Savoyard shows
## 
### 
A group of strong voices
combine with lively strings to
create a solid performance of
two Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas, "Trial by Jury" and
"H.M.S. Pinafore," by the
Savoyards.
Harmonies come easily, the
seriousness necessary for sa
tire is maintained and the act
ing, usually the major weak
ness of operetta perfor
mances, is at least adequate
despite last-minute changes in
both shows' players.
"Trial" serves as a good
warmup both for the audience
and the cast members who ap
pear in both productions. A
one-act, comparatively stiff
play, "Trial" gave the chorus
and several principals a chance
to test their voices and postur
ing before the longer, freer
flowing "Pinafore."

This is especially true for
Charles Jordan, who plays
Counsel for the Plaintiff in "T
-rial" and Captain Corcoran in
"Pinafore." Though his basi
cally strong voice is slightly
flawed by range problems in
both shows, he is able to use
his larger role in "Pinafore" to
display acting ability left sub
merged in "Trial."
Elizabeth Dyrud, playing the
female lead in both shows, also
improves remarkably from "T
-rial" to "Pinafore." In the
former, as a woman scorned
suing her intended for breach
of promise, her soprano voice
is pretty but weak and her
movements uninspired. She
shines, however, when al
lowed in "Pinafore" greater
freedom and a more complex
role.
The two last-minute substi
tutes, Edwin Good as the judge
in "Trial" and Christopher
Dant as Deadeye in "Pinafore,"
give no hint by their perfor
mances that they began the
roles in dress rehearsal.
The heroes, Gerald Chappell
as the defendant husband in
"Trial" and Kevan Miller as
Ralph Rackstraw in "Pinafore,"
displayed excellent voices,
unmatched by their acting abil
ity. Both were impressive
standing and singing their
parts but walked in and out of
the spotlight stiffly.

"Trial by Jury" and "H.M.S. Pi
nafore" run this weekend at

Dant as Deadeye in "Pinafore,"
give no hint by their perfor
mances that they began the
roles in dress rehearsal.
The heroes, Gerald Chappell
as the defendant husband in
"Trial" and Kevan Miller as
Ralph Rackstraw in "Pinafore,"
displayed excellent voices,
unmatched by their acting abil
ity. Both were impressive
standing and singing their
parts but walked in and out of
the spotlight stiffly.

"Trial by Jury" and "H.M.S. Pi
nafore" run this weekend at
Dinkelspiel.
