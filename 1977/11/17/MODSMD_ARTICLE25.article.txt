# Card tackle in last Big Game
## Gordon King: excellence personified 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Gordon King is an offensive lineman — an excep
tional one — and he embodies the living proof that
not all football players are hulking beasts that delight
solely in primitive, violent behavior. King delights in
football, with an undeniable respect for the game and
everything that goes with it,
"It has to be fun for me to play," King said. "When
you're practicing it can get you down sometimes be
cause there are no people there. An important part of
playing is having the people there and having the
band to fire you up. The game would be played diffe
rently in a back lot somewhere with just the two
teams."
King's not "sure where all the fun comes from, but I
know I like it even though I play a position that's really
physical and the recognition goes elsewhere."
It's true. Offensive linemen don't get the best
media coverage, but King attributes that to "the na
ture of the position. People want to read about the
quarterback," King said. "He's more visible and has
some statistics to follow. But publicity isn't the reason
I play anyway. It doesn't motivate you. And I feel I've
gotten my fair share this year."
This year is King's third on the Cardinal varsity. The
calm intensity that shows in his eyes beneath the curls
that top his 6-foot-6 frame betray the emotions of
facing the end of his final Stanford season.
"The Cal game is the last one and I feel kind of sad,"
King said. "There's a certain atmosphere surrounding
it — looking around and seeing all the guys I've
played with for four years. It's a game — and you
think about that — but there's some intangible thing
about playing Cal. Saturday will be really an emo
tional day for me."
And it is far from the day when, trying to make his
decision on which school to attend, his mother of
fered only one piece of advice: "Well, if I were you,
I'd go to Cal."
luckily, Stanford landed King, who confided that
he would actually have rather been recruited as a
defensive lineman.

"It was a new experience at the time, though," King
remarked of the beginning of his football career at
the Farm. "I didn't want to tell someone 'yeah, I want
to play defense.' Then they'd say 'well, sorry, we
don't need anyone right now.' It would have been
silly to turn down an opportunity like this."
By this time King seems to have even found some
advantages to the offensive position.
"It's a comforting feeling being in the offensive
line," King grinned. "Sometimes your mistakes don't
show up — except on film. Then you can't lie your
way out of it. There's physical proof right there."
That physical proof has earned King a great deal of
recognition from professional scouts.
"That's become a real possibility," said King of

being recruited by the teams that pay to play. "I've
looked at it for awhile and it's become more and more
realistic. When it does come, I'd like to give it my best
shot and concentrate all my energies on that."
King is a very competitive, very thorough person.
"I'd like to give it my best effort so I'll never look
back and feel I've cheated myself. I'd be thrilled
wherever I went."
And if it doesn't work out . . . well, King would
have to "reappraise everything. I guess grad school
would be the next best thing," said the communica
tion and psychology major.
King's academic interests also reflect the insight he
has into people, particularly his teammates.
"There's a definite camaraderie that comes from
travelling to strange and exotic places together
(Tulane?) and doing a lot of things together. It's a
good feeling that only comes from sports. Plus, these
guys are intelligent. It's hard to bullshit a Stanford
athlete. You just can't fool them by using little emo
tional tricks (to get them psyched up).
"Some players have a beast mentality. (Remember?
bared teeth, animal instincts.) It's not like that at
Stanford. We're capable of getting ourselves up for
the game and preparing emotionally, physically and
technically."
Of his own preparation to play, King said, "There's
no foaming at the mouth here, no shouting. The
more I've played, the more it's come from within —
and it's a more intense feeling."
That intensity has given the offensive tackle an ex
ceptional skill in clearing out the field for those big
plays they always run toward the 265 lb. offensive
tackle.
"I take it as a compliment," King said, "that I have
that responsibility. I just think about getting my man
and I try to do the job."
That his job is undeniably well done is no secret.
Nor does his quiet seriousness succeed in keeping
King's sense of humor or his intelligence — the qual
ities that make him a stereotypical exception — from
surfacing.

show up — except on film. Then you can't lie your
way out of it. There's physical proof right there."
That physical proof has earned King a great deal of
recognition from professional scouts.
"That's become a real possibility," said King of

being recruited by the teams that pay to play. "I've
looked at it for awhile and it's become more and more
realistic. When it does come, I'd like to give it my best
shot and concentrate all my energies on that."
King is a very competitive, very thorough person.
"I'd like to give it my best effort so I'll never look
back and feel I've cheated myself. I'd be thrilled
wherever I went."
And if it doesn't work out . . . well, King would
have to "reappraise everything. I guess grad school
would be the next best thing," said the communica
tion and psychology major.
King's academic interests also reflect the insight he
has into people, particularly his teammates.
"There's a definite camaraderie that comes from
travelling to strange and exotic places together
(Tulane?) and doing a lot of things together. It's a
good feeling that only comes from sports. Plus, these
guys are intelligent. It's hard to bullshit a Stanford
athlete. You just can't fool them by using little emo
tional tricks (to get them psyched up).
"Some players have a beast mentality. (Remember?
bared teeth, animal instincts.) It's not like that at
Stanford. We're capable of getting ourselves up for
the game and preparing emotionally, physically and
technically."
Of his own preparation to play, King said, "There's
no foaming at the mouth here, no shouting. The
more I've played, the more it's come from within —
and it's a more intense feeling."
That intensity has given the offensive tackle an ex
ceptional skill in clearing out the field for those big
plays they always run toward the 265 lb. offensive
tackle.
"I take it as a compliment," King said, "that I have
that responsibility. I just think about getting my man
and I try to do the job."
That his job is undeniably well done is no secret.
Nor does his quiet seriousness succeed in keeping
King's sense of humor or his intelligence — the qual
ities that make him a stereotypical exception — from
surfacing.


Gordon King
Gordon King is an offensive lineman — an excep
tional one — and he embodies the living proof that
not all football players are hulking beasts that delight
solely in primitive, violent behavior. King delights in
football, with an undeniable respect for the game and
everything that goes with it,
"It has to be fun for me to play," King said. "When
you're practicing it can get you down sometimes be
cause there are no people there. An important part of
playing is having the people there and having the
band to fire you up. The game would be played diffe
rently in a back lot somewhere with just the two
teams."
King's not "sure where all the fun comes from, but I
know I like it even though I play a position that's really
physical and the recognition goes elsewhere."
It's true. Offensive linemen don't get the best
media coverage, but King attributes that to "the na
ture of the position. People want to read about the
quarterback," King said. "He's more visible and has
some statistics to follow. But publicity isn't the reason
I play anyway. It doesn't motivate you. And I feel I've
gotten my fair share this year."
This year is King's third on the Cardinal varsity. The
calm intensity that shows in his eyes beneath the curls
that top his 6-foot-6 frame betray the emotions of
facing the end of his final Stanford season.
"The Cal game is the last one and I feel kind of sad,"
King said. "There's a certain atmosphere surrounding
it — looking around and seeing all the guys I've
played with for four years. It's a game — and you
think about that — but there's some intangible thing
about playing Cal. Saturday will be really an emo
tional day for me."
And it is far from the day when, trying to make his
decision on which school to attend, his mother of
fered only one piece of advice: "Well, if I were you,
I'd go to Cal."
luckily, Stanford landed King, who confided that
he would actually have rather been recruited as a
defensive lineman.

"It was a new experience at the time, though," King
remarked of the beginning of his football career at
the Farm. "I didn't want to tell someone 'yeah, I want
to play defense.' Then they'd say 'well, sorry, we
don't need anyone right now.' It would have been
silly to turn down an opportunity like this."
By this time King seems to have even found some
advantages to the offensive position.

"It has to be fun for me to play," King said. "When
you're practicing it can get you down sometimes be
cause there are no people there. An important part of
playing is having the people there and having the
band to fire you up. The game would be played diffe
rently in a back lot somewhere with just the two
teams."
King's not "sure where all the fun comes from, but I
know I like it even though I play a position that's really
physical and the recognition goes elsewhere."
It's true. Offensive linemen don't get the best
media coverage, but King attributes that to "the na
ture of the position. People want to read about the
quarterback," King said. "He's more visible and has
some statistics to follow. But publicity isn't the reason
I play anyway. It doesn't motivate you. And I feel I've
gotten my fair share this year."
This year is King's third on the Cardinal varsity. The
calm intensity that shows in his eyes beneath the curls
that top his 6-foot-6 frame betray the emotions of
facing the end of his final Stanford season.
"The Cal game is the last one and I feel kind of sad,"
King said. "There's a certain atmosphere surrounding
it — looking around and seeing all the guys I've
played with for four years. It's a game — and you
think about that — but there's some intangible thing
about playing Cal. Saturday will be really an emo
tional day for me."
And it is far from the day when, trying to make his
decision on which school to attend, his mother of
fered only one piece of advice: "Well, if I were you,
I'd go to Cal."
luckily, Stanford landed King, who confided that
he would actually have rather been recruited as a
defensive lineman.

"It was a new experience at the time, though," King
remarked of the beginning of his football career at
the Farm. "I didn't want to tell someone 'yeah, I want
to play defense.' Then they'd say 'well, sorry, we
don't need anyone right now.' It would have been
silly to turn down an opportunity like this."
By this time King seems to have even found some
advantages to the offensive position.
"It's a comforting feeling being in the offensive
line," King grinned. "Sometimes your mistakes don't
show up — except on film. Then you can't lie your
way out of it. There's physical proof right there."
That physical proof has earned King a great deal of
recognition from professional scouts.
"That's become a real possibility," said King of

being recruited by the teams that pay to play. "I've
looked at it for awhile and it's become more and more
realistic. When it does come, I'd like to give it my best
shot and concentrate all my energies on that."
King is a very competitive, very thorough person.
"I'd like to give it my best effort so I'll never look
back and feel I've cheated myself. I'd be thrilled
wherever I went."
And if it doesn't work out . . . well, King would
have to "reappraise everything. I guess grad school
would be the next best thing," said the communica
tion and psychology major.
King's academic interests also reflect the insight he
has into people, particularly his teammates.
"There's a definite camaraderie that comes from
travelling to strange and exotic places together
(Tulane?) and doing a lot of things together. It's a
good feeling that only comes from sports. Plus, these
guys are intelligent. It's hard to bullshit a Stanford
athlete. You just can't fool them by using little emo
tional tricks (to get them psyched up).
"Some players have a beast mentality. (Remember?
bared teeth, animal instincts.) It's not like that at
Stanford. We're capable of getting ourselves up for
the game and preparing emotionally, physically and
technically."
Of his own preparation to play, King said, "There's
no foaming at the mouth here, no shouting. The
more I've played, the more it's come from within —
and it's a more intense feeling."
That intensity has given the offensive tackle an ex
ceptional skill in clearing out the field for those big
plays they always run toward the 265 lb. offensive
tackle.
"I take it as a compliment," King said, "that I have
that responsibility. I just think about getting my man
and I try to do the job."
That his job is undeniably well done is no secret.
Nor does his quiet seriousness succeed in keeping
King's sense of humor or his intelligence — the qual
ities that make him a stereotypical exception — from
surfacing.
