## Women's cross country: running an uphill race 
### Jill Lieber 
It has been a long time com
ing and more miles than they
care to count — but the wo
men's cross country team is fi
nally realizing a dream.
In its first year of varsity
status, the team will compete
in the Association of Intercol
legiate Athletics for Women
Nationals Saturday in Austin,
Texas. The Cards main compet
ition will come from returning
champion lowa State, Cal
State-Northridge, Harvard,
Penn State and UCLA.
Sandy Briscoe, a senior on
the team, was one of the chief
instigators in the formation of
the women's team. Three years
ago Briscoe, who is also a
world-class race walker, ap
proached the Athletic Depart
ment with the idea of starting a
women's team.
The athletic department
bought her sales pitch — but
not without some hesitation.
Stanford athletic adminis
trators figured that cross coun
try was a cheap sport. Let the
women buy their own shoes
and gym shorts, perhaps fur
nish them with sweatsuits and
then turn them loose on the
golf course.
Let 'em run wild.
Ah, but then there was the
problem of coaching. Marshall
Clark, the men's cross country
coach volunteered to oversee
the program, and three former
members of Stanford cross
country teams helped out the
women through their paces
every day.
George Berry, Jack Bellah
and this year's coach, Steve
Crowley, have put in numer

ous hours during the last three
years as a combination coach
teacher-brother-friend.
The road to Austin has been
long and hard, but it has been
well worth it.
"When I was a freshman,
everyone in my dorm was so
amazed that I could run all the
way to the radio-telescope,"
Briscoe said. "Now everyone
does it. There are so many jog
gers that nobody even blinks
or raises their eyebrows when
you tell them how many miles
you run."
Briscoe said that running is
more popular on campus right
now for women than for men.
Twenty-five women came out
for cross country this season
and cuts had to be.made in the
roster. Some of the women
dropped off the team when
they realized the amount of
time that would be involved.
And those who thought the
team would be a form of condi
tioning, were scared away by
the high-powered, full-fledged
training.
"There is intense competi
tion between the people on
the team," Briscoe said. "We
are a lot more serious about
training and running a lot har
der than ever before.
"Running has become a de
finite part of each woman's life.
Everyone is in it for the compet
ition."
Briscoe and three other
women on the team trained at
the Olympic Training Camp in
Squaw Valley early in Sep
tember — often times running
more than 15 miles a day.
Briscoe said that the idea of
the team being a varsity sport,

however, was not the motivat
ing force behind her heavy
duty training. She was a run
ning fanatic before the wo
men's team was formed.
"Cross country being a var
sity sport this season made
some difference to me because
I know the long road it had
come," Broscoe said. "But I'm
not sure the others on the team
are aware that this is our first
year training and competing
this way.
"Being a varsity sport has
helped us get access to things
we really needed — like coach
ing and trainers."
Junior Ann Thrupp, the No. 1
runner on the team, was
another woman responsible
for the team's varsity status.
Thrupp began running three
years ago and since then has
developed into a national
competitor.
Thrupp is Stanford's first
All-America woman distance
runner, having gained that
honor by finishing third in the
10,000 meters last June in the
AAU'strackand field nationals.
"Ann's success was the im
petus we needed to make cross
country a varsity sport," Clark
said. "No one ever thought
we'd do this well in our first
year."
"It's fantastic that we're
going to nationals," Thrupp
said. Thrupp will be competing
in her second cross country na
tionals. Last year she qualified
on her own for the competition
and finished 15th overall. This
season, however, she is nurs
ing a knee injury and may not
finish as high.
"What we really need is a

full-time coach," Thrupp said.
"The team takes a lot of time
for coach Clark. Working with
two teams is a lot to ask of one
person."
Both Briscoe and Clark
pointed out that a full-time
coach is necessary if the
women hope to keep up with
other teams on a national levei.
California has just hired a full
time coach who has the time,
money and support from the
athletic department to go out
to the high schools and recruit
an entire team.
"If Stanford doesn't hire a
full-time coach they're going to
be sorry," Briscoe said, "be
cause we won't be able to
maintain the level we are at
right now."
Clark said that without a
women's track program, few
distance runners will give Stan

ford a second look.
"You don't get a top runner
here unless they can run both
cross country and track," Clark
said. "It is in the girls' hands
themselves. They know
they've got to talk about get
ting track going on a club
status."
Briscoe agreed.
"Some teams get carried
away by getting new sweats
each year and taking trips to
Hawaii," Briscoe said. "But we
aren't asking for that. We just
want a continuation of the
program into track season.
"Right now it just drops off
after cross country and it's a
'see you next fall' attitude. Our
next goal is to start a track
program. Butthatwill take time
and money and lots of student
interest."

Stanford's Ann Thrupp leads the Cards' women's cross country team
over a hill as the harriers work out in preparation for the AIAW
National Meet Saturday in Austin, Texas.
It has been a long time com
ing and more miles than they
care to count — but the wo
men's cross country team is fi
nally realizing a dream.
In its first year of varsity
status, the team will compete
in the Association of Intercol
legiate Athletics for Women
Nationals Saturday in Austin,
Texas. The Cards main compet
ition will come from returning
champion lowa State, Cal
State-Northridge, Harvard,
Penn State and UCLA.
Sandy Briscoe, a senior on
the team, was one of the chief
instigators in the formation of
the women's team. Three years
ago Briscoe, who is also a
world-class race walker, ap
proached the Athletic Depart
ment with the idea of starting a
women's team.
The athletic department
bought her sales pitch — but
not without some hesitation.
Stanford athletic adminis
trators figured that cross coun
try was a cheap sport. Let the
women buy their own shoes
and gym shorts, perhaps fur
nish them with sweatsuits and
then turn them loose on the
golf course.
Let 'em run wild.
Ah, but then there was the
problem of coaching. Marshall
Clark, the men's cross country
coach volunteered to oversee
the program, and three former
members of Stanford cross
country teams helped out the
women through their paces
every day.
George Berry, Jack Bellah
and this year's coach, Steve
Crowley, have put in numer

ous hours during the last three
years as a combination coach
teacher-brother-friend.
The road to Austin has been
long and hard, but it has been
well worth it.
"When I was a freshman,
everyone in my dorm was so
amazed that I could run all the
way to the radio-telescope,"
Briscoe said. "Now everyone
does it. There are so many jog
gers that nobody even blinks
or raises their eyebrows when
you tell them how many miles
you run."
Briscoe said that running is
more popular on campus right
now for women than for men.
Twenty-five women came out
for cross country this season
and cuts had to be.made in the
roster. Some of the women
dropped off the team when
they realized the amount of
time that would be involved.
And those who thought the
team would be a form of condi
tioning, were scared away by
the high-powered, full-fledged
training.
"There is intense competi
tion between the people on
the team," Briscoe said. "We
are a lot more serious about
training and running a lot har
der than ever before.
"Running has become a de
finite part of each woman's life.
Everyone is in it for the compet
ition."
Briscoe and three other
women on the team trained at
the Olympic Training Camp in
Squaw Valley early in Sep
tember — often times running
more than 15 miles a day.
Briscoe said that the idea of
the team being a varsity sport,

however, was not the motivat
ing force behind her heavy
duty training. She was a run
ning fanatic before the wo
men's team was formed.
"Cross country being a var
sity sport this season made
some difference to me because
I know the long road it had
come," Broscoe said. "But I'm
not sure the others on the team
are aware that this is our first
year training and competing
this way.
"Being a varsity sport has
helped us get access to things
we really needed — like coach
ing and trainers."
Junior Ann Thrupp, the No. 1
runner on the team, was
another woman responsible
for the team's varsity status.
Thrupp began running three
years ago and since then has
developed into a national
competitor.
Thrupp is Stanford's first
All-America woman distance
runner, having gained that
honor by finishing third in the
10,000 meters last June in the
AAU'strackand field nationals.
"Ann's success was the im
petus we needed to make cross
country a varsity sport," Clark
said. "No one ever thought
we'd do this well in our first
year."
"It's fantastic that we're
going to nationals," Thrupp
said. Thrupp will be competing
in her second cross country na
tionals. Last year she qualified
on her own for the competition
and finished 15th overall. This
season, however, she is nurs
ing a knee injury and may not
finish as high.
"What we really need is a

full-time coach," Thrupp said.
"The team takes a lot of time
for coach Clark. Working with
two teams is a lot to ask of one
person."
Both Briscoe and Clark
pointed out that a full-time
coach is necessary if the
women hope to keep up with
other teams on a national levei.
California has just hired a full
time coach who has the time,
money and support from the
athletic department to go out
to the high schools and recruit
an entire team.
"If Stanford doesn't hire a
full-time coach they're going to
be sorry," Briscoe said, "be
cause we won't be able to
maintain the level we are at
right now."
Clark said that without a
women's track program, few
distance runners will give Stan

ford a second look.
"You don't get a top runner
here unless they can run both
cross country and track," Clark
said. "It is in the girls' hands
themselves. They know
they've got to talk about get
ting track going on a club
status."
Briscoe agreed.
"Some teams get carried
away by getting new sweats
each year and taking trips to
Hawaii," Briscoe said. "But we
aren't asking for that. We just
want a continuation of the
program into track season.
"Right now it just drops off
after cross country and it's a
'see you next fall' attitude. Our
next goal is to start a track
program. Butthatwill take time
and money and lots of student
interest."

Stanford's Ann Thrupp leads the Cards' women's cross country team
over a hill as the harriers work out in preparation for the AIAW
National Meet Saturday in Austin, Texas.
It has been a long time com
ing and more miles than they
care to count — but the wo
men's cross country team is fi
nally realizing a dream.
In its first year of varsity
status, the team will compete
in the Association of Intercol
legiate Athletics for Women
Nationals Saturday in Austin,
Texas. The Cards main compet
ition will come from returning
champion lowa State, Cal
State-Northridge, Harvard,
Penn State and UCLA.
Sandy Briscoe, a senior on
the team, was one of the chief
instigators in the formation of
the women's team. Three years
ago Briscoe, who is also a
world-class race walker, ap
proached the Athletic Depart
ment with the idea of starting a
women's team.
The athletic department
bought her sales pitch — but
not without some hesitation.
Stanford athletic adminis
trators figured that cross coun
try was a cheap sport. Let the
women buy their own shoes
and gym shorts, perhaps fur
nish them with sweatsuits and
then turn them loose on the
golf course.
Let 'em run wild.
Ah, but then there was the
problem of coaching. Marshall
Clark, the men's cross country
coach volunteered to oversee
the program, and three former
members of Stanford cross
country teams helped out the
women through their paces
every day.
George Berry, Jack Bellah
and this year's coach, Steve
Crowley, have put in numer

ous hours during the last three
years as a combination coach
teacher-brother-friend.
The road to Austin has been
long and hard, but it has been
well worth it.
"When I was a freshman,
everyone in my dorm was so
amazed that I could run all the
way to the radio-telescope,"
Briscoe said. "Now everyone
does it. There are so many jog
gers that nobody even blinks
or raises their eyebrows when
you tell them how many miles
you run."
Briscoe said that running is
more popular on campus right
now for women than for men.
Twenty-five women came out
for cross country this season
and cuts had to be.made in the
roster. Some of the women
dropped off the team when
they realized the amount of
time that would be involved.
And those who thought the
team would be a form of condi
tioning, were scared away by
the high-powered, full-fledged
training.
"There is intense competi
tion between the people on
the team," Briscoe said. "We
are a lot more serious about
training and running a lot har
der than ever before.
"Running has become a de
finite part of each woman's life.
Everyone is in it for the compet
ition."
Briscoe and three other
women on the team trained at
the Olympic Training Camp in
Squaw Valley early in Sep
tember — often times running
more than 15 miles a day.
Briscoe said that the idea of
the team being a varsity sport,

however, was not the motivat
ing force behind her heavy
duty training. She was a run
ning fanatic before the wo
men's team was formed.
"Cross country being a var
sity sport this season made
some difference to me because
I know the long road it had
come," Broscoe said. "But I'm
not sure the others on the team
are aware that this is our first
year training and competing
this way.
"Being a varsity sport has
helped us get access to things
we really needed — like coach
ing and trainers."
Junior Ann Thrupp, the No. 1
runner on the team, was
another woman responsible
for the team's varsity status.
Thrupp began running three
years ago and since then has
developed into a national
competitor.
Thrupp is Stanford's first
All-America woman distance
runner, having gained that
honor by finishing third in the
10,000 meters last June in the
AAU'strackand field nationals.
"Ann's success was the im
petus we needed to make cross
country a varsity sport," Clark
said. "No one ever thought
we'd do this well in our first
year."
"It's fantastic that we're
going to nationals," Thrupp
said. Thrupp will be competing
in her second cross country na
tionals. Last year she qualified
on her own for the competition
and finished 15th overall. This
season, however, she is nurs
ing a knee injury and may not
finish as high.
"What we really need is a

full-time coach," Thrupp said.
"The team takes a lot of time
for coach Clark. Working with
two teams is a lot to ask of one
person."
Both Briscoe and Clark
pointed out that a full-time
coach is necessary if the
women hope to keep up with
other teams on a national levei.
California has just hired a full
time coach who has the time,
money and support from the
athletic department to go out
to the high schools and recruit
an entire team.
"If Stanford doesn't hire a
full-time coach they're going to
be sorry," Briscoe said, "be
cause we won't be able to
maintain the level we are at
right now."
Clark said that without a
women's track program, few
distance runners will give Stan

ford a second look.
"You don't get a top runner
here unless they can run both
cross country and track," Clark
said. "It is in the girls' hands
themselves. They know
they've got to talk about get
ting track going on a club
status."
Briscoe agreed.
"Some teams get carried
away by getting new sweats
each year and taking trips to
Hawaii," Briscoe said. "But we
aren't asking for that. We just
want a continuation of the
program into track season.
"Right now it just drops off
after cross country and it's a
'see you next fall' attitude. Our
next goal is to start a track
program. Butthatwill take time
