# Women prepare sororities plan
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Approximately 15 female
students here designed a
proposal Monday setting
guidelines for sororities to
follow if the ban on
sororities is rescinded.
The women are planning
to present the proposal to
the Board of Trustees when
it considers the sorority
issue once again at its Dec.
13 meeting, according to
senior Marian Stephenson,
co-chairman of the pro
sorority group.
Senior Bonnie McColl,
also co-chairperson of the
group, explained that the
purpose of the proposal is
"to let them (the trustees)
know we've been thinking
about sororities and these
are our objectives. It's a
well-thought-out program.
We have a direction as well
as an intuitive teeling about
there being a need for
sororities."
If the trustees do vote to
lift the ban, national
sororities interested in hav
ing a chapter here will be
asked to comply with these
regulations, Stephenson
said.
McColl and Stephenson
have already received let
ters from four national
sororities expressing an in
terest in reviving their Stan
ford chapters.
One sorority letter stated,
"we are delighted to hear
that you girls are interested
in bringing the NPC (Na
tional Panhellenic Council)
groups on the Stanford
campus. Kappa Kappa
Camma is very interested in
re-establishing our chapter
if this is possible."
The proposal states, "Any
woman going through rush
will be guaranteed a spot in
a national sorority" and that
no women will be excluded
from rush due to race, creed
or religion.
"Spots will be made avail
able depending on the
number of people going
through rush," Stephenson
added.

According to the prop
osal, rush would be gov
erned by the University and
would be held in the spring
"as we feel freshmen dorm
experience is a valuable as
pect of the Stanford Univer
sity education."
The proposal further
states, "If given a house, the
women in the house will be
responsible for its man
agement. It will be a learn
ing experience for all the
women involved as the
women will learn to or
ganize and come together
as a cohesive group."
The proposal also pro
vides for the University to
regulate residence staffing
and student conduct within
the house. There would bea
local Panhellenic Council,
similar to the Inter-
Fraternity Council, for
cooperation with sororities,
the student body and the
University administration.
According to Norm
Robinson, associate dean of
housing, when sororities
were banned 33 years ago,
the University agreed to
purchase the sorority
houses. Three of the
sororities chose to give that
money back to the Univer
sity as an endowment to be
used for scholarships, with
the idea that if sororities
were reinstated, this money
would be returned.
The market value of the
endowments now range
from about $30,000 to
$124,000, Robinson said.
The women interested in
sororities are meeting
Monday at 10 p.m. at Storey
House to set up committees
for organizing an informa
tional campaign.
"Our plan is to go around
and publicize in freshman
dorms, minority groups and
all women's groups to tell
people what a sorority actu
ally is and what it would be
like at Stanford," said
Stephenson.
"We want to try to get rid
of the stereotypes people
have against them."

The market value of the
endowments now range
from about $30,000 to
$124,000, Robinson said.
The women interested in
sororities are meeting
Monday at 10 p.m. at Storey
House to set up committees
for organizing an informa
tional campaign.
"Our plan is to go around
and publicize in freshman
dorms, minority groups and
all women's groups to tell
people what a sorority actu
ally is and what it would be
like at Stanford," said
Stephenson.
"We want to try to get rid
of the stereotypes people
have against them."
Approximately 15 female
students here designed a
proposal Monday setting
guidelines for sororities to
follow if the ban on
sororities is rescinded.
The women are planning
to present the proposal to
the Board of Trustees when
it considers the sorority
issue once again at its Dec.
13 meeting, according to
senior Marian Stephenson,
co-chairman of the pro
sorority group.
Senior Bonnie McColl,
also co-chairperson of the
group, explained that the
purpose of the proposal is
"to let them (the trustees)
know we've been thinking
about sororities and these
are our objectives. It's a
well-thought-out program.
We have a direction as well
as an intuitive teeling about
there being a need for
sororities."
If the trustees do vote to
lift the ban, national
sororities interested in hav
ing a chapter here will be
asked to comply with these
regulations, Stephenson
said.
McColl and Stephenson
have already received let
ters from four national
sororities expressing an in
terest in reviving their Stan
ford chapters.
One sorority letter stated,
"we are delighted to hear
that you girls are interested
in bringing the NPC (Na
tional Panhellenic Council)
groups on the Stanford
campus. Kappa Kappa
Camma is very interested in
re-establishing our chapter
if this is possible."
The proposal states, "Any
woman going through rush
will be guaranteed a spot in
a national sorority" and that
no women will be excluded
from rush due to race, creed
or religion.
"Spots will be made avail
able depending on the
number of people going
through rush," Stephenson
added.

According to the prop
osal, rush would be gov
erned by the University and
would be held in the spring
"as we feel freshmen dorm
experience is a valuable as
pect of the Stanford Univer
sity education."
The proposal further
states, "If given a house, the
women in the house will be
responsible for its man
agement. It will be a learn
ing experience for all the
women involved as the
women will learn to or
ganize and come together
as a cohesive group."
The proposal also pro
vides for the University to
regulate residence staffing
and student conduct within
the house. There would bea
local Panhellenic Council,
similar to the Inter-
Fraternity Council, for
cooperation with sororities,
the student body and the
University administration.
According to Norm
Robinson, associate dean of
housing, when sororities
were banned 33 years ago,
the University agreed to
purchase the sorority
houses. Three of the
sororities chose to give that
money back to the Univer
sity as an endowment to be
used for scholarships, with
the idea that if sororities
were reinstated, this money
would be returned.
