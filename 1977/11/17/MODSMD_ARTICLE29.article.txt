## Recycling site, leaders picked 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU recycling center continues to move
toward completion with two project managers
appointed and the recycling site being pre
pared, according to ASSU Financial Manager
Miles White.
Barry Abramson will be project manager for
operations and Jim Knox will be project manager
for community relations and education.
The recycling site is being outfitted for access
by recycling vehicles, according to Plant Ser
vices Director Jason Mavis. The site is located in
the Plant Services yard (between the fire station
and El Camino) and is being paved and fenced,
Mavis said.
Plant Services will spend about $5000 to im
prove the site, Abramson added and will receive
reimbursement from the project by August
1978. The site is expected to be completed in 30
to 60 days, Mavis said.
80 tons
Abramson said the recycling center hopes to
recycle about 80 tons a month, out of almost 680
tons of waste Stanford produces.
Containers will be placed in student resi
dences for newspapers, cans (aluminum and
steel) and glass, said Abramson. About once a
week, the recyclables will be picked up by some
of the six workers the project expects to hire,
Abramson said. The materials will be taken to
large bins at the recycling site.
From there, the markets and businesses who
purchase recyclables will pick up the materials.
"We want as many of the markets as possible
to pick up their recyclables," said Bob Wenzlau,
leader of a SWOPSI course on recycling and

co-author of the ASSU recycling proposal.
Wenzlau said he expects the project to be
hard work in the beginning.
"You don't make money off recycling, it is
primarily a service," he added.
In fact, there are some recyclables that are
worth "basically zero," he said.
These sorts of material are still collected be
cause people will recycle them. If the center can
obtain the recyclables that pay more than they
cost to pick up (for example, computer paper,
worth $160 a ton), then it is possible to pay for
the materials that cost more to pick up than they
pay (for example, steel cans), Wenzlau added.
"Some items are money makers, some are
losers" as far as recycling payoffs, Abramson
added. However, "they are all winners as far as
saving landfill space."
Cover expenses
The initial funds, about $20,000, for starting
the project will come from the two-quarter Â»ee
assessment approved in the October ASSU elec
tion, White said. Revenues generated from the
project are expected to cover operating ex
penses, he added.
White said he doesn't see a need for any
further fee assessments.
The managers are setting up markets for the
recyclables, working on publ'city for the pro
ject, purchasing a truck to collect the recycla
bles and constructing protective sheds on the
recycling site, Abramson said.
Abramson added he is "really excited about
the potential of recycling stuff and diverting it
from the Bay."
