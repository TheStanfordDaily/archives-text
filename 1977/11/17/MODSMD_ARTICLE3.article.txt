Review rejuvenated
The Stanford Review, published here between 1970
and 1975, with the primary purpose of publishing
undergraduate papers, may resume publication this
year under the auspices of the Academic Organiza
tions Board (AOB). If a proposal, currently being de
veloped, is accepted by AOB, the semiannual journal
will publish student essays and research papers on
any topic. It is anticipated that papers by graduate
students and professors will also be included.
In order to evaluate student support for the en
deavor, students with papers on hand which they
would like to see published are being asked to submit
them to the Review at the ASSU office, second floor
of Tresidder.
