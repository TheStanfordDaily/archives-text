# Egyptian, Syrian presidents discuss planned Israel visit

Damascus, Syria (AP) — Pres
ident Anwar Sadat of Egypt met
with Syrian President Hafez
Assad yesterday, seeking the
backing of his skeptical ally for
his proposed visit to Israel.
Informed diplomatic and Sy
rian sources said they believed
Sadat was trying to allay As
sad's fears he would make pri
vate deals on the first ever visit
of an Arab leader to Israel.
Sadat was likely to tell Assad
any trip to Israel is "meant to
change the Israeli mentality
about Arab intentions, and to
show the world who is serious
about peace and who is not,"
one Arab diplomat said.
Despite the drama of the
prospective meeting between
the two opposing Mideast
leaders and the optimism it
stirred, serious obstacles re

mained to a settlement in the
region — even to a bilateral
understanding between Egypt
and Israel.
Key Arab demands for Israeli
withdrawal from all occupied
territories and creation of a
Palestinian state, both re
peatedly rejected by the Is
raelis, were reiterated by a Sy
rian spokesman after Sadat and
Assad had completed two
rounds of talks.
The spokesman said the two
leaders agreed to "coordinate
their efforts for a just and last
ing peace in the Middle East
based on complete Israeli
withdrawal to pre-June 1967
borders and recognition of the
legitimate rights of the Palesti
nians." At this stage of the talks
the spokesman did not men
tion Sadat's proposed visit to

Israel.
In a cable to a peace
oriented leftist symposium in
Tel Aviv, Sadat repeated his in
sistence upon a Palestinian
state.
In Washington President
jimmy Carter said Sadat's trip
"will be a constructive step"
toward a new Mideast peace
conference. Speaking with re
porters, he also called the
proposed trip "a very courage
ous thing" and said he had
been in almost daily contact
with Sadat in recent weeks. He
did not elaborate.
Sadat's cabled greetings to
the Tel Aviv symposium was
seen as a gesture further indi
cating his peaceful intentions.
It was the first such message by
an Arab leader to an Israeli
event.
