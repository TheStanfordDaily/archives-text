The world hunger crisis per
sists. The famines of the
early 70s are over but millions
of people around the world are
either permanently hungry and
on the way to starvation or are
living on the edge of impend
ing tragedy. Famines only
make v the crisis more visible.
The large concentration of
human suffering and misery
which accompanies famines
captures our attention and
elicits our compassion. Yet the
millions of people who quietly
starve slide by unnoticed.
The hungry live even amidst
the well-fed and affluent. In
the Mid-peninsula alone, The
Ecumenical Hunger Project
served 10,000 hungry people

last year. Stanislaus County,
constituting some of America's
most productive farmland, was
officially declared a hunger
disaster area in 1969. Many
senior citizens in San Francisco
and other U.S. cities struggle
daily with nutritional need.
Many have to resort to dog
food to supplement their diets.
Ffunger has not gone away, it
has merely gone underground.
This world hunger crisis is
the product of scarcity
creating mechanisms which
have been at work on our food
and agriculture systems for
centuries. Most of the
mechanisms have come into
being as a means of coping
with the over-production
which comes when the hungry
of the world cannot afford to
pay the prices charged for the
food they need. Hungry
people do not constitute a
market for the accounting
sheets of the "global super
market."
The effects of these scarcity
creating mechanisms are
most obvious when a famine
occurs. From 1972 until 1974,
the Sahel of northwest Africa
was the victim of a particularly
severe famine; the cir
cumstances leading up to it, as

world's poor.

well as the famine itself, are
representative of the situation
in many other parts of the
world.
The Sahel was once known
as the bread basket of Africa.
The traditional agricultural sys
tem of wandering nomads and
small farmers was perfectly
suited to the food-producing
capacity and characteristics of
the area. Small farmers who
inhabited the southern region
of the Sahel stored millet for
flour, knowing that years of
drought would be coming.
This traditional system of
storing grains was destroyed
by colonization. The French
conquest of the land in the late
19th and early 20th centuries
depleted the population
through slave trade and war.
They also introduced peanuts
and cotton as cash crops. Taxes
depleted the reserves which

farmers had accrued.
When the Sahel countries
won independence in 1960, the
new government sought to
outdo the French. Higher taxes
and falling export prices forced
more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
crop production. The villagers
simply did not have enough
money to buy food. Still, dur
ing the worst year of famine,
export of food from the Sahel
continued. Over 60 per cent
went to North America, Europe

resources were consumed in producing it, or even that

you will be likely to eat it.

and the elite in Africa. In fact
many food exports increased
during the drought year, cattle
exports being one example.
In Mali (part of the Sahel),
production of food for local
consumption dropped sharply
in the early '70s. Corn produc
tion, a local staple, dropped by
one-third while cotton seed
production for export in
creased 400 per cent over nor
mal rainfall years. During the
drought Chad undertook a
major program to increase cot
ton production. Governments
and international lending in
stitutions subsidized the de
velopment of an infrastructure
for exporting, while internal
food distribution structures
were ignored. As one French
economist reported: "If
people are starving, it is not for
want of cotton."
The tragedy of it all is that
with one exception, every
Sahelian country actually pro
duced enough grain to feed its
total population, even during
the worst drought years. It was
the economic and social ban
kruptcy of the agricultural in
frastructure and market that
transformed the Sahel from a
land of milk and honey to a
land of famine. The economic
and political powers of the

Sahelic countries as well as the
climate are at the root of the
starvation experience there.
The tragic occurrences in the
Sahel have their roots in the
colonial period. With col
onialism came the view of ag
riculture as a way to extract
wealth. Agriculture was no
longer seen as a source of food
for local people. As people of
advantage sought their own in
terest, they instituted a system
of agriculture based on crop
exporting. Mono-cropping for
export replaced the self
providing, self-sustaining ag
riculture of the colonized land.
Most of the land was taken out
of local food production and
put into export crop produc
tion. The transition pushed
food production to more and
more marginal land, clearly
making it a secondary concern.

This reorganization of food
systems to fill European needs
was accomplished through
changes in the economies and
land tenure systems of the
countries. Rather than using
raw force to bend the indigen
ous populations to their ends,
the colonizers preferred to tax
them. The taxes had to be paid
in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for
export, divorcing the people
from self-provisioning agricul
ture. Often the cultivation of
export crops by local peasants
under their own auspices was
prohibited since peasants

could more efficiently grow
these same crops for export
than the colonizer, out
competing the colonizer in his
own trade.
Marketing boards emerged
in the 1930s as an effective way
to extract additional profits
from cash crops. This innova
tion foreshadowed to a degree
the present global supermar
ket structure. In 1937, the
cocoa producers of the Gold
Coast refused to sell unless
they received a higher price.
The British government inter
vened, buying all cocoa pro
duction and selling it to the
major cocoa companies. The
next year, the British set up the
West African Cocoa Board to
insure that a "fair" price was
paid to cocoa producers on the
one hand and that British Royal
Treasury and British cocoa
companies received
"adequate" profits on the
other.
By means of the marketing
boards, the price of export
crops was kept below world
market levels and at a level suf
ficient only to keep production
going. The profits of export
crops remained in the control
of the marketing boards and
European companies. Peanuts
cultivated in West Africa and

bought by the board were
often sold at a price seven
times greater than the price
paid to the peasants. This mar
keting scheme seriously neg
lected local food production
and firmly oriented food pro
duction in the direction of
European benefit.
On another level, the de
velopment of plantations
monopolized land use for col
onizer benefit. Land used for
export of luxury crops can not
be used to grow food for local
consumption. In many cases,
the land was not efficiently
used or may have even laid
idle. The purpose of agricul
ture was divorced from local
nutrition; food value was lost
to market value.
The large land holdings of
the typical colonial planter
required a large supply of

cheap labor in order to be pro
fitable. To supply this cheap
labor, self-provisioning ag
riculture was undercut by the
exclusive development of an
export-oriented agricultural in
frastructure and taxes. The
practices were made socially
tolerable by the removal of
tariffs on imported food. This
cheaply imported food de
stroyed the remaining market
for domestically produced
food, impoverishing local food
producers even further. Third
World countries became de
pendent on food imports, a
development which would
have profound historical con
sequences. Any interruption in
food imports would mean

hardship for the indigenous
population which would have
no local diversified food sys
tem to fall back on.
The basic scheme of the
global farm system was thus es
tablished: export monocul
ture. Also, the foundation of
global supermarket was laid —
a controlled marketing system
responsive only to those who
can pay the going price for
food, to those whose com
bined purchasing power con
stitutes a viable market in the
accounting terms of either col
onial ruler or multinational ag
ribusiness.
The outcome of this histori
cal scenario was predictable:
declining food production and
greater food imports, increas
ing impoverishment, growing
vulnerability to the constant
fluctuations in the interna
tional market and internally
uneven growth.
The value of food was mea
sured in terms other than nutri
tional value for the local popu
lation; the well-being of the
colonized rural population was
sacrificed to the profits of the
colonizing Europeans.
The Green Revolution played
an important role in the de
velopment of global super-

markets and farms. The ag
ricultural history of Mexico
provides a typical example of
the circumstances under
which the Green Revolution
"swept the world."
In 1934, Mexico's President
Lazaro Cardinas began to enact
sweeping agrarian reforms to
build the infrastructure which
would make peasant self
provisioning agriculture
economically feasible. The re
forms proved counter to the
development of industrial cap
ital and the export monocrop
ping which was, by and large,
directed toward the benefit of
U.S. business.
In the 19405, the U.S. needed
cheap manufactured and ag
ricultural goods from Mexico
to support the war effort. In
1942, Avila Camacho became
the President of Mexico. Over
turning the reforms of Car

denas, he began agriculture
and industrial development
which needed cheap labor to
insure large industrial and ag
ribusiness profits. Getting
more cheap food to urban
areas was critical to supplying
this large cheap labor supply.
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foun
dation joined with the Mexican
government in an effort to
create the food supply neces
sary for rapid urban-centered
industrialization. (Cardenas
had nationalized Rockefeller's
Standard Oil subsidiary and
foreign-owned railroads as
part of his agrarian develop
ment policies.)
The research was focused on
capital-intensive inputs to be

used in almost ideal conditions
in the best endowed areas: in a
word, away from the
subsistence-self-provisioning
sectors of Mexican agriculture
and toward U.S. and Mexican
agribusiness. The Mexican
government, by subsidizing
agricultural mechanization and
the development of irrigation
systems to be used by large
land holders, insured that large
land holding and cheap farm
labor would continue as the
base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.
The Green Revolution re
duced agriculture to a prob
lem of production alone. Rural
development was not integral.
The result is that the food sys
tem is oriented away from
meeting the needs of local
people; poverty and inequality
are deepened. Quantity and
market value, divorced from
nutritional value, become the
sole measure of agriculture.
Lappe and Collins, in their
book "Food First," report that
an "increase in poverty has
been associated not with a fall
but a rise in per capita produc-

tion of cereal, the main com
ponent of the diet of the
poor."
The increased food produc
tion of the Green Revolution
has not gone to hungry people.
By and large, it has gone to
urban and upper-income
groups. (The increased pro
duction in the Philippines and
Mexico has benefited emerg
ing industrialists and their
foreign partners who want to
have cheap food for workers in
urban industries in order to
keep wage demands low.)
Some of it gets reduced to lux
ury products the poor cannot
afford. Some of it gets fed to
livestock to create meat that
the majority of the local popu
lation cannot afford. Some of
the increased production is
simply thrown away.

in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for
export, divorcing the people
from self-provisioning agricul
ture. Often the cultivation of
export crops by local peasants
under their own auspices was
prohibited since peasants

could more efficiently grow
these same crops for export
than the colonizer, out
competing the colonizer in his
own trade.
Marketing boards emerged
in the 1930s as an effective way
to extract additional profits
from cash crops. This innova
tion foreshadowed to a degree
the present global supermar
ket structure. In 1937, the
cocoa producers of the Gold
Coast refused to sell unless
they received a higher price.
The British government inter
vened, buying all cocoa pro
duction and selling it to the
major cocoa companies. The
next year, the British set up the
West African Cocoa Board to
insure that a "fair" price was
paid to cocoa producers on the
one hand and that British Royal
Treasury and British cocoa
companies received
"adequate" profits on the
other.
By means of the marketing
boards, the price of export
crops was kept below world
market levels and at a level suf
ficient only to keep production
going. The profits of export
crops remained in the control
of the marketing boards and
European companies. Peanuts
cultivated in West Africa and

bought by the board were
often sold at a price seven
times greater than the price
paid to the peasants. This mar
keting scheme seriously neg
lected local food production
and firmly oriented food pro
duction in the direction of
European benefit.
On another level, the de
velopment of plantations
monopolized land use for col
onizer benefit. Land used for
export of luxury crops can not
be used to grow food for local
consumption. In many cases,
the land was not efficiently
used or may have even laid
idle. The purpose of agricul
ture was divorced from local
nutrition; food value was lost
to market value.
The large land holdings of
the typical colonial planter
required a large supply of

cheap labor in order to be pro
fitable. To supply this cheap
labor, self-provisioning ag
riculture was undercut by the
exclusive development of an
export-oriented agricultural in
frastructure and taxes. The
practices were made socially
tolerable by the removal of
tariffs on imported food. This
cheaply imported food de
stroyed the remaining market
for domestically produced
food, impoverishing local food
producers even further. Third
World countries became de
pendent on food imports, a
development which would
have profound historical con
sequences. Any interruption in
food imports would mean

hardship for the indigenous
population which would have
no local diversified food sys
tem to fall back on.
The basic scheme of the
global farm system was thus es
tablished: export monocul
ture. Also, the foundation of
global supermarket was laid —
a controlled marketing system
responsive only to those who
can pay the going price for
food, to those whose com
bined purchasing power con
stitutes a viable market in the
accounting terms of either col
onial ruler or multinational ag
ribusiness.
The outcome of this histori
cal scenario was predictable:
declining food production and
greater food imports, increas
ing impoverishment, growing
vulnerability to the constant
fluctuations in the interna
tional market and internally
uneven growth.
The value of food was mea
sured in terms other than nutri
tional value for the local popu
lation; the well-being of the
colonized rural population was
sacrificed to the profits of the
colonizing Europeans.
The Green Revolution played

velopment of global super-

markets and farms. The ag
ricultural history of Mexico
provides a typical example of
the circumstances under
which the Green Revolution
"swept the world."
In 1934, Mexico's President
Lazaro Cardinas began to enact
sweeping agrarian reforms to
build the infrastructure which
would make peasant self
provisioning agriculture
economically feasible. The re
forms proved counter to the
development of industrial cap
ital and the export monocrop
ping which was, by and large,
directed toward the benefit of
U.S. business.
In the 19405, the U.S. needed
cheap manufactured and ag
ricultural goods from Mexico
to support the war effort. In
1942, Avila Camacho became
the President of Mexico. Over
turning the reforms of Car

denas, he began agriculture
and industrial development
which needed cheap labor to
insure large industrial and ag
ribusiness profits. Getting
more cheap food to urban
areas was critical to supplying
this large cheap labor supply.
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foun
dation joined with the Mexican
government in an effort to
create the food supply neces
sary for rapid urban-centered
industrialization. (Cardenas
had nationalized Rockefeller's
Standard Oil subsidiary and
foreign-owned railroads as
part of his agrarian develop
ment policies.)
The research was focused on
capital-intensive inputs to be

used in almost ideal conditions
in the best endowed areas: in a
word, away from the
subsistence-self-provisioning
sectors of Mexican agriculture
and toward U.S. and Mexican
agribusiness. The Mexican
government, by subsidizing
agricultural mechanization and
the development of irrigation
systems to be used by large
land holders, insured that large
land holding and cheap farm
labor would continue as the
base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.
The Green Revolution re
duced agriculture to a prob
lem of production alone. Rural
development was not integral.
The result is that the food sys
tem is oriented away from
meeting the needs of local
people; poverty and inequality
are deepened. Quantity and
market value, divorced from
nutritional value, become the
sole measure of agriculture.
Lappe and Collins, in their
book "Food First," report that
an "increase in poverty has
been associated not with a fall
but a rise in per capita produc-

tion of cereal, the main com
ponent of the diet of the
poor."
The increased food produc
tion of the Green Revolution
has not gone to hungry people.
By and large, it has gone to
urban and upper-income
groups. (The increased pro
duction in the Philippines and
Mexico has benefited emerg
ing industrialists and their
foreign partners who want to
have cheap food for workers in
urban industries in order to
keep wage demands low.)
Some of it gets reduced to lux
ury products the poor cannot
afford. Some of it gets fed to
livestock to create meat that
the majority of the local popu
lation cannot afford. Some of
the increased production is
simply thrown away.
The Green Revolution made

The world hunger crisis per
sists. The famines of the
early 70s are over but millions
of people around the world are
either permanently hungry and
on the way to starvation or are
living on the edge of impend
ing tragedy. Famines only
make v the crisis more visible.
The large concentration of
human suffering and misery
which accompanies famines
captures our attention and
elicits our compassion. Yet the
millions of people who quietly
starve slide by unnoticed.
The hungry live even amidst
the well-fed and affluent. In
the Mid-peninsula alone, The
Ecumenical Hunger Project
served 10,000 hungry people

last year. Stanislaus County,
constituting some of America's
most productive farmland, was
officially declared a hunger
disaster area in 1969. Many
senior citizens in San Francisco
and other U.S. cities struggle
daily with nutritional need.
Many have to resort to dog
food to supplement their diets.
Ffunger has not gone away, it
has merely gone underground.
This world hunger crisis is
the product of scarcity
creating mechanisms which
have been at work on our food
and agriculture systems for
centuries. Most of the
mechanisms have come into
being as a means of coping
with the over-production
which comes when the hungry
of the world cannot afford to
pay the prices charged for the
food they need. Hungry
people do not constitute a
market for the accounting
sheets of the "global super
market."
The effects of these scarcity
creating mechanisms are
most obvious when a famine
occurs. From 1972 until 1974,
the Sahel of northwest Africa
was the victim of a particularly
severe famine; the cir
cumstances leading up to it, as

well as the famine itself, are
representative of the situation
in many other parts of the
world.
The Sahel was once known
as the bread basket of Africa.
The traditional agricultural sys
tem of wandering nomads and
small farmers was perfectly
suited to the food-producing
capacity and characteristics of
the area. Small farmers who
inhabited the southern region
of the Sahel stored millet for
flour, knowing that years of
drought would be coming.
This traditional system of
storing grains was destroyed
by colonization. The French
conquest of the land in the late
19th and early 20th centuries
depleted the population
through slave trade and war.
They also introduced peanuts
and cotton as cash crops. Taxes
depleted the reserves which

farmers had accrued.
When the Sahel countries
won independence in 1960, the
new government sought to
outdo the French. Higher taxes
and falling export prices forced
more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
crop production. The villagers
simply did not have enough
money to buy food. Still, dur
ing the worst year of famine,
export of food from the Sahel
continued. Over 60 per cent
went to North America, Europe

and the elite in Africa. In fact
many food exports increased
during the drought year, cattle
exports being one example.
In Mali (part of the Sahel),
production of food for local
consumption dropped sharply
in the early '70s. Corn produc
tion, a local staple, dropped by
one-third while cotton seed
production for export in
creased 400 per cent over nor
mal rainfall years. During the
drought Chad undertook a
major program to increase cot
ton production. Governments
and international lending in
stitutions subsidized the de
velopment of an infrastructure
for exporting, while internal
food distribution structures
were ignored. As one French
economist reported: "If
people are starving, it is not for
want of cotton."
The tragedy of it all is that
with one exception, every
Sahelian country actually pro
duced enough grain to feed its
total population, even during
the worst drought years. It was
the economic and social ban
kruptcy of the agricultural in
frastructure and market that
transformed the Sahel from a
land of milk and honey to a
land of famine. The economic
and political powers of the

Sahelic countries as well as the
climate are at the root of the
starvation experience there.
The tragic occurrences in the
Sahel have their roots in the
colonial period. With col
onialism came the view of ag
riculture as a way to extract
wealth. Agriculture was no
longer seen as a source of food
for local people. As people of
advantage sought their own in
terest, they instituted a system
of agriculture based on crop
exporting. Mono-cropping for
export replaced the self
providing, self-sustaining ag
riculture of the colonized land.
Most of the land was taken out
of local food production and
put into export crop produc
tion. The transition pushed
food production to more and
more marginal land, clearly
making it a secondary concern.

This reorganization of food
systems to fill European needs
was accomplished through
changes in the economies and
land tenure systems of the
countries. Rather than using
raw force to bend the indigen
ous populations to their ends,
the colonizers preferred to tax
them. The taxes had to be paid
in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for

base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.
The Green Revolution re
duced agriculture to a prob
lem of production alone. Rural
development was not integral.
The result is that the food sys
tem is oriented away from
meeting the needs of local
people; poverty and inequality
are deepened. Quantity and
market value, divorced from
nutritional value, become the
sole measure of agriculture.
Lappe and Collins, in their
book "Food First," report that
an "increase in poverty has
been associated not with a fall
but a rise in per capita produc-

tion of cereal, the main com
ponent of the diet of the
poor."
The increased food produc
tion of the Green Revolution
has not gone to hungry people.
By and large, it has gone to
urban and upper-income
groups. (The increased pro
duction in the Philippines and
Mexico has benefited emerg
ing industrialists and their
foreign partners who want to
have cheap food for workers in
urban industries in order to
keep wage demands low.)
Some of it gets reduced to lux
ury products the poor cannot
afford. Some of it gets fed to
livestock to create meat that
the majority of the local popu
lation cannot afford. Some of
the increased production is
simply thrown away.

early 70s are over but millions
of people around the world are
either permanently hungry and
on the way to starvation or are

The large concentration of
human suffering and misery
which accompanies famines

millions of people who quietly
starve slide by unnoticed.
The hungry live even amidst
the well-fed and affluent. In
the Mid-peninsula alone, The
Ecumenical Hunger Project
served 10,000 hungry people

last year. Stanislaus County,
constituting some of America's
most productive farmland, was
officially declared a hunger
disaster area in 1969. Many
senior citizens in San Francisco
and other U.S. cities struggle
daily with nutritional need.
Many have to resort to dog
food to supplement their diets.
Ffunger has not gone away, it
has merely gone underground.
This world hunger crisis is
the product of scarcity
creating mechanisms which
have been at work on our food
and agriculture systems for
centuries. Most of the
mechanisms have come into
being as a means of coping
with the over-production
which comes when the hungry
of the world cannot afford to
pay the prices charged for the
food they need. Hungry
people do not constitute a
market for the accounting
sheets of the "global super
market."
The effects of these scarcity
creating mechanisms are
most obvious when a famine
occurs. From 1972 until 1974,
the Sahel of northwest Africa
was the victim of a particularly
severe famine; the cir
cumstances leading up to it, as

well as the famine itself, are
representative of the situation
in many other parts of the
world.
The Sahel was once known
as the bread basket of Africa.
The traditional agricultural sys
tem of wandering nomads and
small farmers was perfectly
suited to the food-producing
capacity and characteristics of
the area. Small farmers who
inhabited the southern region
of the Sahel stored millet for
flour, knowing that years of
drought would be coming.
This traditional system of
storing grains was destroyed
by colonization. The French
conquest of the land in the late
19th and early 20th centuries
depleted the population
through slave trade and war.
They also introduced peanuts
and cotton as cash crops. Taxes
depleted the reserves which

farmers had accrued.
When the Sahel countries
won independence in 1960, the
new government sought to
outdo the French. Higher taxes
and falling export prices forced
more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
crop production. The villagers
simply did not have enough
money to buy food. Still, dur
ing the worst year of famine,
export of food from the Sahel
continued. Over 60 per cent
went to North America, Europe

and the elite in Africa. In fact
many food exports increased
during the drought year, cattle
exports being one example.
In Mali (part of the Sahel),
production of food for local
consumption dropped sharply
in the early '70s. Corn produc
tion, a local staple, dropped by
one-third while cotton seed
production for export in
creased 400 per cent over nor
mal rainfall years. During the
drought Chad undertook a
major program to increase cot
ton production. Governments
and international lending in
stitutions subsidized the de
velopment of an infrastructure
for exporting, while internal
food distribution structures
were ignored. As one French
economist reported: "If
people are starving, it is not for
want of cotton."
The tragedy of it all is that
with one exception, every
Sahelian country actually pro
duced enough grain to feed its
total population, even during
the worst drought years. It was
the economic and social ban
kruptcy of the agricultural in
frastructure and market that
transformed the Sahel from a
land of milk and honey to a
land of famine. The economic
and political powers of the

Sahelic countries as well as the
climate are at the root of the
starvation experience there.
The tragic occurrences in the
Sahel have their roots in the
colonial period. With col
onialism came the view of ag
riculture as a way to extract
wealth. Agriculture was no
longer seen as a source of food
for local people. As people of
advantage sought their own in
terest, they instituted a system
of agriculture based on crop
exporting. Mono-cropping for
export replaced the self
providing, self-sustaining ag
riculture of the colonized land.
Most of the land was taken out
of local food production and
put into export crop produc
tion. The transition pushed
food production to more and
more marginal land, clearly
making it a secondary concern.

This reorganization of food
systems to fill European needs
was accomplished through
changes in the economies and
land tenure systems of the
countries. Rather than using
raw force to bend the indigen
ous populations to their ends,
the colonizers preferred to tax
them. The taxes had to be paid
in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for
export, divorcing the people
from self-provisioning agricul
ture. Often the cultivation of
export crops by local peasants
under their own auspices was
prohibited since peasants

could more efficiently grow
these same crops for export
than the colonizer, out
competing the colonizer in his
own trade.
Marketing boards emerged
in the 1930s as an effective way
to extract additional profits
from cash crops. This innova
tion foreshadowed to a degree
the present global supermar
ket structure. In 1937, the
cocoa producers of the Gold
Coast refused to sell unless
they received a higher price.
The British government inter
vened, buying all cocoa pro
duction and selling it to the
major cocoa companies. The
next year, the British set up the
West African Cocoa Board to
insure that a "fair" price was
paid to cocoa producers on the
one hand and that British Royal
Treasury and British cocoa
companies received
"adequate" profits on the
other.
By means of the marketing
boards, the price of export
crops was kept below world
market levels and at a level suf
ficient only to keep production
going. The profits of export
crops remained in the control
of the marketing boards and
European companies. Peanuts
cultivated in West Africa and

bought by the board were
often sold at a price seven
times greater than the price
paid to the peasants. This mar
keting scheme seriously neg
lected local food production
and firmly oriented food pro
duction in the direction of
European benefit.
On another level, the de
velopment of plantations
monopolized land use for col
onizer benefit. Land used for
export of luxury crops can not
be used to grow food for local
consumption. In many cases,
the land was not efficiently
used or may have even laid
idle. The purpose of agricul
ture was divorced from local
nutrition; food value was lost
to market value.
The large land holdings of
the typical colonial planter
required a large supply of

cheap labor in order to be pro
fitable. To supply this cheap
labor, self-provisioning ag
riculture was undercut by the
exclusive development of an
export-oriented agricultural in
frastructure and taxes. The
practices were made socially
tolerable by the removal of
tariffs on imported food. This
cheaply imported food de
stroyed the remaining market
for domestically produced
food, impoverishing local food
producers even further. Third
World countries became de
pendent on food imports, a
development which would
have profound historical con
sequences. Any interruption in
food imports would mean

hardship for the indigenous
population which would have
no local diversified food sys
tem to fall back on.
The basic scheme of the
global farm system was thus es
tablished: export monocul
ture. Also, the foundation of
global supermarket was laid —
a controlled marketing system
responsive only to those who
can pay the going price for
food, to those whose com
bined purchasing power con
stitutes a viable market in the
accounting terms of either col
onial ruler or multinational ag
ribusiness.
The outcome of this histori
cal scenario was predictable:
declining food production and
greater food imports, increas
ing impoverishment, growing
vulnerability to the constant
fluctuations in the interna
tional market and internally
uneven growth.
The value of food was mea
sured in terms other than nutri
tional value for the local popu
lation; the well-being of the
colonized rural population was
sacrificed to the profits of the
colonizing Europeans.
The Green Revolution played
an important role in the de
velopment of global super-

markets and farms. The ag
ricultural history of Mexico
provides a typical example of
the circumstances under
which the Green Revolution
"swept the world."
In 1934, Mexico's President
Lazaro Cardinas began to enact
sweeping agrarian reforms to
build the infrastructure which
would make peasant self
provisioning agriculture
economically feasible. The re
forms proved counter to the
development of industrial cap
ital and the export monocrop
ping which was, by and large,
directed toward the benefit of
U.S. business.
In the 19405, the U.S. needed
cheap manufactured and ag
ricultural goods from Mexico
to support the war effort. In
1942, Avila Camacho became
the President of Mexico. Over
turning the reforms of Car

denas, he began agriculture
and industrial development
which needed cheap labor to
insure large industrial and ag
ribusiness profits. Getting
more cheap food to urban
areas was critical to supplying
this large cheap labor supply.
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foun
dation joined with the Mexican
government in an effort to
create the food supply neces
sary for rapid urban-centered
industrialization. (Cardenas
had nationalized Rockefeller's
Standard Oil subsidiary and
foreign-owned railroads as
part of his agrarian develop
ment policies.)
The research was focused on
capital-intensive inputs to be

used in almost ideal conditions
in the best endowed areas: in a
word, away from the
subsistence-self-provisioning
sectors of Mexican agriculture
and toward U.S. and Mexican
agribusiness. The Mexican
government, by subsidizing
agricultural mechanization and
the development of irrigation
systems to be used by large
land holders, insured that large
land holding and cheap farm
labor would continue as the
base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.

The tragedy of it all is that
with one exception, every
Sahelian country actually pro
duced enough grain to feed its
total population, even during
the worst drought years. It was
the economic and social ban
kruptcy of the agricultural in
frastructure and market that
transformed the Sahel from a
land of milk and honey to a
land of famine. The economic
and political powers of the

Sahelic countries as well as the
climate are at the root of the
starvation experience there.
The tragic occurrences in the
Sahel have their roots in the
colonial period. With col
onialism came the view of ag
riculture as a way to extract
wealth. Agriculture was no
longer seen as a source of food
for local people. As people of
advantage sought their own in
terest, they instituted a system
of agriculture based on crop
exporting. Mono-cropping for
export replaced the self
providing, self-sustaining ag
riculture of the colonized land.
Most of the land was taken out
of local food production and
put into export crop produc
tion. The transition pushed
food production to more and
more marginal land, clearly
making it a secondary concern.

This reorganization of food
systems to fill European needs
was accomplished through
changes in the economies and
land tenure systems of the
countries. Rather than using
raw force to bend the indigen
ous populations to their ends,
the colonizers preferred to tax
them. The taxes had to be paid
in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for
export, divorcing the people
from self-provisioning agricul
ture. Often the cultivation of
export crops by local peasants
under their own auspices was
prohibited since peasants

could more efficiently grow
these same crops for export
than the colonizer, out
competing the colonizer in his
own trade.
Marketing boards emerged
in the 1930s as an effective way
to extract additional profits
from cash crops. This innova
tion foreshadowed to a degree
the present global supermar
ket structure. In 1937, the
cocoa producers of the Gold
Coast refused to sell unless
they received a higher price.
The British government inter
vened, buying all cocoa pro
duction and selling it to the
major cocoa companies. The
next year, the British set up the
West African Cocoa Board to
insure that a "fair" price was
paid to cocoa producers on the
one hand and that British Royal
Treasury and British cocoa
companies received
"adequate" profits on the
other.
By means of the marketing
boards, the price of export
crops was kept below world
market levels and at a level suf
ficient only to keep production
going. The profits of export
crops remained in the control
of the marketing boards and
European companies. Peanuts
cultivated in West Africa and

bought by the board were
often sold at a price seven
times greater than the price
paid to the peasants. This mar
keting scheme seriously neg
lected local food production
and firmly oriented food pro
duction in the direction of
European benefit.
On another level, the de
velopment of plantations
monopolized land use for col
onizer benefit. Land used for
export of luxury crops can not
be used to grow food for local
consumption. In many cases,
the land was not efficiently
used or may have even laid
idle. The purpose of agricul
ture was divorced from local
nutrition; food value was lost
to market value.
The large land holdings of
the typical colonial planter
required a large supply of

cheap labor in order to be pro
fitable. To supply this cheap
labor, self-provisioning ag
riculture was undercut by the
exclusive development of an
export-oriented agricultural in
frastructure and taxes. The
practices were made socially
tolerable by the removal of
tariffs on imported food. This
cheaply imported food de
stroyed the remaining market
for domestically produced
food, impoverishing local food
producers even further. Third
World countries became de
pendent on food imports, a
development which would
have profound historical con
sequences. Any interruption in
food imports would mean

hardship for the indigenous
population which would have
no local diversified food sys
tem to fall back on.
The basic scheme of the
global farm system was thus es
tablished: export monocul
ture. Also, the foundation of
global supermarket was laid —
a controlled marketing system
responsive only to those who
can pay the going price for
food, to those whose com
bined purchasing power con
stitutes a viable market in the
accounting terms of either col
onial ruler or multinational ag
ribusiness.
The outcome of this histori
cal scenario was predictable:
declining food production and
greater food imports, increas
ing impoverishment, growing
vulnerability to the constant
fluctuations in the interna
tional market and internally
uneven growth.
The value of food was mea
sured in terms other than nutri
tional value for the local popu
lation; the well-being of the
colonized rural population was
sacrificed to the profits of the
colonizing Europeans.
The Green Revolution played
an important role in the de
velopment of global super-

markets and farms. The ag
ricultural history of Mexico
provides a typical example of
the circumstances under
which the Green Revolution
"swept the world."
In 1934, Mexico's President
Lazaro Cardinas began to enact
sweeping agrarian reforms to
build the infrastructure which
would make peasant self
provisioning agriculture
economically feasible. The re
forms proved counter to the
development of industrial cap
ital and the export monocrop
ping which was, by and large,
directed toward the benefit of
U.S. business.
In the 19405, the U.S. needed
cheap manufactured and ag
ricultural goods from Mexico
to support the war effort. In
1942, Avila Camacho became
the President of Mexico. Over
turning the reforms of Car

denas, he began agriculture
and industrial development
which needed cheap labor to
insure large industrial and ag
ribusiness profits. Getting
more cheap food to urban
areas was critical to supplying
this large cheap labor supply.
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foun
dation joined with the Mexican
government in an effort to
create the food supply neces
sary for rapid urban-centered
industrialization. (Cardenas
had nationalized Rockefeller's
Standard Oil subsidiary and
foreign-owned railroads as
part of his agrarian develop
ment policies.)
The research was focused on
capital-intensive inputs to be

used in almost ideal conditions
in the best endowed areas: in a
word, away from the
subsistence-self-provisioning
sectors of Mexican agriculture
and toward U.S. and Mexican
agribusiness. The Mexican
government, by subsidizing
agricultural mechanization and
the development of irrigation
systems to be used by large
land holders, insured that large
land holding and cheap farm
labor would continue as the
base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.
The Green Revolution re
duced agriculture to a prob
lem of production alone. Rural
development was not integral.
The result is that the food sys
tem is oriented away from
meeting the needs of local
people; poverty and inequality
are deepened. Quantity and
market value, divorced from
nutritional value, become the
sole measure of agriculture.
Lappe and Collins, in their
book "Food First," report that
an "increase in poverty has
been associated not with a fall
but a rise in per capita produc-

tion of cereal, the main com
ponent of the diet of the
poor."
The increased food produc
tion of the Green Revolution
has not gone to hungry people.
By and large, it has gone to
urban and upper-income
groups. (The increased pro
duction in the Philippines and
Mexico has benefited emerg
ing industrialists and their
foreign partners who want to
have cheap food for workers in
urban industries in order to
keep wage demands low.)
Some of it gets reduced to lux
ury products the poor cannot
afford. Some of it gets fed to
livestock to create meat that
the majority of the local popu
lation cannot afford. Some of
the increased production is
simply thrown away.

The world hunger crisis per
sists. The famines of the
early 70s are over but millions
of people around the world are
either permanently hungry and
on the way to starvation or are
living on the edge of impend
ing tragedy. Famines only
make v the crisis more visible.
The large concentration of
human suffering and misery
which accompanies famines
captures our attention and
elicits our compassion. Yet the
millions of people who quietly
starve slide by unnoticed.
The hungry live even amidst
the well-fed and affluent. In
the Mid-peninsula alone, The
Ecumenical Hunger Project
served 10,000 hungry people

last year. Stanislaus County,
constituting some of America's
most productive farmland, was
officially declared a hunger
disaster area in 1969. Many
senior citizens in San Francisco
and other U.S. cities struggle
daily with nutritional need.
Many have to resort to dog
food to supplement their diets.
Ffunger has not gone away, it
has merely gone underground.
This world hunger crisis is
the product of scarcity
creating mechanisms which
have been at work on our food
and agriculture systems for
centuries. Most of the
mechanisms have come into
being as a means of coping
with the over-production
which comes when the hungry
of the world cannot afford to
pay the prices charged for the
food they need. Hungry
people do not constitute a
market for the accounting
sheets of the "global super
market."
The effects of these scarcity
creating mechanisms are
most obvious when a famine
occurs. From 1972 until 1974,
the Sahel of northwest Africa
was the victim of a particularly
severe famine; the cir
cumstances leading up to it, as

well as the famine itself, are
representative of the situation
in many other parts of the
world.
The Sahel was once known
as the bread basket of Africa.
The traditional agricultural sys
tem of wandering nomads and
small farmers was perfectly
suited to the food-producing
capacity and characteristics of
the area. Small farmers who
inhabited the southern region
of the Sahel stored millet for
flour, knowing that years of
drought would be coming.
This traditional system of
storing grains was destroyed
by colonization. The French
conquest of the land in the late
19th and early 20th centuries
depleted the population
through slave trade and war.
They also introduced peanuts
and cotton as cash crops. Taxes
depleted the reserves which

farmers had accrued.
When the Sahel countries
won independence in 1960, the
new government sought to
outdo the French. Higher taxes
and falling export prices forced
more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
crop production. The villagers
simply did not have enough
money to buy food. Still, dur
ing the worst year of famine,
export of food from the Sahel
continued. Over 60 per cent
went to North America, Europe

and the elite in Africa. In fact
many food exports increased
during the drought year, cattle
exports being one example.
In Mali (part of the Sahel),
production of food for local
consumption dropped sharply
in the early '70s. Corn produc
tion, a local staple, dropped by
one-third while cotton seed
production for export in
creased 400 per cent over nor
mal rainfall years. During the
drought Chad undertook a
major program to increase cot
ton production. Governments
and international lending in
stitutions subsidized the de
velopment of an infrastructure
for exporting, while internal
food distribution structures
were ignored. As one French
economist reported: "If
people are starving, it is not for
want of cotton."

forms proved counter to the
development of industrial cap
ital and the export monocrop
ping which was, by and large,
directed toward the benefit of
U.S. business.
In the 19405, the U.S. needed
cheap manufactured and ag
ricultural goods from Mexico
to support the war effort. In
1942, Avila Camacho became
the President of Mexico. Over
turning the reforms of Car

denas, he began agriculture
and industrial development
which needed cheap labor to
insure large industrial and ag
ribusiness profits. Getting
more cheap food to urban
areas was critical to supplying
this large cheap labor supply.
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foun
dation joined with the Mexican
government in an effort to
create the food supply neces
sary for rapid urban-centered
industrialization. (Cardenas
had nationalized Rockefeller's
Standard Oil subsidiary and
foreign-owned railroads as
part of his agrarian develop
ment policies.)
The research was focused on
capital-intensive inputs to be

used in almost ideal conditions
in the best endowed areas: in a
word, away from the
subsistence-self-provisioning
sectors of Mexican agriculture
and toward U.S. and Mexican
agribusiness. The Mexican
government, by subsidizing
agricultural mechanization and
the development of irrigation
systems to be used by large
land holders, insured that large
land holding and cheap farm
labor would continue as the
base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.
The Green Revolution re
duced agriculture to a prob
lem of production alone. Rural
development was not integral.
The result is that the food sys
tem is oriented away from
meeting the needs of local
people; poverty and inequality
are deepened. Quantity and
market value, divorced from
nutritional value, become the
sole measure of agriculture.
Lappe and Collins, in their
book "Food First," report that
an "increase in poverty has
been associated not with a fall
but a rise in per capita produc-

tion of cereal, the main com
ponent of the diet of the
poor."
The increased food produc
tion of the Green Revolution
has not gone to hungry people.
By and large, it has gone to
urban and upper-income
groups. (The increased pro
duction in the Philippines and
Mexico has benefited emerg
ing industrialists and their
foreign partners who want to
have cheap food for workers in
urban industries in order to
keep wage demands low.)
Some of it gets reduced to lux

afford. Some of it gets fed to
livestock to create meat that
the majority of the local popu

the increased production is

The world hunger crisis per

early 70s are over but millions
of people around the world are
either permanently hungry and
on the way to starvation or are
living on the edge of impend
ing tragedy. Famines only
make v the crisis more visible.
The large concentration of
human suffering and misery
which accompanies famines
captures our attention and
elicits our compassion. Yet the
millions of people who quietly
starve slide by unnoticed.
The hungry live even amidst
the well-fed and affluent. In
the Mid-peninsula alone, The
Ecumenical Hunger Project
served 10,000 hungry people

last year. Stanislaus County,
constituting some of America's
most productive farmland, was
officially declared a hunger
disaster area in 1969. Many
senior citizens in San Francisco
and other U.S. cities struggle
daily with nutritional need.
Many have to resort to dog
food to supplement their diets.
Ffunger has not gone away, it
has merely gone underground.
This world hunger crisis is
the product of scarcity
creating mechanisms which
have been at work on our food
and agriculture systems for
centuries. Most of the
mechanisms have come into
being as a means of coping
with the over-production
which comes when the hungry
of the world cannot afford to
pay the prices charged for the
food they need. Hungry
people do not constitute a
market for the accounting
sheets of the "global super
market."
The effects of these scarcity
creating mechanisms are
most obvious when a famine
occurs. From 1972 until 1974,
the Sahel of northwest Africa
was the victim of a particularly
severe famine; the cir
cumstances leading up to it, as

well as the famine itself, are
representative of the situation
in many other parts of the
world.
The Sahel was once known
as the bread basket of Africa.
The traditional agricultural sys
tem of wandering nomads and
small farmers was perfectly
suited to the food-producing
capacity and characteristics of
the area. Small farmers who
inhabited the southern region
of the Sahel stored millet for
flour, knowing that years of
drought would be coming.
This traditional system of
storing grains was destroyed
by colonization. The French
conquest of the land in the late
19th and early 20th centuries
depleted the population
through slave trade and war.
They also introduced peanuts
and cotton as cash crops. Taxes
depleted the reserves which

farmers had accrued.
When the Sahel countries
won independence in 1960, the
new government sought to
outdo the French. Higher taxes
and falling export prices forced
more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
crop production. The villagers
simply did not have enough
money to buy food. Still, dur
ing the worst year of famine,
export of food from the Sahel
continued. Over 60 per cent
went to North America, Europe

abundance or that your country's natural and financial
resources were consumed in producing it, or even that

you will be likely to eat it.

and the elite in Africa. In fact
many food exports increased
during the drought year, cattle
exports being one example.
In Mali (part of the Sahel),
production of food for local
consumption dropped sharply
in the early '70s. Corn produc
tion, a local staple, dropped by
one-third while cotton seed
production for export in
creased 400 per cent over nor
mal rainfall years. During the
drought Chad undertook a
major program to increase cot
ton production. Governments
and international lending in
stitutions subsidized the de
velopment of an infrastructure
for exporting, while internal
food distribution structures
were ignored. As one French
economist reported: "If
people are starving, it is not for
want of cotton."
The tragedy of it all is that
with one exception, every
Sahelian country actually pro
duced enough grain to feed its
total population, even during
the worst drought years. It was
the economic and social ban
kruptcy of the agricultural in
frastructure and market that
transformed the Sahel from a
land of milk and honey to a
land of famine. The economic
and political powers of the

Sahelic countries as well as the
climate are at the root of the
starvation experience there.
The tragic occurrences in the
Sahel have their roots in the
colonial period. With col
onialism came the view of ag
riculture as a way to extract
wealth. Agriculture was no
longer seen as a source of food
for local people. As people of
advantage sought their own in
terest, they instituted a system
of agriculture based on crop
exporting. Mono-cropping for
export replaced the self
providing, self-sustaining ag
riculture of the colonized land.
Most of the land was taken out
of local food production and
put into export crop produc
tion. The transition pushed
food production to more and
more marginal land, clearly
making it a secondary concern.

This reorganization of food
systems to fill European needs
was accomplished through
changes in the economies and
land tenure systems of the
countries. Rather than using
raw force to bend the indigen
ous populations to their ends,
the colonizers preferred to tax
them. The taxes had to be paid
in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for
export, divorcing the people
from self-provisioning agricul
ture. Often the cultivation of
export crops by local peasants
under their own auspices was
prohibited since peasants

could more efficiently grow
these same crops for export
than the colonizer, out
competing the colonizer in his
own trade.
Marketing boards emerged
in the 1930s as an effective way
to extract additional profits
from cash crops. This innova
tion foreshadowed to a degree
the present global supermar
ket structure. In 1937, the
cocoa producers of the Gold
Coast refused to sell unless
they received a higher price.
The British government inter
vened, buying all cocoa pro
duction and selling it to the
major cocoa companies. The
next year, the British set up the
West African Cocoa Board to
insure that a "fair" price was
paid to cocoa producers on the
one hand and that British Royal
Treasury and British cocoa
companies received
"adequate" profits on the
other.
By means of the marketing
boards, the price of export
crops was kept below world
market levels and at a level suf
ficient only to keep production
going. The profits of export
crops remained in the control
of the marketing boards and
European companies. Peanuts
cultivated in West Africa and

bought by the board were
often sold at a price seven
times greater than the price
paid to the peasants. This mar
keting scheme seriously neg
lected local food production
and firmly oriented food pro
duction in the direction of
European benefit.
On another level, the de
velopment of plantations
monopolized land use for col
onizer benefit. Land used for
export of luxury crops can not
be used to grow food for local
consumption. In many cases,
the land was not efficiently
used or may have even laid
idle. The purpose of agricul
ture was divorced from local
nutrition; food value was lost
to market value.
The large land holdings of
the typical colonial planter
required a large supply of

cheap labor in order to be pro
fitable. To supply this cheap
labor, self-provisioning ag
riculture was undercut by the
exclusive development of an
export-oriented agricultural in
frastructure and taxes. The
practices were made socially
tolerable by the removal of
tariffs on imported food. This
cheaply imported food de
stroyed the remaining market
for domestically produced
food, impoverishing local food
producers even further. Third
World countries became de
pendent on food imports, a
development which would
have profound historical con
sequences. Any interruption in
food imports would mean

hardship for the indigenous
population which would have
no local diversified food sys
tem to fall back on.
The basic scheme of the
global farm system was thus es
tablished: export monocul
ture. Also, the foundation of
global supermarket was laid —
a controlled marketing system
responsive only to those who
can pay the going price for
food, to those whose com
bined purchasing power con
stitutes a viable market in the
accounting terms of either col
onial ruler or multinational ag
ribusiness.
The outcome of this histori
cal scenario was predictable:
declining food production and
greater food imports, increas
ing impoverishment, growing
vulnerability to the constant
fluctuations in the interna
tional market and internally
uneven growth.
The value of food was mea
sured in terms other than nutri
tional value for the local popu
lation; the well-being of the
colonized rural population was
sacrificed to the profits of the
colonizing Europeans.

provides a typical example of
the circumstances under
which the Green Revolution
"swept the world."
In 1934, Mexico's President
Lazaro Cardinas began to enact
sweeping agrarian reforms to
build the infrastructure which
would make peasant self

economically feasible. The re

more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
crop production. The villagers
simply did not have enough
money to buy food. Still, dur
ing the worst year of famine,
export of food from the Sahel
continued. Over 60 per cent
went to North America, Europe

and the elite in Africa. In fact
many food exports increased
during the drought year, cattle
exports being one example.
In Mali (part of the Sahel),
production of food for local
consumption dropped sharply
in the early '70s. Corn produc
tion, a local staple, dropped by
one-third while cotton seed
production for export in
creased 400 per cent over nor
mal rainfall years. During the
drought Chad undertook a
major program to increase cot
ton production. Governments
and international lending in
stitutions subsidized the de
velopment of an infrastructure
for exporting, while internal
food distribution structures
were ignored. As one French
economist reported: "If
people are starving, it is not for
want of cotton."
The tragedy of it all is that
with one exception, every
Sahelian country actually pro
duced enough grain to feed its
total population, even during
the worst drought years. It was
the economic and social ban
kruptcy of the agricultural in
frastructure and market that
transformed the Sahel from a
land of milk and honey to a
land of famine. The economic
and political powers of the

Sahelic countries as well as the
climate are at the root of the
starvation experience there.
The tragic occurrences in the
Sahel have their roots in the
colonial period. With col
onialism came the view of ag
riculture as a way to extract
wealth. Agriculture was no
longer seen as a source of food
for local people. As people of
advantage sought their own in
terest, they instituted a system
of agriculture based on crop
exporting. Mono-cropping for
export replaced the self
providing, self-sustaining ag
riculture of the colonized land.
Most of the land was taken out
of local food production and
put into export crop produc
tion. The transition pushed
food production to more and
more marginal land, clearly
making it a secondary concern.

This reorganization of food
systems to fill European needs
was accomplished through
changes in the economies and
land tenure systems of the
countries. Rather than using
raw force to bend the indigen
ous populations to their ends,
the colonizers preferred to tax
them. The taxes had to be paid
in the colonizer's currency.
Virtually the only way to ac
quire this currency for many
taxpayers was to work for the
colonizer growing crops for
export, divorcing the people
from self-provisioning agricul
ture. Often the cultivation of
export crops by local peasants
under their own auspices was
prohibited since peasants

could more efficiently grow
these same crops for export
than the colonizer, out
competing the colonizer in his
own trade.
Marketing boards emerged
in the 1930s as an effective way
to extract additional profits
from cash crops. This innova
tion foreshadowed to a degree
the present global supermar
ket structure. In 1937, the
cocoa producers of the Gold
Coast refused to sell unless
they received a higher price.
The British government inter
vened, buying all cocoa pro
duction and selling it to the
major cocoa companies. The
next year, the British set up the
West African Cocoa Board to
insure that a "fair" price was
paid to cocoa producers on the
one hand and that British Royal
Treasury and British cocoa
companies received
"adequate" profits on the
other.
By means of the marketing
boards, the price of export
crops was kept below world
market levels and at a level suf
ficient only to keep production
going. The profits of export
crops remained in the control
of the marketing boards and
European companies. Peanuts
cultivated in West Africa and

bought by the board were
often sold at a price seven
times greater than the price
paid to the peasants. This mar
keting scheme seriously neg
lected local food production
and firmly oriented food pro
duction in the direction of
European benefit.
On another level, the de
velopment of plantations
monopolized land use for col
onizer benefit. Land used for
export of luxury crops can not
be used to grow food for local
consumption. In many cases,
the land was not efficiently
used or may have even laid
idle. The purpose of agricul
ture was divorced from local
nutrition; food value was lost
to market value.
The large land holdings of
the typical colonial planter
required a large supply of

cheap labor in order to be pro
fitable. To supply this cheap
labor, self-provisioning ag
riculture was undercut by the
exclusive development of an
export-oriented agricultural in
frastructure and taxes. The
practices were made socially
tolerable by the removal of
tariffs on imported food. This
cheaply imported food de
stroyed the remaining market
for domestically produced
food, impoverishing local food
producers even further. Third
World countries became de
pendent on food imports, a
development which would
have profound historical con
sequences. Any interruption in
food imports would mean

hardship for the indigenous
population which would have
no local diversified food sys
tem to fall back on.
The basic scheme of the
global farm system was thus es
tablished: export monocul
ture. Also, the foundation of
global supermarket was laid —
a controlled marketing system
responsive only to those who
can pay the going price for
food, to those whose com
bined purchasing power con
stitutes a viable market in the
accounting terms of either col
onial ruler or multinational ag
ribusiness.
The outcome of this histori
cal scenario was predictable:
declining food production and
greater food imports, increas
ing impoverishment, growing
vulnerability to the constant
fluctuations in the interna
tional market and internally
uneven growth.
The value of food was mea
sured in terms other than nutri
tional value for the local popu
lation; the well-being of the
colonized rural population was
sacrificed to the profits of the
colonizing Europeans.
The Green Revolution played
an important role in the de
velopment of global super-

markets and farms. The ag
ricultural history of Mexico
provides a typical example of
the circumstances under
which the Green Revolution
"swept the world."
In 1934, Mexico's President
Lazaro Cardinas began to enact
sweeping agrarian reforms to
build the infrastructure which
would make peasant self
provisioning agriculture
economically feasible. The re
forms proved counter to the
development of industrial cap
ital and the export monocrop
ping which was, by and large,
directed toward the benefit of
U.S. business.
In the 19405, the U.S. needed
cheap manufactured and ag
ricultural goods from Mexico
to support the war effort. In
1942, Avila Camacho became
the President of Mexico. Over
turning the reforms of Car

denas, he began agriculture
and industrial development
which needed cheap labor to
insure large industrial and ag
ribusiness profits. Getting
more cheap food to urban
areas was critical to supplying
this large cheap labor supply.
In 1943, the Rockefeller Foun
dation joined with the Mexican
government in an effort to
create the food supply neces
sary for rapid urban-centered
industrialization. (Cardenas
had nationalized Rockefeller's
Standard Oil subsidiary and
foreign-owned railroads as
part of his agrarian develop
ment policies.)
The research was focused on
capital-intensive inputs to be

used in almost ideal conditions
in the best endowed areas: in a
word, away from the
subsistence-self-provisioning
sectors of Mexican agriculture
and toward U.S. and Mexican
agribusiness. The Mexican
government, by subsidizing
agricultural mechanization and
the development of irrigation
systems to be used by large
land holders, insured that large
land holding and cheap farm
labor would continue as the
base for export agriculture de
velopment. It is not surprising
that about three per cent of all
Mexican farms accounted for
80 per cent of the production
increase during the 19505.
The Green Revolution re
duced agriculture to a prob
lem of production alone. Rural
development was not integral.
The result is that the food sys
tem is oriented away from
meeting the needs of local
people; poverty and inequality
are deepened. Quantity and
market value, divorced from
nutritional value, become the
sole measure of agriculture.
Lappe and Collins, in their
book "Food First," report that
an "increase in poverty has
been associated not with a fall
but a rise in per capita produc-

tion of cereal, the main com
ponent of the diet of the
poor."
The increased food produc
tion of the Green Revolution
has not gone to hungry people.
By and large, it has gone to
urban and upper-income
groups. (The increased pro
duction in the Philippines and
Mexico has benefited emerg
ing industrialists and their
foreign partners who want to
have cheap food for workers in
urban industries in order to
keep wage demands low.)
Some of it gets reduced to lux
ury products the poor cannot
afford. Some of it gets fed to
livestock to create meat that
the majority of the local popu
lation cannot afford. Some of
the increased production is
simply thrown away.

The world hunger crisis per
sists. The famines of the
early 70s are over but millions
of people around the world are
either permanently hungry and
on the way to starvation or are
living on the edge of impend
ing tragedy. Famines only
make v the crisis more visible.
The large concentration of
human suffering and misery
which accompanies famines
captures our attention and
elicits our compassion. Yet the
millions of people who quietly
starve slide by unnoticed.
The hungry live even amidst
the well-fed and affluent. In
the Mid-peninsula alone, The
Ecumenical Hunger Project
served 10,000 hungry people

last year. Stanislaus County,
constituting some of America's
most productive farmland, was
officially declared a hunger
disaster area in 1969. Many
senior citizens in San Francisco
and other U.S. cities struggle
daily with nutritional need.
Many have to resort to dog
food to supplement their diets.
Ffunger has not gone away, it
has merely gone underground.
This world hunger crisis is
the product of scarcity
creating mechanisms which
have been at work on our food
and agriculture systems for
centuries. Most of the
mechanisms have come into
being as a means of coping
with the over-production
which comes when the hungry
of the world cannot afford to
pay the prices charged for the
food they need. Hungry
people do not constitute a
market for the accounting
sheets of the "global super
market."
The effects of these scarcity
creating mechanisms are
most obvious when a famine
occurs. From 1972 until 1974,
the Sahel of northwest Africa
was the victim of a particularly
severe famine; the cir
cumstances leading up to it, as

world's poor.

well as the famine itself, are
representative of the situation
in many other parts of the
world.
The Sahel was once known
as the bread basket of Africa.
The traditional agricultural sys
tem of wandering nomads and
small farmers was perfectly
suited to the food-producing
capacity and characteristics of
the area. Small farmers who
inhabited the southern region
of the Sahel stored millet for
flour, knowing that years of
drought would be coming.
This traditional system of
storing grains was destroyed
by colonization. The French
conquest of the land in the late
19th and early 20th centuries
depleted the population
through slave trade and war.
They also introduced peanuts
and cotton as cash crops. Taxes
depleted the reserves which

farmers had accrued.
When the Sahel countries
won independence in 1960, the
new government sought to
outdo the French. Higher taxes
and falling export prices forced
more export crop production,
often forcing the use of de
structive methods of cultiva
tion. The production
capabilities of the land were
undercut, destroying the
economy of traditional food
exchange as well as export
