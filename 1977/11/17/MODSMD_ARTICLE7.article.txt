on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to
grow it will no longer mean that
you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central
America. From one-third to
one-half of total meat produc
tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer
he hundreds of thousands of
farms in the United States supply
ing the vegetable, fruit, meat,
and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con
sumers will be made dependent
on the active maintenance of a


distorted land use system in un
derdeveloped countries. We will
he forced to translate our own
legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean
years, especially if it has a di
versified profit base. Farmers
cannot. Domestically, agribus
iness is economically viable
not because of its production
record but because of its ability
to compete in the capitalist
market place.
A look at the Westland
documents agribusiness in ac
tion. The Westland is an ad
ministrative district in central
California of the Bureau of Re
clamation which supplies the
area with the water needed to
prevent the district from be
coming a desert. The Reclama
tion Act of 1902 authorized the
public financing of the water
projects. It also dictated that
farmers be limited to 160 acres
(320 for couples), that excess
holdings be sold off at pre
irrigation prices (a measure de
signed to prevent speculation)
and that the landowner live on
the land. The law was passed,
reviewed without revision in
1944,1947,1959, 1960; and has
subsequently been ignored.
Southern Pacific holds 110,000
acres; Standard Oil, Getty Oil,
Anderson Clayton and Coffen
Inc. all have large holdings.
Safeway Stores' president, J.G.
Bosewell, owns Boston Ranch,
another large land holding.
Every landowner in the district

benefits from a government
subsidy of $13.50 per acre foot
of water. Water meant to sup
port small farms is sold to ag
ribusiness concerns at $7.50 an
acre foot. Other water (from
the California Central Valley
Project) costs $21.00 per acre
foot. In addition, agribusiness
concerns get free energy to
pump water out of canals into
the fields. Finally, the concerns
receive interest-free loans for
up to 10 years to buy pipes and
benefit from free large-scale
mechanization research done
at UC-Davis.
This is not the whole story.
Add to this agribusiness "wel
fare" the real social cost ot
cheap labor, real welfare, and
the subsidized cost of artifi
cially cheap oil and one can see
how agribusiness competes
with small farmers. The en
vironmental cost, too, lies hid
den in the accounting sheets.
In summation, agribusiness
receives cheap subsidized wa
ter, free benefits from state
sponsored research and de
velopment of large-scale farm
equipment and cultivation
techniques, exploits farm labor
more ruthlessly than a family
farmer would dare, makes use
of high energy, capital and
resource-intensive produc
tion, controls marketing and
distributing and therefore
prices, has better access to
markets through chain food
stores and passes on the costs
of sustaining its low-paid, sea
sonal work force to the state
and its welfare and service
agencies.

cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer

farms in the United States supply

and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con

legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean

on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to
grow it will no longer mean that
you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central
America. From one-third to
one-half of total meat produc
tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central
America. From one-third to
one-half of total meat produc
tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer
he hundreds of thousands of
farms in the United States supply
ing the vegetable, fruit, meat,
and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con
sumers will be made dependent
on the active maintenance of a


distorted land use system in un
derdeveloped countries. We will
he forced to translate our own
legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean
years, especially if it has a di
versified profit base. Farmers
cannot. Domestically, agribus
iness is economically viable
not because of its production
record but because of its ability
to compete in the capitalist
market place.
A look at the Westland
documents agribusiness in ac
tion. The Westland is an ad
ministrative district in central
California of the Bureau of Re
clamation which supplies the
area with the water needed to
prevent the district from be
coming a desert. The Reclama
tion Act of 1902 authorized the
public financing of the water
projects. It also dictated that
farmers be limited to 160 acres
(320 for couples), that excess
holdings be sold off at pre
irrigation prices (a measure de
signed to prevent speculation)
and that the landowner live on
the land. The law was passed,
reviewed without revision in
1944,1947,1959, 1960; and has
subsequently been ignored.
Southern Pacific holds 110,000
acres; Standard Oil, Getty Oil,
Anderson Clayton and Coffen
Inc. all have large holdings.
Safeway Stores' president, J.G.
Bosewell, owns Boston Ranch,
another large land holding.
Every landowner in the district

benefits from a government
subsidy of $13.50 per acre foot
of water. Water meant to sup
port small farms is sold to ag
ribusiness concerns at $7.50 an
acre foot. Other water (from
the California Central Valley
Project) costs $21.00 per acre
foot. In addition, agribusiness
concerns get free energy to
pump water out of canals into
the fields. Finally, the concerns
receive interest-free loans for
up to 10 years to buy pipes and
benefit from free large-scale
mechanization research done
at UC-Davis.
This is not the whole story.
Add to this agribusiness "wel
fare" the real social cost ot
cheap labor, real welfare, and
the subsidized cost of artifi
cially cheap oil and one can see
how agribusiness competes
with small farmers. The en
vironmental cost, too, lies hid
den in the accounting sheets.
In summation, agribusiness
receives cheap subsidized wa
ter, free benefits from state
sponsored research and de
velopment of large-scale farm
equipment and cultivation
techniques, exploits farm labor
more ruthlessly than a family
farmer would dare, makes use
of high energy, capital and
resource-intensive produc
tion, controls marketing and
distributing and therefore
prices, has better access to
markets through chain food
stores and passes on the costs
of sustaining its low-paid, sea
sonal work force to the state
and its welfare and service
agencies.

on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to

you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer
he hundreds of thousands of
farms in the United States supply
ing the vegetable, fruit, meat,
and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con
sumers will be made dependent
on the active maintenance of a


distorted land use system in un
derdeveloped countries. We will
he forced to translate our own
legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean
years, especially if it has a di
versified profit base. Farmers
cannot. Domestically, agribus
iness is economically viable
not because of its production
record but because of its ability
to compete in the capitalist
market place.
A look at the Westland
documents agribusiness in ac
tion. The Westland is an ad
ministrative district in central
California of the Bureau of Re
clamation which supplies the
area with the water needed to
prevent the district from be
coming a desert. The Reclama
tion Act of 1902 authorized the
public financing of the water
projects. It also dictated that
farmers be limited to 160 acres
(320 for couples), that excess
holdings be sold off at pre
irrigation prices (a measure de
signed to prevent speculation)
and that the landowner live on
the land. The law was passed,
reviewed without revision in
1944,1947,1959, 1960; and has
subsequently been ignored.
Southern Pacific holds 110,000
acres; Standard Oil, Getty Oil,
Anderson Clayton and Coffen
Inc. all have large holdings.
Safeway Stores' president, J.G.
Bosewell, owns Boston Ranch,
another large land holding.
Every landowner in the district

benefits from a government
subsidy of $13.50 per acre foot
of water. Water meant to sup
port small farms is sold to ag
ribusiness concerns at $7.50 an
acre foot. Other water (from
the California Central Valley
Project) costs $21.00 per acre
foot. In addition, agribusiness
concerns get free energy to
pump water out of canals into
the fields. Finally, the concerns
receive interest-free loans for
up to 10 years to buy pipes and
benefit from free large-scale
mechanization research done
at UC-Davis.
This is not the whole story.
Add to this agribusiness "wel
fare" the real social cost ot
cheap labor, real welfare, and
the subsidized cost of artifi
cially cheap oil and one can see
how agribusiness competes
with small farmers. The en
vironmental cost, too, lies hid
den in the accounting sheets.
In summation, agribusiness
receives cheap subsidized wa
ter, free benefits from state
sponsored research and de
velopment of large-scale farm
equipment and cultivation
techniques, exploits farm labor
more ruthlessly than a family
farmer would dare, makes use
of high energy, capital and
resource-intensive produc
tion, controls marketing and
distributing and therefore
prices, has better access to
markets through chain food
stores and passes on the costs
of sustaining its low-paid, sea
sonal work force to the state
and its welfare and service
agencies.

on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to
grow it will no longer mean that
you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central

Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer
he hundreds of thousands of
farms in the United States supply
ing the vegetable, fruit, meat,
and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con
sumers will be made dependent
on the active maintenance of a


distorted land use system in un
derdeveloped countries. We will
he forced to translate our own
legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean
years, especially if it has a di
versified profit base. Farmers
cannot. Domestically, agribus
iness is economically viable
not because of its production
record but because of its ability
to compete in the capitalist
market place.
A look at the Westland
documents agribusiness in ac
tion. The Westland is an ad
ministrative district in central
California of the Bureau of Re
clamation which supplies the
area with the water needed to
prevent the district from be
coming a desert. The Reclama
tion Act of 1902 authorized the
public financing of the water
projects. It also dictated that
farmers be limited to 160 acres
(320 for couples), that excess
holdings be sold off at pre
irrigation prices (a measure de
signed to prevent speculation)
and that the landowner live on
the land. The law was passed,
reviewed without revision in
1944,1947,1959, 1960; and has
subsequently been ignored.
Southern Pacific holds 110,000
acres; Standard Oil, Getty Oil,
Anderson Clayton and Coffen
Inc. all have large holdings.
Safeway Stores' president, J.G.
Bosewell, owns Boston Ranch,
another large land holding.
Every landowner in the district

benefits from a government
subsidy of $13.50 per acre foot
of water. Water meant to sup
port small farms is sold to ag
ribusiness concerns at $7.50 an
acre foot. Other water (from
the California Central Valley
Project) costs $21.00 per acre
foot. In addition, agribusiness
concerns get free energy to
pump water out of canals into
the fields. Finally, the concerns
receive interest-free loans for
up to 10 years to buy pipes and
benefit from free large-scale
mechanization research done
at UC-Davis.
This is not the whole story.
Add to this agribusiness "wel
fare" the real social cost ot
cheap labor, real welfare, and
the subsidized cost of artifi
cially cheap oil and one can see
how agribusiness competes
with small farmers. The en
vironmental cost, too, lies hid
den in the accounting sheets.
In summation, agribusiness
receives cheap subsidized wa
ter, free benefits from state
sponsored research and de
velopment of large-scale farm
equipment and cultivation
techniques, exploits farm labor
more ruthlessly than a family
farmer would dare, makes use
of high energy, capital and
resource-intensive produc
tion, controls marketing and
distributing and therefore
prices, has better access to
markets through chain food
stores and passes on the costs
of sustaining its low-paid, sea
sonal work force to the state
and its welfare and service
agencies.

on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to
grow it will no longer mean that
you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central
America. From one-third to
one-half of total meat produc
tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought

cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer
he hundreds of thousands of
farms in the United States supply
ing the vegetable, fruit, meat,
and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con
sumers will be made dependent
on the active maintenance of a


distorted land use system in un
derdeveloped countries. We will
he forced to translate our own
legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean
years, especially if it has a di
versified profit base. Farmers
cannot. Domestically, agribus
iness is economically viable
not because of its production
record but because of its ability
to compete in the capitalist
market place.
A look at the Westland
documents agribusiness in ac
tion. The Westland is an ad
ministrative district in central
California of the Bureau of Re
clamation which supplies the
area with the water needed to
prevent the district from be
coming a desert. The Reclama
tion Act of 1902 authorized the
public financing of the water
projects. It also dictated that
farmers be limited to 160 acres
(320 for couples), that excess
holdings be sold off at pre
irrigation prices (a measure de
signed to prevent speculation)
and that the landowner live on
the land. The law was passed,
reviewed without revision in
1944,1947,1959, 1960; and has
subsequently been ignored.
Southern Pacific holds 110,000
acres; Standard Oil, Getty Oil,
Anderson Clayton and Coffen
Inc. all have large holdings.
Safeway Stores' president, J.G.
Bosewell, owns Boston Ranch,
another large land holding.
Every landowner in the district

benefits from a government
subsidy of $13.50 per acre foot
of water. Water meant to sup
port small farms is sold to ag
ribusiness concerns at $7.50 an
acre foot. Other water (from
the California Central Valley
Project) costs $21.00 per acre
foot. In addition, agribusiness
concerns get free energy to
pump water out of canals into
the fields. Finally, the concerns
receive interest-free loans for
up to 10 years to buy pipes and
benefit from free large-scale
mechanization research done
at UC-Davis.
This is not the whole story.
Add to this agribusiness "wel
fare" the real social cost ot
cheap labor, real welfare, and
the subsidized cost of artifi
cially cheap oil and one can see
how agribusiness competes
with small farmers. The en
vironmental cost, too, lies hid
den in the accounting sheets.
In summation, agribusiness
receives cheap subsidized wa
ter, free benefits from state
sponsored research and de
velopment of large-scale farm
equipment and cultivation
techniques, exploits farm labor
more ruthlessly than a family
farmer would dare, makes use
of high energy, capital and
resource-intensive produc
tion, controls marketing and
distributing and therefore
prices, has better access to
markets through chain food
stores and passes on the costs
of sustaining its low-paid, sea
sonal work force to the state
and its welfare and service
agencies.

on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to
grow it will no longer mean that
you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central
America. From one-third to
one-half of total meat produc
tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.

that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
majority of U.S. Third World
people.
The saddest feature ofmultina
tion agribusiness is that diets all
around the world have deterior
ated. At least 90 per cent of the
research and development cost
of big food companies goes into
quick preparation and consumer
appeal or motivational re
search and product promotion.
They compete where advertising
rather than price is the effective
instrument. The food processing
industry puts a greater share of its
budget into advertising than any
other industry. The 50 largest
food companies account for 61
per cent of all advertising on tele
vision.
Of course, the whole point
of processing foods is to in
crease profit margins. Potatoes
cost about 9 cents per pound;
potato chips, about $1.18 to
$1.58 per pound; Pringle's,
$2.10 per pound. An inexpen
sive staple which produces lit
tle profit on the multinational

accounting sheet is processed
into a high-profit "modern"
food. Diets suffer as processed
food becomes a major part ot
our food system. Not only does
a dollar buy less processed
than non-processed food but
processing also lowers the nut
ritional worth of food. The av
ailability of staples is affected
because staples are processed
out of the price range of many
poor people.
Advertising replaces food
nutrition with product appeal
as the reason for buying. Soft
drinks, baby formula, proces
sed pineapple and white bread
are but a few examples of the
advertising and marketing ex
pertise of agribusiness.
Today the U.S. imports one
half of the dollar value of all the
food it exports. Lappe and Col
lins state that food security
must be measured in "how re
liable, how resilient, and how
self-contained the agricultural
system is." When farmers can
make more money growing
feed for cattle instead of
staples for people, they grow
feed — not very reliable.
Global farming techniques are
dependent upon almost ideal
conditions and capital inten
sive inputs — not very resilient
or self-contained. Our food
security as well as that of the
rest of the world is very shaky.
Peter Barnes and Peter
Casalino in a study for the
Center for Rural Studies enti
tled, "Who Owns the Land,"
document the fact of increased
concentration of land owner
ship in the hands of a small

minority. The ability of cheap
capital and vertical integration
to write off agricultural losses
against nonagricultural gains
(usually profits made on
energy inputs or marketing
profits) is fueling this concent
ration. Land is no longer seen
in food-producing terms but in
terms of tax loopholes, capital
gains and corporate losses.
A corporation can stand lean
years, especially if it has a di
versified profit base. Farmers
cannot. Domestically, agribus
iness is economically viable
not because of its production
record but because of its ability
to compete in the capitalist
market place.
A look at the Westland
documents agribusiness in ac
tion. The Westland is an ad
ministrative district in central
California of the Bureau of Re
clamation which supplies the
area with the water needed to
prevent the district from be
coming a desert. The Reclama
tion Act of 1902 authorized the
public financing of the water
projects. It also dictated that
farmers be limited to 160 acres
(320 for couples), that excess
holdings be sold off at pre
irrigation prices (a measure de
signed to prevent speculation)
and that the landowner live on
the land. The law was passed,
reviewed without revision in
1944,1947,1959, 1960; and has
subsequently been ignored.
Southern Pacific holds 110,000
acres; Standard Oil, Getty Oil,
Anderson Clayton and Coffen
Inc. all have large holdings.
Safeway Stores' president, J.G.
Bosewell, owns Boston Ranch,
another large land holding.
Every landowner in the district

benefits from a government
subsidy of $13.50 per acre foot
of water. Water meant to sup
port small farms is sold to ag
ribusiness concerns at $7.50 an
acre foot. Other water (from
the California Central Valley
Project) costs $21.00 per acre
foot. In addition, agribusiness
concerns get free energy to
pump water out of canals into
the fields. Finally, the concerns
receive interest-free loans for
up to 10 years to buy pipes and
benefit from free large-scale
mechanization research done
at UC-Davis.
This is not the whole story.
Add to this agribusiness "wel
fare" the real social cost ot
cheap labor, real welfare, and
the subsidized cost of artifi
cially cheap oil and one can see
how agribusiness competes
with small farmers. The en
vironmental cost, too, lies hid
den in the accounting sheets.
In summation, agribusiness
receives cheap subsidized wa
ter, free benefits from state
sponsored research and de
velopment of large-scale farm
equipment and cultivation
techniques, exploits farm labor
more ruthlessly than a family
farmer would dare, makes use
of high energy, capital and
resource-intensive produc
tion, controls marketing and
distributing and therefore
prices, has better access to
markets through chain food
stores and passes on the costs
of sustaining its low-paid, sea
sonal work force to the state
and its welfare and service
agencies.

on imported machines. Crops
must be exported in order to
acquire the foreign currency to
import the capital-intensive
imports. The disenfranchized
landless suffer. Since the in
ception of the Green Revolu
tion, the income of Mexican
landless rural workers has fal
len from $68 to $56 per year
while the per capita income
has increased from $308 to $465
per year.
The Green Revolution has
also made high returns depen
dent on the amount of land
owned rather than the effi
ciency of production itself. The
necessary high-capital agricul
tural input is economical only
on larger acreage and is gener-

ally accomplished by means of
large government subsidies
and much cheap labor. The
price for cheap labor becomes
the market value for all agricul
tural labor. Small farmers are
underpriced with government
and cheap labor subsidizing
the cost of agribusiness pro
duction. The result is increased
monopolization of land own
ership.
The Green Revolution was a
choice: it was a choice to come
up with seeds which produce
high yields under optimum
conditions. It was a choice not
to start by developing seeds
better able to withstand
drought and pests. It was a
choice not to concentrate on
improving traditional methods
of increasing yields, such as
mixed cropping. It was a
choice nof to develop technol
ogy which was productive,
labor-intensive and indepen
dent of foreign input supply. It
was a choice not to concen
trate on reinforcing the ba
lanced, traditional diets of
grains plus legumes.
Of interest is a 1944 sociolog
ical study done in California
comparing two towns, Arvins
and Dinuba, with similar
dollar-value production. Arvin
has a few large farms; Dinuba
is surrounded by many small
farms. By every social measure
of the quality of life, Dinuba
was significantly richer. Di
nuba had twice the number of
small businesses and six times
more retail business; more
self-employed people; better
schools, parks and public ser
vices. The choice for large, cap
ital-intensive farms is not so
cially neutral.
The Green Revolution in
creased the mechanization and
commercialization of agricul
ture. It also fostered the de
velopment of export agricul
ture to pay for the capital
intensive imports which this
new agriculture required.
Lappe and Collins describe this
emerging new food system in
this way:
We have the increasing
worldwide penetration of ag
ribusiness, the linking up of un
derdeveloped countries' farms
with global food markets: A
Global Farm suppling a Global
Supermarket. The world's hungry
people are being thrown into
ever more direct competition
with the well-fed and the over
fed. The fact that something is
grown near your home in abun
dance or that your country's
natural and financial resources
were consumed in producing it,
or even that you yourself toiled to
grow it will no longer mean that
you will be likely to eat it. Rather,

it will go to an emerging Global
Supermarket where the poorest
must reach for it on the same
shelf as hundreds of millions of
others. Every item has a price and
that price, in large part, is deter
mined by what the world's
better-off customers are willing
to bid. None without money will
be able to get through the check
out line. This emerging Clobal
Supermarket will be the culmina
tion of food "interdependence"
in a world of unequals.
Agribusiness now searches
the world for "cheap pro
duction sites" — cheap land
and cheap labor, and in some
cases, cheap water. It has the
ability to makethewholeworld
its global farm, not through

production expertise or effi
ciency as much as through
marketing expertise and low
cost transportation systems.
Increasingly, farms in the
United States and Europe are
underpriced by the cheaper
labor and land found in Third
World Countries. Recently Del
Monte moved all its asparagus
production to Mexico because
of a canning strike that resulted
in higher wages in its California
plants. Mexico is already sup
plying one half to two-thirds of
the United States' winter and
early spring vegetables. Africa
is seen as potentially the
world's biggest producer of
vegetables not only for Europe
but also the U.S. This type of
export agriculture is radically
cutting the availability of food
for the world's poor.
Cattle raising has become a
major industry in Central
America. From one-third to
one-half of total meat produc
tion there is exported to the
U.S. As Costa Rica, in 1975, ex
ported 60 million pounds of
beef, the per capita beef con
sumption declined. Had the
beef which was grown on
Costa Rican land by Costa
Rican labor stayed in Costa
Rica, the local meat consump-

tion could have doubled.
Another aspect of this global
food system is that food not br
inging a large profit is simply
processed into luxury foods
which do bring high profits
when sold to the urban elite.
Eggs go into the making of
mayonnaise instead of being
available at a cheap price for
local consumption. Peasants in
Pakistan compete for the corn
which used to be their primary
staple. Instead, the corn now
goes into the production of
sweeteners for soft drinks and
food sweeteners. Increasingly,
the global supermarket has pit
ted people of the world against
each other for the food which
is available.
The utter inability of the
global farm to meet the needs
of the majority of the people —
the absurdity of the whole
scheme — is startlingly fo
cused in one fact, calmly stated
in a Harvard Business School
study: at least 65 per cent of the

fruits and vegetables produced
in Central America for export is
"literally dumped or, where
feasible, used as animal feed"
because it either confronts an
oversupplied market in the Un
ited States or does not meet
the "beauty" standards of con
sumers here, while at home,
where it is produced, people
are too poor to buy it.
Contract farming has
emerged as the modus
operandi of agribusiness. The
grower of a crop or "associate
producer" contracts to: 1) use
certain inputs (to be bought
from the same vertically integ
rated agribusiness concern), 2)
produce certain amounts of
stipulated produce and 3) de
liver on a certain date at a fixed
price. The associate producer
must sell the entire production
to the agribusiness concern.
The advantage to the ag
ribusinessmen is that they
maintain control with little cap
ital investment and own no
thing which could be
nationalized. They also have
the ability to manage supply
since in times of market boom
they can contract for additional
food and in times of depres
sion, they simply raise the qual
ity standard, thus lowering the
supply.
The disadvantage to farmers
is that they become little more
than slaves on farms "man
aged" by marketing conglom
erates. In fact, contract farming
so restricts the market that it is
virtually impossible to sell out
side of the contracting ar
rangement. Contract farming
also favors centralized con
tracts for obvious managerial
reasons, another shot in the
arm for corporate farming.
The effect of the global food
system on the domestic job
market is the loss of thousands
of agricultural jobs. When Del
Monte moved its asparagus
production to Mexico, 6000
Californians lost their jobs. It is
estimated that with the de
velopment of new increased
mechanization in California
agriculture, 123,000 farming
jobs will be lost. The welfare
cost will be $2 billion. Yet, the
cost of welfare, an implicit so
cial aspect of the global food
system, is never included in
our food bill.
The export of domestic
mushroom production is a

good example of the global
food system in action.
Pennsylvania farmers once did
a thriving mushroom business.
Today, one in three mus
hrooms is imported from
South Korea and Taiwan, not
because of a shortage of
domestic supply but because
of the cheap land and labor of
these countries. The labor and
land cost of South Korea and
Taiwan sets the price for labor
and land in Pennsylvania.
Lappe and Collins paint the
future clearly:
As multinational corporations
expand into the underdeveloped
world, American consumers are
rapidly being made dependent
on a whole range of imported ag
ricultural products. Once this
shift is made, there will no longer
he hundreds of thousands of
farms in the United States supply
ing the vegetable, fruit, meat,
and even flowers Americans buy.
The food needs of American con
sumers will be made dependent
on the active maintenance of a


distorted land use system in un
derdeveloped countries. We will
he forced to translate our own
legitimate food requirements
into opposition to those of coun
tries where hundreds of millions
go hungry. Agribusiness, by put
ting American consumers at odds
with the interests of the world's
hungry, creates a type of inter
dependence no one needs.
Clearly, agribusiness has not
brought us a better agriculture. It
produces luxury export crops,
tying up valuable local resources
that could be producing staples
for the local population. It orients
production for viable markets,
i.e. local and foreign elites who
can pay for more expensive
prices. It uses a production
model that is the antithesis of
rural agricultural development.
All this is for the benefit of a few
and for the detriment of the
