# The
						famine of '72-'74-where did it go?
## 
### 
Several years ago the world
food crisis was continually be
fore the public eye. Anyone
who read newspapers,
watched television, listened to
the radio or received news
magazines was exposed fre
quently to both verbal and
graphic descriptions of the ex
treme hunger in various parts
of the world. In the past year,
however, the emaciated
bodies have vanished from the
radio and television airwaves
and the pages of our journals.
This disappearance does
not, unfortunately, herald the
end of the food crisis. Rather,
the crisis has taken a different,
equally serious although less
sensational form. The food
crisis of 1972-4 should be taken
as a lesson, however. It should
demonstrate that global food
production is at once a com
plex and unstable process.
The crisis was caused by a
number of disparate factors.
During the summer of 1972,
the Soviet Union purchased
huge amounts of grain (almost
30 million tons) from the U.S.
and Canada. Adverse weather
conditions over large parts of
the world caused reduced
production in many areas and
resulted in serious food shor
tages in parts of Africa and
Asia.
To make matters worse, the
Peruvian anchovy catch de
clined substantially in 1972.
(Much of the world's supply of
fish meal, which is used
primarily as a protein-rich ani
mal feed, comes from Peru's
anchovy catch.) The reduced
supply of fish meal coupled
with increased demand in the
industrial countries for meat
created a double bind for de
veloping countries. Many

faced severe food shortages
but could not afford to buy
grain at the inflated prices of
the world market.
These circumstances caught
the developing countries at a
time when they had lost their
agricultural self-sufficiency.
The remarkable crop yields
made possible by the Green
Revolution were to a very
large extent dependent upon
increased expenditures for
fuel and fertilizer. The Arab oil
embargo during the winter of
1973 increased the price of oil
several fold and had two im
portant consequences for de
veloping countries. It in
creased the price for fuel
necessary to run farm machin-

ery and it increased the cost of
fertilizers, many of which are
petroleum derived.
In many developing coun
tries, the effects of the food
crisis were catastrophic. Lester
Brown of the Worldwatch In
stitute has estimated that
nearly one million people died
in India in 1972 and other re
searchers estimate that food
shortages were responsible for
more than 700,000 deaths in
Bangladesh alone between
1971 and 1974.
The food crisis of 1972-74
also affected the developed na

tions. In the United States,
consumers were quick to
notice the rise in food costs in
1973 and blamed the increases
with some justification on the
"wheat deal" which Senator
Henry Jackson characterized as
"one of the most notorious
government foulups in Ameri
can history."
The Soviets were able to sell
some of the wheat purchased
from the U.S. to other coun
tries at a substantial profit, a
case where the communists
outbargained the capitalists.
Much of the grain, however,
went to feed Soviet livestock.
Thus the Soviets ate meat while
many peoples lacked even
grain.

The crisis' most important
impact upon the developed
countries was the significant
reduction of world grain re
serves. These reserves fell
from 95 days worth of world
consumption in 1961 to 26 days
in 1974. This is a dangerously
low level and both the World
Food Conference and the Car
ter administration have called
forthecreation of a world grain
reserve program.
In the past two years world
grain production has increased
and yet despite this increase,
the world food crisis lingers.
Increased grain production has
both good and bad implica
tions.
On the positive side is the
fact that acute food shortages
in some of the most seriously
affected countries have les
sened. Bangladesh has begun
to repay its huge grain debts.
Offsetting this welcome de
velopment is the fact that in
creased food production has
caused a complacent attitude
among many governmental of
ficials.
The international trade in
grain has been characterized
by a boom or bust philosophy

in recent years. Advocates of a
free market argue that supply
and demand is the best reg
ulator of the world grain sup
ply. In the short run, market
forces will push the price of
grain lower. But in the longer
run, as prices received by U.S.
farmers fall (6 per cent this
year) and expenses rise (5 per
cent this year) farmers will re
move land from cultivation,
decreasing the supply of grain.
Thus the seeds of a future
world food crisis may be ger
minating in this period of
abundance.
A number of experts have
advocated the creation of a
world food reserve program to
provide some cushion for fu
ture crises. This was one of the
recommendations of the 1974
World Food Conference. The
recent farm bill contained a
provision for the establish
ment of a national wheat re
serve program to store bet
ween 8 and 19 million metric
tons.
Dropped from the farm bill,
however, was a provision cal
ling for an international
emergency food reserve to
provide government-owned
food stocks to be used for dis
aster relief or in cases of severe
food shortage. Representative
Matthew McHugh introduced
a bill calling for the establish
ment of such a reserve and to
date his bill has attracted 72
co-sponsors. The Carter Ad
ministration plans to introduce
its own emergency reserve bill
early next year.
Despite the fact that the
world food situation seems
better now than three years
ago chronic hunger and mal
nutrition remain in much of the
world. â€”DAN CALDWELL
