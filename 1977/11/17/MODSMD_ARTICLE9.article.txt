Recent U.S. estimates put the number of
chronically malnourished persons in the world
at one billion and the number of permanently
hungry at 460 million. The misery experienced
daily by this substantial proportion of our
species is beyond our power of conception; the
majority of us have never encountered anything
more unpleasant than an hour or two of hunger
pangs. One way to narrow this gap between
conception and reality is to fast for the day.
Another, perhaps more positive, way is to con
tribute to relief agencies whose goal it is to feed
the world's hungriest persons.
These organizations, though bearing a repu
tation for helping out at a superficial level (i.e.,
only feeding the hungry and not considering
any long term needs) actually support or imple
ment programs with a wide range of objectives.
From immediate care for those afflicted by acute
hunger, to introducing small, labor intensive
technology, to implementing basic health-care
delivery systems, an effort is made to help the
poor help themselves. The ultimate hope of all
these relief groups is that the poor will eventu
ally be able to wade out of their plight on their
own two feet. But it is obvious that initial assis
tance is needed; the organizations below are
administering thai assistance in many unique,
effective ways.
CARE is' s a P r ' vate relief and development
agency handling a combination of donated
surplus farm commodities and bulk-rate foods.
Each donated dollar provides $4.97 worth of de
livered aid. An important effort is the "food for
work" program, linking developmental aid,
medical training, and direct food relief into a
comprehensive program suited for each area's
needs.
CROP is the fund-raising and educational arm
of Church World Service (a non-denominational
organization) involved in international famine
relief and development aid. One area of relief is
the National Christian Council of Bangladesh
Economic and Social Welfare Committee which
is funding a number of projects including nutri

tion centers and agriculture training programs.
UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, is a non
sectarian agency. As an advocate for children,
they assist nations with the health, education,
and social well-being of their children. Accord
ing to UNICEF figures $.25 buys a mother and
child vitamins for four months; $12 buys a mid
wife's kit; and $20 vaccinates 1,750 children.
Oxfam-America. Originally the Oxford Com
mittee for Famine Relief, Oxfam has a global
reputation for innovative yet realistic aid. They
are unique in that field directors seek out and
encourage projects which local people then
work and manage. Oxfam has no religious affili
ation.
Northern California Food Network coordi
nates 100 autonomous food distribution cen
ters, providing hunger relief in Northern
California. Their focus is the education of
people concerning nutrition and food distribu
tion.
The Palo Alto Ecumenical Hunger Project is a
church-run agency which coordinates the dis
tribution of donated and bulk-rate foods to a
network of 10 food closets in the local area.
Donations go directly to food aid; there are no
administrative costs.
Hisperian Foundation is a Palo Alto-based
foundation which works in Mexico developing
programs of health care at a village level. Its
ultimate purpose is to train villagers in basic
medical care and appropriate technology using
printed books and material of a nature which
can be understood by people with little or no
formal education.
Today, if you have not already done so, con
sider not only fasting for personal reflection, but
consider as well donating to a relief organization
which you feel is administering aid in a way
consistent with your views. Giving money is
only one way to show concern for the physically
and socially oppressed, but it can be a very im
portant way.

Hisperian Foundation is a Palo Alto-based

Recent U.S. estimates put the number of
chronically malnourished persons in the world
at one billion and the number of permanently
hungry at 460 million. The misery experienced
daily by this substantial proportion of our
species is beyond our power of conception; the
majority of us have never encountered anything
more unpleasant than an hour or two of hunger
pangs. One way to narrow this gap between
conception and reality is to fast for the day.
Another, perhaps more positive, way is to con
tribute to relief agencies whose goal it is to feed
the world's hungriest persons.
These organizations, though bearing a repu
tation for helping out at a superficial level (i.e.,
only feeding the hungry and not considering
any long term needs) actually support or imple
ment programs with a wide range of objectives.
From immediate care for those afflicted by acute
hunger, to introducing small, labor intensive
technology, to implementing basic health-care
delivery systems, an effort is made to help the
poor help themselves. The ultimate hope of all
these relief groups is that the poor will eventu
ally be able to wade out of their plight on their
own two feet. But it is obvious that initial assis
tance is needed; the organizations below are
administering thai assistance in many unique,
effective ways.
CARE is' s a P r ' vate relief and development
agency handling a combination of donated
surplus farm commodities and bulk-rate foods.
Each donated dollar provides $4.97 worth of de
livered aid. An important effort is the "food for
work" program, linking developmental aid,
medical training, and direct food relief into a
comprehensive program suited for each area's
needs.
CROP is the fund-raising and educational arm
of Church World Service (a non-denominational
organization) involved in international famine
relief and development aid. One area of relief is
the National Christian Council of Bangladesh
Economic and Social Welfare Committee which
is funding a number of projects including nutri

tion centers and agriculture training programs.
UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, is a non
sectarian agency. As an advocate for children,
they assist nations with the health, education,
and social well-being of their children. Accord
ing to UNICEF figures $.25 buys a mother and
