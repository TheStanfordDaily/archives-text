Internationally acclaimed, Double Suicide is based on a classic
Bunraku drama by the 18th Century playwright, Chikamatsu.
The Bunraku, or Puppet Drama, uses frank artifice to achieve
y emotional effect, and Shinoda attempts to apply cinematic *
1 equivalent of this technique in adapting Chikamatsu to the '
screen. At times the characters are manipulated as if they were
puppets by figures dressed in black â€” just as stage crews of
i Kabuki and Bunraku are. It is a story of an Osaka paper shop
* merchant who falls so in love with a courtesan he neglects his 1
business, his children and his wife. The courtesan, in turn, is so
in love with him that she rejects other customers.
