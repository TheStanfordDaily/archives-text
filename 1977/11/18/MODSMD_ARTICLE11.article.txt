# Senate disqualification
## 'A gross injustice has been committed' 
### 
Dan Livingston

Editor's Note: The following is the
text of former ASSU Sen. Dan
Livingston's remarks to the Senate
immediately following his disqualifi
cation at the Nov. 10senate meeting.
This afternoon I looked in the dic
tionary to find the definition of the
word "disqualify," and found it was
defined as "to deprive of the re
quired qualities, properties or condi
tions; to make unfit."
Indeed, I feel that I have been
made unfit, through no fault of my
own, as a result of the report we
heard tonight. Who could have ex
pected that the senate seat I won four
weeks ago could be taken away by
the subjective, ex post facto judg
ment of an extra-constitutional
commission for unwritten violations
which no one could have reasonably
forseen?
I have been tried in the headlines
by a newspaper seeking copy as a

result of charges which remain
nebulous at best. I remain of the be
lief that rules were created to fit the
circumstances. They did not exist be
fore but have been conveniently con
ceived in order to patch together the
technicalities for which the Elections
Review Board (ERB) has recom
mended my disqualification.
Terrible precedent
This decision ignores the law and
sets a terrible precedent. It places
every duly-elected senator in
jeopardy of having their seat stolen
by an ex post facto application of
rules by ASSU officials.
If I am sorry for anything, it is that
those hundreds of students who
voted for me may have regretted it as
a result of the image that has been
painted of me in the press. I have
often thought during these past few
weeks that if I were really the kind of
person the Daily has made me out to

be that I would probably hate Dan
Livingston, too.
If I am guilty of anything, it is that I
sought to help a cause more impor
tant than my own candidacy. I was a
conservative long before I was a can
didate. I felt the need to be true to
those convictions; that is why I did
what I did; that is why I entered the
race. How my actions, done without
malice, without intent to deceive,
and with the best interests of the
ASSU in mind now constitute a
"crime" — indeed now constitute
disqualification — is completely
beyond me. How the students and
the senate itself, are better served by
my removal is also beyond me.
Nothing wrong done
But I can go home tonight knowing
that I have done nothing wrong, that
I have been true to my convictions,
and most importantly, that I have
never used my position to destroy
the reputations of others.
And so, I leave tonight with some
bitterness — with a feeling that a
gross injustice has been committed,
and that a job I need to do is being
left undone.
It is difficult to say anything kind
tonight, but I do want to say that I
have enjoyed our first senate meet
ings and would like to say a few
things to its members.
To the SOC, the victims of the
hideous crimes for which I have been
punished, congratulations on a large
victory and on your superb organiza
tion in the election. I have detected
no animosity from you and I hope
you have felt none from me. I had
looked forward to doing honorable
battle with you this year . . . but un
fortunately, that won't be the
case. . . .
To Fred (Senate Chairman Fred
Crethel) I want to wish you good luck
... I know that if you handle the rest
of the meetings as well as you have
handled the first ones, that things
will work out fine.
To (Sen.) Tom McCormack, con
gratulations to you on a tremendous
victory ... I want to be able to read
in the Daily this year of such quotes
as "C'mon y'all, let's just slow down a
little bit and think about what we're
doing. . ."
Support
To (Sen.) Steve Buckley, I wish to
offer my most sincere thanks for his
support in the election, for which I
know he took a great deal of criticism
for both before and after. We don't

agree politically on many things,
Steve, but I think we have a mutual
respect for each other's ability and I
appreciate your looking beyond the
political issues to support me both
before and after the election.
To (Sen.) Doug Bandow, whose
support of me has been more
eloquent than my own ... I felt your
arguments were inarguable by those
who opposed them . . . apparently,

they have fallen on deaf ears.
I guess we all come from different
backgrounds . . . different perspec
tives, but I would hope, and I have
faith, that paramount in all of our
minds is the desire to make the ASSU
in particular and Stanford in general
a better place for all of us to live, to
work and to learn.
To that end, I wish you good luck
and bid you good night.

beyond me. How the students and
the senate itself, are better served by
my removal is also beyond me.
Nothing wrong done
But I can go home tonight knowing
that I have done nothing wrong, that
I have been true to my convictions,
and most importantly, that I have
never used my position to destroy
the reputations of others.
And so, I leave tonight with some
bitterness — with a feeling that a
gross injustice has been committed,
and that a job I need to do is being
left undone.
It is difficult to say anything kind
tonight, but I do want to say that I
have enjoyed our first senate meet
ings and would like to say a few
things to its members.
To the SOC, the victims of the
hideous crimes for which I have been
punished, congratulations on a large
victory and on your superb organiza
tion in the election. I have detected
no animosity from you and I hope
you have felt none from me. I had
looked forward to doing honorable
battle with you this year . . . but un
fortunately, that won't be the
case. . . .
To Fred (Senate Chairman Fred
Crethel) I want to wish you good luck
... I know that if you handle the rest
of the meetings as well as you have
handled the first ones, that things
will work out fine.
To (Sen.) Tom McCormack, con
gratulations to you on a tremendous
victory ... I want to be able to read
in the Daily this year of such quotes
as "C'mon y'all, let's just slow down a
little bit and think about what we're
doing. . ."
Support
To (Sen.) Steve Buckley, I wish to
offer my most sincere thanks for his
support in the election, for which I
know he took a great deal of criticism
for both before and after. We don't

agree politically on many things,
Steve, but I think we have a mutual
respect for each other's ability and I
appreciate your looking beyond the
political issues to support me both
before and after the election.
To (Sen.) Doug Bandow, whose
support of me has been more
eloquent than my own ... I felt your
arguments were inarguable by those
who opposed them . . . apparently,

they have fallen on deaf ears.
I guess we all come from different
backgrounds . . . different perspec
tives, but I would hope, and I have
faith, that paramount in all of our
minds is the desire to make the ASSU
in particular and Stanford in general
a better place for all of us to live, to
work and to learn.
To that end, I wish you good luck
and bid you good night.

Editor's Note: The following is the
text of former ASSU Sen. Dan
Livingston's remarks to the Senate
immediately following his disqualifi
cation at the Nov. 10senate meeting.
This afternoon I looked in the dic
tionary to find the definition of the
word "disqualify," and found it was
defined as "to deprive of the re
quired qualities, properties or condi
tions; to make unfit."
Indeed, I feel that I have been
made unfit, through no fault of my
own, as a result of the report we
heard tonight. Who could have ex
pected that the senate seat I won four
weeks ago could be taken away by
the subjective, ex post facto judg
ment of an extra-constitutional
commission for unwritten violations
which no one could have reasonably
forseen?
I have been tried in the headlines
by a newspaper seeking copy as a

result of charges which remain
nebulous at best. I remain of the be
lief that rules were created to fit the
circumstances. They did not exist be
fore but have been conveniently con
ceived in order to patch together the
technicalities for which the Elections
Review Board (ERB) has recom
mended my disqualification.
Terrible precedent
This decision ignores the law and
sets a terrible precedent. It places
every duly-elected senator in
jeopardy of having their seat stolen
by an ex post facto application of
rules by ASSU officials.
If I am sorry for anything, it is that
those hundreds of students who
voted for me may have regretted it as
a result of the image that has been
painted of me in the press. I have
often thought during these past few
weeks that if I were really the kind of
person the Daily has made me out to

be that I would probably hate Dan
Livingston, too.
If I am guilty of anything, it is that I
sought to help a cause more impor
tant than my own candidacy. I was a
conservative long before I was a can
didate. I felt the need to be true to
those convictions; that is why I did
what I did; that is why I entered the
race. How my actions, done without
malice, without intent to deceive,
and with the best interests of the
ASSU in mind now constitute a
"crime" — indeed now constitute
disqualification — is completely
beyond me. How the students and
the senate itself, are better served by
my removal is also beyond me.

tives, but I would hope, and I have
faith, that paramount in all of our
minds is the desire to make the ASSU
in particular and Stanford in general
a better place for all of us to live, to
work and to learn.
To that end, I wish you good luck
and bid you good night.
Dan Livingston

Editor's Note: The following is the
text of former ASSU Sen. Dan
Livingston's remarks to the Senate
immediately following his disqualifi
cation at the Nov. 10senate meeting.
This afternoon I looked in the dic
tionary to find the definition of the
word "disqualify," and found it was
defined as "to deprive of the re
quired qualities, properties or condi
tions; to make unfit."
Indeed, I feel that I have been
made unfit, through no fault of my
own, as a result of the report we
heard tonight. Who could have ex
pected that the senate seat I won four
weeks ago could be taken away by
the subjective, ex post facto judg
ment of an extra-constitutional
commission for unwritten violations
which no one could have reasonably
forseen?
I have been tried in the headlines
by a newspaper seeking copy as a

result of charges which remain
nebulous at best. I remain of the be
lief that rules were created to fit the
circumstances. They did not exist be
fore but have been conveniently con
ceived in order to patch together the
technicalities for which the Elections
Review Board (ERB) has recom
mended my disqualification.
Terrible precedent
This decision ignores the law and
sets a terrible precedent. It places
every duly-elected senator in
jeopardy of having their seat stolen
by an ex post facto application of
rules by ASSU officials.
If I am sorry for anything, it is that
those hundreds of students who
voted for me may have regretted it as
a result of the image that has been
painted of me in the press. I have
often thought during these past few
weeks that if I were really the kind of
person the Daily has made me out to

be that I would probably hate Dan
Livingston, too.
If I am guilty of anything, it is that I
sought to help a cause more impor
tant than my own candidacy. I was a
conservative long before I was a can
didate. I felt the need to be true to
those convictions; that is why I did
what I did; that is why I entered the
race. How my actions, done without
malice, without intent to deceive,
and with the best interests of the
ASSU in mind now constitute a
"crime" — indeed now constitute
disqualification — is completely
beyond me. How the students and
the senate itself, are better served by
my removal is also beyond me.
Nothing wrong done
But I can go home tonight knowing
that I have done nothing wrong, that
I have been true to my convictions,
and most importantly, that I have
never used my position to destroy
the reputations of others.
And so, I leave tonight with some
bitterness — with a feeling that a
gross injustice has been committed,
and that a job I need to do is being
left undone.
It is difficult to say anything kind
tonight, but I do want to say that I
have enjoyed our first senate meet
ings and would like to say a few
things to its members.
To the SOC, the victims of the
hideous crimes for which I have been
punished, congratulations on a large
victory and on your superb organiza
tion in the election. I have detected
no animosity from you and I hope
you have felt none from me. I had
looked forward to doing honorable
battle with you this year . . . but un
fortunately, that won't be the
case. . . .
To Fred (Senate Chairman Fred
Crethel) I want to wish you good luck
... I know that if you handle the rest
of the meetings as well as you have
handled the first ones, that things
will work out fine.
To (Sen.) Tom McCormack, con
gratulations to you on a tremendous
victory ... I want to be able to read
in the Daily this year of such quotes
as "C'mon y'all, let's just slow down a
little bit and think about what we're
doing. . ."
Support
To (Sen.) Steve Buckley, I wish to
offer my most sincere thanks for his
support in the election, for which I
know he took a great deal of criticism
for both before and after. We don't

agree politically on many things,
Steve, but I think we have a mutual
respect for each other's ability and I
appreciate your looking beyond the
political issues to support me both
before and after the election.
To (Sen.) Doug Bandow, whose
support of me has been more
eloquent than my own ... I felt your
arguments were inarguable by those
who opposed them . . . apparently,

they have fallen on deaf ears.
I guess we all come from different
backgrounds . . . different perspec
tives, but I would hope, and I have
faith, that paramount in all of our
minds is the desire to make the ASSU
in particular and Stanford in general
a better place for all of us to live, to
work and to learn.
To that end, I wish you good luck
and bid you good night.
