paration and distribution of the in
famous blue flyer merited
Livingston's disqualification because
it was "ethically unsound" and in vio
lation of campaign rules. Little con
sideration seems to have been given
to the fact that Livingston's participa
tion in the distribution of the flyer
was nonexistent.
Unsigned leaflets
Little consideration, however, is
exactly what such a fact merits, for
the important point is that the United
States Supreme Court, in Talley v.
California (1960), specifically pro
tected the use of unsigned leaflets
under the First Amendment right of
freedom of speech and press. The
court in Talley emphasized the valu
able role which anonymous flyers
served in our nation's creation, citing
as an example the Federalist Papers.
Regardless whether the ethical
standards of the ASSU or its appen
dages are deemed more worthy than
those of the Supreme Court, pre
sumptuous righteousness does not
suffice to transform a subjective
claim of ethical violation into a
punishable crime.
The claim that the anonymity of the
flyer violated campaign rules is also
easily dismissed. In the first place
there is no written rule against un
signed handbills. Norcari the rule be
implied, for the rule would be pa
tently unconstitutional.
Holding Livingston to the proscrip
tions of the rule despite its absence

As a seven-year observer and
sometimes participant in campus
political affairs, I find it increasingly
difficult to become moved by the pe
rennial scandals on which student
government seems to thrive.
Nevertheless, the most recent flurry
of nonsense has struck a particularly
raw nerve, and has motivated me
once again to offer a few choice
comments.
Last week Dan Livingston, chosen
by the students to serve on the ASSU
Senate, was removed from his seat
by the all-powerful, all-knowing and
all-protecting Election Review Board
(ERB). The Daily, continuing its sup
port of the ERB, applauded the diffi
culty of the ERB decision as it was
based on "little law and less prece
dent." (Daily, Nov. 14.)
Thin air
I concur in the judgment that the
ERB acted out of thin air, but am ap
palled that its arbitrary application of
ex post facto rules have elicited
praise. Decisions based on little law
and less precedent are the stuff of
which kangaroo courts are made, as
this episode has amply de
monstrated.
A brief examination of the clever, if
not insightful, charges posited by
Sean Murphy, the elections commis
sioner, demonstrates the type of
shallowthinkingwhich pervaded the
entire removal proceedings.
Murphy maintained to the bitter
end that Livingston's role in the pre-

merely compounds the constitu
tional infirmities, adding ex post
facto problems to the list. Though
Murphy was undaunted by these de
tails, the ERB apparently recognized
the problems and in a fit of rationality
canned the entire charge.
Murphy's second charge, that
Livingston violated campaign spend
ing limits, was more ludicrous than
the first. In fairness to Murphy, it was
based on equally unconstitutional
applications of ex post facto rules,
and thus was at least consistent.
Without further comment, I simply
note the ERB found Livingston inno
cent of the charge.
New charges
Though the ERB completely and
explicitly exonerated Livingston of
the charges brought against him by
Murphy, it did not hesitate to man
ufacture new charges in order to dis
qualify him. These charges, that
Livingston "failed to cooperate fully
and openly with Elections Commis
sioner Sean Murphy" and "failed to
report full campaign costs," were
charges to which Livingston was
never allowed a chance to respond.
The situation is analogous to a de
fendant being indicted, tried, and
found innocent of all charges against
him, yet being sentenced to death
for being a scoundrel because the
judge feels something ought to be
done.
The inherent unfairness of such a
situation is made even more so by the
disparity in severity of the penalties
attached to the charges.
Livingston "failed to cooperate fully
and openly," one alternate senator
lied to Murphy, and 15 senators and
alternatives "impeded the elections
commission investigation." Yet only
Livingston was disqualified. The liar
was suspended and the impeders
slapped with either wet-noodled
censures or reprimands. Apparently
it's all right to lie and impede, so long
as you cooperate fully and openly.
Attacking a person with ex post
facto rules and then denying the
right to defend against them consti
tutes an egregious violation of fun
damental principles of justice and
fairness. The ERB's actions are not
only reprehensible but extremely
dangerous as precedent. Though we
had little right to expect much from
five students playing judge and
executioner, we at least deserved
better than a kangaroo court.
