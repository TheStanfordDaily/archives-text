# Someone else's attempt at humor
## 
### 
Dave Ans/ey

This column does not push any
offbeat ideology. Or spread the
plague of run-on sentences. It simply
replaces my usual attempt at sick
humor with someone else's sick at
tempt at humor.
So you can read it if you like.
The question has often been raised
(well, once or twice anyway): What
kind of mail do you guys get at the
Daily?
Some incredible dreck gets
through, despite the best destructive
efforts of the postal service. For
example, we are often blessed with
letters from a guy in Ohio who says
he's God's messenger, Spanish stu
dent newspapers (in Spanish) and
unsolicited features on pot (written
by a press agent for E-Z Wider rolling
papers).
In case you're puzzling over an ap
propriate gift for your favorite
roommate, here's a couple of timely
items being pushed with press re
leases:
"Underwear that's funtawear" is a
"unique undergarment experi
ence." Honest.
"An escape from the doldrums of
ho-hum undergarments."
Yeah, but can they beat edible pan
ties?
"Twenty full-color eye-catching
designs." Excuse me, but if someone
is eyeing your underwear, they're
probably more interested in what's
underneath.
"Sweeping the nation with top-

selling designs such as the 'I've Got
The Force' Star Drawers; the nine
inch 'Golden Rule;'andthe'Gunsling
er' sporting a .45 peacemaker.
"Undercover favourites (love that
British spelling) of stockbrokers and
stock clerks, politicians and police
men. .
Don't belong to one of those
categories? Perhaps we can interest
you in "Childstar, the Hollywood
greeting card company that put the X
back into Xmas" with their glossy
photo cards:
"St. Nick's in for a few digs with
'Dashing Through the Snow,' which
pictures a jovial Santa pursued by a
nymph wearing nothing but her
lipstick.
"Then there's the open-mouthed
gasp of a surprised six-year-old on
Christmas Eve when he says 'I saw
daddy kissing Santa Claus.'
"What could be more appropriate
in celebrating the nativity than a birth
announcement? 'Joseph and Mary of
Nazareth announce the birth of a
son, Jesus Christ' is beautifully
printed on parchment vellum in
Christmas green and red."
The only thing more amazing than
these products: "press release"
writers who think these products are
worth writing about.
"Editors: Funtawear samples are
available on request for editorial/
photo layout purposes."
