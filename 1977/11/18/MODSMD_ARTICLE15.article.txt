# 'Disregard for legality'

The judgment rendered by the
Elections Review Board (ERB) should
give us pause. By disqualifying Dan
Livingston, the ERB has taught us a
few lessons.
First, it is better to lie than to tell
the truth. The candidate who lied
was not disqualified, while Dan
Livingston, who never lied, was (for
failure to volunteer information).
Second, it is better to "impede"
the investigation of the Elections
Commission, than to fail to "cooper
ate fully and openly" with it. Candi
dates who did the former were not
disqualified; however, Dan, who did
not do the former, was.
Third, it is simply better not to be
Dan Livingston. An alternate on
Dan's slate was charged with the
same offense of failing to "fully re
port" campaign costs and was not
disqualified.
Fourth, it is acceptable to disqual
ify someone on the basis of charges
that the person did not know were

being leveled against him, and to
which he had no chance to respond.
Even the Elections Commission had
not recommended his disqualifica
tion on these grounds; Dan mista
kenly thought he had to respond to
the charges that had been made
against him.
And finally, there is clearly no need
for any election laws at all. The ERB
blazed a new trail in ASSU jurispru
dence by making up the crimes as
they went along; the by-laws and
constitution are clearly no longer re
levant.
Most people seem to have lost
track of the fundamental principle
that has been so badly perverted;
people should have fair warning of
the consequences of their actions.
Here there was none. A reasoned
look at the constitution and by-laws
does not conceivably suggest that
some subjective and unknowable
ideals would be turned into crimes,
and would result in disqualification.

The action of the ERB, that is, re
troactively kicking someone out for
doing something that at the time was
not a recognized violation, is akin to
the California legislature passing a
law retroactively banning blue flyers,
and prosecuting Dan under it. Such
an e* post facto law would be ex
pressly prohibited by the U.S. Con
stitution.
The precedent will come back to
haunt us. In the future, any candi
date is subject to having someone
else retroactively pass subjective
judgment upon their conduct.
Thus, this most basic procedural
safeguard has been blindly forgot
ten; the myopic and callous disre
gard for legality in the blind search
for some form of nebulous and sub
jective "moral truth" has perversely
led to the greatest moral injustice of
all.
