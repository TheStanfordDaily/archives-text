San Francisco (AP) — A state
Public Utilities Commission
hearing officer recommended
Thursday that Pacific Gas &
Electric reduce its rates by
}>j6.5 million a year and refund
as much as $100 million to its
customers.
In a hard-hitting, 124-page
proposed report, the utility
was blasted for placing
what was called unjustified re
liance on statistically meaning
less surveys and studies in its
efforts toward energy conser
vation.
The report, by hearing of
ficer Carol Coffey, resulted
from a study following PG&E's
general rate increase of $176.4
million in August 1976.
PG&E spokesman Dennis
Pooler said the utility would re
serve comment until it could
study the thick report.

The recommendation on a
rate decrease and refunds was
purportedly based on the utili
ty's income tax allowances, tax
refunds and future tax credits
taken in 1976. A PUC spokes
man said it was determined
that PG&E paid no taxes in
1975, 1976 and so far this year.
The PUC report found that
PG&E took income tax allo
wances of $56.5 million in 1976,
received a tax refund of $75
million for that year, and had
available *50 million to reduce
federal tax payments after
1976.
The report found that since
the date of the increase, PG&E
got $56.5 million a year in re
venues for allowance for in
come taxes which it has not
demonstrated that it will actu
ally pay to any governmental
body.
