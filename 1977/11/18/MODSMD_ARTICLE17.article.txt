# Abercrombie sale

### 
New York (AP) — For 85 years
it provided playthings for pres
idents, potentates and ple
bians with healthy pocket
books. But Thursday, after a
year of fighting off bankruptcy,.
Abercrombie & Fitch began its
going-out-of-business sale.
In the next four days, the
elegant sporting goods and ac
cessories chain expects to
clear out an $8.5 million inven
tory of luxury clothing and
quality hardware for indoor
and outdoor sportsmen.
Hundreds of bargain
hunters strode purposefully
through the main doors of its
Madison Avenue store here at
8 a.m. after waiting hours in
rain.
"What brings me here? A
venerable old store going belly
up — and the vultures are
gathering," Ron Rose, 41, a
Manhattan insurance man,
said self-deprecatingly.
Rose and his girl friend,
Michele Peimer, in jeans and
down jackets, were in the first

wave of thousands going
through the main doors. They
headed for the clothing on the
third floor and stroked approv
ingly a natural-color short
shearling coat, marked down
to $330.
"Too much," mused Rose.
"We may end up getting no
thing. I'm looking for a leather
coat, then possibly some fish
ing stuff.
"I shopped here rarely," he
said, "just for good cutlery and
archery stuff that I couldn't
find elsewhere." He ended up
buying a filleting knite, marked
down to $ I J.BB from $8.50 and
which he said he needed "like
a fish needs a bicycle."
Closeout sales were going
on also at Abercrombie
branches in Chicago, San Fran
cisco and Bel Harbor, Fla. In
cluded was stock from five
other branches that shut down
earlier this month in Palm
Beach, Fla.; Short Hills, N.J.;
Oak Brook, III.; Troy, Mich,
and Colorado Springs, Colo.
