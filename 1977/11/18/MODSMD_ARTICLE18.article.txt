Every time we go to lack's or
McDonald's, the same question comes
up - is there milk in their milk shakes?
I'm told they make them with "shake
mix." What is that? Is there milk in that?
What exactly are we drinking???
-P.B.
Well, I called McDonald's general of
fices in San lose and talked with pur
chasing secretary Connie Silva. She
told me that McDonald's uses either
condensed milk or Grade A milk pow
der.
I next called the folks at |ack-in-the-
Box. They would only tell me that they
use "ice milk" from Berkeley Farms.
Wondering what "ice milk" was
exactly, I called Berkeley Farms. They
said that "ice milk" must contain at
least V/i per cent milk fat by law, so the
ice milk "shake mix" that they sell "de
finitely contains milk."
So if you believe that "Every body
needs milk," rest assured that your
body will be getting some from a milk
shake at Mac's or jack's.
Who is responsible for providing the
benches at the bus stop near the mam
Quad (24-86 lines)???
One of the benches has been broken
since the beginning of the quarter.
Plant Services is responsible for re-

pairing such items and I have already
reported the damage to Al Genevro,
shop superintendent at Plant Services.
For those who are interested in
benches, Facilities Planning has or
dered benches for the Marguerite bus
stops along Serra Street.
Can anything be done to make the
bicyclists passing through White Plaia
more considerate of pedestrians? It
used to be very pleasant to take a casual
walk through the central campus area,
but now you have to watch out every
step ot the way, lest you get run down.
-B.S.
Two letters have recently appeared in
the Daily concerning this matter (Daily;
Nov. 14, Nov. 16). The last letter men
tioned an open meeting tor those con
cerned with bicycle safety. It will be
held at noon, Tuesday, November 22,
in Tresidder room 132, and I urge all
interested persons to attend.
As typical Stanford graduate stu
dents, we wrestle daily with those burn
ing philosophical questions which truly
have a right to be considered ultimate:
What is the proper interpretation of
Hegel's being-as-such? Can we really
transcend subjective objectivity? What
is the true nature of the universe?

But no question among these has
been the cause of more searching and
fevered debate than the following, a
question that you with your immense
wisdom and renowned perserverance
may in fact be able to answer for us.
Does Bubba Smith really rip the top off
the Miller Lite can or is it some kind of
cheap trick?
-PS & RL
According to the Miller Brewing
Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
"that information is not available." "It's
like being a magician," they said, "you
just don't reveal your secrets." Sorry —

I guess the secret of Miller Lite is a
tough can to crack. (I'd call Bubba, but I
don't think he'd tell either.)
CORRECTION: In last week's Bug Me,
Oscar Nelson was incorrectly identified
as the director of Facilities Planning. His
correct title is Master Planner, lames
kelson is director of Facilities Planning.
Something "bugging you"? If so,
bring a note by the Daily office, or send
it to: Bug Me, c/o The Stanford Daily,
Storke Publications Building, Stanford,
CA. 94 iO5. Only intials will be used.
