# Player ticket scalping common
## 
### Randy Keith 
So you want to buy a Big Came ticket? Chances are
that if you bought one recently for reserved seats some
where between the 25 and 30 yard lines it cost you
around $25 and it came from a member of the football
team.
Illegal ticket scalping by players on collegiate teams is
common knowledge and the Stanford players are no
exception.
"We know damn well that athletes resell their com
plimentry tickets," said Ray Young, assistant athletic di
rector.
"I'm sure football players are selling their Big Came
tickets for more than their face value," he said.
One player said that one of the team members sold
eight tickets for $25 apiece.
Reselling of tickets for face value does not violate the
NCAA regulations governing the conduct of collegiate
sports nor does it violate California state law, but players
here are known to sell their free tickets to the highest
bidder in complete disregard of their signed Student-
Athlete statement.
"I know people on the team are making money on the
tickets," one player said.
"Some sell to students, some sell to friends or parents
and some sell to other people, but they all find some
place to sell them," he added.
"This is something that has been going on for years,"
according to )oe Ruetz, director of athletics. "It is just
like students who resell their game tickets to make a few
dollars ... if we can find out about any player involved
in this type of activity we would first investigate the
claim, speak to the coach and the player and if it proved
true, declare the player ineligible," he added.
Never declared
Ruetz said that he has never declared a player ineligi
ble for scalping tickets.
According to NCAA football regulations which are
read to the team each year and then signed by individual
players, "A student-athlete shall not be eligible in a sport

if he has . . . ever received compensation of more than
face value for any ticket (purchased or complimentry) to
an athletic contest involving his institution or received
money from his institution in lieu of such tickets."
Players are allowed four free tickets to each home
game in their sport and two for each away game. Players
here have been allowed to purchase four additional
tickets for the Big Came, according to Betty Robertson of
the Athletic Department Ticket Office.
A NCAA Enforcement Division spokesman said that no
school has been investigated solely on charges of ticket
scalping since October of last year when the NCAA in
vestigated the University of Oklahoma. Citing NCAA
policy, he refused to discuss the Oklahoma case.
According to John McCasey of the UC-Berkeley Athle
tic Department Public Relations office, scalped Big
Came tickets are "going pretty good" at Berkeley, but
said that he was "not aware" of any scalping by members
of the Cal football team.
But, he added, "To say that it certainly doesn't go on at
Cal is naive."
Captain Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford police said he
is concerned about the possibility of large scale scalping
operations at the Big Game. He said that he feels that
most of the tickets being offered by scalpers come from
football players here.
Niemeyer also warned there are two other methods of
scalping; "one is the selling of fascimile or worthless
tickets and the other is offering a good deal to the pas
sing fan and when the fan takes the money out, to snatch
it and run off."
Access to large blocks of tickets by alumni, scalpers or
students is difficult, according to Robertson. "I question
anyone who wants large blocks of tickets unless they are
an established group," she said.
She did say that blocks of tickets could be purchased
at various other ticket outlets however.
"We are not about to establish an FBI to examine our
players on the minutia of NCAA regulations," Ruetz
said.
