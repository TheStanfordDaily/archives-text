# Enjoy exotic brunch at New Varsity

The New Varsity
Theatre Restaurant
456 University Avenue
Palo Alto
Melodious notes from a Re
naissance lute float through
the air as you sit on a Spanish
patio sipping a glass of chablis.
Perky blue and white umbrel
las and canvas directors chairs
labeled Gary Cooper, Marilyn
Monroe, Al Pacino, etc. are
sprinkled throughout the cour
tyard of not a sidewalk cafe in
Pamplona, but The New Varsity
Theatre Restaurant in
downtown Palo Alto.
Sunday Brunch at The New
Varsity is relaxed and pleasur
able. Thequaintand unpreten
tious atmosphere certainly
contributes to the enjoyable
dining experience here, but
the delicious food speaks for
itself. Complimentary cham
pagne or chablis, French cof
fee, fresh fruit (strawberries)
with a delicate sour-cream rum
sauce and golden creullers
(somewhat similar to a round
fried doughnut), generously
covered with sugar, are served
with each brunch. These are a
great opening for any of the in
teresting entrees found on the
menu.
For something a bit diffe
rent, try the Seafound Quiche
($5.50). At least three inches
high, with a light flaky crust
and plenty of shrimp and scal
lops, it is a very tasty dish,
though a bit on the dry side.
Mushroom, chicken, and
seafood crepes are $4.50. Like
the quiche and the Frittata Re
vano (onions and spinach in a
souffle-style omelette), the
crepes are served with tender
and fresh sauteed cauliflower,
broccoli, and carrots. The
breeze tends to cool the veget
ables, so eat them soon after
they are served.
A diverse selection of
omelets ($4.50), in addition to

the Frittata Ravano, is offered.
Sample the delicate French
herb omelette, or the unique
Basquaise omelette with to
matoes, chiles, and onions.
Absolutely irresistable are
the Cheese Blintzes ($4.50).
The light cheese filling is mild
and not too sweet; the topping
of raspberry preserves and
sour-cream accents it well. No
body could eat just two.
Portions served here are, for
most people, adequate. Con
sidering the scrumptious ap
petizers included with each
meal, the prices are reasonable
enough.
The New Varsity also serves
lunch and dinner, and if you
spend a minimum of five dol
lars on dinner, you will be ad
mitted to that night's movie for
one dollar. Showing
November 10-16 is The Valley,
and November 17-23 Fellini's
Amarcord.
