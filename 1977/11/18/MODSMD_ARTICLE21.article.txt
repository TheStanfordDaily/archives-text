Pistachio's Restaurant
and Delicatessen
Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
Good food, accommodating
service, and a casual charm
are the hallmarks of Pistachio's
Restaurant and Delicatessen.
One of Town and Country's
newest additions, Pistachio's
offers a pleasant escape from
the typical pizza and burger
haunts of the Stanford student.
Hanging ferns, subtle earth
tones and the effective use of
natural wood furnishings
create a warm and comfortable
atmosphere. The menu is var
ied, and, like the mood, leaves
little to be desired. Regular
favorites include "healthful

sandwiches," bountiful salads,
and "sinfully chocolate" de
sserts; dinner entrees and
dailyhouse specialties are also
featured.
We ordered the Salmon
Provencale ($7.95) and Sirloin
Teriyaki Brochette ($6.25) and
as our clean plates later tes
tified, we were more than satis
fied with our selections. Both
meals included a large tossed
garden-patch salad with a
tangy house dressing and a
basket of crisp rye and bagel
wafers baked in parmesan and
garlic seasonings.
The salmon was smothered
in mushrooms, tomatoes, and
a light garlic and white wine
sauce. The teriyaki was ske
wered with chunks of pineap

ple, green pepper, and onion,
and basted in a savory sweet
and sour sauce. Like the sal
mon, the brochette was
served with wild rice and
lightly sauteed zucchini.
Thoughtfully prepared and at
tractively served, each entree
was an aesthetic as well as a
culinary delight.
Not to be outdone, Pis
tachio's dessert fare offers a
teiVipting array of pastries,
cakes and ice cream sundaes.
In the interest of good report
ing (not to mention good eat
ing), we felt compelled to sam
ple the"sweets," and ordered
Pistachio's "Favorite Ice Cream
Pie" ($1.25) and old-fashioned
cheesecake (65 cents).
After one bite the ice cream

pie quickly became our "favo
rite" as well. Dripping with
sweet strawberry sauce, this
calorific bombshell consists of
two thick layers of ice cream,
one french vanilla, the other
pistachio, mounded on top of a
flaky golden piecrust. Rich and
creamy, the cheesecake
proved to be equally delicious.
Finally, steaming cups of
dark coffee marked the end of
our meal and the beginning of
what I hope is a continued Pis
tachio patronage. So, whether
you're an intimate two, a
friendly few, or even just a
hungry "many," Pistachio's
has the right feeling and the
right food for you.

and basted in a savory sweet
and sour sauce. Like the sal
mon, the brochette was
served with wild rice and
lightly sauteed zucchini.
Thoughtfully prepared and at
tractively served, each entree
was an aesthetic as well as a
culinary delight.
Not to be outdone, Pis
tachio's dessert fare offers a
teiVipting array of pastries,
cakes and ice cream sundaes.
In the interest of good report
ing (not to mention good eat
ing), we felt compelled to sam
ple the"sweets," and ordered
Pistachio's "Favorite Ice Cream
Pie" ($1.25) and old-fashioned
cheesecake (65 cents).
After one bite the ice cream

pie quickly became our "favo
rite" as well. Dripping with
sweet strawberry sauce, this
calorific bombshell consists of
two thick layers of ice cream,
one french vanilla, the other
pistachio, mounded on top of a
flaky golden piecrust. Rich and
creamy, the cheesecake
proved to be equally delicious.
Finally, steaming cups of
dark coffee marked the end of
our meal and the beginning of
what I hope is a continued Pis
tachio patronage. So, whether
you're an intimate two, a
friendly few, or even just a
hungry "many," Pistachio's
has the right feeling and the
right food for you.

Pistachio's Restaurant
and Delicatessen
Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
Good food, accommodating
service, and a casual charm
are the hallmarks of Pistachio's
Restaurant and Delicatessen.
One of Town and Country's
newest additions, Pistachio's
offers a pleasant escape from
the typical pizza and burger
haunts of the Stanford student.
Hanging ferns, subtle earth
tones and the effective use of
natural wood furnishings
create a warm and comfortable
atmosphere. The menu is var
ied, and, like the mood, leaves
little to be desired. Regular
favorites include "healthful

sandwiches," bountiful salads,
and "sinfully chocolate" de
sserts; dinner entrees and
dailyhouse specialties are also
featured.
We ordered the Salmon
Provencale ($7.95) and Sirloin
Teriyaki Brochette ($6.25) and
as our clean plates later tes
tified, we were more than satis
fied with our selections. Both
meals included a large tossed
garden-patch salad with a
tangy house dressing and a
basket of crisp rye and bagel
wafers baked in parmesan and
garlic seasonings.
The salmon was smothered
in mushrooms, tomatoes, and
a light garlic and white wine
sauce. The teriyaki was ske
wered with chunks of pineap

ple, green pepper, and onion,
and basted in a savory sweet
and sour sauce. Like the sal
mon, the brochette was
served with wild rice and
lightly sauteed zucchini.
Thoughtfully prepared and at
