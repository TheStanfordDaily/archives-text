Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
