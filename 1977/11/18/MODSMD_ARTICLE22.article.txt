Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is

procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,
(Space paid for by News & Publications Service}
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,

Recommended statement on investment responsibility

1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment is to maximize the financial return on those resources,
taking into account the amount of risk appropriate for
University investment policy.
However, when corporate policies or practices are ad
judged by the trustees to cause substantial social injury, they,
as responsible and ethical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor in their investment policies and in voting
proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms; for purposes of
these guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The obligation to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on
corporate securities derives in part from Stanford University's
Founding Grant, which states that among the purposes of the
University is "to promote the public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity and civilization." This duty
also arises from the obligations of stewardship inherent in the
ownership and beneficial use of property, including corporate
securities.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds) in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary
criterion for the retention of the University's endowment
securities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3.
In both cases, when assessing the expected return on the
securities of a company, the investment manager or advisor
shall take into consideration any substantial social injury
caused by company activities which is likely to produce an
adverse governmental or public reaction.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees find that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which seeks to elimi
nate or reduce the substantial social injury, the University
will vote th« proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or retard such elimination or reduction.
In cases where there is serious doubt as to the degree of social
injury or where the proposed remedy is deemed unreason
able, the University may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees find that the
company's activities cause social injury, the University may
make formal or informal representations to corporate man
agement to explain or reinforce its position on proxy issues
and on issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees find that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees
determine that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities or policies
would have a direct and material effect in alleviating such
injury,
ii) the University has exhausted its practicable share
holder rights in seeking to modify the company's activities to

eliminate or reduce the substantial social injury thereby
caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the University will not continue to exercise its shareholder
rights under the foregoing paragraphs, but will instead sell the
securities in question within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions
If a finding is made by the trustees that a specific
University action otherwise indicated under these guidelines
is likely to impair seriously the capacity of the University to
carry out its educational mission (for example, by causing
significant adverse action on the part of governmental or
other external agencies or groups, or by causing deep divi
sions within the University community), then the University
will not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBI
LITY
The Trustees shall receive recommendations concerning
the implementation of the above guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).
3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President from each of the components of the University
community, in the following numbers: three members of the
Academic Council, three students, three alumni, one adminis
trative officer, and two other full-time staff. One trustee and
the director of finance shall be members without vote, ex
officio.
b) Members shall be appointed for at least one year and
may be reappointed. Members shall serve until their succes
sors take office. In the event of a vacancy caused by death,
disability, or resignation of a member, the President shall
appoint a replacement, who shall serve until the expiration of
such member's term and until a successor takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President.
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair
or by any six members.
b) The Chair is responsible for setting agendas. The Chair
shall take as an agenda item any matter referred by the Board
of Trustees, the President, or the vice-president for business
and finance. The Chair shall also take as an agenda item any
matter submitted by two or more members of the CIR. In
addition, the CIR will consider written proposals from any
member or group of the Stanford community for possible
inclusion on the agenda. The director of finance shall,
whenever practicable, give reasonable notice to the CIR of
any matter pertaining to the University's endowment securi
ties which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consult
ants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the
CIR and make staff and research time available in amounts
approved by the President on the basis of annual budgets
submitted by the CIR and approved by the President. In
extraordinary circumstances the CIR may request additional
staff and research time from the President.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by or on behalf of the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with
respect to proxy issues on which the University has the right
to vote. (An investment pool is a commingled group of
investment funds and assets. The vast majority of the Univer
sity's endowment assets are retained in commingled pools.)
f) The CIR may establish committees of its members, to

serve at the pleasure of the CiR.
g) The CIR may establish rules of procedure, subject to
the provisions of this statement.
3.3 Operations
a) The CIR shall examine issues of investment responsi
bility involving the University's endowment securities and
make appropriate recommendations for action by the trust
ees. Such recommendations shall take into consideration the
following factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has
gathered in its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed
within the Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3)
the legal and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) The CIR may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage
the convening of occasional local public meetings or forums
to assess the views of members of the Stanford community
concerning investment responsibility issues including, but not
limited to, proxy issues.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the
University community, including a member of the CIR, a
writtpn request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall
first determine whether the request, on its face and assuming
its factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established
by Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.
d) The CIR shall make its recommendation in writing to
the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
factual findings and an analysis of the question involved.
Appointed or ex officio members of the CIR who hold
dissenting or divergent views may submit them in writing
with the ClR's recommendation. The recommendation, to
gether with accompanying materials, shall be made available
for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before
taking action.
112) The trustees will make the final decision on all recom
mendations for action under this policy. Should the trustees
decide not to accept a recommendation of the CIR, the CIR
will be informed of the reasons for the trustees' actions.
4. AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES
4.1 The trustees may amend this Statement from time to
time.
4.2 The CIR may, from time to time, submit recom
mendations to the trustees for amendments to this State
ment.

Comments by Nelson G. Dong, Rodney H. Adams, and Tully
M. Friedman.
In very large measure, the work of our Ad Hoc Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility should speak for itself. The
product of our many meetings and many more hours of
private discussions and redrafting fairly sets forth our collec
tive wisdom—and our collective doubts—on the subject of the
University's obligations as an ethical investor.
We individual members are appending these few words,
first, to record the spirit in which our committee worked,
and second, to convey our personal views of why this
document should be adopted in toto.
I. The Ad Hoc Committee on Investment Responsibility
Our committee came together in early summer, mostly
strangers to one another. We brought varying degrees of
expertise and interest to this project, but in a very short time
we had worked out both procedures and goals for ourselves.
Throughout our meetings, the members engaged in vigorous,
blunt, and often diametrically opposed debates. Often there
were as many 'sides' to an issue under discussion as there
were committee members.
It is perhaps somewhat self-serving to say this, but we do
believe that the committee members maintained an extraor
dinary degree of civility and respect for one another despite
the many differences that separated them. There was much
give-and-take, but the entire effort was sustained by the
common motivation of all the committee members: to
produce a document that would be a credit to the University
and a model for other ethical institutional investors through
out the U.S.
Accordingly, many individual preferences and strongly
held views were deliberately subsumed to create a draft
document that would be acceptable to the greatest number
of committee members. We hope that in your own delibera

tions you will keep that thought in mind.
As the minutes of our meetings reflect, there was a
discussion about virtually every word, phrase, and punctua
tion mark in the document; you may rest assured that very
careful thought was given to the language and the many
checks and balances finally agreed upon.
11. The 1971 Statement
Our initial charge was to reexamine the premises and
procedures of the 1971 statement adopted by the trustees.
The committee members unanimously agreed that the docu
ment, however well-motivated at the time of its drafting, was
inadequate to the present situation. The minutes of our first
two meetings, at which this conclusion was reached, may not
adequately describe the reasons for our virtually total rejec
tion of the language from the 1971 statement.
In the intervening seven years, the concepts of ethical
investment and corporate social responsibility have become
substantially accepted, both by institutional investors and by
the corporations in which the University has invested.
The debate today is over the degree, rather than the
propriety, of such considerations. The 1971 statement, which
was a pioneering document, was framed in a time when it was
necessary to be defensive and cautious, in order that the
concepts might gain limited acceptance. Today that kind of
negative and tentative tone in the 1971 statement (especially
in Section II) is not only unnecessary but inappropriate.
111. The Committee Proposal
Although we chose to reject the bulk of the 1971
statement, it was a starting point for our work.
A. "Substantial consensus" v. "social injury"
Conceptually we have retained, in a slightly different
form, the criterion of "undesirable social, economic [or I
political acts." However, we have abandoned the concept of
"substantial consensus within the Stanford community"
because that concept has proven difficult to define and
impossible to assess.
Instead we have substituted essentially two levels of
objective fact-finding: first, by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and second, by the trustees themselves
Action can be taken if there is agreement within those
bodies as to the presence of a substantial social injury caused
by a corporation's activities. We believe this is a much more
workable standard for both bodies.
B. The preamble
The preamble to our draft is probably the most self-ex
planatory portion of our product. It recognizes the fiduciary
duty of the trustees, but it goes on to recognize the duty to
be an ethical institutional investor, and it goes on to cite the
sources of that additional duty.
C. The Commission on Investment Responsibility
The core of the committee proposal is a revised Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (CIR). By its composition,
the CIR will be made up of members of the different
components of the University community, yet they will not
serve as representatives per se.
The CIR will have an ongoing linkage to the director of
finance, who is in the first instance responsible for the
investment decisions of the University. He will be an ex
officio nonvoting member of the CIR itself, and it will be
primarily to his office that the CIR will look for staff support
and financial analyses. He will routinely and expeditiously
refer matters within the purview of the CIR for its considera
tions.
D. Fact Finding
The CIR will first focus on the threshold question of
"social injury" and the degree thereof. This finding will be
based on all available information from the affected corpora
tion ands'rom proponents of issues. The CIR analysis will be
further buttressed by the contributions of highly qualified
groups such as the Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) in Washington, D.C., to which the University has
been a subscriber since the IRRC's inception.
But a CIR finding of social injury, or even substantial
social injury, will only be the first step. Second, the CIR
must also analyze the intrinsic reasonableness of the proposal
in relation to that in jury, and, third, it must weigh the legal
and financial effects of the proposal to the University itself.
Only then will the CIR make its recommendation.
All relevant data are to be factored into the consideration
of the ClR—economic and financial information from the
University's financial advisors and officers, legal analyses, and
the opinions of ail interested members and groups within the
Stanford community.
Although the language is not used in our present draft,
the 1971 Statement did contain this useful observation:
"Optimal choice of investments is a complex problem
at best, and additional social, economic, and political
considerations further increase this complexity• There is
no substitute for independent judgments, weighting dif
ferent factors appropriately in each particular case. "
We have accordingly eschewed making iron-clad rules.
Instead we have focused on creating a mechanism for collect
ing and analyzing the maximum amount of information
bearing on investment decisions that have corporate social
responsibility implications.
The linchpin of this entire proposal is the final written
report of the CIR. These are to be the comprehensive
recommendations for action (or nonaction, if appropriate)
fully supported by a factual record. The director of finance
will have had full input in preparing the recommendation,
and he may, from time to time, accompany that report with
his own independent analysis. Each member of the CIR may
submit supplemental or dissenting views as well.
E. Channels of comunication
We believe it essential that the entire CIR report be sent
concurrently to the appropriate individuals: the Board of
Trustees, which will review the CIR report and make the final
decisions; the President of the University, who has overall
administrative responsibility for the financial operational
welfare of the University; and the vice-president for business
and finance, under whose jurisdiction falls the management
of the University endowment and with whom the Univer
sity's investment advisor must work.
The reasons for these channels of reporting are several.
First, although the CIR is appointed by the President, its
primary function is to advise the trustees in the discharge of
their fiduciary and ethical obligations noted above. Whatever
weight may ultimately be given to the CIR report, the
recommendations for action are properly directed to the
trustees themselves. Yet it is only fair that the report also go
to the affected administrative officers at the same time.
Second, such a flow of information between the CIR and
these individuals will hopefully open an ongoing dialogue
within the Stanford community about the financial and
ethical issues implicit in operating a major private university.
Third, such a channel will go far in restoring the credibi
lity of the CIR within some segments of the University
community. Our committee noted the perceived impotence
of the present CIR because its reports and recommendations,
under the present plan, may never reach the trustees at all,
regardless of the amount of effort that may have been
invested by the CIR. Such a channel would be in the nature
of a "fair hearing" for the considered views of the CIR.
It is our understanding that President Lyman fully appre
ciates these reasons for this mechanism and supports it. We
sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees will reach the same
conclusion.
V Conclusion
In closing, each member of the Committee obviously
hopes that the Board of Trustees will adopt the proposed
plan. But beyond that, each of us hopes that the Board of
Trustees will then honor the implicit understanding that great
weight should be given to the recommendations of the CIR.
Every effort has been made to assure that the CIR will
operate in a spirit of due process and full information. Its
conclusions and recommendations will likely be the product
of many long hours of careful analysis, probably many more
than would have been possible had the trustees sought to
make the same analysis themselves.
Thank you for your attention to our report.

Three student
members opinion
Following are comments by Ellen Byrne, Lloyd Dixon,
and Anne Henkels:
As meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility rolled by, it became clear to the three student
members that the Committee would not have time to fully
address all issues raised by the question of investment respon
sibility. It also became evident to us that irreconcilable differ
ences were developing.
Below, we elaborate points that were not accepted by the
Committee as a whole and strongly suggest substitutions to
the proposed Statement that would make it more acceptable
to the Stanford community. We trust that Board members
will lead this appendix as carefully as the rest of the report.
It is important to remember why this report was written.
The Ad Hoc Committee was commissioned by the trustees in
response to dissatisfaction within the Stanford community
with the University's 1971 Statement on Investment Respon
sibility. In fact, were it not for community concern, the 1971
Policy Statement would not have been written, and if not for
overt action on the campus last spring, the Statement would
not have been reexamined by this Committee.
The Ad Hoc Committee consisted of three community
groups-students, faculty and alumnae-and two ex officio
adminstrators. Because we interpret this as the Board's recog
nition of the importance of community opinion in forming
an investment policy, we were dismayed that staff were not
represented on the Committee. The legitimacy of whatever
policy the Board chooses to adopt will be lessened by the
absence of input from this functional and important part of
Stanford.
Our fellow committee members represented themselves,
their professional viewpoints, and what thoy thought a con
stituency of faculty, alumnae, or trustees would find accept
able, just as we put forward our personal thought and the
viev? of students as they were conveyed to us. The work of

the Ad Hoc Committee was to write a University investment
policy that was responsible to community concern. However,
the majority decision of the Committee to have closed meet
ings and private minutes restricted community input, as inter
ested people could not follow or respond to Committee
progress from meeting to meeting.
In the writing of these new investment guidelines, we
accepted the trustees' final power in decision-making as a
legal premise, but we do not agree with it in sentiment. While
President Lyman has repeatedly told the campus that the
University is not a democratic institution, as long as that is
true, a struggle for power and influence will always rightfully
exist. The trustees are responsible to their constituency, and
the community is entitled to participate in the shaping of
policy at Stanford.
Before we explain our alternative drafts of sections of the
report, we would like to clarify that this Statement deals
only with endowment securities and is only a first step in
developing a policy of investment responsibility for Stan
ford's capital assets. It is equally important for the Board to
consider the social, political, and economic impacts of the
University's land ownership, research contracts, employment
practices, and government lobbying.
1. PREAMBLE
While we attempted to strengthen Stanford's commitment
to a more responsible investment policy, the tone of the
Preamble is disappointing., It does not articulate the prin
ciples that make investment responsibility necessary.
First, as we have stated before, in order that it may fulfill
its educational mission, Stanford owns property, employs
thousands of people, and invests millions of dollars. The
University must consider the effects it has on society as a
whole in carrying out these economic functions.
Secondly, the Founding Grant mandates the trustees to
observe two responsiblities. The first is to maintain and
upgrade the University, which is currently fulfilled by maxi
mizing return on all investments. The second responsibility is
to manage the trust in a way consistent with general ethical
and moral principles. We still are unable to accept the subor
dination of social responsibility to maximum return. We
therefore suggest the following Preamble:
As investors, it is the incurred responsibility of the
trustees to exercise control over an asset in view of its
social, political, and economic impact. This duty arises
from obligations inherent in the ownership and bene
ficial use of property. It is also affirmed by Stanford's
Founding Grant, which states that among the Univer
sity's purposes is to "promote the public welfare by
exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization."
In order to establish and maintain "seminaries of
learning as shall make it (the University) of highest
grade," as prescribed in the Founding Grant, the pri
mary fiduciary duty of the trustees in investing and
managing the Endowment is to maximize return on
those resources. This is due to the fact that the Uni
versity will seldom have sufficient funds to fully carry
out this educational mission.
However, if the University maximizes return with
out consideration of the social, political, and econo
mic impacts of the investment, it is in conflict with
the spirit of the Founding Grant and the duty of a
responsible investor.
The fiduciary and responsible investor duties of the
trustees do not necessarily conflict, but in the event
that they do, the trustees will use the following guide
lines in making investment decisions, and in incorpora
ting community input into those decisions.
2.1 SELECTION AND RETENTION OF ENDOWMENT
SECURITIES
Tne report as written specifies only substantial social
injury to be cause for trustee action in investment policy and
proxy decisions. For the Board to act only in such grievous
cases is a stilted perception of its shareholder duties. Stanford
must not consider cases only when social injury has been
judged to be "substantial" but must constantly monitor the
impacts of its investments, whether constituting a case of
social injury or not. We have also included a clause that
would allow Stanford to single out companies beforehand
that it will not invest in. This would avoid unnecessary
involvement in socially objectionable corporations.
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary
criterion for the selection of the University's endow
ment securities except in the cases covered by para
graph 2.3. In both cases the investment manager or
advisor shall take into account the social, political, and
economic impact of the company's activities.
The University may instruct its portfolio manager
not to invest in corporations that have been identified
as responsible for social injury.
2.2 EXERCISE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The shareholder right of initiating proxies is not men
tioned in this report. We believe using this right could be
useful to the University, which (as we are led to believe)
sometimes abstains on resolutions for the reason that while
agreeing with the proxy in principle, the Board finds certain
language in the proxy objectionable. Therefore, we wish to
include the following paragraph for consideration:
2.2b) The University may initiate or cosponsor
proxy resolutions when the trustees judge such action
to be useful or necessary to eliminate or reduce social
injury.

2.3 DIVESTMENT
We propose several changes in the divestment paragraph
that was adopted by the Committee. First we feel that
section "i)" should be deleted because if the issue has reach
ed as far as the question of divestment, it has undoubtedly
already been determined that the "desired change in the
company's behavior would have a direct and material effect
in alleviating such injury."
Second, we have deleted the word "maximum" in "ii)"
because we feel maximum goes too far. There will always be
some disagreement over when the University should act.
Third, we have added a phrase that would allow the Univer
sity to divest if it chooses not to exercise its shareholder
rights. This would be relevant in cases where a University
action, i.e., voting against management, would cause adverse
reaction within or outside the University community.
2.3 DIVESTMENT
The University will not continue to exercise its
shareholder rights, but will instead begin a scheduled
divestment of the securities in question if the trustees
determine:
i) that the University has appropriately used its
shareholder rights in seeking to influence a company's
activities in order to eliminate or reduce social injury,
and
ii) that the company, having been given a reason
able opportunity, has refused or failed to begin to
rectify the social injury
OR The Trustees choose not to exercise share
holder rights Ifor example, in order to avoid adverse
reaction on the part of external agencies or groups, or
deep divisions within the University community.)
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI
BILITY
Because we see the CIR as representing the community in
its advice to the Board, we recommend that these words
preface the section on the CIR:
In investing the University's name and resources,
the trustees act on the behalf of the Stanford commu
nity—the most immediate beneficiaries of the Trust.
Therefore, it is only consistent that the trustees should
be well-informed of community sentiment, and in
making investment decisions, exercise a strong presum
ption in its favor.
Also, an important part of the CIR charge was left out
education of the community. To formulate valid opinions on
investment questions, the community must be aware and
well-informed. Therefore, we recommend that the following
paragraph be added.
3.3b) In order that the community be well-inform
ed and able to better judge the issues, the CIR shall
endeavor to educate the community on the role of the
University as an institutional investor. The CIR shall
keep the community informed of current issues of
investment responsibility.
Finally, because the trustees do not have the time to
educate themselves completely on matters of investment res
ponsibility, and because they cannot be expected to judge
community sentiment, they should respect CIR recommenda
tions. We recommend the Board add this paragraph.
The trustees shall exercise a strong presumption in
favor of any majority recommendation filed by the
CIR. Should the CIR be evenly divided as to what its
recommendation should be, the trustees shall consider
such division a recommendation for no action, or in
the case of a proxy, abstention.
David Abernethy
gives his views
Following are comments by Prof. David B. Abernethy:
The Statement our Committee submits to you is, in my
view, preferable in several important respects to the State
ment on Investment Responsibility adopted by the Trustees
in 1971; I urge acceptance of the Committee's proposals even
though, as indicated below, they do not contain some
provisions that I personally believe merit inclusion.
Among the improved features of the new Statement are a
general "tone" that encourages rather than discourages the
thoughtful application of ethical criteria to investment deci
sions; greater attention to the rationale for investment re
sponsibility on the part of an educational institution such as
Stanford; tacit abandonment of the strange notion that a
promanagement vote on a proxy resolution is a nonpolitical,
noncontroversial, and value-neutral act, while a vote against
management is political, controversial, value-laden, and there
fore generally to be avoided; elimination of the "substantial
consensus" criterion, which has been virtually impossible to
define, much less consistently apply in different cases; the
proposed appointment to the Commission on Investment
Responsibility of members of the nonadministrative, nonfac
ulty staff, a large and important group whose exclusion from
the current Commission makes it more difficult for the CIR
to discarn the views of, and in some sense speak for, the
University community as a whole; adoption of procedures for
conveying CIR recommendations (including dissenting opin
ions within the CIR) directly to the Board of Trustees; and
the eminently reasonable request that the CIR be informed
of the reasons for Board decisions when those decisions run
counter to recommendations of the Commission.
Our Committee relied heavily on the concept of "social
injury" as defined and elaborated in John Simon et at, The
Ethical Investor (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972).
We labored under no illusions, however, that the meaning of
"social injury" or "substantial social injury" would be self

evident, or the basis for readily reaching consensus, when a
group of individual actually tried to relate the concept to
particular corporate policies and practices.
The most we could reasonably do, we felt, was to propose
a vague criterion for decision-making whose meaning would
become somewhat less vague as a series of specific CIR
recommendations and Trustee decisions based upon it
evolved. Unfortunately, our committee lacked the time to
give more than passing attention to the related—and highly
complex—concept of causation.
What is meant when we say that Corporation X causes
substantial social injury: that it is the sole contributor to the
injury in question, or one of the major contributors, or one
among a large number of almost equally guilty parties? Must
the cause-and-effect relationship be direct and obvious, or
can it also be indirect and subtle? The Board of Trustees and
the new CIR will need to give serious thought to such
questions, whose abstract character should not beguile any
one into thinking that the way they are answered makes no
significant difference in the so-called "real' world.
As might be expected, the final statement of our commit
tee is in large measure the product of compromise. The group
included individuals with widely differing and strongly held
beliefs; we knew that if we were to come up with anything
lesembling a collective document within the limited period of
time available to us, each person would have to give up
something, ranging from a pet phrase to a favorite proposal.
It is my impression that no member of the committee was
ecstatic about the content and prose of the final statement,
but neither was anyone utterly alienated from the message
the statement conveyed. It is doubtless true that the three
student members lost out on more split votes (when it came
to that) and felt obliged to compromise on more issues than
any other three members of the Committee. But it is also
true, I believe, that student views prevailed at many key
points and were instrumental in effecting the improvements
noted at the beginning of this commentary.
What has emerged does not represent a clear victory for
the students, who had far-reaching aspirations to change the
status quo. However, it should definitely not be considered a
defeat for them, or for the many others whose spring quarter
protests against trustee decisions on South African proxy
issues led directly to the formation of the ad hoc committee.
I wish to record a dissenting voice from the Committee's
report in two respects. First, I favor inclusion of a provi
sion—which the majority voted to delete—enabling the Uni
versity to exercise its shareholder right to initiate proxy
proposals under certain conditions. The provision (as Section
2.2 c), Other Shareholder Rights) might read:
"The University may initiate or cosponsor proxy
resolutions in those rare instances where Stanford has
a special or unique concern with an issue, or where the
language of a resolution proposed by the University is
deemed a more reasonable and effective way of in
ducing appropriate corrective action on the part of a
company causing substantial social injury than the
language of a resolution proposed by others. "
I grant that initiating a proxy resolution may well be
economically and politically costly to a single University. I
fail to see, however, why University officials should dismiss
out of hand the possibility of ever taking such an initiative.
It is conceivable that a campus-based resolution, carefully
phrased so as to attract maximum support from the different
constituencies of the University, and cosponsored with other
major universities and foundations, could be less costly and
divisive than a resolution formulated by off-campus groups
which is strongly supported by some elements on campus yet
which the Trustees feel obliged to reject because of the way
it is worded. The option to exercise what is undoubtedly a
shareholder's right—to initiate proxy resolutions—is one that
institutional investors should not automatically foreclose.
Second, I favor inclusion (under Section 3.3 b)) of a
provision enabling the CIR to sponsor local public meetings
at which the views of informed individuals taking different
positions on proxy issues can be presented.
Although the ClR's principal task is to gather information
and opinions relevant to the recommendations it makes to
the Board of Trustees, I think it can at times also perform a
useful community education function by sponsoring debates
on corporate responsibility issues.
The CIR would have an interest in ensuring that reasoned
dialogue was the order of the day rather than soapbox
oratory; it would be a more appropriate sponsor for debates
than campus groups generally sympathetic with one or
another side of a controversy; and the debates themselves
could provide CIR members with valuable information, both
about the issues at stake and about the extent and nature of
campus interest in these issues.
Many members of the ad hoc Committee asserted that a
community education function was incompatible with ClR's
advisory function to the Trustees, and they feared that a
debate format might prove more inflammatory than en
lightening. I respectfully disagree with their assertion and,
while understanding their fears, believe it possible and—more
importantly—essential for a university to encourage struc
tured debates on controversial social, economic, and political
issues. That such debates might get "out of hand" is no more
valid a reason for inhibiting them than discouraging student
attendance in classes because students might learn the wrong
thing, or perhaps learn nothing at all.
A committee statement with these two additional provi
sions would, in my judgment, be a better statement than the
one we present. But what we do present is quite good. It
merits careful attention and eventual approval by the Board
of Trustees. ,
