# 'Tuna saidia Shule Ya Nairobi'
## A
						fashionable way to help E.P.A. schools 
### Paulette Truman 
Of the many events happen
ing on campus during the Big
Game weekend, one affair
worth attending is a fashion
show co-sponsored by the Sis
ters In Stanford and the
Nairobi Schools.
"Tunasaidia Shule Ya
Nairobi" which in Swahili
means, "We Are Helping
Nairobi Schools," is the theme
of the show to be held at 8 p.m.
Saturday at the Lagunita dining
hall. All proceeds from the
show will go to the Nairobi
Schools in East Palo Alto.
The Nairobi Schools is a pri
vate educational system ex
tending from elementary
through high school and pro
vides an educational alterna
tive to local public schools for
children living in East Palo Al
to's predominately black, low
income community.
Disco and jazz
A unique aspect of the show
is that its models, 15 women
and 10 men, will be dancing in
their outfits. According to
Rodney Johnson, choreog
rapher for the affair, "It's not
only more interesting and en
compassing for the model, but
for the audience as well."
"It adds a lot to the fashion
show if you have the added
dimension of jazz music," said
Johnson. Cuts of music will be
from Grover Washington Jr.'s
"l-eels So Good" album and
from Rose Royce's "In Full
Bloom."
"We planned to gear it
(show) toward affordable fash
ions for students," said Billie
Freeman, a show coordinator.
Karen Ransom, another
show coordinator said, "We
have a lot of shops but the
price of the shops is within the
range of your normal tuition
paying student."
Clothes to be modeled will
consist of school, sports, and
evening wear. A special part of
the show will allow models to
wear outfits they made them
selves.
After the show, refresh

merits will be served. Freeman
said the occasion calls for
semi-formal dress because
"people don't get much of a
chance to get dressed to go
out. It's like going out to the
City to do something extravag
ant but it's only $2."
Why support the Nairobi
schools?

"Anyone who knows any
thing about the educational
system in East Palo Alto knows
it has quite a few flaws,"
Johnson said.
Nairobi Schools began more
than 10 years ago when East
Palo Alto parents became in
creasingly concerned about
the education their children
were receiving in the local pub
lic schools.
Educational alternative
"The kids were graduating
not being able to read and that
disturbed me because one of
those students had been my
son. That disturbed me be
cause I felt he had the ability,"
said Gertrude Wilks, founder
of the school and chairwoman
of the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council.
East Palo Alto students not
attending the Nairobi schools
are currently participating in a
busing program to other
school districts such as San
Carlos, Sequoia, Woodside
and Menlo-Atherton, she said.
"I felt that Ravenswood (East

Palo Alto school district) could
have worked but it was control
led by the Sequoia Board of
Trustees. The community had
no control or say in the prog
ram," Wilks said.
Non-profit
Nairobi is a non-profit, tax
exempt institution which re
ceives no federal or state fund
ing. Twenty five per cent of the
operating budget goes toward
tuition. The rest of the budget
is paid for through fundraisers
such as the fashion show to be
presented by the Sisters In
Stanford.
"It's always easy to get in
volved in foreign problems but
very few people have the cour
age to deal with problems at
home. I think it's very wise of
the Sisters to put on a show to
help the Nairobi students here
at home," Wilkes said.
Tickets will be sold at the
door, the Black Activities
Center and the Black House.
The price is $2 for students and
faculty and $3 for general ad
mission.
