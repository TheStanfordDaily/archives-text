# Olympic medalist offers skiing tips
## 
### John Nelson Associated Press 
The traditional opening at
most ski resorts comes next
week, around Thanksgiving,
and if you haven't gotten your
equipment — skis, poles,
boots, arms, legs, back, joints
— in shape yet, it's still not too
late.
We sat down for lunch re
cently with Olympic medalist
Billy Kidd, who now teaches at
the Steamboat ski area in Col
orado. He shared with us some
tips on getting ready for the
season, both in physical condi
tioning and equipment selec
tion.
Kidd admits he doesn't keep
in shape like he used to, when
he andean-Claude Killy were

trading World Cup victories in
the 19605, but he says the aver
age skier can get himself in
reasonable shape in about a
month, "starting in September
and exercising right through
the season."
Jump rope
He recommends jumping
rope and half knee-bends as a
start.
"Jumping rope is one of the
easiest ways to exercise. Ten
minutes of jump-rope is worth
about a half hour of jogging,
and you don't have to go any
where," he says.
"It exercises the ankles,
knees, thighs, back — the
same muscles that are used in
skiing. And you get indepen
dent foot action and move

ment," he says.
"If you do jog, try weaving in
and out so you get eye-foot
coordination and variations in
the turns and pace," he says.
"That's what you do when
you ski around corners, alter
nating pressure on your feet."
Knee bends
When you do the knee
bends, he says, make sure you
only dip about halfway down.
"Never do full knee bends,"
Kidd says. "They stretch your
ligaments too much. And when
youdothem, rotateyourknees
from side to side to stretch the
ligaments on the side of the
knees."
When you exercise, you
should take into consideration
three things, says Kidd.

You need strength in your
arms, legs, back and stomach
for poling, handling moguls
and just to keep your skis
under control.
"You don't need to be a
superman," says Kidd, "but
you've got to be abie to move."
- Stamina
You have to improve your
wind and stamina. "If you ski in
Vermont or the Rockies," says

Kidd, "you're going to run into
high altitude situations — thin
air and you're really going to
feel it in your lungs. When you
exercise, push yourself a little
bit so you breathe heavier."
And, finally, you're going to
fall down. "You need stretch
ing, flexing exercises for your
shoulders, ankles, knees and
groin. If you're in shape, you
don't need to worry about in
jury."
Once in reasonable shape,
you're ready to select your
equipment. If you're a begin
ner, going for your first lesson,
Kidd reinforces the old axiom
rent first, buy later. "It's less
expensive," he says, "rind
you'll make a more intelligent
choice when you do buy."

Kidd recommends you select
a ski that comes up to your
chin. Don't pay any attention
to the ski bums who call you a
turkey if you're on anything
shorter than the Golden Gate
Bridge.
"Four or five years ago, the
short skis weren't very stable,"
says Kidd, "but new skiing
technology can make 180s or
180 centimeters pretty stable

even at 40 to 50 miles an hour,
which is pretty fast for most
skiers."
Although he sometimes skis
on 2055, Kidd says he uses 180s
most of the time, himself. For
the beginner, however, Kidd
recommends something
around 150 centimeters long.
The skis should be flexible
from tip to tip, and they should
be simply constructed.
If the boot fits
Boots should be soft, flexible
and well fitted. Perhaps the
most excruciating pain a skier
can encounter results from ski
ing all day in boots that don't
fit.
"Wear three or four pairs of
socks," says Kidd. "The boot
should fit snugly around the

ankle, shin and especially the
ball of the toot.
"When you first tick your
foot into the boot, you should
just barely feel your toes touch
ing the end. But when you
buckle the boot up and push
the front of your leg against the
boot, your heel should go back
and your toes should be free.
"As you become a better
skier, you'll use a longer, stiffer
ski and a higher, stiffer boot.
"The President's Council on
Physical Fitness is very in
terested in seeing people ski,"
says Kidd. "If you start skiing
when you're five, you can ski
all your life. It's not like foot
ball or baseball. With skiing,
you can participate your whole
life, with your family."

Ski champ Billy Kidd says jumping rope is
a good pre-ski exercise. 'Ten minutes of
jump-rope is worth about a half hour of
jogging."
