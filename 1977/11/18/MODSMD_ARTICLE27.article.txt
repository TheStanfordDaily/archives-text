# Abused drugs considered for possible medical uses
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — A committee will be set up
at the National Institutes of Health to develop
procedures for evaluating the possible medical
uses of heroin, marijuana and other abused
drugs, it was announced this week.
The decision to set up the NIH Coordinating
committee, which could be in operation within
two weeks, came at a White House meeting
between Carteradministration aides and federal
health officials.
Meanwhile, a government advisory panel was
told Wednesday that government red tape and
restrictions are discouraging researchers from
investigating possible medical uses of
marijuana.
Stripping red tape
The panel put off for at least three months a
decision on whether to loosen the restrictions
to make it easier for scientists and doctors to test
marijuana's effect on patients with glaucoma or
asthma or on patients undergoing
chemotherapy.
At the White House, Dr. Peter Bourne, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's special assistant for health
matters, opened the possibility of using certain
controlled drugs for medical purposes in cor
respondence with the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
Carter endorsed Bourne's suggestion that
drugs like heroin and marijuana be reassessed
for their medical potential in an unbiased way,

without regard to their history of abuse.
Benefit research
Bourne said his decision to ask for the review
was prompted partially by a concern by some
people that drugs that may benefit cancer pa
tients are being held back because of their po
tential for abuse.
Addictive heroin is used in Great Britain and
several other countries to relieve the pain as
sociated with terminal cancer. And tests with
marijuana show it is effective in preventing or
relieving some cases of severe nausea, includ
ing that common to cancer patients undergoing
chemical therapy.

The advisory panel heard from Charles Schus
ter, a member of the Food and Drug Administra
tion's Controlled Substances Advisory Commit
tee, who said he ran into the red tape problem
while conducting experiments with marijuana at
the University of Chicago, where he is a profes
sor of psychiatry and pharmacology.
He said it takes at least a year to get experi
ments approved, adding, "The current
categorization of marijuana does frighten and
impede a number of researchers."
Marijuana currently is treated like heroin and
LSD under the federal drug abuse law. As such,
no medical uses are recognized for marijuana
and doctors can obtain it for experiments only
under tight government supervision.
