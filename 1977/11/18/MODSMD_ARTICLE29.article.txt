# Wilks speaks on the black family
## 
### 
"There is un unspoken spirit
in the black family," according
to Gertrude Wilks, Mayor of
East Palo Alto. "It is a spirit of
caring, of doing a job well, and
of taking action."
Wilks delivered a speech in
the Ujamaa lounge recenlty
dealing with the black family as
the driving force in the survival
of black people.
"Without our family struc
ture we'd all be crazy. There is
great strength in the family;
don't underestimate it."
"Black people are not mira
cle workers, although it may
seem that way sometimes."
Milks emphasized that black
people must be strong in order
to survive the oppression bes
towed upon them.
"The image of the black
woman is that of matriarch.
She is perceived as a strong wil
led, domineering, bitchy
female. But she's really just like
everybody else. She's sensi
tive, she gets tired, and she
needs help and support from
others."
One reason the black
woman is perceived as such a
strong figure is because of the
large number of one-parent
families in black communities.
There are over 1200 families
in East Palo Alto headed by a
single parent, according to
Wilks. To help these women,
Wilks originated day care cen
ters in East Palo Alto. These
centers are open extended
hours, from 7 a.m. until 1 a.m.,

and are organized by one pa
rent families. "We hope to ex
pand this program to include
older children as well," said
Wilks.
Another neglected group
Wilks hopes to help is the
senior citizens.
"We have plans for a senior
citizen home in East Palo Alto,"
she claimed. It is important for
these people to be a part of the
black community. They have a
lot to contribute to youngsters
in the form of historical anec
dotes, and they enjoy being
members of the black com
munity.
"Integration is terribly de
structive to blacks," according
to Wilks. Only blacks are bus
sed. They are dispersed
throughout the Bay Area, and
to get to school on time they
must get up at 5 or 6 a.m.
To rememdy the situation, a
tutorial program, Mothers for
Equal Education, has been
operating in East Palo Alto
since 1966.
With aggressiveness in the
black community, the major
need is money, she said. "We
need money to build the com
munity," said Wilks.
"Black folks can do for each
other. I urge you black stu
dents to go back to your com
munities and do something;
inconvenience yourselves for
others. There is nothing grea
ter than outreaching to one
another."

led, domineering, bitchy
female. But she's really just like
everybody else. She's sensi
tive, she gets tired, and she
needs help and support from
others."
One reason the black
woman is perceived as such a
strong figure is because of the
large number of one-parent
families in black communities.
There are over 1200 families
in East Palo Alto headed by a
single parent, according to
Wilks. To help these women,
Wilks originated day care cen
ters in East Palo Alto. These
centers are open extended
hours, from 7 a.m. until 1 a.m.,

and are organized by one pa
rent families. "We hope to ex
pand this program to include
older children as well," said
Wilks.
Another neglected group
Wilks hopes to help is the
senior citizens.
"We have plans for a senior
citizen home in East Palo Alto,"
she claimed. It is important for
these people to be a part of the
black community. They have a
lot to contribute to youngsters
in the form of historical anec
dotes, and they enjoy being
members of the black com
munity.
"Integration is terribly de
structive to blacks," according
to Wilks. Only blacks are bus
sed. They are dispersed
throughout the Bay Area, and
to get to school on time they
must get up at 5 or 6 a.m.
To rememdy the situation, a
tutorial program, Mothers for
Equal Education, has been
operating in East Palo Alto
since 1966.
With aggressiveness in the
black community, the major
need is money, she said. "We
need money to build the com
munity," said Wilks.
"Black folks can do for each
other. I urge you black stu
dents to go back to your com
munities and do something;
inconvenience yourselves for
others. There is nothing grea
ter than outreaching to one
another."

"There is un unspoken spirit
in the black family," according
to Gertrude Wilks, Mayor of
East Palo Alto. "It is a spirit of
caring, of doing a job well, and
of taking action."
Wilks delivered a speech in
the Ujamaa lounge recenlty
dealing with the black family as
the driving force in the survival
of black people.
"Without our family struc
ture we'd all be crazy. There is
great strength in the family;
don't underestimate it."
"Black people are not mira
cle workers, although it may
seem that way sometimes."
Milks emphasized that black
people must be strong in order
to survive the oppression bes
towed upon them.
"The image of the black
woman is that of matriarch.
She is perceived as a strong wil
led, domineering, bitchy
female. But she's really just like
everybody else. She's sensi
tive, she gets tired, and she
needs help and support from
others."
