San Francisco (AP) â€” The University of California, which raised
student fees $48 this year, is thinking of trying to lower them $51
next year.
This year's fee isn't the same as last year's, but that wouldn't
matter to UC students who now pay lat least $648 a year in fees to a
university that is nominally tuition-free.
The UC regents consider the proposed reduction at a commit
tee meeting today and a full board session Friday.
But the final decision is up to the Legislature and Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr., who would be asked to approve about $6.6 million
more state aid to make up for the fees.
UC President David Saxon and the Student Lobby are both
recommending the $51 reduction in the education fee, which is
$300 a year for undergraduates and $360 for graduate students.
The university also has a registration fee, which pays for health
centers, counseling and other campus services. This year it was
raised to $348 at all campuses and higher at four of the nine.
The education fee pays for the Educational Opportunity Prog
ram of scholarships for minorities and other disadvantaged stu
dents.
