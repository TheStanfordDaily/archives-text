# 1977 Stanford-Cal clash truly a 'Big' Game
## Bears, Cardinals duel for Axe before 87,000 
### Bill Burger 
Not many events can draw
87,000 people to Stanford
Stadium on a Saturday after
noon, rain or shine. A Beatles
comeback concert, possibly.
Maybe even a Super Bowl con
test or the Olympics. Maybe.
But rain or shine, tomor
row's Big Came will be seen by
a standing-room-only crowd of
very partisan Stanford and
California fans.
It is more than a football
game. "It's a great, epic
game," said Card mentor Bill
Walsh. "It always has been and
always will be."
It is, without a doubt, THE
FOOTBALL CAME of the year
for Stanford and Cal players,
coaches, alumni, fans and
bands alike. Even if both teams
were 2-8 on the season, the
game would be meaningful to
enough people to fill any
stadium in the country.
That's a rivalry.
"It seems as though every
year," Cal head coach Mike
White said, "both teams' sea
sons hinge on the outcome,
maybe more for pride than
anything.
"Last year it was a winning
season at stake. This year,
however, it is for a better over
all record and a hope that
something else might come
along. Whatever, it certainly is
the most important game of
our season," White added.
Bowl bids
That "something else"
White is referring to is the pos
sible bowl bid that might be in
store for the winner of the Big
Game. Nothing is assured, but
both the Fiesta and Sun bowls
have mentioned an interest in
the winner.
So this November's Big
Came is just a little bigger than
most since the Cards and the
Golden Bears, both 7-3 this
year, are playing for more than
pride.
Kickoff for the 80th Big Game
is at 1 p.m. tomorrow. Be pre
pared for a lot of kickoffs. Both
teams are offense-minded.
The Cards currently rank
second in the Pac-8 in team of
fense, but average only 29
yards per game more than the
third-ranked Bears.
Surprisingly, Cal is first in
Pac-8 passing, averaging 265.1
yards per game in the air. Stan
ford, on the arm of the nation's
leading passer, ranks second,
only .6 yards a game behind
Cal.

Guy Benjamin, the leading
All-America candidate at quar
terback, needs 17 completions
to break the Pac-8 season re
cord of 208 set by WSU's Jack
Thompson last year. Benjamin
also has an excellent chance to
end his career as the most ac
curate passer in Pac-8 history.
He has completed 60.4 per cent
of his passes; the existing re
cord is 59.0, set by USC's Troy
Winslow in 1964-66.
Gary Graumann will start at
quarterback for Cal tomorrow.
The Bears have had some trou
ble deciding who should throw
the ball but as their statistics
indicate either Graumann or
Charlie Young, both juniors,
can throw against any team
around — a decision most
teams wouldn't mind having.
The Pac-B's top five receivers
will be in tomorrow's game.
Stanford's James Lofton, pos
sibly the nation's premier re
ceiver, has 48 receptions to
lead the conference.
Darrin Nelson, the Cards'
freshman sensation, is second
with 46 catches, while Cal's
Jesse Thompson is third with
45. Stanford's Bill Kellar and
Cal's George Freitas are tied for
fourth place in the conference
with 44 receptions.
Nelson is also the confer
ence's second-leading rusher
with 975 yards and a 6.1 yards
per carry average. If he main
tains his current second-place
ranking in rushing and receiv
ing, he would become the first
Pac-8 player to ever finish that
high in both categories.
1000 yard season
Nelson needs only 25 yards
to become the sixth freshman
in NCAA history to rush for
1000 yards in a season.
The Cards' running game has
been strengthened in recent
weeks by the strong showing
of fullbacks John Finley and
Phil Francis. The two backs
have combined for 767 yards
this year, often coming in
third-down and short-yardage
situations, where the yards
come tough.
Cal fullback Paul Jones
missed last week's game
against Oregon and is doubtful
for tomorrow's.game. Johnny
Williams and Mark Houghton
filled in for Jones against Ore
gon and gained 160 yards and
scored three touchdowns bet
ween them.
But it is Cal's defense that
keeps them in every game. "I
think their defense is one of
the best in the western part of

the country," said Walsh.
"They've had games when they
shut down their opponent,
which we've been unable to
do."
Stanford's defense, on the
other hand, has been shred
ded several times this season.
The Cards have had 262 points
scored against them. Even with
a 7-3 record, Stanford has been
outscored 22-points worth by
opponents this season.
Cal is second in team de
fense in the Pac-8, giving up
only 295.5 yards per game
compared to Stanford's
seventh-ranked 409.7 yards per
game.
Secondaries
The Bear's defensive secon
dary has held opponents to
118.7 yards per game in the air
and a league low completion
percentage of .433. Stanford's
secondary has been hit for a
.628 completion percentage by
opponents.
The importance of the kick
ing game in tomorrow's con
test cannot be overstated.
Thirty-seven of the past 79 Big
Games have been decided by
seven points or less. To date,
Cal has scored 1048 points to
Stanford's 1032.
The teams' punting games
are virtually equal. Stanford's
Brad Fox is averaging4l.6yards
per kick while Cal's Dan Mel
ville has a 41.7 average.
Card place-kicker Ken Naber
has made an immediate con
tribution to the team in his first
year on the Farm. Connecting
on 21 of 23 extra-point attempts
and 12 of 19 field goal tries,
Naber ranks 13th nationally in
placekicking.
Cal's Jim Breech is playing in
his final Big Game and needs
three field goals tomorrow to
break the NCAA career record
of 51 held by Air Force's Dave
Lawson.
Breech has converted 34 of
34 PATs this year and an amaz
ing 110 of 115 in four years. In
side the 40-yard line, Breech
has hit on 30 of 34 field goal
attempts.
But all the statistics, figures
and records of the 1977 Stan
ford and Cal teams don't really
mean too much. It is a game of
pride, tradition and respect.
As White said, "Heck, when
you come down to it, this game
is always the most important
game. This is the Big Game.
Statistics won't mean a thing
on Saturday, believe me."

Not many events can draw
87,000 people to Stanford
Stadium on a Saturday after
noon, rain or shine. A Beatles
comeback concert, possibly.
Maybe even a Super Bowl con
test or the Olympics. Maybe.
But rain or shine, tomor
row's Big Came will be seen by
a standing-room-only crowd of
very partisan Stanford and
California fans.
It is more than a football
game. "It's a great, epic
game," said Card mentor Bill
Walsh. "It always has been and
always will be."
It is, without a doubt, THE
FOOTBALL CAME of the year
for Stanford and Cal players,
coaches, alumni, fans and
bands alike. Even if both teams
were 2-8 on the season, the
game would be meaningful to
enough people to fill any
stadium in the country.
That's a rivalry.
"It seems as though every
year," Cal head coach Mike
White said, "both teams' sea
sons hinge on the outcome,
maybe more for pride than
anything.
"Last year it was a winning
season at stake. This year,
however, it is for a better over
all record and a hope that
something else might come
along. Whatever, it certainly is
the most important game of
our season," White added.
Bowl bids
That "something else"
White is referring to is the pos
sible bowl bid that might be in
store for the winner of the Big
Game. Nothing is assured, but
both the Fiesta and Sun bowls
have mentioned an interest in
the winner.
So this November's Big
Came is just a little bigger than
most since the Cards and the
Golden Bears, both 7-3 this
year, are playing for more than
pride.
Kickoff for the 80th Big Game
is at 1 p.m. tomorrow. Be pre
pared for a lot of kickoffs. Both
teams are offense-minded.
The Cards currently rank
second in the Pac-8 in team of
fense, but average only 29
yards per game more than the
third-ranked Bears.
Surprisingly, Cal is first in
Pac-8 passing, averaging 265.1
yards per game in the air. Stan
ford, on the arm of the nation's
leading passer, ranks second,
only .6 yards a game behind
Cal.

Guy Benjamin, the leading
All-America candidate at quar
terback, needs 17 completions
to break the Pac-8 season re
cord of 208 set by WSU's Jack
Thompson last year. Benjamin
also has an excellent chance to
end his career as the most ac
curate passer in Pac-8 history.
He has completed 60.4 per cent
of his passes; the existing re
cord is 59.0, set by USC's Troy
Winslow in 1964-66.
Gary Graumann will start at
quarterback for Cal tomorrow.
The Bears have had some trou
ble deciding who should throw
the ball but as their statistics
indicate either Graumann or
Charlie Young, both juniors,
can throw against any team
around — a decision most
teams wouldn't mind having.
The Pac-B's top five receivers
will be in tomorrow's game.
Stanford's James Lofton, pos
sibly the nation's premier re
ceiver, has 48 receptions to
lead the conference.
Darrin Nelson, the Cards'
freshman sensation, is second
with 46 catches, while Cal's
Jesse Thompson is third with
45. Stanford's Bill Kellar and
Cal's George Freitas are tied for
fourth place in the conference
with 44 receptions.
Nelson is also the confer
ence's second-leading rusher
with 975 yards and a 6.1 yards
per carry average. If he main
tains his current second-place
ranking in rushing and receiv
ing, he would become the first
Pac-8 player to ever finish that
high in both categories.
1000 yard season
Nelson needs only 25 yards
to become the sixth freshman
in NCAA history to rush for
1000 yards in a season.
The Cards' running game has
been strengthened in recent
weeks by the strong showing
of fullbacks John Finley and
Phil Francis. The two backs
have combined for 767 yards
this year, often coming in
third-down and short-yardage
situations, where the yards
come tough.
Cal fullback Paul Jones
missed last week's game
against Oregon and is doubtful
for tomorrow's.game. Johnny
Williams and Mark Houghton
filled in for Jones against Ore
gon and gained 160 yards and
scored three touchdowns bet
ween them.
But it is Cal's defense that
keeps them in every game. "I
think their defense is one of
the best in the western part of

the country," said Walsh.
"They've had games when they
shut down their opponent,
which we've been unable to
do."
Stanford's defense, on the
other hand, has been shred
ded several times this season.
The Cards have had 262 points
scored against them. Even with
a 7-3 record, Stanford has been
outscored 22-points worth by
opponents this season.
Cal is second in team de
fense in the Pac-8, giving up
only 295.5 yards per game
compared to Stanford's
seventh-ranked 409.7 yards per
game.
Secondaries
The Bear's defensive secon
dary has held opponents to
118.7 yards per game in the air
and a league low completion
percentage of .433. Stanford's
secondary has been hit for a
.628 completion percentage by
opponents.
The importance of the kick
ing game in tomorrow's con
test cannot be overstated.
Thirty-seven of the past 79 Big
Games have been decided by
seven points or less. To date,
Cal has scored 1048 points to
Stanford's 1032.
The teams' punting games
are virtually equal. Stanford's
Brad Fox is averaging4l.6yards
per kick while Cal's Dan Mel
ville has a 41.7 average.
Card place-kicker Ken Naber
has made an immediate con
tribution to the team in his first
year on the Farm. Connecting
on 21 of 23 extra-point attempts
and 12 of 19 field goal tries,
Naber ranks 13th nationally in
placekicking.
Cal's Jim Breech is playing in
his final Big Game and needs
three field goals tomorrow to
break the NCAA career record
of 51 held by Air Force's Dave
Lawson.
Breech has converted 34 of
34 PATs this year and an amaz
ing 110 of 115 in four years. In
side the 40-yard line, Breech
has hit on 30 of 34 field goal
attempts.
But all the statistics, figures
and records of the 1977 Stan
ford and Cal teams don't really
mean too much. It is a game of
pride, tradition and respect.
As White said, "Heck, when
you come down to it, this game
is always the most important
game. This is the Big Game.
Statistics won't mean a thing
on Saturday, believe me."

Stadium on a Saturday after
noon, rain or shine. A Beatles
comeback concert, possibly.
Maybe even a Super Bowl con
test or the Olympics. Maybe.
But rain or shine, tomor
row's Big Came will be seen by
a standing-room-only crowd of
very partisan Stanford and
California fans.
It is more than a football
game. "It's a great, epic
game," said Card mentor Bill
Walsh. "It always has been and
always will be."
It is, without a doubt, THE
FOOTBALL CAME of the year
for Stanford and Cal players,
coaches, alumni, fans and
bands alike. Even if both teams
were 2-8 on the season, the
game would be meaningful to
enough people to fill any
stadium in the country.
That's a rivalry.
"It seems as though every
year," Cal head coach Mike
White said, "both teams' sea
sons hinge on the outcome,
maybe more for pride than
anything.
"Last year it was a winning
season at stake. This year,
however, it is for a better over
all record and a hope that
something else might come
along. Whatever, it certainly is
the most important game of
our season," White added.
Bowl bids
That "something else"
White is referring to is the pos
sible bowl bid that might be in
store for the winner of the Big
Game. Nothing is assured, but
both the Fiesta and Sun bowls
have mentioned an interest in
the winner.
So this November's Big
Came is just a little bigger than
most since the Cards and the
Golden Bears, both 7-3 this
year, are playing for more than
pride.
Kickoff for the 80th Big Game
is at 1 p.m. tomorrow. Be pre
pared for a lot of kickoffs. Both
teams are offense-minded.
The Cards currently rank
second in the Pac-8 in team of
fense, but average only 29
yards per game more than the
third-ranked Bears.
Surprisingly, Cal is first in
Pac-8 passing, averaging 265.1
yards per game in the air. Stan
ford, on the arm of the nation's
leading passer, ranks second,
only .6 yards a game behind
Cal.

Guy Benjamin, the leading
All-America candidate at quar
terback, needs 17 completions
to break the Pac-8 season re
cord of 208 set by WSU's Jack
Thompson last year. Benjamin
also has an excellent chance to
end his career as the most ac
curate passer in Pac-8 history.
He has completed 60.4 per cent
of his passes; the existing re
cord is 59.0, set by USC's Troy
Winslow in 1964-66.
Gary Graumann will start at
quarterback for Cal tomorrow.
The Bears have had some trou
ble deciding who should throw
the ball but as their statistics
indicate either Graumann or
Charlie Young, both juniors,
can throw against any team
around — a decision most
teams wouldn't mind having.
The Pac-B's top five receivers
will be in tomorrow's game.
Stanford's James Lofton, pos
sibly the nation's premier re
ceiver, has 48 receptions to
lead the conference.
Darrin Nelson, the Cards'
freshman sensation, is second
with 46 catches, while Cal's
Jesse Thompson is third with
45. Stanford's Bill Kellar and
Cal's George Freitas are tied for
fourth place in the conference
with 44 receptions.
Nelson is also the confer
ence's second-leading rusher
with 975 yards and a 6.1 yards
per carry average. If he main
tains his current second-place
ranking in rushing and receiv
ing, he would become the first
Pac-8 player to ever finish that
high in both categories.
1000 yard season
Nelson needs only 25 yards
to become the sixth freshman
in NCAA history to rush for
1000 yards in a season.
The Cards' running game has
been strengthened in recent
weeks by the strong showing
of fullbacks John Finley and
Phil Francis. The two backs
have combined for 767 yards
this year, often coming in
third-down and short-yardage
situations, where the yards
come tough.
Cal fullback Paul Jones
missed last week's game
against Oregon and is doubtful
for tomorrow's.game. Johnny
Williams and Mark Houghton
filled in for Jones against Ore
gon and gained 160 yards and
scored three touchdowns bet
ween them.
But it is Cal's defense that
keeps them in every game. "I
think their defense is one of
the best in the western part of

the country," said Walsh.
"They've had games when they
shut down their opponent,
which we've been unable to
do."
Stanford's defense, on the
other hand, has been shred
ded several times this season.
The Cards have had 262 points
scored against them. Even with
a 7-3 record, Stanford has been
outscored 22-points worth by
opponents this season.
Cal is second in team de
fense in the Pac-8, giving up
only 295.5 yards per game
compared to Stanford's
seventh-ranked 409.7 yards per
game.
Secondaries
The Bear's defensive secon
dary has held opponents to
118.7 yards per game in the air
and a league low completion
percentage of .433. Stanford's
secondary has been hit for a
.628 completion percentage by
opponents.
The importance of the kick
ing game in tomorrow's con
test cannot be overstated.
Thirty-seven of the past 79 Big
Games have been decided by
seven points or less. To date,
Cal has scored 1048 points to
Stanford's 1032.
The teams' punting games
are virtually equal. Stanford's
Brad Fox is averaging4l.6yards
per kick while Cal's Dan Mel
ville has a 41.7 average.
Card place-kicker Ken Naber
has made an immediate con
tribution to the team in his first
year on the Farm. Connecting
on 21 of 23 extra-point attempts
and 12 of 19 field goal tries,
Naber ranks 13th nationally in
placekicking.
Cal's Jim Breech is playing in
his final Big Game and needs
three field goals tomorrow to
break the NCAA career record
of 51 held by Air Force's Dave
Lawson.
Breech has converted 34 of
34 PATs this year and an amaz
ing 110 of 115 in four years. In
side the 40-yard line, Breech
has hit on 30 of 34 field goal
attempts.
But all the statistics, figures
and records of the 1977 Stan
ford and Cal teams don't really
mean too much. It is a game of
pride, tradition and respect.
As White said, "Heck, when
you come down to it, this game
is always the most important
game. This is the Big Game.
Statistics won't mean a thing
on Saturday, believe me."

Maybe even a Super Bowl con
test or the Olympics. Maybe.
But rain or shine, tomor
row's Big Came will be seen by
a standing-room-only crowd of
very partisan Stanford and
California fans.
It is more than a football
game. "It's a great, epic
game," said Card mentor Bill
Walsh. "It always has been and
always will be."
It is, without a doubt, THE
FOOTBALL CAME of the year
for Stanford and Cal players,
coaches, alumni, fans and
bands alike. Even if both teams
were 2-8 on the season, the
game would be meaningful to
enough people to fill any
stadium in the country.
That's a rivalry.
"It seems as though every
year," Cal head coach Mike
White said, "both teams' sea
sons hinge on the outcome,
maybe more for pride than
anything.
"Last year it was a winning
season at stake. This year,
however, it is for a better over
all record and a hope that
something else might come
along. Whatever, it certainly is
the most important game of
our season," White added.
Bowl bids
That "something else"
White is referring to is the pos
sible bowl bid that might be in
store for the winner of the Big
Game. Nothing is assured, but
both the Fiesta and Sun bowls
have mentioned an interest in
the winner.
So this November's Big
Came is just a little bigger than
most since the Cards and the
Golden Bears, both 7-3 this
year, are playing for more than
pride.
Kickoff for the 80th Big Game
is at 1 p.m. tomorrow. Be pre
pared for a lot of kickoffs. Both
teams are offense-minded.
The Cards currently rank
second in the Pac-8 in team of
fense, but average only 29
yards per game more than the
third-ranked Bears.
Surprisingly, Cal is first in
Pac-8 passing, averaging 265.1
yards per game in the air. Stan
ford, on the arm of the nation's
leading passer, ranks second,
only .6 yards a game behind
Cal.

Guy Benjamin, the leading
All-America candidate at quar
terback, needs 17 completions
to break the Pac-8 season re
cord of 208 set by WSU's Jack
Thompson last year. Benjamin
also has an excellent chance to
end his career as the most ac
curate passer in Pac-8 history.
He has completed 60.4 per cent
of his passes; the existing re
cord is 59.0, set by USC's Troy
Winslow in 1964-66.
Gary Graumann will start at
quarterback for Cal tomorrow.
The Bears have had some trou
ble deciding who should throw
the ball but as their statistics
indicate either Graumann or
Charlie Young, both juniors,
can throw against any team
around — a decision most
teams wouldn't mind having.
The Pac-B's top five receivers
will be in tomorrow's game.
Stanford's James Lofton, pos
sibly the nation's premier re
ceiver, has 48 receptions to
lead the conference.
Darrin Nelson, the Cards'
freshman sensation, is second
with 46 catches, while Cal's
Jesse Thompson is third with
45. Stanford's Bill Kellar and
Cal's George Freitas are tied for
fourth place in the conference
with 44 receptions.
Nelson is also the confer
ence's second-leading rusher
with 975 yards and a 6.1 yards
per carry average. If he main
tains his current second-place
ranking in rushing and receiv
ing, he would become the first
Pac-8 player to ever finish that
high in both categories.
1000 yard season
Nelson needs only 25 yards
to become the sixth freshman
in NCAA history to rush for
1000 yards in a season.
The Cards' running game has
been strengthened in recent
weeks by the strong showing
of fullbacks John Finley and
Phil Francis. The two backs
have combined for 767 yards
this year, often coming in
third-down and short-yardage
situations, where the yards
come tough.
Cal fullback Paul Jones
missed last week's game
against Oregon and is doubtful
for tomorrow's.game. Johnny
Williams and Mark Houghton
filled in for Jones against Ore
gon and gained 160 yards and
scored three touchdowns bet
ween them.
But it is Cal's defense that
keeps them in every game. "I
think their defense is one of
the best in the western part of

the country," said Walsh.
"They've had games when they
shut down their opponent,
which we've been unable to
do."
Stanford's defense, on the
other hand, has been shred
ded several times this season.
The Cards have had 262 points
scored against them. Even with
a 7-3 record, Stanford has been
outscored 22-points worth by
opponents this season.
Cal is second in team de
fense in the Pac-8, giving up
only 295.5 yards per game
compared to Stanford's
seventh-ranked 409.7 yards per
game.
Secondaries
The Bear's defensive secon
dary has held opponents to
118.7 yards per game in the air
and a league low completion
percentage of .433. Stanford's
secondary has been hit for a
.628 completion percentage by
opponents.
The importance of the kick
ing game in tomorrow's con
test cannot be overstated.
Thirty-seven of the past 79 Big
Games have been decided by
seven points or less. To date,
Cal has scored 1048 points to
Stanford's 1032.
The teams' punting games
are virtually equal. Stanford's
Brad Fox is averaging4l.6yards
per kick while Cal's Dan Mel
ville has a 41.7 average.
Card place-kicker Ken Naber
has made an immediate con
tribution to the team in his first
year on the Farm. Connecting
on 21 of 23 extra-point attempts
and 12 of 19 field goal tries,
Naber ranks 13th nationally in
placekicking.
Cal's Jim Breech is playing in
his final Big Game and needs
three field goals tomorrow to
break the NCAA career record
of 51 held by Air Force's Dave
Lawson.
Breech has converted 34 of
34 PATs this year and an amaz
ing 110 of 115 in four years. In
side the 40-yard line, Breech
has hit on 30 of 34 field goal
attempts.
But all the statistics, figures
and records of the 1977 Stan
ford and Cal teams don't really
mean too much. It is a game of
pride, tradition and respect.
As White said, "Heck, when
you come down to it, this game
is always the most important
game. This is the Big Game.
Statistics won't mean a thing
on Saturday, believe me."
Believe him.

Stadium on a Saturday after
