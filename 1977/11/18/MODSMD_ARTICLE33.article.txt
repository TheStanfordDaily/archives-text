# Lymans foresee Big Game weenie roast
## 
### 
Sparing no effort for our Big Came
weekend forecasts, the Daily sports
staff conned the University's Main Man
and Stanford's First Lady to stare into
their crystal ball and tell us what they
see for the last four Pacific-8 football
confrontations.
Well, danged if the President and
Mrs. Lyman have not only one but two
crystal balls â€” and one of them has
short-circuited.
)ing Lyman, working independently
of husband Dick, foresees the Pac-8
race winding up with the Cardinals in
the Rose Bowl:
"Washington State 27, Washington
21. The Cougars are out for Dog's blood
even if they are a little uptight and miss
the first PAT.
"Oregon 35, Oregon State 31. They
are both pretty wet but Ducks are on
top of the water.
"USC 11, UCLA 10. Seven fumbles
and six interceptions notwithstanding,
a lucky two-point conversion will do it.
"Stanford 49, California 0. Because I
am a perennial optimist, as everyone
knows, and anyway trees clearly over
shadow Bears, and Griffins both out
smart and overfly them. Rose Bowl,
here we come!"
President Lyman, says "au contraire"

and the "Oracle of the Quad" predicts:
"Stanford 28, California 26. Having
won the Championship of Santa Clara
County last week, Stanford will find the
temptation to be Bay Area Champions
too strong to resist. We'll score two
field goals, three touchdowns, two
extra points kicked and one two-point
conversion; Cal will duplicate all of this
except the two-pointer, which will be
spoiled by Gordy Ceresino dumping
the Cal quarterback in the closing half
second of play. In other words, just an
ordinary, run-of-the-mill Big Came.
"UCLA 17, USC 14. This medium
sized Game is always hard to predict.
Bruins will eat turkey on the 24th and
Trojans the following night. Indigestion
is then overwhelmingly likely; hence
the two last-quarter Trojan
touchdowns.
"Oregon State 6, Oregon 0. It will
rain in Oregon. This will make Ducks
overconfident, and Beavers should
have no trouble damming up the mild
Duck offense.
"Washington 47, WSU 38. It will be
sunny in Washington, and both de
fenses will spend the entire afternoon
two steps behind the action. Huskies by
a score only a computer could love."
