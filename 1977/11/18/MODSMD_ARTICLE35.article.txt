# Poloists in battle for No. 1
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
"This is what it's all about,"
said Stanford water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti. "This" is
tomorrow's 11 a.m. game
against California at deGuerre
pool.
"It" is left to the reader's in
terpretation.
The winner of tomorrow's
game will have won two of
three contests between the
teams and, more importantly,
will fly to Providence, R.I. next
week as the No. 1 seed for the
NCAA championships.
In previous meetings bet
ween the two teams, the Cards
defeated Cal, 9-7, on Oct. 1 in
the Nor-Cal Invitational Tour
nament held at Stanford. Two
weeks later in Berkeley the
Bears beat Stanford, 7-4, in
their first Pac-8 matchup.
That day, Stanford made
only four of 30 shots as the
combination of Cal's pressure
defense and the smaller size of
the Bears' pool completely
shut off the Cards' fast-break
counter attack.
"The stadium was packed at

Cal," recalled junior Tom
Angelo. "I'm sure that had an
influence on both the referees
and the team.
"Saturday's game should be
a fast one," he added. "Both
teams counter well. We're
playing well in practice this
week. I think it's going to be a
fun game."
"It should be a fun game to
watch and play," agreed De
ttamanti. "It will be a great
game between two evenly
matched teams. It should be an
intense game also. Both teams
will be more psyched for this
game than any other game so
far this year."
Freshman goalie John Gan
sel said, "I think we can beat
them. Man for man, we're a
better team."
"We're going to have to
shoot better this time," said
Dettamanti. "We forced our
shots last time. We have to be
more patient.
"We have to overcome their
pressure defense," he con
tinued, "particularly on
extra-man situations."

"They have a good pressing
defense," said junior Doug
Burke. "We'll have to be more
aware during the game."
At Berkeley, when the two
teams last played, fouling and
rough play got out of hand,
Stanford players said. Junior
Dave Egan, who shares the
hole man duties with senior
Rick Johannsen, said he hopes
the game will be kept under
control by the referees.
"It should be a tough game,"
Egan added. "Carlos Stephens
(of Cal) is a good hole guard.
He's hard to set against."
Egan said he hopes to play a
strong defensive game and
make good passes from the
hole.
Dettamanti concluded by
saying that, considering the
even matchup, the team that is
shooting better is likely to win.
"We're playing the best
water polo we've played all
year," he said. "I don't think
the pressure will affect us.
We've had a lot of pressured,
must-win games this year. We
play best under pressure."
