# Spikers in weekend crucials
##

Tonight at 8 p.m. Maples
Pavilion will be the site of the
Stanford women's volleyball
team's "Big Came" with
California. Tonight's match,
along with the match at San
Jose State Saturday night, will
be the deciding factor in who
goes to the Regionals this year.
Stanford, which has only one
conference loss, must beat
both Cal and San Jose, who are
tied for second place with two
losses apiece, to gain an un
disputed spot in the Regionals.
"I look for us to have a very
tough match Friday night,"
said Stanford coach Art Lam
bert. "Cal's a good team . . .
with good talent, and well
coached," he said. "They've
got a couple of tall gals who are
good hitters. We'll just have to
stop a couple of things they do
well," Lambert said.
In the matchup with Cal at
Berkeley earlier this season,
the Cards won in four games,
12-15, 15-9, 15-12 and 15-6.
Those games weren't easy, but
down 1-0 after the first game of
the match, the women came
back and won the next three
consecutive games.
"We haven't seen them (Cal)
for the past five weeks,
though," said Lambert. "They
may run a different offense

now," he added.
Lambert said that he's been
"led to believe" that the Cards
are ready for this match and the
team seems to agree. Team
captain Liz Hughes said the
team was disappointed and a
bit "shook up" about the loss
to UOP last weekend and
added that they were going to
have to take these two matches
to go to the regionals for sure.
But, she said, "It's not like Art's
been getting down on us or
anything; we're personally
motivated."
Freshman team member
Chris Anderson is more than
optimistic about the game.
"I'm really psyched," she said.
"I think we can win." But Chris
also spelled out the same sort
of feeling that coach Lambert
has talked about all season. "If
we do lose," she said, "it'll be
because we beat ourselves.
None of the other teams are
really more skilled than we
are," she said.
If the Cards don't win to
night, they will be in at least a
two-way tie, if not a three-way
tie, and with playoffs starting
Tuesday.
"We really don't want that to
happen," Hughes said. "I think
they'd like to win outright," ag
reed Lambert.

UCLA Invitational. The Cards lost in the quarterfinals of the tourna
ment to Pepperdine. Stanford faces California today at 8 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion and San Jose State tomorrow at 8 p.m. in San Jose.
The spikers' need two victories this weekend to insure them a place in
regional action.
