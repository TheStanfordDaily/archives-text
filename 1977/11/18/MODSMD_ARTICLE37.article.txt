# California's aggressive defense
## Are they really the dirty Golden Bears? 
### Paul Spath 
Tomorrow, Stanford and
California meet at Stanford
Stadium in the Big Came. Usu
ally a hard, well-fought battle
between the two rivals, the
game always promises an equal
amount of excitement, en
thusiasm and aggression from
both teams.
This year, however, accord
ing to some football circles, the
aggression aspect of the game
may be tilted in Cal's favor.
The rumor going around the
Pac-8 is that this year's Golden
Bears are the most overaggres
sive football team in the con
ference, and that they do not
hesitate to sidestep legality in
order to badger and intimidate
their opponents.
The basis for these rumors is
not quite certain, but there can
be little doubt that three weeks
ago, after a game between the
Bears and the USC Trojans, the
rumors gathered enough rec
ognition to become a wide
spread belief and to convince
many people of their absolute
truth, including USC coach
)ohn Robinson.
In referring to the fight that
occurred on the USC sidelines
between three Cal defenders
and the USC football team,
after the Cal players had run
USC's Charles White out of
bounds, Robinson said
"Somebody punched Charles
in the face on that pileup. No,
I'm notgoingto saywhoitwas;
I don't want to get into that."

Of course, as to every story
there is more than one side,
and Ralph Deloach, the Cal de
fender who had helped run
White out of bounds, saw the
fighting this way: "It was all a
misunderstanding. Anthony
Washington and I tackled
Charles White on the sideline
and I guess we didn't get off as
fast as White wanted."
Since the Trojan players say
the Bears were slugging from
the first play, and others say
that they have been violent all
season, how do the Catds feel

about Cal's style of play? "I saw
the films from the 'SC-Cal
game," said Mark Hill, Stan
ford's starting guard, "and in
any game as emotional as that,
feelings and tempers are going
to be up and fists may fly. But I
do not consider Cal a cheap
shot team.
"Their defensive backfield is
very aggressive, but not vio
lent.
Phil Francis, Stanford's start
ing fullback, expressed similar
feelings: "Against 'SC, Cal
played good, aggressive foot

ball. It didn't look bad, and it
was not at all cheap.
Either these two players saw
different films from the game
than John Robinson and the
(JSC Trojans saw, or they are
not stating their true senti
ments towards Cal in order not
to rile the Bears' fighting incen
tive on Saturday. In any case,
there seems to be a wide dif
ference of opinion concerning
Cal's aggressiveness.

den Bears? Only the Big Game
will tell.

ball. It didn't look bad, and it
was not at all cheap.
Either these two players saw
different films from the game
than John Robinson and the
(JSC Trojans saw, or they are
not stating their true senti
ments towards Cal in order not
to rile the Bears' fighting incen
tive on Saturday. In any case,
there seems to be a wide dif
ference of opinion concerning
Cal's aggressiveness.
Are they really the Dirty Col
den Bears? Only the Big Game
will tell.
Tomorrow, Stanford and
California meet at Stanford
Stadium in the Big Came. Usu
ally a hard, well-fought battle
between the two rivals, the
game always promises an equal
amount of excitement, en
thusiasm and aggression from
both teams.
This year, however, accord
ing to some football circles, the
aggression aspect of the game
may be tilted in Cal's favor.
The rumor going around the
Pac-8 is that this year's Golden
Bears are the most overaggres
sive football team in the con
ference, and that they do not
hesitate to sidestep legality in
order to badger and intimidate
their opponents.
The basis for these rumors is
not quite certain, but there can
be little doubt that three weeks
ago, after a game between the
Bears and the USC Trojans, the
rumors gathered enough rec
ognition to become a wide
spread belief and to convince
many people of their absolute
truth, including USC coach
)ohn Robinson.
In referring to the fight that
occurred on the USC sidelines
between three Cal defenders
and the USC football team,
after the Cal players had run
USC's Charles White out of
bounds, Robinson said
"Somebody punched Charles
in the face on that pileup. No,
I'm notgoingto saywhoitwas;
I don't want to get into that."

Of course, as to every story
there is more than one side,
and Ralph Deloach, the Cal de
fender who had helped run
White out of bounds, saw the
fighting this way: "It was all a
misunderstanding. Anthony
Washington and I tackled
Charles White on the sideline
and I guess we didn't get off as
fast as White wanted."
Since the Trojan players say
the Bears were slugging from
the first play, and others say
that they have been violent all
season, how do the Catds feel

about Cal's style of play? "I saw
the films from the 'SC-Cal
game," said Mark Hill, Stan
ford's starting guard, "and in
any game as emotional as that,
feelings and tempers are going
to be up and fists may fly. But I
do not consider Cal a cheap
shot team.
"Their defensive backfield is
very aggressive, but not vio
lent.
Phil Francis, Stanford's start
ing fullback, expressed similar
feelings: "Against 'SC, Cal
played good, aggressive foot

ball. It didn't look bad, and it
was not at all cheap.
