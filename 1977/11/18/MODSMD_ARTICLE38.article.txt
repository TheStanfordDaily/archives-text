Containers
There will be no large con
tainers such as coolers, picnic
baskets and ice boxes allowed
into the Big Game tomorrow,
the Athletic Department said.
Officials in the Athletic De
partment said that individual
cans, quart-sized thermoses
and brown bag lunches will be
allowed in the stadium, how
ever.
The container measures
have been taken to keep the
aisles and rows as clear as pos
sible for the convenience of
spectators trying to get to re
strooms and other facilities.
Security people at the game
will be instructed not to allow
anyone in the stadium with
large containers and there will

be no collection area for con
tainers, so people are advised
to leave any oversized recepta
cles in their dormitories or
cars.
