# A 						totally fictious interview
## The 						mysterious case of the Cal band weenies 
### John Nielsen 
I wasn't expecting California
band members to march into
the Daily office last night, but
when they did, I was quick to
react. I asked them to sit down
(they refused, and stayed at at
tention), and pulled a tape re
corder from my Stanford Daily
utility belt. Then I asked deeply
probing questions and cap
tured their comments in full. It
went as follows:
Weenies: We Cal bandsmen
have come here today in an ef
fort to esablish once and for all
that ours is no ordinary organi
zation. We have come because
we think that the people of the
Palo Alto and Stanford com
munities really appreciate the
precision marching and discip
lined performance of the Cal
band far more than they ap
preciate the degenerate, slo
venly, drooling, perverse be
havior of their own ostensible
representatives.
We think that the god
fearing, straight-arrow, patrio
tic Americans on this side of
the Bay will get more enjoy
ment out of our show than they
will get out of the meanderings
oftheirown misguided youths,
and for that reason we have
come today to set the record
straight.
Daily: In what sense would
you like to set the record
straight?
Weenies: We would like to
deny the whinings of those sob
sisters and subversive types
who have made their way into
our nation and your university;
to prove once and for all that a
Cal bandsman is more than a
short ugly person with no
friends or sex life.
Daily: What, then, is a Cal
bandsman like? How would we
know one if we saw one in the
street?
Weenies: Aside from the in
evitably horrible skin disease, a
Cal bandsman is immediately
recognizable to those around
him as one who exudes a
genuine warmth, one whose
humane and courageous aura
will always attract attention.
You can tell a Cal bandsman by
the way he polishes the little
plastic points on the tips of
their shoe laces, or you can
find him out quite quickly by
the way he picks his teeth.
You can also tell a Cal

bandsman by his uniform. We
are very proud of our distinc
tive uniforms — nothing simi
lar has been manufactured in
the United States for over two
hundred years.
Daily: That is quite an
achievement. You must go to
great lengths to find just the
right persons for your organi
zation. Could you tell us some
thing about how a Cal
bandsman is chosen?
Weenies: Certainly, but first
allow us to dispel an awful
rumor. We have been told that
those other people have
claimed that we rely exclu
sively on high school aptitude
tests when we select
bandsmen — that we value
most highly those applicants
whose tests predict a career fil
ling Coke machines, or one
spent sorting tobacco leaves by
shape and color. Let us assure
you must emphatically at this
time that these rumors are only
half true. There are a number
of additional criteria that must
be met by Cal band applicants.
Among them are a desire to
fight vice with energetic right
eousness and an ability to re
move pant-leg stains. In short,
we have attempt to as great a
degree as is possible to imitate
the USC band, an organization
for which we have only the
deepest respect and admira
tion. Some day, we hope, we
will learn to make them proud.
Daily: That, too, would be a
considerable achievement —
but how can you hope to match
the USC mascot?
Weenies: We have gone to
great lengths this year to find
the perfect Oski. Admittedly it
has been difficult, in that most
good prospects find it impos
sible to stop drooling on the
inside of the suit, but we have
perservered this year and dis
covered an Oski whose other
talents are so considerable that
we have been able to overlook
those smaller problems.
If you don't mind though,
we'd like to get back to the bus
inessat hand, which centers on
the differences between our
musical philosophy and that of
your band.
Daily Well?
Weenies: The typical Stan
ford bandsman represents the
decline of western culture to
us, and the Stanford band

philosophy seems modeled to
that end. Conversely, we on
the far side of the big water
have dedicated ourselves to
the moral and upright aspects
of an age which puts high pre
miums on masculinity, order
and the discovery of interest
ing things to do with large con
ical objects.
Daily: What about those
many Cal pranks? Do you think
you could give us a little of the
philosophy that powers those
wildly inventive forays?
Weenies: Cal pranks are wild
and many because we give
them tremendous thought. We
practice all year painting things
blue. For instance — small
birds, old women, unused
parts of our bodies. We also
review our spelling inces
santly, often taking extra hours
to memorize difficult four and
five letter words. It may seem
tough, all that effort, but I as
sure you it pays. We have be
come extremely adept at defac
ing 100-year-old buildings.
Daily: To what does the Cal
band aspire musically? Could
you tell us something about
this week's halftime show?
Weenies: Musically we
would like to recreate the kind
of sounds heard in aisle 4B at
any Ralph's Market, or those
encountered when walking
from an airport check-in
counter to the men's room. We
aspire to the kind of music
heard while reading Hilight
magazine in the dentist's of
fice.
Specifically, our halftime
show this week will take equal
inspiration rrom the marches
of John Phillips Sousa, the
snappy rat-a-tat-tat music of
Guy Lombardo and the with-it
driving rhythms of those old
Gregorian monks. Though it
would be unprofessional at
this time to reveal the exact na
ture of each song we will admit
as a sort of teaser that it fea
tures the death march from
"Snow White."
The interview ends here.
'After receiving a phone call in
forming them that their spray
paint was ready the weenies
lept to their feet and vanished,
marching quickly out of the
room with the same endearing
six-inch steps that we will see
so much of tomorrow.

I wasn't expecting California
band members to march into
the Daily office last night, but
when they did, I was quick to
react. I asked them to sit down
(they refused, and stayed at at
tention), and pulled a tape re
corder from my Stanford Daily
utility belt. Then I asked deeply
probing questions and cap
tured their comments in full. It
went as follows:
Weenies: We Cal bandsmen
have come here today in an ef
fort to esablish once and for all
that ours is no ordinary organi
zation. We have come because
we think that the people of the
Palo Alto and Stanford com
munities really appreciate the
precision marching and discip
lined performance of the Cal
band far more than they ap
preciate the degenerate, slo
venly, drooling, perverse be
havior of their own ostensible
representatives.
We think that the god
fearing, straight-arrow, patrio
tic Americans on this side of
the Bay will get more enjoy
ment out of our show than they
will get out of the meanderings
oftheirown misguided youths,
and for that reason we have
come today to set the record
straight.
Daily: In what sense would
you like to set the record
straight?
Weenies: We would like to
deny the whinings of those sob
sisters and subversive types
who have made their way into
our nation and your university;
to prove once and for all that a
Cal bandsman is more than a
short ugly person with no
friends or sex life.
Daily: What, then, is a Cal
bandsman like? How would we
know one if we saw one in the
street?
Weenies: Aside from the in
evitably horrible skin disease, a
Cal bandsman is immediately
recognizable to those around
him as one who exudes a
genuine warmth, one whose
humane and courageous aura
will always attract attention.
You can tell a Cal bandsman by
the way he polishes the little
plastic points on the tips of
their shoe laces, or you can
find him out quite quickly by
the way he picks his teeth.
You can also tell a Cal

bandsman by his uniform. We
are very proud of our distinc
tive uniforms — nothing simi
lar has been manufactured in
the United States for over two
hundred years.
Daily: That is quite an
achievement. You must go to
great lengths to find just the
right persons for your organi
zation. Could you tell us some
thing about how a Cal
bandsman is chosen?
Weenies: Certainly, but first
allow us to dispel an awful
rumor. We have been told that
those other people have
claimed that we rely exclu
sively on high school aptitude
tests when we select
bandsmen — that we value
most highly those applicants
whose tests predict a career fil
ling Coke machines, or one
spent sorting tobacco leaves by
shape and color. Let us assure
you must emphatically at this
time that these rumors are only
half true. There are a number
of additional criteria that must
be met by Cal band applicants.
Among them are a desire to
fight vice with energetic right
eousness and an ability to re
move pant-leg stains. In short,
we have attempt to as great a
degree as is possible to imitate
the USC band, an organization
for which we have only the
deepest respect and admira
tion. Some day, we hope, we
will learn to make them proud.
Daily: That, too, would be a
considerable achievement —
but how can you hope to match
the USC mascot?
Weenies: We have gone to
great lengths this year to find
the perfect Oski. Admittedly it
has been difficult, in that most
good prospects find it impos
sible to stop drooling on the
inside of the suit, but we have
perservered this year and dis
covered an Oski whose other
talents are so considerable that
we have been able to overlook
those smaller problems.
If you don't mind though,
we'd like to get back to the bus
inessat hand, which centers on
the differences between our
musical philosophy and that of
your band.
Daily Well?
Weenies: The typical Stan
ford bandsman represents the
decline of western culture to
us, and the Stanford band

philosophy seems modeled to
that end. Conversely, we on
the far side of the big water
have dedicated ourselves to
the moral and upright aspects
of an age which puts high pre
miums on masculinity, order
and the discovery of interest
ing things to do with large con
ical objects.
Daily: What about those
many Cal pranks? Do you think
you could give us a little of the
philosophy that powers those
wildly inventive forays?
Weenies: Cal pranks are wild
and many because we give
them tremendous thought. We
practice all year painting things
blue. For instance — small
birds, old women, unused
parts of our bodies. We also
review our spelling inces
santly, often taking extra hours
to memorize difficult four and
five letter words. It may seem
tough, all that effort, but I as
sure you it pays. We have be
come extremely adept at defac
ing 100-year-old buildings.
Daily: To what does the Cal
band aspire musically? Could
you tell us something about
this week's halftime show?
Weenies: Musically we
would like to recreate the kind
of sounds heard in aisle 4B at
any Ralph's Market, or those
encountered when walking
from an airport check-in
counter to the men's room. We
aspire to the kind of music
heard while reading Hilight
magazine in the dentist's of
fice.
Specifically, our halftime
show this week will take equal
inspiration rrom the marches
of John Phillips Sousa, the
snappy rat-a-tat-tat music of
Guy Lombardo and the with-it
driving rhythms of those old
Gregorian monks. Though it

Daily: To what does the Cal
band aspire musically? Could
you tell us something about
this week's halftime show?
Weenies: Musically we
would like to recreate the kind
of sounds heard in aisle 4B at
any Ralph's Market, or those
encountered when walking
from an airport check-in
counter to the men's room. We
aspire to the kind of music
heard while reading Hilight
magazine in the dentist's of
fice.
Specifically, our halftime
show this week will take equal
inspiration rrom the marches
of John Phillips Sousa, the
snappy rat-a-tat-tat music of
Guy Lombardo and the with-it
driving rhythms of those old
Gregorian monks. Though it
would be unprofessional at
this time to reveal the exact na
ture of each song we will admit
as a sort of teaser that it fea
tures the death march from
"Snow White."

I wasn't expecting California
band members to march into
the Daily office last night, but
when they did, I was quick to
react. I asked them to sit down
(they refused, and stayed at at
tention), and pulled a tape re
corder from my Stanford Daily
utility belt. Then I asked deeply
probing questions and cap
tured their comments in full. It
went as follows:
Weenies: We Cal bandsmen
have come here today in an ef
fort to esablish once and for all
that ours is no ordinary organi
zation. We have come because
we think that the people of the
Palo Alto and Stanford com
munities really appreciate the
precision marching and discip
lined performance of the Cal
band far more than they ap
preciate the degenerate, slo
venly, drooling, perverse be
havior of their own ostensible
representatives.
We think that the god
fearing, straight-arrow, patrio
tic Americans on this side of
the Bay will get more enjoy
ment out of our show than they
will get out of the meanderings
oftheirown misguided youths,
and for that reason we have
come today to set the record
straight.
Daily: In what sense would
you like to set the record
straight?
Weenies: We would like to
deny the whinings of those sob
sisters and subversive types
who have made their way into
our nation and your university;
to prove once and for all that a
Cal bandsman is more than a
short ugly person with no
friends or sex life.
Daily: What, then, is a Cal
bandsman like? How would we
know one if we saw one in the
street?
Weenies: Aside from the in
evitably horrible skin disease, a
Cal bandsman is immediately
recognizable to those around
him as one who exudes a
genuine warmth, one whose
humane and courageous aura
will always attract attention.
You can tell a Cal bandsman by
the way he polishes the little
plastic points on the tips of
their shoe laces, or you can
find him out quite quickly by
the way he picks his teeth.
You can also tell a Cal

bandsman by his uniform. We
are very proud of our distinc
tive uniforms — nothing simi
lar has been manufactured in
the United States for over two
hundred years.
Daily: That is quite an
achievement. You must go to
great lengths to find just the
right persons for your organi
zation. Could you tell us some
thing about how a Cal
bandsman is chosen?
Weenies: Certainly, but first
allow us to dispel an awful
rumor. We have been told that
those other people have
claimed that we rely exclu
sively on high school aptitude
tests when we select
bandsmen — that we value
most highly those applicants
whose tests predict a career fil
ling Coke machines, or one
spent sorting tobacco leaves by
shape and color. Let us assure
you must emphatically at this
time that these rumors are only
half true. There are a number
of additional criteria that must
be met by Cal band applicants.
Among them are a desire to
fight vice with energetic right
eousness and an ability to re
move pant-leg stains. In short,
we have attempt to as great a
degree as is possible to imitate
the USC band, an organization
for which we have only the
deepest respect and admira
tion. Some day, we hope, we
will learn to make them proud.
Daily: That, too, would be a
considerable achievement —
but how can you hope to match
the USC mascot?
Weenies: We have gone to
great lengths this year to find
the perfect Oski. Admittedly it
has been difficult, in that most
good prospects find it impos
sible to stop drooling on the
inside of the suit, but we have
perservered this year and dis
covered an Oski whose other
talents are so considerable that
we have been able to overlook
those smaller problems.
If you don't mind though,
we'd like to get back to the bus
inessat hand, which centers on
the differences between our
musical philosophy and that of
your band.
Daily Well?
Weenies: The typical Stan
ford bandsman represents the
decline of western culture to
us, and the Stanford band

philosophy seems modeled to
that end. Conversely, we on
the far side of the big water
have dedicated ourselves to
the moral and upright aspects
of an age which puts high pre
miums on masculinity, order
and the discovery of interest
ing things to do with large con
ical objects.
Daily: What about those
many Cal pranks? Do you think
you could give us a little of the
philosophy that powers those
wildly inventive forays?
Weenies: Cal pranks are wild
and many because we give
them tremendous thought. We
practice all year painting things
blue. For instance — small
birds, old women, unused
parts of our bodies. We also
review our spelling inces
santly, often taking extra hours
to memorize difficult four and
five letter words. It may seem
tough, all that effort, but I as
sure you it pays. We have be
come extremely adept at defac
ing 100-year-old buildings.

band aspire musically? Could
