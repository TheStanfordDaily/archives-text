Attendants anticipate United strike
Washington — A flight attendants union said yesterday
it is preparing to strike United Airlines at midnight to
night in a dispute that could ground the nation's biggest
airline over the Thanksgiving holiday.
Patricia Robertson, president of the Association of
Flight Attendants, said there "has not been enough
progress in talks at this point" between the union and
the company to avert a walkout.
A strike "appears likely," Robertson said, advising that
"people with reservations on United may want to make
backup arrangements on other airlines."
Despite the union's statement, federal mediators said
contract talks were continuing. "We are still optimistic
that an agreement can be reached before the deadline,"
said mediator Robert Harris.
United operates an average of 1450 flights daily, carry
ing an average of 93,000 passengers a day to 94 cities in
the United States and Canada.
The spokesman said the airline has booked 440,000
reservations over the tour-day Thanksgiving holiday,
traditionally a peak travel period.
Scientists question nuclear safety
Washington — A group of scientists opposed to nuc
lear power charged yesterday that serious reactor acci
dents are 20 times more likely than the government's
basic estimate, and may kill thousands in the next few
decades.
The Union of Concerned Scientists sharply criticized
the more optimistic "Rasmussen Report," which has
been the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's tundamen
tal safety study since 1974.
The scientist group said its own "corrections" ot the
government study lead to forecasts of some 14,400
cancer deaths due to nuclear power plant accidents
within the next 23 years if the program grows rapidly.
Food prices, job prospects to rise
Washington — The average family will have to pay up
to six percent more in food prices next year but there are
indications that an improving economy could help some
of them meet the higher bill.
An Agriculture Department official said the higher

food prices will be caused by rising costs for transport
ing, processing and selling food after it leaves the farm.
The increase in consumer food prices — estimated to
run between four per cent and six per cent — will be
slightly below the 6.5 per cent rise projected for this
year, said Kenneth Farrell, acting chief of the depart
ment's Economic Research Service.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department issued a re
port encouraging to job prospects and the economic
outlook. The department said the nation's output of
goods and services, or gross national product, grew at
an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the third quarter.
It takes a growth rate of more than four per cent to
produce new jobs.
Company attempts train cancellation
San Francisco — Southern Pacific is going to the fed
eral government in a new attempt to eliminate its
money-losing commuter train service between San
Francisco and San Jose.
SP Vice President Alan DeMoss said yesterday the
commuter services lost $26.5 million for the company
last year.
He said SP is petitioning the Interstate Commerce
Commission to end the service. Meantime, DeMoss
said, the railroad will continue seeking discontinuance
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
"The losses are real and enormous and impede our
ability to meet the needs of interstate commerce, prom
ote economic development and employment and keep
rail-served industry and agriculture in California and
other states competitive in national markets," DeMoss
said.
The ICC petition, which was expected to be tiled for
mally today, says ridership declined from 16,500 per day
in 1954 to 7500 now.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today. Chance of showers tonight
decreasing tomorrow. Cooling today and colder tomor
row. Lows mid-30s to mid-40s. Highs today mid-50s to
mid-60s and tomorrow 50s to low 60s. Northwest winds
10 to 20 mph today increasing tomorrow. Chance of rain

The scientist group said its own "corrections" ot the
government study lead to forecasts of some 14,400
cancer deaths due to nuclear power plant accidents

Food prices, job prospects to rise
Washington — The average family will have to pay up
to six percent more in food prices next year but there are
indications that an improving economy could help some
of them meet the higher bill.
An Agriculture Department official said the higher

food prices will be caused by rising costs for transport
ing, processing and selling food after it leaves the farm.
The increase in consumer food prices — estimated to
run between four per cent and six per cent — will be
slightly below the 6.5 per cent rise projected for this
year, said Kenneth Farrell, acting chief of the depart
ment's Economic Research Service.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department issued a re
port encouraging to job prospects and the economic
outlook. The department said the nation's output of
goods and services, or gross national product, grew at
an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the third quarter.
It takes a growth rate of more than four per cent to
produce new jobs.
Company attempts train cancellation
San Francisco — Southern Pacific is going to the fed
eral government in a new attempt to eliminate its
money-losing commuter train service between San
Francisco and San Jose.
SP Vice President Alan DeMoss said yesterday the
commuter services lost $26.5 million for the company
last year.
He said SP is petitioning the Interstate Commerce
Commission to end the service. Meantime, DeMoss
said, the railroad will continue seeking discontinuance
before the California Public Utilities Commission.
"The losses are real and enormous and impede our
ability to meet the needs of interstate commerce, prom
ote economic development and employment and keep
rail-served industry and agriculture in California and
other states competitive in national markets," DeMoss
said.
The ICC petition, which was expected to be tiled for
mally today, says ridership declined from 16,500 per day
in 1954 to 7500 now.

Attendants anticipate United strike
Washington — A flight attendants union said yesterday
it is preparing to strike United Airlines at midnight to
night in a dispute that could ground the nation's biggest
airline over the Thanksgiving holiday.
Patricia Robertson, president of the Association of
Flight Attendants, said there "has not been enough
progress in talks at this point" between the union and
the company to avert a walkout.
A strike "appears likely," Robertson said, advising that
"people with reservations on United may want to make
backup arrangements on other airlines."
Despite the union's statement, federal mediators said
contract talks were continuing. "We are still optimistic
that an agreement can be reached before the deadline,"
said mediator Robert Harris.
United operates an average of 1450 flights daily, carry
ing an average of 93,000 passengers a day to 94 cities in
the United States and Canada.
The spokesman said the airline has booked 440,000
reservations over the tour-day Thanksgiving holiday,
traditionally a peak travel period.
Scientists question nuclear safety
Washington — A group of scientists opposed to nuc

basic estimate, and may kill thousands in the next few
decades.

the more optimistic "Rasmussen Report," which has
been the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's tundamen
