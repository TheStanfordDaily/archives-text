# Faculty considers Honor Code responsibility
## 
### Steven Burr 
In an effort to strengthen the
Honor Code, the Honor Code com
mission will present a resolution af
firming faculty members' responsi
bility to observe the code to the Fa
culty Senate Steering Committee
Tuesday.
Commission Chairperson and
ASSU Co-president Steve Westly said
the action follows the Steering
Committee's three-time rejection of
a resolution asking faculty members
to sign Honor Code observance

boxes similar to those on student
blue books as part of their end
quarter report forms.
The signatures would affirm that
courses had been conducted accord
ing to Honor Code requirements,
Westly said.
Westly said the signature proposal
was intended to remind faculty
members of Honor Code principles.
Academic Secretary Eric Hutchin
son, in a letter to the commission,
said the Steering Committee
"warmly endorses the principle of

the Honor Code," but listed three
objections of the committee to the
signature proposal:
— the proposal provides no sanc
tions against code violators;
— the Honor Code problem calls
for "educational means, not . . .
bureaucratic procedures"; and
— the commission failed to show
faculty Honor Code violations are a
serious problem.
Westly responded that the
November 1976 Cole Report on the
Honor Code provided evidence of
widespread ignorance of the code.
Hutchinson said thatwhilethe report
gave evidence of ignorance, deliber
ate violation on the faculty's part was
not proved.
Thirty-five per cent of faculty
members surveyed for the Cole Re
port responded incorrectly toa ques
tion about the code's provisions
while 18 per cent said they didn't
know the answer.
In addition, 96 per cent of those
responding said they did not follow
Honor Code procedures in the most
recent cheating case they faced, and
only 16 per cent said their failure to
act according to the code was based
on ignorance.
Westly said after the failure of the
signature proposal the commission
decided to try the second proposal to
make sure the code actually has the
support of the faculty, something
that has yet to be affirmed.
A similar resolution has already
passed the ASSU Senate, stating that
students acknowledge their respon
sibility to uphold the code.
As for the faculty, Westly said, "it
would be ideal if they could take time
at the beginning of every class at the
beginning of the quarter to explain
the Honor Code."
"Perhaps the faculty needs more
time to realize the importance of it
(the code)," he added.
Hutchinson said reaction to the
new proposal is likely to be much
more favorable than to the old.
The new proposal is "not a difficult
thing for the (Faculty) Senate or
Steering Committee to accept," he
said.
"It would be more in line with the
senate's desire for education as op

posed to 'bureaucratic proce
dures.' "
Asked about Westly's belief that
the original proposal would have
provided good educational means,
he replied that "the Steering Com
mittee heard him for an hour and
didn't agree with him."
According to Peter Stansky, chair
man of the Faculty Senate, the new
resolution is unnecessary and the
original one is still on its way to the
senate as a whole.
The Honor Code Commission was
formed last year after the Student
Conduct Legislative Council added
interpretations to the code sanction
ing promotion and advertisement of
the code to students and faculty.
