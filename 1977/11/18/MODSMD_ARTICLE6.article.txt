# Arabs voice alarm at Sadat's Israel visit
## 
### Associated Press 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
has set his historic visit to Israel for
this weekend despite growing alarm
among fellow-Arabs dramatized yes
terday by the resignation in quick
succession of two Egyptian foreign
ministers.
Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin said Sadat's 36-hour visit
would begin Saturday night, after the
)ewish Sabbath. On Sunday, Sadat is
to worship at a Moslem mosque,
meet privately with Begin and then
address the Knesset, the Israeli parli
ament, at 4 p.m. (6 a.m. PST).
Sadat has pledged not to negotiate
a separate peace, and in his address
to the Knesset he is expected to list
the standard Arab demands for a
Palestinian homeland and Israeli
withdrawal from lands occupied in
1967 — demands Israel rejects.
But if the visit comes about, Sadat
will be the first Arab leader ever to
visit the Jewish state, a breakthrough
that could open a new chapter in the
search for a Middle East peace after
four wars.

Observers said the boldness of the
mission, which Sadat described as a
"sacred duty," reflected how badly
he wanted peace so he could shift his
attention to Egypt's acute economic
problems.
For the Israelis, the visit falls just
short of answering their 30-year
quest for Arab recognition.
Begin told reporters in
lerusalem that after Sadat's visit to
the Israeli capital he hoped to be in
vited to Cairo.
"But the psychological impact of
this on the Arab world," said an Is
raeli Foreign Ministry official, paus
ing to search for words, "the
psychological impact will be im
mense."
The announcement of Sadat's visit
followed several days ol public ex
changes by th< tgyptian and Israeli
leaders. Hut the timing came as a
surprise to U.S. and other diplomats,
who had not expected it until later
next week.
Begin said the d.iy was set last
Wednesday, and the tinal agreement
came in an exchange of letters
through the U.S. ambassadors to
Egypt and Israel. The announcement
in Jerusalem came amid these fast
paced developments:
—Sadat accepted the invitation
after tlying to Damascus in a futile bid
to win Syrian President Hafez Assad's
support for the trip. After seven
hours of talks, Assad said his failure
to dissuade Sadat was "really pain
ful."
