# Arabs voice alarm at Sadat's Israel visit
## 
### Associated Press 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
has set his historic visit to Israel for
this weekend despite growing alarm
among fellow-Arabs dramatized yes
terday by the resignation in quick
succession of two Egyptian foreign
ministers.
Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin said Sadat's 36-hour visit
would begin Saturday night, after the
)ewish Sabbath. On Sunday, Sadat is
to worship at a Moslem mosque,
meet privately with Begin and then
address the Knesset, the Israeli parli
ament, at 4 p.m. (6 a.m. PST).
Sadat has pledged not to negotiate
a separate peace, and in his address
to the Knesset he is expected to list
the standard Arab demands for a
Palestinian homeland and Israeli
withdrawal from lands occupied in
1967 — demands Israel rejects.
But if the visit comes about, Sadat
will be the first Arab leader ever to
visit the Jewish state, a breakthrough
that could open a new chapter in the
search for a Middle East peace after
four wars.

Observers said the boldness of the
mission, which Sadat described as a
"sacred duty," reflected how badly
he wanted peace so he could shift his
attention to Egypt's acute economic
problems.
For the Israelis, the visit falls just
short of answering their 30-year
quest for Arab recognition.
Begin told reporters in
lerusalem that after Sadat's visit to
the Israeli capital he hoped to be in
vited to Cairo.
"But the psychological impact of
this on the Arab world," said an Is
raeli Foreign Ministry official, paus
ing to search for words, "the
psychological impact will be im
mense."
The announcement of Sadat's visit
followed several days ol public ex
changes by th< tgyptian and Israeli
leaders. Hut the timing came as a
surprise to U.S. and other diplomats,
who had not expected it until later
next week.
Begin said the d.iy was set last
Wednesday, and the tinal agreement
came in an exchange of letters
through the U.S. ambassadors to
Egypt and Israel. The announcement
in Jerusalem came amid these fast
paced developments:
—Sadat accepted the invitation
after tlying to Damascus in a futile bid
to win Syrian President Hafez Assad's
support for the trip. After seven
hours of talks, Assad said his failure
to dissuade Sadat was "really pain
ful."
—Shortly after the Syrian ancJ
Egyptian leaders announced their
disagreement two bombs exploded
outside the Egyptian embassy in
Damascus. There was no immediate
report on casualties.
—As soon as Sadat returned to
Egypt, the official Middle East News
Agency announced that Ismail
Fahmy, his foreign minister and top
foreign policy aide since the October
1973 war, had resigned. Sadat named
Fahmy's deputy, Mohammed Riad,
in his stead, but several hours later
the agency said he too had quit.
There was immediate speculation
that both resigned in protest against
the Israel visit. The agency said Sadat

accepted both resignations and
named Butros Ghali, a minister of
state and member of the minority
Coptic Christian faith, as acting
foreign minister.
In Beirut, Palestinian leader Yasir
Arafat condemned the planned visit
and urged Sadat to cancel it.
The Syrian statement claimed
Sadat's visit would give Israel "gains
it failed to achieve through war or
otherwise in the last 30 years," an
apparent reference to de facto rec
ognition of the lewish state implied
in such a visit.
The statement appealed to the
Arabs to "act to thwart the expected
dangers, and search for proper for
mulas to intercept them."
In San Francisco, one of the United
States' leading jewish spokesmen
yesterday praised Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's trip to Israel this
weekend as "a courageous and im
aginative offer, creating an aura
which can bring peace."
Rabbi Alexander Schindler, presi
dent of the Union of American Heb
rew Congregations, said Sadat's in
itiative is "more than an acceptance
of Israel's right to exist; it is an accep
tance of the urgency of peace.
"A treaty could be arranged in
very, very little time."
However, Schindler, who also
serves as chairman of the Confer
ence of Major American Jewish Or
ganizations, warned that "as en
couraging as this step is in advanc ing
the climate for peace, a visit does not
spell peace itself."
He said, "Sadat cannot afford to
stand alone. His moderation must be
equaled by other Arab leaders. Hard
compromises, which will take time
and patience, lie ahead."

tance of the urgency of peace.
"A treaty could be arranged in
very, very little time."
However, Schindler, who also
serves as chairman of the Confer
ence of Major American Jewish Or
ganizations, warned that "as en
couraging as this step is in advanc ing
the climate for peace, a visit does not
spell peace itself."
He said, "Sadat cannot afford to
stand alone. His moderation must be
equaled by other Arab leaders. Hard
compromises, which will take time
and patience, lie ahead."
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
has set his historic visit to Israel for
this weekend despite growing alarm
among fellow-Arabs dramatized yes
terday by the resignation in quick
succession of two Egyptian foreign
ministers.
Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin said Sadat's 36-hour visit
would begin Saturday night, after the
)ewish Sabbath. On Sunday, Sadat is
to worship at a Moslem mosque,
meet privately with Begin and then
address the Knesset, the Israeli parli
ament, at 4 p.m. (6 a.m. PST).
Sadat has pledged not to negotiate
a separate peace, and in his address
to the Knesset he is expected to list
the standard Arab demands for a
Palestinian homeland and Israeli
withdrawal from lands occupied in
1967 — demands Israel rejects.
But if the visit comes about, Sadat
will be the first Arab leader ever to
visit the Jewish state, a breakthrough
that could open a new chapter in the
search for a Middle East peace after
four wars.

Observers said the boldness of the
mission, which Sadat described as a
"sacred duty," reflected how badly
he wanted peace so he could shift his
attention to Egypt's acute economic
problems.
For the Israelis, the visit falls just
short of answering their 30-year
quest for Arab recognition.
Begin told reporters in
lerusalem that after Sadat's visit to
the Israeli capital he hoped to be in
vited to Cairo.
"But the psychological impact of
this on the Arab world," said an Is
raeli Foreign Ministry official, paus
ing to search for words, "the
psychological impact will be im
mense."
The announcement of Sadat's visit
followed several days ol public ex
changes by th< tgyptian and Israeli
leaders. Hut the timing came as a
surprise to U.S. and other diplomats,
who had not expected it until later
next week.
Begin said the d.iy was set last
Wednesday, and the tinal agreement
came in an exchange of letters
through the U.S. ambassadors to
Egypt and Israel. The announcement
in Jerusalem came amid these fast
paced developments:
—Sadat accepted the invitation
after tlying to Damascus in a futile bid
to win Syrian President Hafez Assad's
support for the trip. After seven
hours of talks, Assad said his failure
to dissuade Sadat was "really pain
ful."
—Shortly after the Syrian ancJ
Egyptian leaders announced their
disagreement two bombs exploded
outside the Egyptian embassy in
Damascus. There was no immediate
report on casualties.
—As soon as Sadat returned to
Egypt, the official Middle East News
Agency announced that Ismail
Fahmy, his foreign minister and top
foreign policy aide since the October
1973 war, had resigned. Sadat named
Fahmy's deputy, Mohammed Riad,
in his stead, but several hours later
the agency said he too had quit.
There was immediate speculation
that both resigned in protest against
the Israel visit. The agency said Sadat

accepted both resignations and
named Butros Ghali, a minister of
state and member of the minority
Coptic Christian faith, as acting
foreign minister.
In Beirut, Palestinian leader Yasir
Arafat condemned the planned visit
and urged Sadat to cancel it.
The Syrian statement claimed
Sadat's visit would give Israel "gains
it failed to achieve through war or
otherwise in the last 30 years," an
apparent reference to de facto rec
ognition of the lewish state implied
in such a visit.
The statement appealed to the
Arabs to "act to thwart the expected
dangers, and search for proper for
mulas to intercept them."
In San Francisco, one of the United
States' leading jewish spokesmen
yesterday praised Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's trip to Israel this
weekend as "a courageous and im
aginative offer, creating an aura
which can bring peace."
Rabbi Alexander Schindler, presi
dent of the Union of American Heb

dangers, and search for proper for
mulas to intercept them."
In San Francisco, one of the United
States' leading jewish spokesmen
yesterday praised Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's trip to Israel this
weekend as "a courageous and im
aginative offer, creating an aura
which can bring peace."
Rabbi Alexander Schindler, presi
dent of the Union of American Heb
rew Congregations, said Sadat's in
itiative is "more than an acceptance
of Israel's right to exist; it is an accep
tance of the urgency of peace.
"A treaty could be arranged in
very, very little time."
However, Schindler, who also
serves as chairman of the Confer
ence of Major American Jewish Or
ganizations, warned that "as en
couraging as this step is in advanc ing
the climate for peace, a visit does not
spell peace itself."
He said, "Sadat cannot afford to
stand alone. His moderation must be
equaled by other Arab leaders. Hard
compromises, which will take time
and patience, lie ahead."
