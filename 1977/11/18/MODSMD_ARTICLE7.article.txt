# 1300 raise $3000 for Day of Fasting
## 
### Douglas Greenfield 
About $3000 was raised by the
Stanford Committee on Hunger as
part of their annual Day of Fasting
yesterday, according to Curtis Whit
son, president of the Committee.
Over 1300 people turned in meal
cards for a rebate or donated funds
to go to a variety of local and interna
tional hunger relief organizations,
Whitson said.
Competition from Big Came
events and good grain harvests in the
past few years reduced this year's
participation, Whitson said. Over
$4000 was raised last year.
There were more people lined up
at noon yesterday in White Plaza for
root beer floats than attended the
Day of Fasting rally, Whitson pointed
out.
And the immediate lack of a famine
orother serious hunger-related crisis
(which are only the "tip of the
iceberg") due to good grain produc
tion in the past few years has lowered
people's awareness, he said.
It is just such an awareness that the
Committee on Hunger is trying to
create, Whitson said.
"The Day of Fasting was an effort to

get people to reflect on their own
personal relation to hunger in the
world, and how the individual can
affect the problem," he said.
Three hundred of those who
fasted officially yesterday were not
donating food service rebates, in
cluding 100 members of the Eating
Clubs, he said.
Many of the independent houses
donated anywhere from $50 to $100.
The Day of Fasting is only part of a
continuing educational effort, Whit
son said.
The Committee Against Hunger, in
conjunction with Food Service and
the Energy Conservation Center, are
planning a six month food and
energy waste awareness program,
beginning in January, he said.
