# U.S. in South Africa
## The 						impact of investments 
###

In evaluating the total impact of
American investments in South Af
rica it is not enough simply to look
for progressive reforms on the part
of corporations. It is necessary to
evaluate the other arm of the scale:
in what ways do American invest
ments actively support the strength
and determination of the white re
gime?
The past and present pattern of
U.S. business involvement in South
Africa reveals an essentially col
laborative relationship with the rul
ing whites. American firms stabilize
the economy, contribute crucial
technology and equip the police and
military.
South Africa cannot generate
enough capital internally to fully
exploit its cheap labor and valuable
mineral deposits. According to the
country's Standard Bank, "South Af
rica has to a large extent been de
pendent on foreign capital for de
velopment purposes."
Balance of payments
The country's dependence on a
steady inflow of foreign capital is also
reflected in its balance of payments.
South Africa's export trade is not
large enough to finance the massive
imports of machinery it requires.
This gap is filled by foreign exchange
brought into the country by outside
investors.
After Britain, America is the largest
foreign investor in South Africa. Its
$1.7 billion comprises 17 per cent of
all foreign investment in that coun
try. In addition, American banks
have $2 billion in outstanding loans
to South Africa.
As of 1973, three-fourths of Ameri
can investment in South Africa was
controlled by 12 firms playing major
roles in the most strategic and
dynamic sectors of the economy. An
examination of U.S. involvement in
two of these industries — petroleum
and computers — illustrates the cor
porate contribution to apartheid.
South Africa is almost entirely de
pendent on imported oil for its pet
roleum needs. Three American
companies — Mobil, Caltex, and
Esso (Exxon) — import, refine and
market about one-half of this oil.
Because of South Africa's vulnera
bility to an oil cut-off, relations bet
ween the government and U.S. oil
companies have been exceedingly
close. Since 1%7, the government
has had carte blanche to use the U.S.
firms' refineries to meet its strategic
needs.
Mobil argues that under the Offi

cial Secrets Act, they cannot supply
information about their operation in
South Africa because "Oil supplies
are the very lifeblood of the army,
navy and air force, and information
in regard to the sources thereof, re
fining, storage, reserves and dis
tribution are of the utmost strategic
importance to the State."
Like any other advanced, indus
trialized country, South Africa could
not function without the employ
ment of sophisticated computers.
Seven American data processing
firms in South Africa control about 70
per cent of the computer market.
The managing director of Bur
roughs South Africa has said that
"We're entirely dependent on the
United States. The economy would
grind to a halt without access to the
computer technology of the West."
American computer companies
have extensive dealings with the
South African government. At least
one-third of all IBM's business is with
the government. The agencies in
which U.S. marketed and serviced
computers are used include the De
partment of Defense, Armaments
Board, Department of Prisons,
Atomic Energy Board and Council for

Scientific and Industrial Research
(which oversees all civilian and milit
ary research).
IBM equipment in the Department
of Interior computerizes the "Book
of Life," a document which repre
sents for Coloureds and Asians what
the passbook is for blacks. In 1965
IBM was outbid for the passbook
computer system by a British firm.
Integral part
Clearly U.S. corporations are an in
tegral part of South African apar
theid. But would withdrawal of these
investments be a constructive move
toward elimination of that system?
The withdrawal of U.S. firms would
weaken the status quo, and would
create hope among black South Afri
cans that they can effectively chal
lenge the regime. If even a small
number of U.S. firms withdrew, the
psychological and political impact on
the South African government would
be tremendous, and the crisis of con
fidence which withdrawal would
spark among South African whites
could effectively speed an end to
apartheid.
