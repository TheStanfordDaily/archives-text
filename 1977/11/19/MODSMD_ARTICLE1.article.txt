through the process of mechaniza
tion whicii dominates ' the Ameri
can educational system," stated
Howard J. Conn of Stanford, who
with Glenn Orde Rusk, debated a
team from the University of Wash
ington in the Assembly Hall last
night. The Stanford speakers up

ington university defended present
educational methods.

overlooked in the mass production
methods which education has as
sumed in this country," Conn con

examples of the superficiality
which cloaks our university educa

decried by the affirmative is not an
evil, and therefore cannot he in

utilitarian training in our present
civilization, and the American edu
cational system fulfills that need,"
argued Bell, who recently placed

The affirmative arguments were
held invalid by Bell since they did
nor consider the educational sys

and problems of the present day.
