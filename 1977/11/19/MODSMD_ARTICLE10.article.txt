"Whatever interest the Christian
may have in a future, in either ;
earth or heaVcn, rests in the out
, rome of tlie inner traffic of his '
own mind with the God of the in !
effable name," said Dr. G. A. John-';
ston Itoss in his lecture last night j
;on "Christian Destiny." The end
I of the Christian's yearning for a
life beyond death is in the King
i dom of God. In this one phrase is
wrapped up all that could be de
[ sired —a fellowship of man with
1 man. and man with God.
' "We believe in life after death
1 because we believe in God," Dr.
: Itoss continued. "Christ gave his
life lo further the fulfillment of.
i God's' end—he shrank from dying
| as any strong-minded man would.
! he was not spared doubt, even at 1
I the end. yet beyond all of that was
| a deep faith.
"What becomes «»r the ilesh, we
know, and can hardly think about —
flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God —they are laid
aside for good and all at. death.
Science." Jio stated, "even ques
tions whether anything, body or
soul, can remain after death. /
"But a belief lit God. in his ever'j
| present bounty, based on an ac
tual friendship aiid fellowship with [
us -holding within it the clement.'
of eternity, run *'overcome even
: this." *
In • 'inclusion, Dr. Itoss quoted
Dr. H. iuy Norris Itussell: "Whclh
cr we base our lu-lief on the. fart,
thai Jesus believed in God, or on
the larl I hat Jesus was just, we
have abundant, grounds for our own
faith. In Thy hands. Oh Lord, I
eomnnnd my spirit."
