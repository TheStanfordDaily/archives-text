# 80th Big Game
## Card defense must force Cal to punt 
### David Georgette 
How much is at stake in to
day's 80th version of the Big
Came? For beginners, there's
an 8-3 record and a possible
bowl bid. And there's a lot of
pride and a lot of heartbreak.
And there's the Axe.
So you know what Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said he thinks
could be the key to who gets
what? "We're gonna have to
make Cal punt," he said.
If the Stanford defense can
force coach Mike White's
Bears to call upon punter Dan
Melville often, the Cards stand
a reasonable chance for vic
tory. If not, the Bears' offense,
ranked third in the Pacific-8,
could have a field day against a
Stanford defensive unit that at
times has offered as much re
sistance as a sieve.
The Stanford defense is
rated seventh overall, seventh
against the rush and fourth
against the pass in the Pac-8.
"Our feeling now is they've
played some good games and
some not so good games," said
Cal's assistant head coach
Roger Theder. "Recently
they've played good. It looked
like USC just wore them
down."

The cornerstone of the Stan
ford defense is middle
linebacker Gordy Ceresino,
who with 172 tackles has nearly
twice as many as any other

Cardinal. "Ceresino is one of
the finest football players I've
seen at middle linebacker re
cently," said White.
While the Stanford defense
has been criticized for not
stopping the opposition, the
Bear defense has been
criticized for stopping offenses
by using overly aggressive
play. But make no mistake
about it, the Bear defense is
good it has held opponents
to an average of less than 300
yards a game total offense.
Walsh said the Cal defense is
"one of the best in the Western
part of the country."
As a team, though, the Bears
have been penalized nearly
twice as much as their oppo
nents or Stanford. "It hasn't
been anything that has con
cerned us," said Theder. "It
just makes us wonder if people
are looking closer at us."

once in the past seven years has the symbol of the Big Game been retained by a school for two years.
