## Benjamin assesses career 
### Richard Keller 
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in
touch with yourself, I feel that
helps alleviate a lot of tension.
When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per
form that well.
"You just sit there and
think," he said. "I don't chant
certain words or burn incense
or anything.
"I live at jasper Ridge in a
caretaker's house," he con
tinued. "I can get the same ef
fect by checking out all the
animals or just by looking at

what's happeningaround me."
Benjamin is a quiet person;
he would prefer to let his per
formances do his speaking for
him. He does not enjoy talking
to reporters, and he shows it.
He rarely comments on how he
feels about things. This inter
view is an exception.
Veteran San Francisco
Chronicle reporter Al Moss
elaborated.
He said, "Guy bothers a lot
of reporters because he is kind
of cocky and he's a little flip.
He doesn't want to waste his
time on what he doesn't con
sider important.
"It's a problem that a lot of
athletes for different reasons
have. Some reporters ask some
pretty dumb questions. But if
you're in the limelight you
have to expect the good and
the bad.
"Probably," continued
Moss, "he'll find out a lot of
writers take a guy on face
value. If they don't like a per
son, and the guy is doing
badly, some writers will un
consciously slant their stories.
That's human nature."
After hearing Moss' side of
the story, Benjamin said,
"When I'm dealing with repor
ters that ask stupid questions,
yes I'm cocky. Sometimes
they'll ask ridiculous questions
or the same questions week
after week.
"If they show some concern

for me as an individual and a
person, I'll treat them as an in
dividual and a person. If they
treat me as an object, I'll treat
them with disrespect. I react
the same way they treat me."
Benjamin commented on his
relations with Mike Cordova,
with whom Benjamin shared
the quarterback duties for
three seasons.
"We weren't friends simply
because we have different per
sonalities," he said. "He's said
a few words to me, but consid
ering everything, we got along
really well."
Added Benjamin, "The guy
has a hell of a lot of potential if
he could just be consistent."
Cordova is now on the in
jured reserve list of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
True, Benjamin was in
Hawaii as a hotel employe two
summers ago, while Cordova
was slaving away at Stanford.
But Benjamin would have dis
played the same dedication
had he felt staying on The Farm
would have improved his foot
ball.
"I didn't think there was any
advantage to sticking around,"
he said. "No one taught me a
thing about technique before
this year. I don't know what
reason he (Cordova) could
have had to stay at Stanford all
summer except to impress the
coaches."
