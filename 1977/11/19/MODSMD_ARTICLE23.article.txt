# Turmoil gone
## Benjamin assesses career 
### Richard Keller 
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in
touch with yourself, I feel that
helps alleviate a lot of tension.
When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per
form that well.
"You just sit there and
think," he said. "I don't chant
certain words or burn incense
or anything.
"I live at jasper Ridge in a
caretaker's house," he con
tinued. "I can get the same ef
fect by checking out all the
animals or just by looking at

what's happeningaround me."
Benjamin is a quiet person;
he would prefer to let his per
formances do his speaking for
him. He does not enjoy talking
to reporters, and he shows it.
He rarely comments on how he
feels about things. This inter
view is an exception.
Veteran San Francisco
Chronicle reporter Al Moss
elaborated.
He said, "Guy bothers a lot
of reporters because he is kind
of cocky and he's a little flip.
He doesn't want to waste his
time on what he doesn't con
sider important.
"It's a problem that a lot of
athletes for different reasons
have. Some reporters ask some
pretty dumb questions. But if
you're in the limelight you
have to expect the good and
the bad.
"Probably," continued
Moss, "he'll find out a lot of
writers take a guy on face
value. If they don't like a per
son, and the guy is doing
badly, some writers will un
consciously slant their stories.
That's human nature."
After hearing Moss' side of
the story, Benjamin said,
"When I'm dealing with repor
ters that ask stupid questions,
yes I'm cocky. Sometimes
they'll ask ridiculous questions
or the same questions week
after week.
"If they show some concern

for me as an individual and a
person, I'll treat them as an in
dividual and a person. If they
treat me as an object, I'll treat
them with disrespect. I react
the same way they treat me."
Benjamin commented on his
relations with Mike Cordova,
with whom Benjamin shared
the quarterback duties for
three seasons.
"We weren't friends simply
because we have different per
sonalities," he said. "He's said
a few words to me, but consid
ering everything, we got along
really well."
Added Benjamin, "The guy
has a hell of a lot of potential if
he could just be consistent."
Cordova is now on the in
jured reserve list of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
True, Benjamin was in
Hawaii as a hotel employe two
summers ago, while Cordova
was slaving away at Stanford.
But Benjamin would have dis
played the same dedication
had he felt staying on The Farm
would have improved his foot
ball.
"I didn't think there was any
advantage to sticking around,"
he said. "No one taught me a
thing about technique before
this year. I don't know what
reason he (Cordova) could
have had to stay at Stanford all
summer except to impress the
coaches."
One thing that never con
cerned Benjamin was impres
sing the old coaching regime.
He was almost bitter espe
cially towards offensive coor
dinator Pete Kettela.
"He (Kettela) can't or doesn't
have the personality to relate
to the players," Benjamin said.
"I would say Pete Kettela was
the one reason I never played
here until this year. More so
than Jack Christiansen. I never

had a personality conflict with
coach Chris at all," Benjamin
said.
Rod Dowhower has replaced
Kettela. Benjamin couldn't be
happier.
"I've never had any
technique that someone's
taught me until this year," reit
erated Benjamin. "Jack Christ
iansen and Pete Kettela cer
tainly didn't. And in the L.A.
city system they allowed two
coaches, one for offense and

one for defense. They didn't
have time to teach me."
"Rod Dowhower has spent
so many hours teaching me
certain techniques," said Ben
jamin. "He's always available.
I'd meet with him at 6:30 every
night.(in the summer) and
work out for two hours. He'd
even bring his family up and
take us to Jack in the Box.
"Dowhower hasn't got a lot
of credit," added Benjamin.
"But I feel he's made James
Lofton. And he's given me
something I can use the rest of
my football career."
Benjamin and head coach
Bill Walsh aren't as close as the
gifted quarterback would like.
"We don't have that much
contact," remarked Benjamin.
"Most of my dealings are with
Dowhower. I would have liked
to have been coached by him
more, but that's not the way it's
structured. Rod gets Bill's
ideas, combines with his own
and passes them to me.
"Ideally I would like to have
him do it (talk with the players
individually) all the time. It
would help me personally in
my career. But I'm just being
greedy by saying that," said
Benjamin.
Supporting cast
Following this season, Ben
jamin will be the most accurate
career passer in Pacific-8 con
ference history, and will be
among the leaders in total of

fense. Without a superlative
corps of receivers and a tough
offensive line, his statistics
wouldn't be nearly as impres
sive.
"James (Lofton) and Tony
(Hill) are two really good
athletes who are really fast,"
Benjamin said. "I think James
has the potential to be much
better than Tony (who now
plays for Dallas) because he
has better natural ability.
"One fault James has,
though, is he gets a little tied
up with the defensive backs.
He's more concerned about
where the defensive backs are
than letting them worry about
him. But he's improved tre
mendously over last year in
that respect.
"James is a team player," he
continued. "Tony was really
selfish. He was always worried
about how many receptions he
had. I don't blame Tony, be
cause the situation at the time
was not an atmosphere that
was conducive to winning.
There were not good relations
between the players and the
coaches. We never did sit
down and discuss. The team
was going nowhere and he
could go somewhere."
According to the 6-foot-4,
220 lb. signal caller, Stanford's
offensive line has been
"super" this fall.
"I had some reservations at
the beginning of the year," he

said, "but (offensive line
coach) Doug Single has done a
tremendous job with them.
When I get sacked it's usually
not due to the offensive line.
It's a receiver slipping or a de
fensive back covering a re
ceiver."
Stanford football teams have
always had a reputation for up
setting favored opponents and
losing or nearly losing to as
sorted impotent rivals.
"It's because there are not a
lot of true football players at
Stanford," said Benjamin. "A
true football player is one who
lives, breaths, and dies football
one who has almost animal
characteristics. He goes

jamin has the leadership qualities - and the talent - to make the grade
in professional football.
bullshit every game. You have
players like that at Michigan,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and
Texas.
"You don't have that at Stan
ford at all. It's not good if you
want to win consistently year
after year. But we have proven
that you can have a good team
that does well in league play
and goes to the Rose Bowl
without that kind of player.
Stanford's No. 7 is probably
the best at his position in col
lege football. Yet he feels he
needs to be more "disci
plined."
"I've thrown seven intercep
tions in the last two games,"
remarked Benjamin. "What
sometimes happens is you
don't see the guy. But mostly,
I'll get greedy. James Lofton
makes so many great catches,
I'll go ahead and take the
chance.
"I also take a lot of short
cuts," he said. "That's what
happened against USC. The
progression is from primary
receiver to secondary receiver
to the back outlet. Ideally
you're supposed to go in that

order.
"But if you go through your
progression and dump it off to
your outlet you'll get the shit
knocked out of you. There
fore, in the (JSC game I came
outthinking secondary, outlet.
"It taught me never to leave
the progression," he con
cluded. "It's all discipline. The
ability is there."
Walsh said Benjamin is "very
perceptive and full of fun. You
might say he's a little intro
verted. He's embarrassed to sit
down and talk about Guy Ben
jamin. I don't know if he knows
exactly how to handle those
situations."
Relaxed
Being so relaxed on the field,
it appears that Benjamin
doesn't care. After a
touchdown, he'll bow his
head, look away from the
players and walk off. If he gets
sacked, the same procedure
applies.
Walsh said, "That's the way
he carries himself. Some
people look very intense, but
most of the great quarterbacks
are sort of like Benjamin. You
have to be relaxed. Like in
baseball, if a pitcher gives up a

home run, he can't get all ex
cited because the next one
could be a home run too.
"Benjamin and (Oakland
quarterback Ken) Stabler are
alike in their personalities,"
Walsh said. "Oakland will have
some big play and Stabler's
staring off into space. They you
can look at some rookie quar
terback and he'll be jumping
up and down when the team
does well.
"Stabler had a hard time
dealing with the press his first
couple of years, too," Walsh
added.
Unlike past years, Benjamin
is really caught up in the Big
Game atmosphere.
Remarked Benjamin, "It
hasn't at all been a 'big' game
before. This time it's different.
Most importantly it's my last
game. I really have strong feel
ings. I'll never have a chance to
be with everybody in the same
situation again. I really want to
have a good feeling when I
come off the field, and the only
way I think I can feel that way is
to win."
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in

When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per

Stanford's No. 7 is probably
the best at his position in col

down and talk about Guy Ben

Relaxed
Being so relaxed on the field,
it appears that Benjamin
doesn't care. After a
touchdown, he'll bow his
head, look away from the
players and walk off. If he gets
sacked, the same procedure
applies.
Walsh said, "That's the way
he carries himself. Some
people look very intense, but
most of the great quarterbacks
are sort of like Benjamin. You
have to be relaxed. Like in
baseball, if a pitcher gives up a

home run, he can't get all ex
cited because the next one
could be a home run too.
"Benjamin and (Oakland
quarterback Ken) Stabler are
alike in their personalities,"
Walsh said. "Oakland will have
some big play and Stabler's
staring off into space. They you
can look at some rookie quar
terback and he'll be jumping
up and down when the team
does well.
"Stabler had a hard time
dealing with the press his first
couple of years, too," Walsh
added.
Unlike past years, Benjamin
is really caught up in the Big
Game atmosphere.
Remarked Benjamin, "It
hasn't at all been a 'big' game
before. This time it's different.
Most importantly it's my last
game. I really have strong feel
ings. I'll never have a chance to
be with everybody in the same
situation again. I really want to
have a good feeling when I
come off the field, and the only
way I think I can feel that way is
to win."
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in
touch with yourself, I feel that
helps alleviate a lot of tension.
When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per
form that well.
"You just sit there and
think," he said. "I don't chant
certain words or burn incense
or anything.
"I live at jasper Ridge in a
caretaker's house," he con
tinued. "I can get the same ef
fect by checking out all the
animals or just by looking at

what's happeningaround me."
Benjamin is a quiet person;
he would prefer to let his per
formances do his speaking for
him. He does not enjoy talking
to reporters, and he shows it.
He rarely comments on how he
feels about things. This inter
view is an exception.
Veteran San Francisco
Chronicle reporter Al Moss
elaborated.
He said, "Guy bothers a lot
of reporters because he is kind
of cocky and he's a little flip.
He doesn't want to waste his
time on what he doesn't con
sider important.
"It's a problem that a lot of
athletes for different reasons
have. Some reporters ask some
pretty dumb questions. But if
you're in the limelight you
have to expect the good and
the bad.
"Probably," continued
Moss, "he'll find out a lot of
writers take a guy on face
value. If they don't like a per
son, and the guy is doing
badly, some writers will un
consciously slant their stories.
That's human nature."
After hearing Moss' side of
the story, Benjamin said,
"When I'm dealing with repor
ters that ask stupid questions,
yes I'm cocky. Sometimes
they'll ask ridiculous questions
or the same questions week
after week.
"If they show some concern

for me as an individual and a
person, I'll treat them as an in
dividual and a person. If they
treat me as an object, I'll treat
them with disrespect. I react
the same way they treat me."
Benjamin commented on his
relations with Mike Cordova,
with whom Benjamin shared
the quarterback duties for
three seasons.
"We weren't friends simply
because we have different per
sonalities," he said. "He's said
a few words to me, but consid
ering everything, we got along
really well."
Added Benjamin, "The guy
has a hell of a lot of potential if
he could just be consistent."
Cordova is now on the in
jured reserve list of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
True, Benjamin was in
Hawaii as a hotel employe two
summers ago, while Cordova
was slaving away at Stanford.
But Benjamin would have dis
played the same dedication
had he felt staying on The Farm
would have improved his foot
ball.
"I didn't think there was any
advantage to sticking around,"
he said. "No one taught me a
thing about technique before
this year. I don't know what
reason he (Cordova) could
have had to stay at Stanford all
summer except to impress the
coaches."
One thing that never con
cerned Benjamin was impres
sing the old coaching regime.
He was almost bitter espe
cially towards offensive coor
dinator Pete Kettela.
"He (Kettela) can't or doesn't
have the personality to relate
to the players," Benjamin said.
"I would say Pete Kettela was
the one reason I never played
here until this year. More so
than Jack Christiansen. I never

had a personality conflict with
coach Chris at all," Benjamin
said.
Rod Dowhower has replaced
Kettela. Benjamin couldn't be
happier.
"I've never had any
technique that someone's
taught me until this year," reit
erated Benjamin. "Jack Christ
iansen and Pete Kettela cer
tainly didn't. And in the L.A.
city system they allowed two
coaches, one for offense and

one for defense. They didn't
have time to teach me."
"Rod Dowhower has spent
so many hours teaching me
certain techniques," said Ben
jamin. "He's always available.
I'd meet with him at 6:30 every
night.(in the summer) and
work out for two hours. He'd
even bring his family up and
take us to Jack in the Box.
"Dowhower hasn't got a lot
of credit," added Benjamin.
"But I feel he's made James
Lofton. And he's given me
something I can use the rest of
my football career."
Benjamin and head coach
Bill Walsh aren't as close as the
gifted quarterback would like.
"We don't have that much
contact," remarked Benjamin.
"Most of my dealings are with
Dowhower. I would have liked
to have been coached by him
more, but that's not the way it's
structured. Rod gets Bill's
ideas, combines with his own
and passes them to me.
"Ideally I would like to have
him do it (talk with the players
individually) all the time. It
would help me personally in
my career. But I'm just being
greedy by saying that," said
Benjamin.
Supporting cast
Following this season, Ben
jamin will be the most accurate
career passer in Pacific-8 con
ference history, and will be
among the leaders in total of

fense. Without a superlative
corps of receivers and a tough
offensive line, his statistics
wouldn't be nearly as impres
sive.
"James (Lofton) and Tony
(Hill) are two really good
athletes who are really fast,"
Benjamin said. "I think James
has the potential to be much
better than Tony (who now
plays for Dallas) because he
has better natural ability.
"One fault James has,
though, is he gets a little tied
up with the defensive backs.
He's more concerned about
where the defensive backs are
than letting them worry about
him. But he's improved tre
mendously over last year in
that respect.
"James is a team player," he
continued. "Tony was really
selfish. He was always worried
about how many receptions he
had. I don't blame Tony, be
cause the situation at the time
was not an atmosphere that
was conducive to winning.
There were not good relations
between the players and the
coaches. We never did sit
down and discuss. The team
was going nowhere and he
could go somewhere."
According to the 6-foot-4,
220 lb. signal caller, Stanford's
offensive line has been
"super" this fall.
"I had some reservations at
the beginning of the year," he

said, "but (offensive line
coach) Doug Single has done a
tremendous job with them.
When I get sacked it's usually
not due to the offensive line.
It's a receiver slipping or a de
fensive back covering a re
ceiver."
Stanford football teams have
always had a reputation for up
setting favored opponents and
losing or nearly losing to as
sorted impotent rivals.
"It's because there are not a
lot of true football players at
Stanford," said Benjamin. "A
true football player is one who
lives, breaths, and dies football
one who has almost animal
characteristics. He goes

of credit," added Benjamin.
"But I feel he's made James
Lofton. And he's given me
something I can use the rest of
my football career."
Benjamin and head coach
Bill Walsh aren't as close as the
gifted quarterback would like.
"We don't have that much
contact," remarked Benjamin.
"Most of my dealings are with
Dowhower. I would have liked

"Ideally I would like to have
him do it (talk with the players

greedy by saying that," said

Following this season, Ben

career passer in Pacific-8 con

among the leaders in total of

fense. Without a superlative
corps of receivers and a tough
offensive line, his statistics
wouldn't be nearly as impres

"James (Lofton) and Tony

athletes who are really fast,"
Benjamin said. "I think James
has the potential to be much
better than Tony (who now

"One fault James has,
though, is he gets a little tied

He's more concerned about
where the defensive backs are

that respect.
"James is a team player," he
continued. "Tony was really
selfish. He was always worried
about how many receptions he
had. I don't blame Tony, be

There were not good relations

According to the 6-foot-4,

Stanford's No. 7 is probably
the best at his position in col

Relaxed
Being so relaxed on the field,
it appears that Benjamin
doesn't care. After a
touchdown, he'll bow his
head, look away from the
players and walk off. If he gets
sacked, the same procedure
applies.
Walsh said, "That's the way
he carries himself. Some
people look very intense, but
most of the great quarterbacks
are sort of like Benjamin. You
have to be relaxed. Like in
baseball, if a pitcher gives up a

home run, he can't get all ex
cited because the next one
could be a home run too.
"Benjamin and (Oakland
quarterback Ken) Stabler are
alike in their personalities,"
Walsh said. "Oakland will have
some big play and Stabler's
staring off into space. They you
can look at some rookie quar
terback and he'll be jumping
up and down when the team
does well.
"Stabler had a hard time
dealing with the press his first
couple of years, too," Walsh
added.
Unlike past years, Benjamin
is really caught up in the Big
Game atmosphere.
Remarked Benjamin, "It
hasn't at all been a 'big' game
before. This time it's different.
Most importantly it's my last
game. I really have strong feel
ings. I'll never have a chance to
be with everybody in the same
situation again. I really want to
have a good feeling when I
come off the field, and the only
way I think I can feel that way is
to win."
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in
touch with yourself, I feel that
helps alleviate a lot of tension.
When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per
form that well.
"You just sit there and
think," he said. "I don't chant
certain words or burn incense
or anything.
"I live at jasper Ridge in a
caretaker's house," he con
tinued. "I can get the same ef

animals or just by looking at

Benjamin is a quiet person;
he would prefer to let his per
formances do his speaking for
him. He does not enjoy talking
to reporters, and he shows it.
He rarely comments on how he
feels about things. This inter
view is an exception.
Veteran San Francisco
Chronicle reporter Al Moss
elaborated.
He said, "Guy bothers a lot
of reporters because he is kind
of cocky and he's a little flip.
He doesn't want to waste his
time on what he doesn't con
sider important.
"It's a problem that a lot of
athletes for different reasons
have. Some reporters ask some
pretty dumb questions. But if
you're in the limelight you
have to expect the good and
the bad.
"Probably," continued
Moss, "he'll find out a lot of
writers take a guy on face
value. If they don't like a per
son, and the guy is doing
badly, some writers will un
consciously slant their stories.
That's human nature."
After hearing Moss' side of
the story, Benjamin said,
"When I'm dealing with repor
ters that ask stupid questions,
yes I'm cocky. Sometimes
they'll ask ridiculous questions
or the same questions week
after week.
"If they show some concern

for me as an individual and a
person, I'll treat them as an in
dividual and a person. If they
treat me as an object, I'll treat
them with disrespect. I react
the same way they treat me."
Benjamin commented on his
relations with Mike Cordova,
with whom Benjamin shared
the quarterback duties for
three seasons.
"We weren't friends simply
because we have different per
sonalities," he said. "He's said
a few words to me, but consid
ering everything, we got along
really well."
Added Benjamin, "The guy
has a hell of a lot of potential if
he could just be consistent."
Cordova is now on the in
jured reserve list of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
True, Benjamin was in
Hawaii as a hotel employe two
summers ago, while Cordova
was slaving away at Stanford.
But Benjamin would have dis
played the same dedication
had he felt staying on The Farm
would have improved his foot
ball.
"I didn't think there was any
advantage to sticking around,"
he said. "No one taught me a
thing about technique before
this year. I don't know what
reason he (Cordova) could
have had to stay at Stanford all
summer except to impress the
coaches."
One thing that never con
cerned Benjamin was impres
sing the old coaching regime.
He was almost bitter espe
cially towards offensive coor
dinator Pete Kettela.
"He (Kettela) can't or doesn't
have the personality to relate
to the players," Benjamin said.
"I would say Pete Kettela was
the one reason I never played
here until this year. More so
than Jack Christiansen. I never

had a personality conflict with
coach Chris at all," Benjamin
said.
Rod Dowhower has replaced
Kettela. Benjamin couldn't be
happier.
"I've never had any
technique that someone's
taught me until this year," reit
erated Benjamin. "Jack Christ
iansen and Pete Kettela cer
tainly didn't. And in the L.A.
city system they allowed two
coaches, one for offense and

one for defense. They didn't
have time to teach me."
"Rod Dowhower has spent
so many hours teaching me
certain techniques," said Ben
jamin. "He's always available.
I'd meet with him at 6:30 every
night.(in the summer) and
work out for two hours. He'd
even bring his family up and

sider important.
"It's a problem that a lot of
athletes for different reasons
have. Some reporters ask some
pretty dumb questions. But if
you're in the limelight you
have to expect the good and
the bad.
"Probably," continued
Moss, "he'll find out a lot of
writers take a guy on face
value. If they don't like a per
son, and the guy is doing
badly, some writers will un
consciously slant their stories.
That's human nature."
After hearing Moss' side of
the story, Benjamin said,
"When I'm dealing with repor
ters that ask stupid questions,
yes I'm cocky. Sometimes
they'll ask ridiculous questions
or the same questions week
after week.
"If they show some concern

for me as an individual and a
person, I'll treat them as an in
dividual and a person. If they
treat me as an object, I'll treat
them with disrespect. I react
the same way they treat me."
Benjamin commented on his
relations with Mike Cordova,
with whom Benjamin shared
the quarterback duties for
three seasons.
"We weren't friends simply
because we have different per
sonalities," he said. "He's said
a few words to me, but consid
ering everything, we got along
really well."
Added Benjamin, "The guy
has a hell of a lot of potential if
he could just be consistent."
Cordova is now on the in
jured reserve list of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
True, Benjamin was in
Hawaii as a hotel employe two
summers ago, while Cordova
was slaving away at Stanford.
But Benjamin would have dis
played the same dedication
had he felt staying on The Farm
would have improved his foot
ball.
"I didn't think there was any
advantage to sticking around,"
he said. "No one taught me a
thing about technique before
this year. I don't know what
reason he (Cordova) could
have had to stay at Stanford all
summer except to impress the
coaches."
One thing that never con
cerned Benjamin was impres
sing the old coaching regime.
He was almost bitter espe
cially towards offensive coor
dinator Pete Kettela.
"He (Kettela) can't or doesn't
have the personality to relate
to the players," Benjamin said.
"I would say Pete Kettela was
the one reason I never played
here until this year. More so
than Jack Christiansen. I never

had a personality conflict with
coach Chris at all," Benjamin
said.
Rod Dowhower has replaced
Kettela. Benjamin couldn't be
happier.
"I've never had any
technique that someone's
taught me until this year," reit
erated Benjamin. "Jack Christ
iansen and Pete Kettela cer
tainly didn't. And in the L.A.
city system they allowed two
coaches, one for offense and

one for defense. They didn't
have time to teach me."
"Rod Dowhower has spent
so many hours teaching me
certain techniques," said Ben
jamin. "He's always available.
I'd meet with him at 6:30 every
night.(in the summer) and
work out for two hours. He'd
even bring his family up and
take us to Jack in the Box.
"Dowhower hasn't got a lot
of credit," added Benjamin.
"But I feel he's made James
Lofton. And he's given me
something I can use the rest of
my football career."
Benjamin and head coach
Bill Walsh aren't as close as the
gifted quarterback would like.
"We don't have that much
contact," remarked Benjamin.
"Most of my dealings are with
Dowhower. I would have liked
to have been coached by him
more, but that's not the way it's
structured. Rod gets Bill's
ideas, combines with his own
and passes them to me.
"Ideally I would like to have
him do it (talk with the players
individually) all the time. It
would help me personally in
my career. But I'm just being
greedy by saying that," said
Benjamin.
Supporting cast
Following this season, Ben
jamin will be the most accurate
career passer in Pacific-8 con
ference history, and will be
among the leaders in total of

fense. Without a superlative
corps of receivers and a tough
offensive line, his statistics
wouldn't be nearly as impres
sive.
"James (Lofton) and Tony
(Hill) are two really good
athletes who are really fast,"
Benjamin said. "I think James
has the potential to be much
better than Tony (who now
plays for Dallas) because he
has better natural ability.
"One fault James has,
though, is he gets a little tied
up with the defensive backs.
He's more concerned about
where the defensive backs are
than letting them worry about
him. But he's improved tre
mendously over last year in
that respect.
"James is a team player," he
continued. "Tony was really
selfish. He was always worried
about how many receptions he
had. I don't blame Tony, be
cause the situation at the time
was not an atmosphere that
was conducive to winning.
There were not good relations
between the players and the
coaches. We never did sit
down and discuss. The team
was going nowhere and he
could go somewhere."
According to the 6-foot-4,
220 lb. signal caller, Stanford's
offensive line has been
"super" this fall.
"I had some reservations at
the beginning of the year," he

said, "but (offensive line
coach) Doug Single has done a
tremendous job with them.
When I get sacked it's usually
not due to the offensive line.
It's a receiver slipping or a de
fensive back covering a re
ceiver."
Stanford football teams have
always had a reputation for up
setting favored opponents and
losing or nearly losing to as
sorted impotent rivals.
"It's because there are not a
lot of true football players at
Stanford," said Benjamin. "A
true football player is one who
lives, breaths, and dies football

Stanford's No. 7 is probably
the best at his position in col

needs to be more "disci

down and talk about Guy Ben
jamin. I don't know if he knows
exactly how to handle those
situations."
Relaxed
Being so relaxed on the field,
it appears that Benjamin
doesn't care. After a
touchdown, he'll bow his
head, look away from the
players and walk off. If he gets
sacked, the same procedure
applies.
Walsh said, "That's the way
he carries himself. Some
people look very intense, but
most of the great quarterbacks
are sort of like Benjamin. You
have to be relaxed. Like in
baseball, if a pitcher gives up a

home run, he can't get all ex
cited because the next one
could be a home run too.
"Benjamin and (Oakland
quarterback Ken) Stabler are
alike in their personalities,"
Walsh said. "Oakland will have
some big play and Stabler's
staring off into space. They you
can look at some rookie quar
terback and he'll be jumping
up and down when the team
does well.
"Stabler had a hard time
dealing with the press his first
couple of years, too," Walsh
added.
Unlike past years, Benjamin
is really caught up in the Big
Game atmosphere.
Remarked Benjamin, "It
hasn't at all been a 'big' game
before. This time it's different.
Most importantly it's my last
game. I really have strong feel
ings. I'll never have a chance to
be with everybody in the same
situation again. I really want to
have a good feeling when I
come off the field, and the only
way I think I can feel that way is
to win."
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in
touch with yourself, I feel that
helps alleviate a lot of tension.
When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per
form that well.
"You just sit there and
think," he said. "I don't chant
certain words or burn incense
or anything.
"I live at jasper Ridge in a
caretaker's house," he con
tinued. "I can get the same ef
fect by checking out all the
animals or just by looking at

what's happeningaround me."
Benjamin is a quiet person;
he would prefer to let his per
formances do his speaking for
him. He does not enjoy talking
to reporters, and he shows it.
He rarely comments on how he
feels about things. This inter
view is an exception.
Veteran San Francisco
Chronicle reporter Al Moss
elaborated.
He said, "Guy bothers a lot
of reporters because he is kind
of cocky and he's a little flip.

applies.
Walsh said, "That's the way
he carries himself. Some
people look very intense, but
most of the great quarterbacks
are sort of like Benjamin. You
have to be relaxed. Like in
baseball, if a pitcher gives up a

home run, he can't get all ex
cited because the next one
could be a home run too.
"Benjamin and (Oakland
quarterback Ken) Stabler are
alike in their personalities,"
Walsh said. "Oakland will have
some big play and Stabler's
staring off into space. They you
can look at some rookie quar
terback and he'll be jumping
up and down when the team
does well.
"Stabler had a hard time
dealing with the press his first
couple of years, too," Walsh
added.
Unlike past years, Benjamin
is really caught up in the Big
Game atmosphere.
Remarked Benjamin, "It
hasn't at all been a 'big' game
before. This time it's different.
Most importantly it's my last
game. I really have strong feel
ings. I'll never have a chance to
be with everybody in the same
situation again. I really want to
have a good feeling when I
come off the field, and the only
way I think I can feel that way is
to win."
Everyone recognizes Guy
Benjamin. Few people know
him.
That's the way Benjamin
wants it, but misunderstand
ings arise from his reticence.
"I really like anonymity,"
said Stanford's reluctant star
quarterback. "Publicity almost
creates an adverse effect in me.
Rather than to go out and be
accosted (at parties, etc.) I'll sit
at home.
"I don't react hostile to it,"
Benjamin continued. "I sort of
accept it. But I'd rather be
without it.
"I think my family enjoys my
accomplishments as much or
more than I do. I never did like
publicity."
One way Benjamin achieves
his privacy is through his own
form of meditation.
He said, "If you can take 15
minutes and totally get in
touch with yourself, I feel that
helps alleviate a lot of tension.
When you're tense and have a
lot of adrenalin flowing in any
fashion of life you don't per
form that well.
"You just sit there and
think," he said. "I don't chant
certain words or burn incense
or anything.
"I live at jasper Ridge in a
caretaker's house," he con
tinued. "I can get the same ef

animals or just by looking at

Benjamin is a quiet person;
he would prefer to let his per
formances do his speaking for
him. He does not enjoy talking
to reporters, and he shows it.
He rarely comments on how he
feels about things. This inter
view is an exception.
Veteran San Francisco
Chronicle reporter Al Moss
elaborated.
He said, "Guy bothers a lot
of reporters because he is kind
of cocky and he's a little flip.
He doesn't want to waste his
time on what he doesn't con
sider important.
"It's a problem that a lot of
athletes for different reasons
have. Some reporters ask some
pretty dumb questions. But if
you're in the limelight you
have to expect the good and
the bad.
"Probably," continued
Moss, "he'll find out a lot of
writers take a guy on face
value. If they don't like a per
son, and the guy is doing
badly, some writers will un
consciously slant their stories.
That's human nature."
After hearing Moss' side of
the story, Benjamin said,
"When I'm dealing with repor
ters that ask stupid questions,
yes I'm cocky. Sometimes
they'll ask ridiculous questions
or the same questions week
after week.
"If they show some concern

for me as an individual and a
person, I'll treat them as an in
dividual and a person. If they
treat me as an object, I'll treat
them with disrespect. I react
the same way they treat me."
Benjamin commented on his
relations with Mike Cordova,
with whom Benjamin shared
the quarterback duties for
three seasons.
"We weren't friends simply
because we have different per
sonalities," he said. "He's said
a few words to me, but consid
ering everything, we got along
really well."
Added Benjamin, "The guy
has a hell of a lot of potential if
he could just be consistent."
Cordova is now on the in
jured reserve list of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
True, Benjamin was in
Hawaii as a hotel employe two
summers ago, while Cordova
was slaving away at Stanford.
But Benjamin would have dis
played the same dedication
had he felt staying on The Farm
would have improved his foot
ball.
"I didn't think there was any
advantage to sticking around,"
he said. "No one taught me a
thing about technique before
this year. I don't know what
reason he (Cordova) could
have had to stay at Stanford all
summer except to impress the
coaches."
One thing that never con
cerned Benjamin was impres
sing the old coaching regime.
He was almost bitter espe
cially towards offensive coor
dinator Pete Kettela.
"He (Kettela) can't or doesn't
have the personality to relate
to the players," Benjamin said.
"I would say Pete Kettela was
the one reason I never played
here until this year. More so
than Jack Christiansen. I never

had a personality conflict with
coach Chris at all," Benjamin
said.
Rod Dowhower has replaced
Kettela. Benjamin couldn't be
happier.
"I've never had any
technique that someone's
taught me until this year," reit
erated Benjamin. "Jack Christ
iansen and Pete Kettela cer
tainly didn't. And in the L.A.
city system they allowed two
coaches, one for offense and

one for defense. They didn't
have time to teach me."
"Rod Dowhower has spent
so many hours teaching me
certain techniques," said Ben
jamin. "He's always available.
I'd meet with him at 6:30 every
night.(in the summer) and
work out for two hours. He'd
even bring his family up and
take us to Jack in the Box.
"Dowhower hasn't got a lot
of credit," added Benjamin.
"But I feel he's made James
Lofton. And he's given me
something I can use the rest of
my football career."
Benjamin and head coach
Bill Walsh aren't as close as the
gifted quarterback would like.
"We don't have that much
contact," remarked Benjamin.
"Most of my dealings are with
Dowhower. I would have liked
to have been coached by him
more, but that's not the way it's

ideas, combines with his own
and passes them to me.
"Ideally I would like to have
him do it (talk with the players
individually) all the time. It
would help me personally in
my career. But I'm just being
greedy by saying that," said
Benjamin.

Following this season, Ben
jamin will be the most accurate
career passer in Pacific-8 con
ference history, and will be
among the leaders in total of

fense. Without a superlative
corps of receivers and a tough
offensive line, his statistics
wouldn't be nearly as impres
sive.
"James (Lofton) and Tony
(Hill) are two really good
athletes who are really fast,"
Benjamin said. "I think James
has the potential to be much
better than Tony (who now
plays for Dallas) because he
has better natural ability.
"One fault James has,
though, is he gets a little tied
up with the defensive backs.
He's more concerned about
where the defensive backs are
than letting them worry about
him. But he's improved tre
mendously over last year in
that respect.
"James is a team player," he
continued. "Tony was really
selfish. He was always worried
about how many receptions he
had. I don't blame Tony, be
cause the situation at the time
was not an atmosphere that
was conducive to winning.
There were not good relations
between the players and the
coaches. We never did sit
down and discuss. The team
was going nowhere and he
could go somewhere."
According to the 6-foot-4,
220 lb. signal caller, Stanford's
offensive line has been
"super" this fall.
"I had some reservations at
the beginning of the year," he

said, "but (offensive line
coach) Doug Single has done a
tremendous job with them.
When I get sacked it's usually
not due to the offensive line.
It's a receiver slipping or a de
fensive back covering a re
ceiver."
Stanford football teams have
always had a reputation for up
setting favored opponents and
losing or nearly losing to as
sorted impotent rivals.
"It's because there are not a
lot of true football players at
Stanford," said Benjamin. "A
true football player is one who
lives, breaths, and dies football
one who has almost animal

Stanford's No. 7 is probably
the best at his position in col

"I've thrown seven intercep

remarked Benjamin. "What

I'll get greedy. James Lofton
makes so many great catches,
I'll go ahead and take the

"I also take a lot of short

"James is a team player," he
continued. "Tony was really
selfish. He was always worried
about how many receptions he
had. I don't blame Tony, be
cause the situation at the time
was not an atmosphere that
was conducive to winning.
There were not good relations
between the players and the
coaches. We never did sit
down and discuss. The team
was going nowhere and he
could go somewhere."
According to the 6-foot-4,
220 lb. signal caller, Stanford's
offensive line has been
"super" this fall.
"I had some reservations at
the beginning of the year," he

said, "but (offensive line
coach) Doug Single has done a
tremendous job with them.
When I get sacked it's usually
not due to the offensive line.
It's a receiver slipping or a de
fensive back covering a re
ceiver."
Stanford football teams have
always had a reputation for up
setting favored opponents and
losing or nearly losing to as
sorted impotent rivals.
"It's because there are not a
lot of true football players at
Stanford," said Benjamin. "A
true football player is one who
lives, breaths, and dies football
one who has almost animal
characteristics. He goes

Coaches and pro scouts have said that Stanford quarterback Guy Ben
jamin has the leadership qualities - and the talent - to make the grade
in professional football.
bullshit every game. You have
players like that at Michigan,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and
Texas.
"You don't have that at Stan
ford at all. It's not good if you
want to win consistently year
after year. But we have proven
that you can have a good team
that does well in league play
and goes to the Rose Bowl
without that kind of player.
Stanford's No. 7 is probably
the best at his position in col
lege football. Yet he feels he
needs to be more "disci
plined."
"I've thrown seven intercep
tions in the last two games,"
remarked Benjamin. "What
sometimes happens is you
don't see the guy. But mostly,
I'll get greedy. James Lofton
makes so many great catches,
I'll go ahead and take the
chance.
"I also take a lot of short
cuts," he said. "That's what
happened against USC. The
progression is from primary
receiver to secondary receiver
to the back outlet. Ideally
you're supposed to go in that

order.
"But if you go through your
progression and dump it off to
your outlet you'll get the shit
knocked out of you. There

outthinking secondary, outlet.
"It taught me never to leave
the progression," he con
cluded. "It's all discipline. The
ability is there."
Walsh said Benjamin is "very
perceptive and full of fun. You
might say he's a little intro
verted. He's embarrassed to sit
down and talk about Guy Ben
jamin. I don't know if he knows
exactly how to handle those
situations."
Relaxed
Being so relaxed on the field,
it appears that Benjamin
doesn't care. After a
touchdown, he'll bow his
head, look away from the
players and walk off. If he gets
sacked, the same procedure
applies.
Walsh said, "That's the way
he carries himself. Some
people look very intense, but
most of the great quarterbacks
are sort of like Benjamin. You
have to be relaxed. Like in
baseball, if a pitcher gives up a

home run, he can't get all ex
cited because the next one
could be a home run too.
"Benjamin and (Oakland
quarterback Ken) Stabler are
alike in their personalities,"
Walsh said. "Oakland will have
some big play and Stabler's
staring off into space. They you
can look at some rookie quar
terback and he'll be jumping
up and down when the team
does well.
"Stabler had a hard time
dealing with the press his first
couple of years, too," Walsh
added.
Unlike past years, Benjamin
is really caught up in the Big
Game atmosphere.
Remarked Benjamin, "It
hasn't at all been a 'big' game
before. This time it's different.
Most importantly it's my last
game. I really have strong feel
ings. I'll never have a chance to
be with everybody in the same
situation again. I really want to
have a good feeling when I
come off the field, and the only
way I think I can feel that way is
to win."
