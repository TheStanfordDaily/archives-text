# 'Very aggressive'
## Freitas looks to pros 
### Ben Webster 
The Big Game used to be
played in Visalia, Calif. at
least for George Freitas, whose
Redwood High School team
always played its last football
game against arch enemy Mt.
Whitney in "about the biggest
rivalry around."
But that was before Freitas,
now playing his fourth year as
California's tight end, had
heard of Oski the Bear or the
Stanford Axe.
In fact, "I'd never even heard
of Cal until I was recruited my
senior year," recalled Freitas,
whose hometown of Visalia in
the San Joaquin Valley barely
has more people than Berkeley
has students.
Prep All-American Freitas,
who also starred in basketball
and baseball, led his grid team
to a 12-0 record and the Valley
Conference crown in 1973.
"During my senior year, I
quickly narrowed down my
scholarship interests to Cal and
UCLA because of the friendly
atmospheres and the decent
people," Freigas said. "I finally
came here because I thought
the Cal offense was more in
clined to throw me a lot of pas
ses."

One hundred and four, to be
exact, with his 44 catches for
the season putting him fifth in
the Pacific-8 in receiving, first
among the conference's tight
ends. Four of Freitas' catches
have gone for touchdowns in
the Bears' 10 games.
"I don't mind hitting. In fact,
I like to block a lot," Freitas
said. "But the best part is catch
ing the ball. I guess it's the mix
ture of blocking and receiving
that makes my position in
teresting to me."
And to a lot of other people
as well.
"He's a very aggressive
about getting to the ball," said

Stanford assistant coach
George Seifert. "We've
watched other teams try all
sorts of things to bottle him up,
and he's always been nifty and
knowledgeable enough to get
clear. The quarterbacks seem
to have great faith in this abil
ity, waiting confidently for him
to break open."
The best?
Cal's assistant coach, Roger
Theder, lauded Freitas with a
bit more praise: "In my mind,
George is the finest all-around
tight end in the nation."
Theder said Freitas excels in
blocking, reading coverage,
catching the ball, and running
with it. "He's so darn smart
he's like a coach out on the
field. His best strength is being
able to adjust to any situation.
But he just doesn't fit a compu
ter."
Freitas received All Pac-8
Honorable Mention for his
sophomore and junior per
formances, "an insult to his
skills," says the 1977 California
Media Guide.)

"Because he doesn't have
4.6 speed and he's not 6'5","
Theder said, "a lot of people
tend to ignore him." "N

But not the professional
football scouts. "He's exactly
like (ex-Stanford star) Bob
Moore," Gil Brandt, vice pres
ident of the Dallas Cowboys
said, agreeing with head Cal
coach Mike White. "Great
strength, great hands, and
great concentration," con
tinued Brandt's evaluation.
The admiration seems to be
mutual; Freitas would like no
thing better than to play on the
NFL grid. "Right now the main
thing I'm considering in the fu
ture is pro ball," said the
sociology major.
Freitas and his wife Gail live

in an apartment complex a
block from Cal's Memorial
Stadium. Gail, employed as a
university secretary in Sproul
Hall, "makes life just a whole
lot easier, especially when
things get busy around here."
Rugby, too
Freitas works out on the field
almost all year long, playing on
the Cal rugby team during the
winter. "I start rugby in the fall
as soon as I get out of my foot
ball uniform I get done in
the spring just in time for early
football practice. But it's really
a lot of fun."
Motorcycle riding is also a
hobby of sorts for the tight
end. He can often be seen rid
ing around the campus or just
cruising "to havea good time."
"There are so many different
kinds of students at this cam
pus. The diversity of the
people around here is exciting,
especially for someone from a
small town."
And then there's the Big
Game. Freitas has been getting
"emotional" all week for the
contest that "always, without
exception, is a great game."
Freitas has already started in
three Big Games. Last year he
caught three passes for 41
yards against the Cardinals.
"Even when both teams are
poor, the thrill is there. Butthis
year we've done pretty wellâ€”
Washington was the only time
we didn't play so well and
Stanford still has that
mathematical shot at the Rose
Bowl."
Yes, and the odds are also
that today's game will be a
good one.
But it's an even safer bet that
No. 83, George Freitas, will be
remembered by Bear Backers
as one of the best tight ends
ever to wear the blue and gold.
