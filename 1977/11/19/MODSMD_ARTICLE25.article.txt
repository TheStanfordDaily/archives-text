# Francis healthy again
## A 						back where he belongs 
### Emilie Deutsch 
"There are so many times
I've wanted to can football and
just go to school and be a regu
lar student not put in my
seven hours a day. But when I
first missed the game against
Tulane I was miserable. Then I
missed the second one and I
was really miserable. And I
thought 'I must really dig foot
ball.' "
Phil Francis isn't miserable
any longer. He's returned in
full force to the Cardinal line
up after a bout with tendonitis
in the hip. And he's doing his
job consistently well as a run
ning back.
"It's bad when you miss a
game, but what's worse is play
ing when you're injured, se
eing a hole you're trying to get
to and realizing you'd be there,
or you'd be gaining 10 more
yards if you were healthy.
That's the most frustrating
thing," Francis said.
The discussion of injuries
aside, the quick grin returns to
Francis' face. He's genuinely
happy about being able to per
form up to his usual standard.
And when you've played the
same position for 10 years like
Francis has that standard
should be fairly high.
"Everyone eventually origi
nates their own running style,"
Francis commented. "Running
is all instinct. Like John Finley,
he runs powerfully because
he's so big. He's learned that
one person can't bring him
down very easily. Darrin Nel
son is really quick so much
quicker than anyone else so he
stops a lot."
And of his own style Francis
said, "I know I'm not really that
strong and I'm not really that
quick, but I've got agility and
pretty good speed for a
fullback. I just use that to my
advantage."
Which happens to be advan
tageous to the team too. Fran
cis isolated the running back
position as a unique one on the
team.
"It can't be taught," he said.

"The offensive line is always
working on technique and
wide receivers are always
working on their patterns. All
the running backs ever do is
learn the plays and run through
them. You're never coached
on how to run."
He likes that. "It's nice," the
6-foot-1 ball carrier said. "The
only time you get yelled at is
when you miss a block. It's
hard to yell at you for not hit
ting the right hole or making
the right move because it's
something you can't learn."
Another thing that Francis

hasn't been able to learn is to
enjoy school.
"School's really hard for
me," he admitted. "I never re
ally liked it. But in grade school
and high school the alarm
would go off in the morning,
I'd get on the school bus and
go to school. Once I was there I
figured I might as well do my
work."
Why did Francis choose
Stanford then an academic
as well as athletic giant among
universities?
"I came to Stanford first be-

this season.
cause of the sunshine and
my mother wanted me to go
here," said the import from
Beaverton, Ore. "I was glad to
get out of the rain and into the
school."
The California sun probably
helps Francis in being loose
and relaxed the attitude that
helps him play his best.
"I'm at my best when I'm
loose," he said. "Sometimes I
like to play so loose that I can
laugh after a play."
Francis is easygoing off the
field, too. "I try to have a good
time. I think that's the way I get
my nervousness off just pre
tending it's no bigthing when I
know it really is."
The junior communication
major (who's all-time favorite
class is, typically, Humorous
Communication) is going to be
having a.lot of fun for today's
game.
"It's definitely a big game. It
seems like a lot more intense
than in the years past. We're
both seven and three and the
team that wins this will have
the best record in the Pac-8.
Plus it's a good rivalry and Cal
has a really good team. So do
we. Cal might be our last game
to show anything, so we want
to go out and have the best
game we possibly can," Francis
said.
In his friendly, outgoing

manner Francis shows a lot of
serious respect for his coach
("Denny Green is a really per
sonable coach that works out
as much as we do"), his team
mates (Francis is the one who
dubbed Nelson 'Junior' be
cause he "looks like a bratty
little kid"), and the position
that he plays.
"The thing that's good about
a running back is that if you
have a good game everyone
knows it and if you have a bad
game they just say the line
messed up," he said.
Today, don't look for the line
to mess up. Look for Francis to
perform like a 10-year veteran
of the position. And be thank
ful Stanford can look for him
next year, too.

Plus it's a good rivalry and Cal
has a really good team. So do
we. Cal might be our last game
to show anything, so we want
to go out and have the best
game we possibly can," Francis
said.
In his friendly, outgoing

manner Francis shows a lot of
serious respect for his coach
("Denny Green is a really per
sonable coach that works out
as much as we do"), his team
mates (Francis is the one who
dubbed Nelson 'Junior' be
cause he "looks like a bratty
little kid"), and the position
that he plays.
"The thing that's good about
a running back is that if you
have a good game everyone
knows it and if you have a bad
game they just say the line
messed up," he said.
Today, don't look for the line
to mess up. Look for Francis to
perform like a 10-year veteran
of the position. And be thank
ful Stanford can look for him
next year, too.
"There are so many times
I've wanted to can football and
just go to school and be a regu
lar student not put in my
seven hours a day. But when I
first missed the game against
Tulane I was miserable. Then I
missed the second one and I
was really miserable. And I
thought 'I must really dig foot
ball.' "
Phil Francis isn't miserable
any longer. He's returned in
full force to the Cardinal line
up after a bout with tendonitis
in the hip. And he's doing his
job consistently well as a run
ning back.
"It's bad when you miss a
game, but what's worse is play
ing when you're injured, se
eing a hole you're trying to get
to and realizing you'd be there,
or you'd be gaining 10 more
yards if you were healthy.
That's the most frustrating
thing," Francis said.
The discussion of injuries
aside, the quick grin returns to
Francis' face. He's genuinely
happy about being able to per
form up to his usual standard.
And when you've played the
same position for 10 years like
Francis has that standard
should be fairly high.
"Everyone eventually origi
nates their own running style,"
Francis commented. "Running
is all instinct. Like John Finley,
he runs powerfully because
he's so big. He's learned that
one person can't bring him
down very easily. Darrin Nel
son is really quick so much
quicker than anyone else so he
stops a lot."
And of his own style Francis
said, "I know I'm not really that
strong and I'm not really that
quick, but I've got agility and
pretty good speed for a
fullback. I just use that to my
advantage."
Which happens to be advan
tageous to the team too. Fran
cis isolated the running back
position as a unique one on the
team.
"It can't be taught," he said.

"The offensive line is always
working on technique and
wide receivers are always
working on their patterns. All
the running backs ever do is
learn the plays and run through
them. You're never coached
on how to run."
He likes that. "It's nice," the
6-foot-1 ball carrier said. "The
only time you get yelled at is
when you miss a block. It's
hard to yell at you for not hit
ting the right hole or making
the right move because it's
something you can't learn."
Another thing that Francis

hasn't been able to learn is to
enjoy school.
"School's really hard for
me," he admitted. "I never re
ally liked it. But in grade school
and high school the alarm
would go off in the morning,
I'd get on the school bus and
go to school. Once I was there I
figured I might as well do my
work."
Why did Francis choose
Stanford then an academic
as well as athletic giant among
universities?
"I came to Stanford first be-

here," said the import from
Beaverton, Ore. "I was glad to
get out of the rain and into the
school."
The California sun probably
helps Francis in being loose
and relaxed the attitude that
helps him play his best.
"I'm at my best when I'm
loose," he said. "Sometimes I
like to play so loose that I can
laugh after a play."
Francis is easygoing off the
field, too. "I try to have a good
time. I think that's the way I get
my nervousness off just pre

know it really is."

Beaverton, Ore. "I was glad to
get out of the rain and into the
school."
The California sun probably
helps Francis in being loose
and relaxed the attitude that
helps him play his best.
"I'm at my best when I'm
loose," he said. "Sometimes I
like to play so loose that I can
laugh after a play."
Francis is easygoing off the
field, too. "I try to have a good
time. I think that's the way I get
my nervousness off just pre
tending it's no bigthing when I
know it really is."
The junior communication
major (who's all-time favorite
class is, typically, Humorous
Communication) is going to be
having a.lot of fun for today's
game.
"It's definitely a big game. It
seems like a lot more intense
than in the years past. We're
both seven and three and the
team that wins this will have
the best record in the Pac-8.
Plus it's a good rivalry and Cal
has a really good team. So do
we. Cal might be our last game
to show anything, so we want
to go out and have the best
game we possibly can," Francis
said.
In his friendly, outgoing

manner Francis shows a lot of
serious respect for his coach
("Denny Green is a really per
sonable coach that works out
as much as we do"), his team
mates (Francis is the one who
dubbed Nelson 'Junior' be
cause he "looks like a bratty
little kid"), and the position
that he plays.
"The thing that's good about
a running back is that if you
have a good game everyone
knows it and if you have a bad
game they just say the line
messed up," he said.
Today, don't look for the line
to mess up. Look for Francis to
perform like a 10-year veteran
of the position. And be thank
ful Stanford can look for him
next year, too.
"There are so many times
I've wanted to can football and
just go to school and be a regu
lar student not put in my
seven hours a day. But when I
first missed the game against
Tulane I was miserable. Then I
missed the second one and I
was really miserable. And I
thought 'I must really dig foot
ball.' "
Phil Francis isn't miserable
any longer. He's returned in
full force to the Cardinal line
up after a bout with tendonitis
in the hip. And he's doing his
job consistently well as a run
ning back.
"It's bad when you miss a
game, but what's worse is play
ing when you're injured, se
eing a hole you're trying to get
to and realizing you'd be there,
or you'd be gaining 10 more
yards if you were healthy.
That's the most frustrating
thing," Francis said.
The discussion of injuries
aside, the quick grin returns to
Francis' face. He's genuinely
happy about being able to per
form up to his usual standard.
And when you've played the
same position for 10 years like
Francis has that standard
should be fairly high.
"Everyone eventually origi
nates their own running style,"
Francis commented. "Running
is all instinct. Like John Finley,
he runs powerfully because
he's so big. He's learned that
one person can't bring him
down very easily. Darrin Nel
son is really quick so much
quicker than anyone else so he
stops a lot."
And of his own style Francis
said, "I know I'm not really that
strong and I'm not really that
quick, but I've got agility and
pretty good speed for a
fullback. I just use that to my
advantage."
Which happens to be advan
tageous to the team too. Fran
cis isolated the running back
position as a unique one on the
team.
"It can't be taught," he said.

"The offensive line is always
working on technique and
wide receivers are always
working on their patterns. All
the running backs ever do is
learn the plays and run through
them. You're never coached
on how to run."
He likes that. "It's nice," the
6-foot-1 ball carrier said. "The
only time you get yelled at is
when you miss a block. It's
hard to yell at you for not hit
ting the right hole or making
the right move because it's
something you can't learn."
Another thing that Francis

hasn't been able to learn is to
enjoy school.
"School's really hard for
me," he admitted. "I never re
ally liked it. But in grade school
and high school the alarm
would go off in the morning,
I'd get on the school bus and
go to school. Once I was there I
figured I might as well do my
work."
Why did Francis choose
Stanford then an academic
as well as athletic giant among
universities?
"I came to Stanford first be-
