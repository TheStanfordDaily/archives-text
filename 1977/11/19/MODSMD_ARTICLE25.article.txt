# Francis healthy again

						back where he belongs

"There are so many times
I've wanted to can football and
just go to school and be a regu
lar student not put in my
seven hours a day. But when I
first missed the game against
Tulane I was miserable. Then I
missed the second one and I
was really miserable. And I
thought 'I must really dig foot
ball.' "
Phil Francis isn't miserable
any longer. He's returned in
full force to the Cardinal line
up after a bout with tendonitis
in the hip. And he's doing his
job consistently well as a run
ning back.
"It's bad when you miss a
game, but what's worse is play
ing when you're injured, se
eing a hole you're trying to get
to and realizing you'd be there,
or you'd be gaining 10 more
yards if you were healthy.
That's the most frustrating
thing," Francis said.
The discussion of injuries
aside, the quick grin returns to
Francis' face. He's genuinely
happy about being able to per
form up to his usual standard.
And when you've played the
same position for 10 years like
Francis has that standard
should be fairly high.
"Everyone eventually origi
nates their own running style,"
Francis commented. "Running
is all instinct. Like John Finley,
he runs powerfully because
he's so big. He's learned that
one person can't bring him
down very easily. Darrin Nel
son is really quick so much
quicker than anyone else so he
stops a lot."
And of his own style Francis
said, "I know I'm not really that
strong and I'm not really that
quick, but I've got agility and
pretty good speed for a
fullback. I just use that to my
advantage."
Which happens to be advan
tageous to the team too. Fran
cis isolated the running back
position as a unique one on the
team.
"It can't be taught," he said.

"The offensive line is always
working on technique and
wide receivers are always
working on their patterns. All
the running backs ever do is
learn the plays and run through
them. You're never coached
on how to run."
He likes that. "It's nice," the
6-foot-1 ball carrier said. "The
only time you get yelled at is
when you miss a block. It's
hard to yell at you for not hit
ting the right hole or making
the right move because it's
something you can't learn."
Another thing that Francis

hasn't been able to learn is to
enjoy school.
"School's really hard for
me," he admitted. "I never re
ally liked it. But in grade school
and high school the alarm
would go off in the morning,
I'd get on the school bus and
go to school. Once I was there I
figured I might as well do my
work."
Why did Francis choose
Stanford then an academic
as well as athletic giant among
universities?
"I came to Stanford first be-

Stanford junior fullback Phil Francis is healthy once again after ten
donitis slowed him earlier in the season. Here Francis moves through a
gap in the Washington State defense for some of his 344 yards gained
this season.
