# Out of Nelson's shadow
## Chapman makes a move 
### Brad Brockbank 
"Robby Chapman came to us
as an outstanding running
back," said Stanford football
coach Bill Walsh, "one of the
best in Southern California.
But playing behind Darrin Nel
son, he wasn't going to get
much of a chance to play. We
decided it would be best for
the team to put him as a defen
sive back, where he's played
very well for a freshman."
"When they told me they
wanted to switch me to de
fense," said Chapman, "it was
really exciting for me because,
with Darrin playing, I wasn't
getting much chance to play.
So when they brought it up, I
was all for it because I figured
I'd get an opportunity to play."
Chapman got his chance and
now has secured the starting
spot at free safety.
"They didn't actually tell me I
was going to start," the
freshman from South Pasadena
said. "They were hinting
around, like talking about how
coach Walsh was looking for
some changes. When they cal
led out the first defensive unit,
in practice, they called my
name. I was kind of tickled in
side to be on the first defense
but at first I wasn't sure that
meant I was going to be start
ing that Saturday. All through
the week, though, I was on the
first defense so I finally con
cluded that this meant I was
starting."
For many freshmen, starting
the first game can be a nervous
experience. For Chapman,
however, it was just another
game.
"I guess I should have been,
but I just didn't get nervous be
fore the game," he said. "My
palms were sweaty but that's
all. I was excited the whole
week, but not right before the
game.
"I was always pretty mel
low," he explained. "Before a
game in high school, I'd go to
the other side of the locker
room and cry to get my anger
up."
Though Chapman doesn't
do that any more, he has been
known to throw chairs around

the locker room when the
Cards lose. During the game,
he is equally intense.
Aggressive
"I enjoy the aggressiveness
of the game," he said. "It feels
good, every once and awhile,
to give someone a really good
shot. I'm a pretty competitive
person. I hate to lose. Most
people do, but I hate it with a
passion.
"In my high school," Chap
man continued, "we only lost
one game and tied one game in
my whole two years of varsity
ball. It's just a really weird feel
ing to lose."
Since Chapman entered the
lineup, the Cards have lost
only one game, against USC,
but for the 6-foot-1,195 poun.
der, it turned out to be his best
personal effort to date. No. 47
finished the contest with 16
tackles. Even though the final
result was a 49-0 loss for the
Cards, Chapman's abilities did
not go unnoticed.
"He's quick on his feet,"
Walsh said. "He has excellent
coordination and he's a fine
competitor. He's an excellent
tackier and he's a ballhawk.
He's made a couple of inter
ceptions and some very good
plays. He's a fine all-around
athlete.
"Our problem next spring,"
Walsh continued, "will be de
ciding whether he should
compete for the fullback posi
tion. A backfield with Robby
Chapman and Darrin Nelson
could be a great backfield. We
have Phil Francis, though, a
fine back, and some others
who wouldn't be able to play
defense."
Just wants to play
"If they left me on defense,"
said Chapman, "I'd be happy
but if they moved me to run
ning back, I'd be happy too.
Just as long as I get to play, I'm
happy.
"I really like both," he con
tinued. "I played both in high
school. I always thought it was
really fun to play defense. On
offense, everybody's taking
shots at me the whole game, so
when I play defense I get a
chance to hit somebody back.

"Running, on offense, is a
more natural type of thing,"
Chapman commented. "They
hand you the ball and you have
the option to run here or run
there, whatever you decide!'
Though Chapman said that
he does not consider himself
fast, he said that quickness is
important for a defensive back.
"When you speak of quick
ness for a defensive player," he
explained, "it's a matter of
reading and reacting. You have
to read before you can react.
You have to get to a particular
spot, then once you read that
spot, if it's, say, a run, then you
have to come up really fast.
"Usually," he continued,
"I'm the last guy, the last line of
defense. If they break a long
run, I'm supposed to be the
guy who makes the tackle. If
they make a long pass and the
(defensive) halfback gets
burned or something, I'm sup
posed to be the guy who
knocks the ball down."
Like most athletes, Chapman
said he enjoys home games
more than away games and is
affected by a cheering home
crowd.
"When we went toTulane,"
he recalled, "we won that
game but it was pretty close.
The Superdome is so big. We'd
make a touchdown and we'd
just hear a couple of alumni
that came to the game,* cheer
ing, and that was all. It's no
thing like hearinga big roar of a
home crowd, the cannon
going off and the Band striking
up a song. That's great.
"After a (home) game, I'm
sure everybody enjoys, you
know, 'Nice game, Robby' and
all the kids want your autog
raph and say, 'Can I have your
chin strap?' A lot of little kids
ask you for your chin strap or
your elbow pad."
And Chapman responds to
the youngsters. But on the
field, said Walsh, "he's outgo
ing, very sure of himself and
he's all business as a football
player. "He thrives on play
ing."
So the Cards found him a
place to play.
