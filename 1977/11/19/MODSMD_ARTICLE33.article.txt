## Hill defeats paralysis 
### Ali Webb 
Stanford offensive guard
Mark Hill has started every
game this season. Nothing
special, huh?
Except that earlier this year
Mark Hill was paralyzed from
the waist down. An unknown
viral infection put Hill in Kaiser
Hospital for 2Vi weeks in Feb
ruary, his chances for walking
again uncertain.
A spring and summer of slow
rehabilitation brought Hill
back to top speed and form for
the '77 season. "By midsum
mer I was back 100 per cent as
faras strength and quickness in
my legs," he said.
The 6-foot-4, 255 senior said
that his doctors were surprised
that he regained the use of his
legs so quickly. "It was only
after I was out of the hospital
that I realized how bad it could
have been," Hill said.
Hill, looking back at his
paralysis, stated, "Anyone that
comes out of that is thankful
for what he has. I was in a situa
tion that I might not have
played football; I might never
have wajked. It is a miracle that
I am starting as guard this quar
ter."
Share experience
Many people have written
and called Hill asking him to
share his experience with
friends who are in similar situa
tions. "One 10-yearrold girl,
active in swimming, is
paralyzed from the waist
down. I got a team program au
tographed and wrote her a let
ter," he said.
Hill is interested in working
with children using the skills of
developmental psychology.
He hopes to play professional
football while working on ad
vanced degrees in his major
psychology during the off
season.
Offensive line coach Doug
Single said that many pro sc
outs are interested in Hill be

cause of his ovefall athletic
ability. "He moves well for a
big man," Single commented.
"I don't care how high or low
I am drafted, or if I go in as a
free agent, I just want a shot at
the pros," Hill stated. Hill's
senior-year performance is
crucial to his chance at a pro
spot. "When I make a mistake
it hits me deep down because
now I am playing with a career
as well as giving my best for the
team."
One of Hill's special talents,
the deep snap, has proved in
valuable to the team this year
according to coach Single.
Single calls Hill consistent in
his snaps to the punter and

holder. Hill said that this may
give him a plus to the pro sc
outs.
Assessing Hill's performance
on the field, coach Single
stated that Hill takes his playing
seriously. Due to extensive in
juries during the '76 season,
Hill was moved from his start
ing position at center to the
right guard spot. "We were
impressed with his ability as a
guard, mainly his quickness,"
Single said.
Switch didn't hurt
Hill doesn't feel that switch
ing positions hurt his compe
tence in either spot. "At the
beginning of the season you
