# Back to the bench
## Steve Dils accepts role 
### Ivan Maisel 
This is the story of two quar
terbacks. One is an All-
America and a Heisman Trophy
candidate the national
leader in passing his senior
season. The other is his bac
kup. The backup is good
enough to start at just about
any other school in the nation,
and proved that by leading his
team to an important victory
against a hated rival when the
star was hurt. However, all this
performance earned him was a'
few slaps on the back, a couple
of post-game interviews, and a
seat on the bench the next
week.
As can be guessed, the star is
Guy Benjamin, Stanford's start
ing quarterback. The backup?
Noneotherthan Steve Dils, the
6-foot-2, 180-lb. junior from
Vancouver/Wash., who led
Stanford to a thrilling 32-28 vic
tory over UCLA on Oct. 8. Dils
has accepted his role as bac
kup, and has made the best of
it.
"Look, I don't like sitting and
watching, I like playing," he
said. "But I realize that I'm
playing behind the best quar
terback in the country."
Actually, Dils looks at this
year as an improvement over
last year, when he played be
hind both Benjamin and Mike
Cordova.
"Last year this time, the sea
son had begun to drag, and I
was looking forward to the last
week of the season. But this
year, I have gotten plenty of
practice time and even played a
complete game. I could play
two or three more weeks."
Out of the spotlight
Since his complete game
against UCLA, Dils admitted
that the taste of "life at the top"
has had him craving for more,
especially when he compares it
to coming in during a game.
"Sure, there is a big differ
ence between knowing you are

starting and being thrown in
during the middle of a game,"
he said. "Mentally, I'm always
ready to go in. But physically,
my legs are tight and it takes
me a few plays to get going.
Another thing is that I don't get
as much practice time during
the week, so I'm not as well
prepared."
Dils would be the first to say
that a quarterback must exude
both leadership and confi
dence in himself. Coming in
during a game isn't always the
thing to do, particularly replac
ing a passer like Benjamin.
"I don't worry about my
self," said Dils. "I had a few
doubts at the start, but I didn't
let them become a problem.
Even if I had messed up once, I
knew I could do it. Since things
went smoothly, I had nothing
to worry about."
From his performance
against UCLA, one can see that
things went quite smoothly.
Dils went 24 for 37 for 287 yards
and threw one touchdown
pass. However, the next week
against Washington, Dils went
right back to the bench.
"I didn't let it bother me. I
was a little let down," he said,
"but I knew that as soon as Guy
was back, I'd be back on the
bench. Coach Rod Dowhower
told me 'lt's tough, but that's
the way it's got to be.' I could
have said something, but I feel
that I was lucky to get the
chance. I played more than I
thought I ever would."
More relaxed
Since Dils got his chance
against the Bruins, he said he
has been able to relax on the
sidelines during the game.
"At the beginning of the sea

son, I was constantly watching
the defense from the sidelines.
It was difficult, because con
centration is hard to keep up
when you are on the sidelines.
Now that I have played, I watch
the game as more of a spec
tator," he said.
Dils realizes that if he wants
to do any more playing this
year (such as in a bowl), the
Cardinals have to beat Cal to
day.
"Cal is as good defensively
as UCLA," he said. "They're
aggresive, and they talk a lot to
you. But there is always some
thing our offense can do. Our
defense will play good, too."
As for postseason play, Dils
eyes light up!
"Sure, I'd love to go to any
bowl. And don't forget, we
may still go to the Rose Bowl."
He started to laugh, then said,
"I'd love to go to the Rose
Bowl."
