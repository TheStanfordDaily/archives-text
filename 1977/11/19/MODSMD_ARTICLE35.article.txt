# Cal coach Cunningham teaches Bears to play aggressively
## 
### George Anders 
John Ralston, the man who
coached Stanford to its last
Rose Bowl appearance, did it.
So did Cal coach Mike
White.
And today, Cal assistant
coach Gunther Cunningham
will add his name to the select
list of persons who have
coached for both teams in the
Big Game.
Cunningham, defensive line
coach for the Cards from 1974
to 1976, was let go when Bill
Walsh took over the head
coaching spot for Stanford.
Cunningham recalled that
when he was approached
about a position with Cal, his
first reaction was " 'Oh my
God!' What with the rivalry and
all, it was a very traumatic
thing. For four years, all I had
wanted to do was to beat Cal."
But Cunningham ended up
accepting the job of secondary
coach with the Bears, and said
that now "the only thing I'm
concerned about is making the
Cal defense the best defense in

the world."
Earlier this month, USC
football coach John Robinson
had charged that Cunningham
was teaching his defensive
backs some dirty football.
Not dirty
Cunningham said, though,
"I teach aggressive play, but I
don't believe I've ever coached
dirty football."
Stanford defensive tackle
Geoff Kieburtz recalled that
when Cunningham worked on
the west side of the Bay, "he
was an aggressive type coach,
but that's the way defense in
general has to be played.
"He never instructed us to
do anything that could be cal
led dirty football," Kieburtz
continued.
"He taught us how to get off
the line quickly, how to main
tain good body position and a
lot of playing hands. But there
wasn't anything about punch
ing through the face mask or
anything like that."
Kieburtz explained that play
ing hands entails "delivering a
good shot to the offensive
lineman which stuns his charge
so you can get off him and
make the tackle."
Cunningham, a linebacker at
Oregon for three years in the
'6os, is now in charge of Cal's
secondary. He said the change
in duties from defensive line to
backfield is "not that difficult."
"It's a personal challenge to

switch positions," he said.
Cunningham added, though,
that members of the defensive
backfield are "the best athletes
on the football field."
Many persons have asked
him if he is being regarded at
Cal as a guru about Stanford
football, Cunningham said. He
ruled out such a role, though,
saying Stanford's "offense and
their defense is different. We
still have to study films."
Recruited Cards
Looking back on his days on
the Farm, Cunningham said, "I
don't know how many recruits
I sold on that university, and I
was selling them on a great
university. And now I have to
compete against them."
Card defensive end Chuck
Evans, recalled his former
coach as "a moody guy, who
would sometimes bring some
thing to practice that had hap
pened earlier in the day."
Cunningham was a demand
ing coach, Evans said, "but
that's the kind of coach I
need."
Kieburtz termed Cunnin
gham "a pretty emotional
dude, looking for the best way
to motivate players." While
Cunningham was with the
Cards, Kieburtz said, "he still
hadn't really found his way to
coach, and would try different
things."
"Sometimes, if he felt he
wasn't getting through as a
nice guy, he would force him
self to be kind of a bastard,"
Kieburtz added.
Regardless of whatever the
coaching style, Cunningham
admitted he's thought about a
head coaching spot.
"All of us shoot for the
moon," he said, "and some
day I hope to have the kind of

opportunity that coach White
or Bill Walsh have. But that's in
the future."
For this afternoon, Cunnin
gham will be watching the Big
Game from the other sideline,
and he predicts it will be
another "traumatic experi
ence."
At least, in Ralston and White
he's got good company.

dirty football."
Stanford defensive tackle
Geoff Kieburtz recalled that
when Cunningham worked on
the west side of the Bay, "he
was an aggressive type coach,
but that's the way defense in
general has to be played.
"He never instructed us to
do anything that could be cal
led dirty football," Kieburtz
continued.
"He taught us how to get off
the line quickly, how to main
tain good body position and a
lot of playing hands. But there
wasn't anything about punch
ing through the face mask or
anything like that."
Kieburtz explained that play
ing hands entails "delivering a
good shot to the offensive
lineman which stuns his charge
so you can get off him and
make the tackle."
Cunningham, a linebacker at
Oregon for three years in the
'6os, is now in charge of Cal's
secondary. He said the change
in duties from defensive line to
backfield is "not that difficult."
"It's a personal challenge to

switch positions," he said.
Cunningham added, though,
that members of the defensive
backfield are "the best athletes
on the football field."
Many persons have asked
him if he is being regarded at
Cal as a guru about Stanford
football, Cunningham said. He
ruled out such a role, though,
saying Stanford's "offense and
their defense is different. We
still have to study films."
Recruited Cards
Looking back on his days on
the Farm, Cunningham said, "I
don't know how many recruits
I sold on that university, and I
was selling them on a great
university. And now I have to
compete against them."
Card defensive end Chuck
Evans, recalled his former
coach as "a moody guy, who
would sometimes bring some
thing to practice that had hap
pened earlier in the day."
Cunningham was a demand
ing coach, Evans said, "but
that's the kind of coach I
need."
Kieburtz termed Cunnin
gham "a pretty emotional
dude, looking for the best way
to motivate players." While
Cunningham was with the
Cards, Kieburtz said, "he still
hadn't really found his way to
coach, and would try different
things."
"Sometimes, if he felt he
wasn't getting through as a
nice guy, he would force him
self to be kind of a bastard,"
Kieburtz added.
Regardless of whatever the
coaching style, Cunningham
admitted he's thought about a
head coaching spot.
"All of us shoot for the
moon," he said, "and some
day I hope to have the kind of

opportunity that coach White
or Bill Walsh have. But that's in
the future."
For this afternoon, Cunnin
gham will be watching the Big
Game from the other sideline,
and he predicts it will be
another "traumatic experi
ence."
At least, in Ralston and White
he's got good company.

Two of Cal secondary coach Gunther Cunningham's defenders - Anthony Green (31) and Wade Johnson (47)
- move in with tackle Craig Watkins on Stanford runner Gary Lynn.
John Ralston, the man who
coached Stanford to its last
Rose Bowl appearance, did it.
So did Cal coach Mike
White.
And today, Cal assistant
coach Gunther Cunningham
will add his name to the select
list of persons who have
coached for both teams in the
Big Game.
Cunningham, defensive line
coach for the Cards from 1974
to 1976, was let go when Bill
Walsh took over the head
coaching spot for Stanford.
Cunningham recalled that
when he was approached
about a position with Cal, his
first reaction was " 'Oh my
God!' What with the rivalry and
all, it was a very traumatic
thing. For four years, all I had
wanted to do was to beat Cal."
But Cunningham ended up
accepting the job of secondary
coach with the Bears, and said
that now "the only thing I'm
concerned about is making the
Cal defense the best defense in

the world."
Earlier this month, USC
football coach John Robinson
had charged that Cunningham
was teaching his defensive
backs some dirty football.
Not dirty
Cunningham said, though,
"I teach aggressive play, but I
don't believe I've ever coached
dirty football."

Geoff Kieburtz recalled that
