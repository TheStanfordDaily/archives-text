## Wilson 'gongs' opponents

On the field he wears the
helmet and uniform of a foot
ball player, while off the field
he dons an ankle-length rain
coat, a Lone Ranger mask and a
German helmet.
Who is the man behind the
mask? Who, along with three
colleagues was a two-time per
former on the Gong Show?
He's defensive end Dean
Wilson, whose outrageous
costume and antics brought
him laughs on the Gong Show,
but whose performance on the
field is nothing to be laughed
at.
The 6-foot-4,218 sophomore
is smaller than most defensive
linemen, who usually weigh
more than 235 pounds. In Wil

son's case, however, size
doesn't seem to matter.
What he may lack in size, he
makes up for in speed and
strength. Defensive line coach
Fred von Appen said "Wilson is
immensely strong for his size
and able to hold his own."
Where does this immense
strength come from?
Inherited
Wilson claims that he inher
ited it from his parents while
vonAppen "Dean either has a
natural strength or he
squeezes his girl friend's hand
hard."
The fact is that Wilson
doesn't work at building up his
strength. "Lifting weights is a
painful process," he said. "So,
I try to avoid it as much as pos

sible." He said he feels thatthe
strength should be there, but
he disagrees with the need for
bulging muscles.

ley, Calif, where he was named
All-CIF in football as well as
wrestling. Even though wrestl
ing wasn't a sport to which he
looked forward, he continued
it because it gave him strength
and endurance for football. He
wrestled as a heavyweight,
even though he was only five
pounds over that division's
lower limit.
Why didn't he just lose the
weight and drop a class? He
said that he simply hates to
diet. "I didn't like getting up
for breakfast and saying, 'Hey,
mom, fix me a bowl of
steam.' "
During his senior year of
high school, Wilson and three
colleagues formed a comedy
group called "The Magicians."
They performed at various par
ties in their costumes, made a
movie and were involved in
publishing a controversial stu
dent magazine which got three
of them suspended. The group
is still together, and will be

seen sometime in January on
the Cong Show.
On the Farm
Wilson transferred here last
spring from Grossmont Col
lege ,in La Mesa where, after
playing his freshman year, he
was sidelined by injury for
most of his sophomore season.
Wilson says he chose to
come to Stanford "because of
the prestige and for the oppor
tunity to play in the Pac-8."
According to vonAppen, it
was originally thought that

Wilson would play linebacker,
but he gained a defensive end
position in the starting line-up
for the Colorado game and has
played every game since. Be
cause of an injury to defensive
tackle Steve Howe during the
Washington game, Wilson was
moved to tackle. According to
vonAppen, his strength and
quickness were valuable there.
In the next two games, Wilson
was rotated between end and
tackle, which he said was tax
ing.
Academically, Wilson is pur
suing a degree in economics,
with business school as a pos
sibility after graduation.
Even with four hours of foot
ball practice a day and classes,
Wilson is able to participate in
various outside "activities."
Last year, as a resident of Ot
ero, he was known for his
rubber-band machine gun
raids on Rinconada.
Rubber bands aren't silver
bullets, but one could have

According to vonAppen, it

moved to tackle. According to
vonAppen, his strength and

In the next two games, Wilson
was rotated between end and
