## Wilson 'gongs' opponents 
### Yvonne Randle 
On the field he wears the
helmet and uniform of a foot
ball player, while off the field
he dons an ankle-length rain
coat, a Lone Ranger mask and a
German helmet.
Who is the man behind the
mask? Who, along with three
colleagues was a two-time per
former on the Gong Show?
He's defensive end Dean
Wilson, whose outrageous
costume and antics brought
him laughs on the Gong Show,
but whose performance on the
field is nothing to be laughed
at.
The 6-foot-4,218 sophomore
is smaller than most defensive
linemen, who usually weigh
more than 235 pounds. In Wil

son's case, however, size
doesn't seem to matter.
What he may lack in size, he
makes up for in speed and
strength. Defensive line coach
Fred von Appen said "Wilson is
immensely strong for his size
and able to hold his own."
Where does this immense
strength come from?
Inherited
Wilson claims that he inher
ited it from his parents while
vonAppen "Dean either has a
natural strength or he
squeezes his girl friend's hand
hard."
The fact is that Wilson
doesn't work at building up his
strength. "Lifting weights is a
painful process," he said. "So,
I try to avoid it as much as pos

sible." He said he feels thatthe
strength should be there, but
he disagrees with the need for
bulging muscles.

Stanford defensive lineman Dean Wilson leads a charge against Washington State quarterback Jack Thompson
that nearly resulted in a safety. Wilson has played both tackle and end for the Cards this season. He utilizes his
strength and speed to help compensate for his relative lack of size along the line of scrimmage.
