Band, prepared for the Daily by

It only happens once a year.
The labyrinthian lines of impa
tient, yet pleasantly inebriated
fans wind amongst the
eucalyptus trees. Scalpers reap
the benefits of the bullish
pigskin futures market. Altered
alumni vainly insist their flasks
contain merely milk of mag
nesia. Dowwind from the stu

ca's gold doesn't sell as well as
Colombia's. In the traditional
spirit of the pregame tailgate

the stadium.
Pregame
The Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
(LSJUMB), in conjunction with
the Stanford Chaparral Visual
Humor Department (SCVHD),
are pleased to present today's
special pregame extravaganza.
The Big Game has provided the
appropriate setting for a musi
cal solution to our great uni
versity's continuing struggle to
find the mascot that exemplifies
the essence of Stanford, repre
senting its magnitude and po
tency, epitomizing its depth
and diversity. We take great

pride in unveiling the new
symbol of Stanford, that awe
inspiring king of the vegies:
the Elephant Squash.
The Band prepares itself for
the task at hand with a few
calisthenics before the show.
Then, with a display not unlike
that of a herd of walruses dur
ing mating season, the Incom
parables violate the gridiron
with an unnatural Axe. The
majestic strains of "Fanfare"
herald the entrance of our first
Elephant Squash Princess, Kris
hna DeGrate, accompanied by
the Old One, and members of
the SCVHD.
Stanford's faith in coach
Walsh has demonstrated the
desire for growth of the inter
collegiate athletic program at
the Farm. The LSJUMB illus
trates how our new mascot
emulates this noble virtue; this
turgid vegetable can grow to 48
inches in a single season. In
spired by this tubular enlarge
ment, the team is sure to con
vince the Weenies that there
"Ain't Nothin' Stoppin' Us
Now."
Having rescued the Stanford
community from the
stanglehold of controversy,
the Band moves to pay homage
to our symbol of state by play
ing Dr. A.P. Barnes' arrange
ment of the National Anthem.
Now finished with the pre
game functions, the Incom

parables hurry to the stands in
hope of finding empty seats.
Halftime
For the entertainment of
those confined to their chairs
by alcohol-induced motor re
sponse dysfunctions, the Band
salutes the institution of Big
Game in its halftime show en
titled "Isn't the Hot Dog Man
Around Here Somewhere?"
Refreshed from their two
quarters of spa and tanning
seminars, the Band tramples
onto the field to commemorate
Herbert Hoover's first depres
sion finding he had brought
NO BALL td the first Big Game.
The Incomparables reenact his
howls of "She's Not There."
Led by Jumpin' Jimmy Jett,
the moving target favored by
Cal sharpshooters, the Band
recognizes that the Liquid Mis
sle Crisis can leave its targets
"Cold as Ice."
Moving with the searing
speed of a cement truck, the
LSJUMB salutes the Immortal
21 for successfully cracking
Cal's security and committing
the legendary AXE HAUL. We
challenge the Dirty Golden
Bears to "Turn the Beat
Around."
Finally, with the frenzy of a
female salmon struggling to
spawn, only to die shortly
thereafter, we offer the alumni
their favorite elixir, and

The Leland Stanford Junior

appropriate setting for a musi

find the mascot that exemplifies
the essence of Stanford, repre
senting its magnitude and po
tency, epitomizing its depth
and diversity. We take great

pride in unveiling the new
symbol of Stanford, that awe
inspiring king of the vegies:
the Elephant Squash.
The Band prepares itself for
the task at hand with a few
calisthenics before the show.
Then, with a display not unlike
that of a herd of walruses dur
ing mating season, the Incom
parables violate the gridiron
with an unnatural Axe. The
majestic strains of "Fanfare"
herald the entrance of our first
Elephant Squash Princess, Kris
hna DeGrate, accompanied by
the Old One, and members of
the SCVHD.
Stanford's faith in coach
Walsh has demonstrated the
desire for growth of the inter
collegiate athletic program at
the Farm. The LSJUMB illus
trates how our new mascot
emulates this noble virtue; this
turgid vegetable can grow to 48
inches in a single season. In
