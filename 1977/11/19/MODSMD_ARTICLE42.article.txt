Epilogue
In the event that the post
season bowl czars do not see fit
to include Stanford in their
plans, the members of the
LSJUMB would like to take this
opportunity to reflect on this
year's football season. We feel
it's been one of the most suc
cessful ever, both musically

and athletically. We hope
you've had as much fun watch
ing us as we had performing,
since for us, it was the support
of the Stanford community that
made it all possible. We offer
our sincerest thanks for you,
too, are truly Incomparable.
