# Super sub Dils accepts sideline view of action
## 
### 
Dils realizes that his key is
the future. As a matter of fact,
he sees himself as the front
runner for the starting quar
terback position.
"Yes, I'd be disappointed if I
didn't start next year," he said.
"Our other quarterback, Turk
Schonert, is good. I got lucky
because I got the chance to
play this season."
Dils is also excited about

next year's team.
"We're losing a lot on of
fense, particularly on the line.
But Darrin Nelson, Phil Francis
and I will be back, and so will
most of the defense. We will be
good next year."
Steve Dils has accepted his
backup role to Guy Benjamin,
just as he accepted only getting
in for one play last season, just
as he accepted going back to
the bench after the UCLA
game, and just as he accepts
being the number one candi
date for starting quarterback
next season. His philosophy is
simple: take everything in
stride.

"When I wasn't playing, I
knew that sooner or later I'd
get my chance. That's what has
kept me around." To the relief
of coaches and fans alike, that
is.
