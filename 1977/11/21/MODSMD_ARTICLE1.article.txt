# Cards throttle Cal 21-3; get Sun Bowl bid
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Big Games are traditionally
caldrons of turbulent pathos,
games won more by heart and
desire than skill and brawn.
Saturday's 80th renewal of the
Stanford-California football
rivalry was no exception.
An emotionally high Stan
ford football team shut down
Calif6rnia, 21-3, to retain pos
session of the Axe and secure
an invitation to the Sun Bowl
in El Paso, Texas, where the
Cardinals will meet Louisiana
State Dec. 31.
"This win came from every
body's heart, from the guys on
defense, the guys on offense,
the guys on the special teams
and even from guys who didn't
play," said Stanford quarter
back Guy Benjamin in the loc
kerroom after the Card victory.
Benjamin has said that tran
quilityand calmness are essen
tial to his performance as a
quarterback. But Saturday,
Benjamin, who normally plays
with a stoic exterior, was jump
ing up and down and hugging
teammates after big plays.
"The whole team did the
same thing," Benjamin said of
his emotional play. "Every
body was into it."
Special meeting
Benjamin completed 16of 27
passes for 211 yards, one
touchdown and no intercep
tions against the Bears. But his
major contribution to the vic
tory Saturday may have come
earlier in the week when the
Stanford captain called a team

meeting Wednesday before
practice.
The meeting was held.with
out coaches and Benjamin re
portedly opened it by discus
sing the mechanical approach
the Cards had played with in
their losses to Washington and
use.
"We didn't have a team
meeting all year," Benjamin
said. "We didn't communicate
with each other. Wednesday
we all talked and everybody
knew where everybody else
was coming from."
"It was an incredible meet
ing," said Stanford cornerback
John Pigott. "Mostly seniors
talked, guys like Benjamin,
James Lofton, Bill Kellar and
Cordon King, and they tried to
convey the whole meaning of
the Big Came.
"It was the big turning point
this week. From then on I knew
we would win. When we play
an emotionally high game we
don't lose."
Perfunctory practice
"We were too mechanical at
practice Monday and Tues
day," King said. "I think Guy
called the meeting. He said it
wasour last game and we'd (let
ter give it everything or we'd
regret it later. It really got the
juices going."
The team had one more
meeting without the coaches
last week — in the field house
at the stadium just before
Saturday's opening • kickoff.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis leaps over the line for a second-quarter touchdown and tackle Gordon King (72) opened the hole for Francis on this counter which
in the Cards' 21-3 victory over California Saturday. Guard Jimmy Stephens (63) also brought Francis aTD in tne first quarter.
That meeting also stirred Stan
ford emotions.
Quick score
The Cards took the opening
kickoff 78 yards in 16 plays
with fullback Phil Francis
plunging over from the 2-yard
line to give Stanford a 7-0 ad
vantage before Cal even
touched the ball. It was the first
first-quarter touchdown scored
against the Golden Bears all
season.
Before Francis found
paydirt, however, freshman
running phenom Darrin Nel
son became the first Cardinal
runner to ever rush for more
than 1000 yards in one season
when he picked up 13 yards on
a run around left end.
Nelson finished the game
with 94 yards on 23 carries. He
rushed for 1069 yards this fall
and is only the sixth freshman
running back in NCAA history
to gain more than 1000 yards
on the ground in his freshman
year.
Scoring on the first drive
"helped us a lot," said King.
"We did the same thing against
UCLA. We got our momentum
going. The first drive was an
indication to us that we could
move the ball on them."
Taking its cue from the of
fense, the Stanford defense
came out fired-up and halted
the Bears at the California 22.
"The key to the game was our
defensive play," Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said. "Ourde
fensive men were in the proper
positions and carried out the
details of football."
Bell rung
Early in the second quarter
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino was toppled
with a mild concussion which
left the Cards' leading tackier
watching the game from the
sidelines for the rest of the af
ternoon.
Steve Budinger replaced
Ceresino and did an outstand
ing job anchoring the middle of
the Stanford defense.
"I thought Stanford compen
sated very well for Ceresino,"
Cal coach Mike White said.
"When you lose a playerof that
caliber it isn't that easy to ad
just. It is to their credit that they
did and the score reflects it."
Stanford lit the scoreboard
again in the second quarter
when the Cards drove 80 yards
in eight plays, the key play a

38-yard bomb from Benjamin
to the leaping Lofton. The
6-foot-3 senior had five recep
tions for 92 yards Saturday and
finished the season as the top
pass receiver in the Pacific-8
with 53 receptions.
Diving TD
With second-and-goal from
the one, Benjamin faked play
direction to the right, spun and
handed the ball to Francis who
leaped over left tackle for the
score.
"It was a 63 counter between
Jimmy Stephens and myself,"
said King, whoanchorsthe line
from his left tackle spot. "It's
hard to slow Phil down when
we get down near the goal
line."
Cal, on the other hand, en
countered numerous problems
trying to cross the end stripe.
"We just couldn't generate any
offense," said White. "We
came out at the start of the sec
ond half and executed well but
just couldn't get into the end
zone."
The Bears did get close
enough for a 48-yard field goal
by Jim Breech early in the third
quarter. But that was it.
Cards score too
Stanford replied to Breech's
field goal with an 80-yard drive
capped by an 8-yard scoring
toss from Benjamin to Lofton.
The TD gave Lofton 12
touchdown receptions on the
year and broke the Stanford
season mark for touchdowns.
After the Stanford score, Cal
soughtquick retaliation and on
its second play quarterback
Gary Graumann heaved a 49-
yard pass to flanker Jesse
Thompson.
The Bears had first down on
the Stanford 15. Three straight
passes to Thompson went in
complete, however, and Cal
had faced fourth-and-10. White
decided to go for the first down
rather than attempt a field goal.
Graumann dropped back and
fired a pass which hit
Thompson in the bread basket
but Stanford cornerback Rick

Parker reached around
Thompson and knocked the
ball out of his grasp.
Another thrust, another parry
Charlie Young came in at
quarterback for the second time
in the game at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. Young di
rected the Bears to a first down
on the Stanford 10.
Two running plays and an
incomplete pass left Cal with
fourth-and-seven. Young tos
sed a pass to Thompson but he
couldn't hold on to it.
Cal had one more opportun
ity to score midway through
the final period. Driving to the
Stanford 10, the Golden Bears
faltered once more as the Car
dinal defense entrenched itself
near the goal line for a third
time.
"When you get behind/'
White said, "the defense has
that extra opportunity to gam
ble. For some reason, we just
couldn't get that big play when
we needed it, but it's to their
credit that they came up with
the crucial defensive play."
Looking ahead
Stanford has six weeks to
prepare for its New Year's Eve
Day confrontation with LSU's
Bengal Tigers. For right now,
though, Walsh said, "I just
want to think about this one."
The triumph gave Stanford
an 8-3 season record (5-2 in the
Pac-8) which equals any regu
lar season record for the Cards
since 1951. The win also gave
the Cards the first unbeaten,
untied season at home in 37
years. The Cards were 6-0 at
home this year.
Cal, too, can reflecton a good
season. The Bears finished 7-4,
including a 17-14 upset of
use
"I have to be disappointed to
finish this waybut I thought we
did real well for the entire sea
son if you could cross out this
one game," said White. "Un
fortunately the Big Game is a
one-game season."
Such is the emotion of the
Big Game.

running back in NCAA history
to gain more than 1000 yards
on the ground in his freshman
year.
Scoring on the first drive
"helped us a lot," said King.
"We did the same thing against
UCLA. We got our momentum
going. The first drive was an
indication to us that we could
move the ball on them."
Taking its cue from the of
fense, the Stanford defense
came out fired-up and halted
the Bears at the California 22.
"The key to the game was our
defensive play," Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said. "Ourde
fensive men were in the proper
positions and carried out the
details of football."
Bell rung
Early in the second quarter
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino was toppled
with a mild concussion which
left the Cards' leading tackier
watching the game from the
sidelines for the rest of the af
ternoon.
Steve Budinger replaced
Ceresino and did an outstand
ing job anchoring the middle of
the Stanford defense.
"I thought Stanford compen
sated very well for Ceresino,"
Cal coach Mike White said.
"When you lose a playerof that
caliber it isn't that easy to ad
just. It is to their credit that they
did and the score reflects it."
Stanford lit the scoreboard
again in the second quarter
when the Cards drove 80 yards
in eight plays, the key play a

38-yard bomb from Benjamin
to the leaping Lofton. The
6-foot-3 senior had five recep
tions for 92 yards Saturday and
finished the season as the top
pass receiver in the Pacific-8
with 53 receptions.
Diving TD
With second-and-goal from
the one, Benjamin faked play
direction to the right, spun and
handed the ball to Francis who
leaped over left tackle for the
score.
"It was a 63 counter between
Jimmy Stephens and myself,"
said King, whoanchorsthe line
from his left tackle spot. "It's
hard to slow Phil down when
we get down near the goal
line."
Cal, on the other hand, en
countered numerous problems
trying to cross the end stripe.
"We just couldn't generate any
offense," said White. "We
came out at the start of the sec
ond half and executed well but
just couldn't get into the end
zone."
The Bears did get close
enough for a 48-yard field goal
by Jim Breech early in the third
quarter. But that was it.
Cards score too
Stanford replied to Breech's
field goal with an 80-yard drive
capped by an 8-yard scoring
toss from Benjamin to Lofton.
The TD gave Lofton 12
touchdown receptions on the
year and broke the Stanford
season mark for touchdowns.
After the Stanford score, Cal
soughtquick retaliation and on
its second play quarterback
Gary Graumann heaved a 49-
yard pass to flanker Jesse
Thompson.
The Bears had first down on
the Stanford 15. Three straight
passes to Thompson went in
complete, however, and Cal
had faced fourth-and-10. White
decided to go for the first down
rather than attempt a field goal.
Graumann dropped back and
fired a pass which hit
Thompson in the bread basket
but Stanford cornerback Rick

Parker reached around
Thompson and knocked the
ball out of his grasp.
Another thrust, another parry
Charlie Young came in at
quarterback for the second time
in the game at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. Young di
rected the Bears to a first down
on the Stanford 10.
Two running plays and an
incomplete pass left Cal with
fourth-and-seven. Young tos
sed a pass to Thompson but he
couldn't hold on to it.
Cal had one more opportun
ity to score midway through
the final period. Driving to the
Stanford 10, the Golden Bears
faltered once more as the Car
dinal defense entrenched itself
near the goal line for a third
time.
"When you get behind/'
White said, "the defense has
that extra opportunity to gam
ble. For some reason, we just
couldn't get that big play when
we needed it, but it's to their
credit that they came up with
the crucial defensive play."
Looking ahead
Stanford has six weeks to
prepare for its New Year's Eve
Day confrontation with LSU's
Bengal Tigers. For right now,
though, Walsh said, "I just
want to think about this one."
The triumph gave Stanford
an 8-3 season record (5-2 in the
Pac-8) which equals any regu
lar season record for the Cards
since 1951. The win also gave
the Cards the first unbeaten,
untied season at home in 37
years. The Cards were 6-0 at
home this year.
Cal, too, can reflecton a good
season. The Bears finished 7-4,
including a 17-14 upset of
use
"I have to be disappointed to
finish this waybut I thought we
did real well for the entire sea
son if you could cross out this
one game," said White. "Un
fortunately the Big Game is a
one-game season."
Such is the emotion of the
Big Game.

Cardinal defensive backs John Pigott (24) and Ralph Phillips close in on a Cal ball carrier in Saturday's 21-3 Big Game victory.
Big Games are traditionally
caldrons of turbulent pathos,
games won more by heart and
desire than skill and brawn.
Saturday's 80th renewal of the
Stanford-California football
rivalry was no exception.
An emotionally high Stan
ford football team shut down
Calif6rnia, 21-3, to retain pos
session of the Axe and secure
an invitation to the Sun Bowl
in El Paso, Texas, where the
Cardinals will meet Louisiana
State Dec. 31.
"This win came from every
body's heart, from the guys on
defense, the guys on offense,
the guys on the special teams
and even from guys who didn't
play," said Stanford quarter
back Guy Benjamin in the loc
kerroom after the Card victory.
Benjamin has said that tran
quilityand calmness are essen
tial to his performance as a
quarterback. But Saturday,
Benjamin, who normally plays
with a stoic exterior, was jump
ing up and down and hugging
teammates after big plays.
"The whole team did the
same thing," Benjamin said of
his emotional play. "Every
body was into it."
Special meeting
Benjamin completed 16of 27
passes for 211 yards, one
touchdown and no intercep
tions against the Bears. But his
major contribution to the vic
tory Saturday may have come
earlier in the week when the
Stanford captain called a team

meeting Wednesday before
practice.
The meeting was held.with
out coaches and Benjamin re
portedly opened it by discus
sing the mechanical approach
the Cards had played with in
their losses to Washington and
use.
"We didn't have a team
meeting all year," Benjamin
said. "We didn't communicate
with each other. Wednesday
we all talked and everybody
knew where everybody else
was coming from."
"It was an incredible meet
ing," said Stanford cornerback
John Pigott. "Mostly seniors
talked, guys like Benjamin,
James Lofton, Bill Kellar and
Cordon King, and they tried to
convey the whole meaning of
the Big Came.
"It was the big turning point
this week. From then on I knew
we would win. When we play
an emotionally high game we
don't lose."
Perfunctory practice
"We were too mechanical at
practice Monday and Tues
day," King said. "I think Guy
called the meeting. He said it
wasour last game and we'd (let
ter give it everything or we'd
regret it later. It really got the
juices going."
The team had one more
meeting without the coaches
last week — in the field house
at the stadium just before
Saturday's opening • kickoff.

Cal had one more opportun
ity to score midway through
the final period. Driving to the
Stanford 10, the Golden Bears
faltered once more as the Car
dinal defense entrenched itself
near the goal line for a third
time.
"When you get behind/'
White said, "the defense has
that extra opportunity to gam
ble. For some reason, we just
couldn't get that big play when
we needed it, but it's to their
credit that they came up with
the crucial defensive play."
Looking ahead
Stanford has six weeks to
prepare for its New Year's Eve
Day confrontation with LSU's
Bengal Tigers. For right now,
though, Walsh said, "I just
want to think about this one."
The triumph gave Stanford
an 8-3 season record (5-2 in the
Pac-8) which equals any regu
lar season record for the Cards
since 1951. The win also gave
the Cards the first unbeaten,
untied season at home in 37
years. The Cards were 6-0 at
home this year.
Cal, too, can reflecton a good
season. The Bears finished 7-4,
including a 17-14 upset of
use
"I have to be disappointed to
finish this waybut I thought we
did real well for the entire sea
son if you could cross out this
one game," said White. "Un
fortunately the Big Game is a
one-game season."
Such is the emotion of the
Big Game.

Big Games are traditionally
caldrons of turbulent pathos,
games won more by heart and
desire than skill and brawn.
Saturday's 80th renewal of the
Stanford-California football
rivalry was no exception.
An emotionally high Stan
ford football team shut down
Calif6rnia, 21-3, to retain pos
session of the Axe and secure
an invitation to the Sun Bowl
in El Paso, Texas, where the
Cardinals will meet Louisiana
State Dec. 31.
"This win came from every
body's heart, from the guys on
defense, the guys on offense,
the guys on the special teams
and even from guys who didn't
play," said Stanford quarter
back Guy Benjamin in the loc
kerroom after the Card victory.
Benjamin has said that tran
quilityand calmness are essen
tial to his performance as a
quarterback. But Saturday,
Benjamin, who normally plays
with a stoic exterior, was jump
ing up and down and hugging
teammates after big plays.
"The whole team did the
same thing," Benjamin said of
his emotional play. "Every
body was into it."
Special meeting
Benjamin completed 16of 27
passes for 211 yards, one
touchdown and no intercep
tions against the Bears. But his
major contribution to the vic
tory Saturday may have come
earlier in the week when the
Stanford captain called a team

meeting Wednesday before
practice.
The meeting was held.with
out coaches and Benjamin re
portedly opened it by discus
sing the mechanical approach
the Cards had played with in
their losses to Washington and
use.
"We didn't have a team
meeting all year," Benjamin
said. "We didn't communicate
with each other. Wednesday
we all talked and everybody
knew where everybody else
was coming from."
"It was an incredible meet
ing," said Stanford cornerback
John Pigott. "Mostly seniors
talked, guys like Benjamin,
James Lofton, Bill Kellar and
Cordon King, and they tried to
convey the whole meaning of
the Big Came.
"It was the big turning point
this week. From then on I knew
we would win. When we play
an emotionally high game we
don't lose."
Perfunctory practice
"We were too mechanical at
practice Monday and Tues
day," King said. "I think Guy
called the meeting. He said it
wasour last game and we'd (let
ter give it everything or we'd
regret it later. It really got the
juices going."
The team had one more
meeting without the coaches
last week — in the field house
at the stadium just before
Saturday's opening • kickoff.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis leaps over the line for a second-quarter touchdown and tackle Gordon King (72) opened the hole for Francis on this counter which
in the Cards' 21-3 victory over California Saturday. Guard Jimmy Stephens (63) also brought Francis aTD in tne first quarter.
That meeting also stirred Stan
ford emotions.
Quick score
The Cards took the opening
kickoff 78 yards in 16 plays
with fullback Phil Francis
plunging over from the 2-yard
line to give Stanford a 7-0 ad
vantage before Cal even
touched the ball. It was the first
first-quarter touchdown scored
against the Golden Bears all
season.
Before Francis found
paydirt, however, freshman
running phenom Darrin Nel
son became the first Cardinal
runner to ever rush for more
than 1000 yards in one season
when he picked up 13 yards on
a run around left end.
Nelson finished the game
with 94 yards on 23 carries. He
rushed for 1069 yards this fall
and is only the sixth freshman
running back in NCAA history
to gain more than 1000 yards
on the ground in his freshman
year.
Scoring on the first drive
"helped us a lot," said King.
"We did the same thing against
UCLA. We got our momentum
going. The first drive was an
indication to us that we could
move the ball on them."
Taking its cue from the of
fense, the Stanford defense
came out fired-up and halted
the Bears at the California 22.
"The key to the game was our
defensive play," Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said. "Ourde
fensive men were in the proper
positions and carried out the
details of football."
Bell rung
Early in the second quarter
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino was toppled
with a mild concussion which
left the Cards' leading tackier
watching the game from the
sidelines for the rest of the af
ternoon.
Steve Budinger replaced
Ceresino and did an outstand
ing job anchoring the middle of
the Stanford defense.
"I thought Stanford compen
sated very well for Ceresino,"
Cal coach Mike White said.
"When you lose a playerof that
caliber it isn't that easy to ad
just. It is to their credit that they
did and the score reflects it."
Stanford lit the scoreboard
again in the second quarter
when the Cards drove 80 yards
in eight plays, the key play a

38-yard bomb from Benjamin
to the leaping Lofton. The
6-foot-3 senior had five recep
tions for 92 yards Saturday and
finished the season as the top
pass receiver in the Pacific-8
with 53 receptions.
Diving TD
With second-and-goal from
the one, Benjamin faked play
direction to the right, spun and
handed the ball to Francis who
leaped over left tackle for the
score.
"It was a 63 counter between
Jimmy Stephens and myself,"
said King, whoanchorsthe line
from his left tackle spot. "It's
hard to slow Phil down when
we get down near the goal
line."
Cal, on the other hand, en
countered numerous problems
trying to cross the end stripe.
"We just couldn't generate any
offense," said White. "We
came out at the start of the sec
ond half and executed well but
just couldn't get into the end
zone."
The Bears did get close
enough for a 48-yard field goal
by Jim Breech early in the third
quarter. But that was it.
Cards score too
Stanford replied to Breech's
field goal with an 80-yard drive
capped by an 8-yard scoring
toss from Benjamin to Lofton.
The TD gave Lofton 12
touchdown receptions on the
year and broke the Stanford
season mark for touchdowns.
After the Stanford score, Cal
soughtquick retaliation and on
its second play quarterback
Gary Graumann heaved a 49-
yard pass to flanker Jesse
Thompson.
The Bears had first down on
the Stanford 15. Three straight
passes to Thompson went in
complete, however, and Cal
had faced fourth-and-10. White
decided to go for the first down
rather than attempt a field goal.
Graumann dropped back and
fired a pass which hit
Thompson in the bread basket
but Stanford cornerback Rick

Parker reached around
Thompson and knocked the
ball out of his grasp.
Another thrust, another parry
Charlie Young came in at
quarterback for the second time
in the game at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. Young di
rected the Bears to a first down
on the Stanford 10.
Two running plays and an
incomplete pass left Cal with
fourth-and-seven. Young tos
sed a pass to Thompson but he
couldn't hold on to it.
Cal had one more opportun
ity to score midway through
the final period. Driving to the

The team had one more
meeting without the coaches
last week — in the field house
at the stadium just before
Saturday's opening • kickoff.

Stanford fullback Phil Francis leaps over the line for a second-quarter touchdown and tackle Gordon King (72) opened the hole for Francis on this counter which
in the Cards' 21-3 victory over California Saturday. Guard Jimmy Stephens (63) also brought Francis aTD in tne first quarter.
That meeting also stirred Stan
ford emotions.
Quick score
The Cards took the opening
kickoff 78 yards in 16 plays
with fullback Phil Francis
plunging over from the 2-yard
line to give Stanford a 7-0 ad
vantage before Cal even
touched the ball. It was the first
first-quarter touchdown scored
against the Golden Bears all
season.
Before Francis found
paydirt, however, freshman
running phenom Darrin Nel
son became the first Cardinal
runner to ever rush for more
than 1000 yards in one season
when he picked up 13 yards on
a run around left end.
Nelson finished the game
with 94 yards on 23 carries. He
rushed for 1069 yards this fall
and is only the sixth freshman
running back in NCAA history
to gain more than 1000 yards
on the ground in his freshman
year.
Scoring on the first drive
"helped us a lot," said King.
"We did the same thing against
UCLA. We got our momentum
going. The first drive was an
indication to us that we could
move the ball on them."
Taking its cue from the of
fense, the Stanford defense
came out fired-up and halted
the Bears at the California 22.
"The key to the game was our
defensive play," Stanford
coach Bill Walsh said. "Ourde
fensive men were in the proper
positions and carried out the
details of football."
Bell rung
Early in the second quarter
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino was toppled
with a mild concussion which
left the Cards' leading tackier
watching the game from the
sidelines for the rest of the af
ternoon.
Steve Budinger replaced
Ceresino and did an outstand
ing job anchoring the middle of
the Stanford defense.
"I thought Stanford compen
sated very well for Ceresino,"
Cal coach Mike White said.
"When you lose a playerof that
caliber it isn't that easy to ad
just. It is to their credit that they
did and the score reflects it."
Stanford lit the scoreboard
again in the second quarter
when the Cards drove 80 yards
in eight plays, the key play a

38-yard bomb from Benjamin
to the leaping Lofton. The
6-foot-3 senior had five recep
tions for 92 yards Saturday and
finished the season as the top
pass receiver in the Pacific-8
with 53 receptions.
Diving TD
With second-and-goal from
the one, Benjamin faked play
direction to the right, spun and
handed the ball to Francis who
leaped over left tackle for the
score.
"It was a 63 counter between
Jimmy Stephens and myself,"
said King, whoanchorsthe line
from his left tackle spot. "It's
hard to slow Phil down when
we get down near the goal
line."
Cal, on the other hand, en
countered numerous problems
trying to cross the end stripe.
"We just couldn't generate any
offense," said White. "We
came out at the start of the sec
ond half and executed well but
just couldn't get into the end
zone."
The Bears did get close
enough for a 48-yard field goal
by Jim Breech early in the third
quarter. But that was it.
Cards score too
Stanford replied to Breech's
field goal with an 80-yard drive
capped by an 8-yard scoring
toss from Benjamin to Lofton.
The TD gave Lofton 12
touchdown receptions on the
year and broke the Stanford
season mark for touchdowns.
After the Stanford score, Cal
soughtquick retaliation and on
its second play quarterback
Gary Graumann heaved a 49-
yard pass to flanker Jesse
Thompson.
The Bears had first down on
the Stanford 15. Three straight
passes to Thompson went in
complete, however, and Cal
had faced fourth-and-10. White
decided to go for the first down
rather than attempt a field goal.
Graumann dropped back and
fired a pass which hit
Thompson in the bread basket
but Stanford cornerback Rick

Parker reached around
Thompson and knocked the
ball out of his grasp.
Another thrust, another parry
Charlie Young came in at
quarterback for the second time
in the game at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. Young di
rected the Bears to a first down
on the Stanford 10.
Two running plays and an
incomplete pass left Cal with
fourth-and-seven. Young tos
sed a pass to Thompson but he
couldn't hold on to it.
Cal had one more opportun
ity to score midway through
the final period. Driving to the
Stanford 10, the Golden Bears
faltered once more as the Car
dinal defense entrenched itself
near the goal line for a third
time.
"When you get behind/'
White said, "the defense has
that extra opportunity to gam
ble. For some reason, we just
couldn't get that big play when
we needed it, but it's to their
credit that they came up with
the crucial defensive play."
Looking ahead
Stanford has six weeks to
prepare for its New Year's Eve
Day confrontation with LSU's
Bengal Tigers. For right now,
though, Walsh said, "I just
want to think about this one."
The triumph gave Stanford
an 8-3 season record (5-2 in the
Pac-8) which equals any regu
lar season record for the Cards
since 1951. The win also gave
the Cards the first unbeaten,
untied season at home in 37
years. The Cards were 6-0 at
home this year.
Cal, too, can reflecton a good
season. The Bears finished 7-4,
including a 17-14 upset of
use
"I have to be disappointed to
finish this waybut I thought we
did real well for the entire sea
son if you could cross out this
one game," said White. "Un
fortunately the Big Game is a
one-game season."
Such is the emotion of the
Big Game.

Big Games are traditionally
caldrons of turbulent pathos,
games won more by heart and
desire than skill and brawn.
Saturday's 80th renewal of the
Stanford-California football
rivalry was no exception.
An emotionally high Stan
ford football team shut down
Calif6rnia, 21-3, to retain pos
session of the Axe and secure
an invitation to the Sun Bowl
in El Paso, Texas, where the
Cardinals will meet Louisiana
State Dec. 31.
"This win came from every
body's heart, from the guys on
defense, the guys on offense,
the guys on the special teams
and even from guys who didn't
play," said Stanford quarter
back Guy Benjamin in the loc
kerroom after the Card victory.
Benjamin has said that tran
quilityand calmness are essen
tial to his performance as a
quarterback. But Saturday,
Benjamin, who normally plays
with a stoic exterior, was jump
ing up and down and hugging
teammates after big plays.
"The whole team did the
same thing," Benjamin said of
his emotional play. "Every
body was into it."
Special meeting
Benjamin completed 16of 27
passes for 211 yards, one
touchdown and no intercep
tions against the Bears. But his
major contribution to the vic
tory Saturday may have come
earlier in the week when the
Stanford captain called a team

meeting Wednesday before
practice.
The meeting was held.with
out coaches and Benjamin re
portedly opened it by discus
sing the mechanical approach
the Cards had played with in
their losses to Washington and
use.
"We didn't have a team
meeting all year," Benjamin
said. "We didn't communicate
with each other. Wednesday
we all talked and everybody
knew where everybody else
was coming from."
"It was an incredible meet
ing," said Stanford cornerback
John Pigott. "Mostly seniors
talked, guys like Benjamin,
James Lofton, Bill Kellar and
Cordon King, and they tried to
convey the whole meaning of
the Big Came.
"It was the big turning point
this week. From then on I knew
we would win. When we play
an emotionally high game we
don't lose."

trying to cross the end stripe.
"We just couldn't generate any
offense," said White. "We
came out at the start of the sec
ond half and executed well but
just couldn't get into the end
zone."
The Bears did get close
enough for a 48-yard field goal
by Jim Breech early in the third
quarter. But that was it.
Cards score too
Stanford replied to Breech's
field goal with an 80-yard drive
capped by an 8-yard scoring
toss from Benjamin to Lofton.
The TD gave Lofton 12
touchdown receptions on the
year and broke the Stanford
season mark for touchdowns.
After the Stanford score, Cal
soughtquick retaliation and on
its second play quarterback
Gary Graumann heaved a 49-
yard pass to flanker Jesse
Thompson.
The Bears had first down on
the Stanford 15. Three straight
passes to Thompson went in
complete, however, and Cal
had faced fourth-and-10. White
decided to go for the first down
rather than attempt a field goal.
Graumann dropped back and
fired a pass which hit
Thompson in the bread basket
but Stanford cornerback Rick

Parker reached around
Thompson and knocked the
ball out of his grasp.
Another thrust, another parry
Charlie Young came in at
quarterback for the second time
in the game at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. Young di
rected the Bears to a first down
on the Stanford 10.
Two running plays and an
incomplete pass left Cal with
fourth-and-seven. Young tos
sed a pass to Thompson but he
couldn't hold on to it.
Cal had one more opportun
ity to score midway through
the final period. Driving to the
Stanford 10, the Golden Bears
faltered once more as the Car
dinal defense entrenched itself
near the goal line for a third
time.
"When you get behind/'
White said, "the defense has
that extra opportunity to gam
ble. For some reason, we just
couldn't get that big play when
we needed it, but it's to their
credit that they came up with
the crucial defensive play."
Looking ahead
Stanford has six weeks to
prepare for its New Year's Eve
Day confrontation with LSU's
Bengal Tigers. For right now,
though, Walsh said, "I just
want to think about this one."
The triumph gave Stanford
an 8-3 season record (5-2 in the
Pac-8) which equals any regu
lar season record for the Cards
since 1951. The win also gave
the Cards the first unbeaten,
untied season at home in 37
years. The Cards were 6-0 at
home this year.
Cal, too, can reflecton a good
season. The Bears finished 7-4,
including a 17-14 upset of
use
"I have to be disappointed to
finish this waybut I thought we
did real well for the entire sea
son if you could cross out this
one game," said White. "Un
fortunately the Big Game is a
one-game season."
Such is the emotion of the
Big Game.
