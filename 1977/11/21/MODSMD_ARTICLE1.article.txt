# Cards throttle Cal 21-3; get Sun Bowl bid
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Big Games are traditionally
caldrons of turbulent pathos,
games won more by heart and
desire than skill and brawn.
Saturday's 80th renewal of the
Stanford-California football
rivalry was no exception.
An emotionally high Stan
ford football team shut down
Calif6rnia, 21-3, to retain pos
session of the Axe and secure
an invitation to the Sun Bowl
in El Paso, Texas, where the
Cardinals will meet Louisiana
State Dec. 31.
"This win came from every
body's heart, from the guys on
defense, the guys on offense,
the guys on the special teams
and even from guys who didn't
play," said Stanford quarter
back Guy Benjamin in the loc
kerroom after the Card victory.
Benjamin has said that tran
quilityand calmness are essen
tial to his performance as a
quarterback. But Saturday,
Benjamin, who normally plays
with a stoic exterior, was jump
ing up and down and hugging
teammates after big plays.
"The whole team did the
same thing," Benjamin said of
his emotional play. "Every
body was into it."
Special meeting
Benjamin completed 16of 27
passes for 211 yards, one
touchdown and no intercep
tions against the Bears. But his
major contribution to the vic
tory Saturday may have come
earlier in the week when the
Stanford captain called a team

meeting Wednesday before
practice.
The meeting was held.with
out coaches and Benjamin re
portedly opened it by discus
sing the mechanical approach
the Cards had played with in
their losses to Washington and
use.
"We didn't have a team
meeting all year," Benjamin
said. "We didn't communicate
with each other. Wednesday
we all talked and everybody
knew where everybody else
was coming from."
"It was an incredible meet
ing," said Stanford cornerback
John Pigott. "Mostly seniors
talked, guys like Benjamin,
James Lofton, Bill Kellar and
Cordon King, and they tried to
convey the whole meaning of
the Big Came.
"It was the big turning point
this week. From then on I knew
we would win. When we play
an emotionally high game we
don't lose."
Perfunctory practice
"We were too mechanical at
practice Monday and Tues
day," King said. "I think Guy
called the meeting. He said it
wasour last game and we'd (let
ter give it everything or we'd
regret it later. It really got the
juices going."
The team had one more
meeting without the coaches
last week — in the field house
at the stadium just before
Saturday's opening • kickoff.
