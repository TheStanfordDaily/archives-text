Nutrition classes?
As a visitor to the Stanford campus
I read with interest the articles in the
Stanford Daily devoted to famine and
malnutrition. A few hours later I was
leafing through a 1976-77 Stanford
Bulletin in the apartment I am stay
ing and could find only one course
offered in the area of nutrition. Am I
right that only one undergraduate
course is offered on the Stanford
campus in the field of nutrition?
I suppose I am surprised since
Stanford is one of the better known
American universities. Yet other
well known U.S. universities have
excel lent graduate programs in nutri
tion; for example Cornell, Harvard,
Johns Hopkins, MIT and the Univer
sities of California and Wisconsin.
I hope I am mistaken, for it would
be shocking for Stanford University
students not to have access to lec
tures in this area of major intellectual
and scientific concern.

Counter-criticism
It is distressing that Paul Hariton's
thoughtful and incisive criticism of
the photograph of two gay men on
the front page of Nov. I's Daily
(Daily, Nov. 7) must be defended
against counter-criticism that is, if
not completely thoughtless, at least
woefully superficial.
It was apparently not enough for
Hariton to have pointed out that the
photograph is oppressive because it
reinforces a stereotypical image of
gay men which is inapplicable to
many of us.
In her letter (Daily, Nov. 14), Sha
ron Aglito makes the very demand
that the Daily made by printing the
photo in the first place (prominently
on the front page, so that only a
"brief, neutral comment" was
needed: the editors are aware of,
though not particularly subtle at ap
plying, the tricks of understatement):
that all gay people identify their per
sonal idea of "gay pride, gay rights,
and gay as an acceptable, alternative
lifestyle" with the activity in the
photograph.
Cay love, including theexample in
the photograph, is no more "a dis
gusting example of blatant indiscre
tion" than straight love. Take a walk
through White Plaza on a sunny day
and see the straight couples straddl

ing each other "right there in pub
lic." For some people such scenes are
a "disgusting" display of heterosex
ual privilege.
While the Daily photograph is op
pressive to gay people for the reasons
that Hariton cites, it is at the same
time a defiant political statement it
is an image of freedom to express
love howeverone may. Straights who
find their delicate sensibilities of
fended by it should examine their
own behavior. Chances are that the
gay behavior most offensive to Aglito
and most straights is a transference of
straight society's stereotypical male
female sex-role playing into same sex
relations. And it is precisely this re
quirement to play roles that many
gays are fighting.

Encina gym
I wish to draw your attention to the
unsanitary and dangerous condi
tions which prevail at Encinagym.lt
is a health hazard on several counts.
1. The exercise benches are never dis
infected and the floor seldom
cleaned. As a result, there is con
stant danger of skin disease, as
many users work out without a
shirt on and so the benches are

often drenched with perspiration.
2. The gym is probably the main
source of flu and related respirat
ory diseases on campus because of
the extreme crowding together of
people breathing heavily on each
other.
3. The major danger is that of injury
resulting from excessive crowd
ing. At peak hours, as many as 100
persons are packed together like
sardines in a relatively small area.
One student may be doing sit-ups
within inches of another attempt
ing to lift 200 pounds over his
head. The slightest loss of balance
could result in a broken limb or
crushed back.
Cleaning the rooms more fre
quently and disinfecting theexercise
benches periodically would cer
tainly help. As for crowding, it could
be reduced by keeping the gym open
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. as it used to be.
Curiously enough, the hours of ac
cess were reduced precisely at a time
when the number of users increased
considerably. (The Nautilus
machines have attracted many new
users and, happily, women no longer
consider the gym a restricted area.)
These conditions were brought to
the attention of the Physical Educa
tion Department. Alas, to no avail.
