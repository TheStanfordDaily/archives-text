# Author sees value in diaries, letters

Revealing the private lives —
sexual or otherwise — of re
knowned persons has a pur
pose and does not discredit
those involved, according to
British author and publisher
Nigel Nicolson.
The Daily interviewed
Nicholson Friday at Tresidder.
"If they were very interesting
people living courageous lives,
nothing can take away from
their stature," Nicolson said as
he puffed calmly on a Player
cigarette he had brought with
him to this country just 20
hours before.
"If they were mean people,
cruel or insignificant people
not worth considering, then
such information would
damage them. But for fine
courageous people, all revela
tions merely tell us more about
them," he said.
Marriage
He was, of course, referring to
his parents, author Vita
Sackvilie-West and Sir Harold
Nicolson, a diplomat, whose
letters and diaries he hasedited
and about whom his book "Por
trait of a Marriage" was writ
ten.
"Portrait" described his pa
rents' marriage, which thrived
even though both were en
gaged in extra-marital
homosexual affairs. '
Nicolson took a sip of his
sweet coffee and said his pa
rents' "open marriage" af
fected him "considerably" —
not so much at the time of his
childhood as within the last 10
years when he was reading
their letters and diaries.
"I understood them much
better. A lot of what they were
saying is very consistent with
the way people'sop in ion today
has moved.
Separate lives
"Women must be allowed
their separate lives, careers,
friends and have their separate
love affairs. My parents in the
1920s were not only saying
these things, but practicing
them," he said.
Virginia Woolf was a close
friend of Vita Sackville-West, al
though never her lover. Nicol
son has edited the first three
volumes of a six-volume series
of Woolf's letters.
The subject of his lecture at 8
tonight in Bishop Auditorium
will be the third volume of
Woolf's letters.
"I knew her very well,"
Nicolson said. "She was a very
intimate friend of my mother,
Vita. She'd visit us at Knole in
Kent or at Long Barn where I
spent my early childhood.
Storyteller
"She used to tell us stories.
Once we were traveling in a
train to London. There was

only one other man in the car
riage with us. She told me, 'See
that man? He is a bus conduc
tor from Leeds.'
"I asked her 'How do you
know?' and she replied, 'There
is no question about it.' Then
she would tell us the man's life
story in the next hour. Of
course she didn't even know
who he was," Nicolson said.
Nicolson said he was invited
to write the volumes byQuen
tin Bell, Woolf's nephew and
accepted the challenge.
Best letter writer
"I think Virginia Woolf was
one of the best letter writers of
this century.
"She is a woman who will
remain enormously important
to British literature for cen
turies to come. If the letters are
not published now, they will
be forever lost and scattered.
"I think enough time has
passed that we can publish
these very private letters with
out any indiscretion," Nicol
son said.
The first task was to gather
the 4500 letters from libraries
and friends, then date them and
put them in chronological or
der.
"She used to often only write
'Tuesday' on her letters. Well,
which Tuesday was it?" Nicol
son said.
He said he often re lied on in
ternal evidence in the letters to
date them.

"Then, reading her hand
writing was terribly difficult,"
Nicolson said, with his very
British accent.
"It was a cramped little
handwriting. Later she de
veloped a very distinguished
hand. We'd spend hours over
her work. We'd even look at it
in mirrors."
This two-week tour is Nicol
son's first visit to the United
States, despite his distin
guished career as a Grenadine
Guard in Italy and Tunisia dur
ing World War 11, and asa Co
nservative Member of Parlia
ment from 1952 to 1959.
"The Grenadine Guards are
historically the elite of the
British infantry," Nicolson
said. He is the author of a war
time history of the guards enti
tled, "TheGrenadineGuards in
the Second World War."
Certain snobbishness
"There is a certain snobbish
ness attached to them. They are
the spearhead troops, similar to
your Marines. They're put in
tougher spots. The survival
rate is lower, the casualty rate
higher than in other regi
ments," he said.
Nicolson managed toend his
duty in Italy and Tunisia "un
scathed" which "is a shame. It
would have been nice to have a
few scars around," he said.
The biggest controversy
Nicolson faced as a Member of

Parliament was the Suez Crisis.
"I took a line against my own
party's Prime Minister. I was
opposed to the Suez Crisis,"
Nicolson said.
"Being against your own
party and Prime Minister, was
considered shameful then, like
shooting your colonel in the
back.
"I felt the liaison between us,
Egypt, France and Israel was
wrong in principle. We were
acting a big lie by going in for
one reason ('to separate the
Jews and the Arabs') when our
real intention was to overturn
Nasser and seize the Canal."
This internal battle went on
for two years until finally, in
1958, the first and only primary
election in British political his
tory was held. Nicolson's con
stituents in Bournemouth East
and Christchurch were asked
whether they wanted Nicolson
to continue being their rep
resentative.
"Twenty thousand people
voted. I lost by 61 votes. Thank
God I didn't win by 61 votes. I
could now resign in dignity,"
Nicolson said.
Nicolson has three children
and is divorced after 15 years of
marriage. Considering his pa
rents' unusual marriage which
"paradoxically became such a
success," Nicolson said he is
"not against marriage, but
against boring marriages."
