# Big Game Week: A school spirit revival
## 
### 
Two points are obvious. The
Cards retained the Axe. And
Band members slept about four
hours a night for a straight
week.
Behind these statistics were
an array of other events, the
total of which comprised the
revived Big Game "Fiesta"
Week.
For those who Ii ve to eat and
for others who enjoy a free
coke, the TDS Food Service
sponsored daily specials in
Tresidder and the Commons.
"Bearburgers," honey-covered
yogurt and bear claws were
some of the other discounted
items offered throughout the
week.
Wednesday noon brought
the traditional bear baiting of
the late '60s, as cheerleaders
marched Cal's Oski Bear up

White Plaza, dumping him into
the fountain for Big Game Bea
rial '77.
Not at Harvard
"I would have preferred
seeing Vale's Ely bulldog
drowning there. But it was hys
terica!. I never saw this at Ivy
League Harvard," one student
said.
"We're starting all over,"
said Boh Moog, Instant Rally
Commissioner and organizer
for Fiesta Week. "This could be
the beginning of a new era at
Stanford."
Student sentiment in favor of
the week mounted as the game
drew nearer. "This has been a
guaranteed write-off week,"
one student said. "It's been a
darned good excuse to party."

"l don't know what's going
on, but people sure seem to be
having fun with it," a middle
aged business student said.
The screen of Cubberley Au
ditorium evoked series of
screams and laughs as over 420
people watched movie clips of
yesteryear, narrated by Ralph
Hanson of the Stanford Arc
hives, Wednesday night.
All that jazz
Come Thursday, Stanford's
Jazz Band and the Glee Club
performed at Tresidder and
several frats unveiled decora
tions on their house facades
depicting the inevitable
downfall of Cal'sOski Bear.
Into Thursday evening,
quickly Friday morning, the
Leland Stanford Band rendez
voused the campus in an at
your-door rally.
"This is a really existential
experience," one woman re
marked as the Band scattered
apart down the road.
"I've never seen those trum
peters in such intense spirit.
Why doesn't the University
just cancel everything else ex
cept this happy-go-lucky
stuff?" another student
queried.
TGI F
Activities across the board
built up to Friday's Inter-
Fraternity Council sponsored
Mega-Nooner, held in the Flo
Mo field. Frisbees flew for over
three hours, and 50 kegs were
on hand for the live band.
"Gaieties," a satirical revue
of Stanford life drew many-a
smile and some walloping
laughs from audiences who
witnessed Dean Hargedon and
his angels strut across stage.
"It was rude, awful, but boy
was it great," remarked one
student on her way out the
door. "I was really going
crazy."
"Yeah, she was going crazy
all right," said another.
"I would usually say I've got
to study and work hard, you
know, be the typical diligent
Stanford student. The hell with
that. Who cares if I flunk a
course? I'm psyched forever,"
one woman said.
After a flaming non-fire
Band rally, Little Leland's
Latter-Day Railroad departed
for the legendary Frisco Band
march, a 11 of which culminated

in an all-campus slumber
party.
Yeah, team
"People seem to be really
happy that there's spirit. They
can certainly tell there's a dif
ference between this week and
all the rest. But the team's made
it great by giving such an excit
ing season," Moog said.
For, after Fiesta Week's last
partying event, it was all in
how the Bears played their
Cards. Big Game gates opened
at 11 a.m., letting through a
crowd of 87,500 who watched
the Cards hatchet the Bears
21-3.
"I've absolutely loved this
week. All the activity and ex
citement really reminds me of
my years here in the '30s. It
used to be really on-the-farm
but it's totally different now,"
one alum said.
A Stanford crowd "psyched
but fatigued" spent Saturday
evening either catching Zappa
tunes at Maples Pavilion, en

gaging in bare bear hugsor col
lapsing.
"Beat Cal" buttons and In
dian feathers returned to draw
ers in hopes of another" Fiesta"
next year.
—EMILY SACHAR
Band on the run
San Francisco — It seems
silly to write about Friday
night. Anyone who was there
knows what it was like — and
everyone was there.
The residents of Francisco
Street had undoubtedly never
seen anything like it before: a
flash flood of red, white and
drums.
They witnessed porch-to
porch people: a fast flowing de
luge three blocks long that ig
nored red lights, irate motorists
and the lackof a parade permit.
The natives seemed not to
mind. Having unwittingly lent
their street, they added their

yells of encouragement to
those outside.
Somewhere in midstream
(along with anorangeOpel that
had ventured in too deep) was
the excuse tor the incompara
ble demonstration: the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Almost like lemmings
Distinguishable in the dim
streetsonly by the tubas visible
above their heads, the Pied
Pipers of Stanford directed the
flow past Gh i rarde 11 i Square to
the shore of Aquatic Park.
If they had marched straight
on, wading into the Bay, there's
a good chance that several
thousand otherwise intelligent
and restrained students would
have followed.
But those "madcap masters
of musical mayhem" had
slightly warmer things in
mind.
Descending upon an inti
mate couple's beach fire, the
Band formed its standard rag
ged semicircle on the sand.
They faced a suddenly statio
nary audience, which had been
diverted into the park's
bleachers.
Illuminated by a half moon
and a single streetlight, the
LSJUMB filled the cold, clear
night with more than an hour
of music.
Practice makes perfect
Decked out in gas masks or
blinking helmets, playing cow
bells or 36-key toy pianos, the
musicians (and assorted rin
gers and groupies) put together
one of their best performances
of the year.
Perhaps the fact that it was
the group's 10th show of the
week had something to do with
that.
Microphones on a 15-foot
stand, swaying dangerously
above drum major Jim Jett,
helped record many of the 20-
some songs for stereophonic
posterity.
The lively audience partici
pated in the show, jingling
keys, clapping, singing along
— and a lone trumpeter some
where in the stands helped out
with the brassier refrains.

The Band played long and hard on the shores of the bay near
Ghirardelli Square Friday night (top center). Counterclockwise
from top right, drum major |im Jett gets a lift from Oski bear at
the Big Came; the cast nas a blast in a Caieties routine Friday
night; yell leaders join the Dollies and Band in a rousing Alma
Mater.

The crowd's activity was half
inspired by the need to keep
warm; concrete seats at mid
night had a chilling effect as
the night wore on.
"My toes have never been so
happy to hear 'All Right
Now,' " was one woman's reac
tion to the night's eventual
conclusion.
An apartment-dweller over
looking the beach tried to add
to the visual effect, but his
balcony-mounted strobe light
was sadlyout of synch with the
beat below.
Red cheeks, white noses
Let us not forget the yell
leaders and Dollies, who, in
addition to their usual duties,
spelledout"Stanford"by lying
on a cold sidewalk and de
monstrated conclusively that it
is possible to swing to the tune
of "Squeezebox."
No accurate crowd count
was possible. For one thing,

there was no one vantage point
from which to count several
thousand frosty noses. For
another, the police, who can
usually offer an estimate, were
nowhere to be seen.
(There were reports that two
police cars were seen in the
areaafter the rallybroke up,but
their presence wasn't made
known to the celebrants.)
At any rate, the spirited Big
Came Eve throng was certainly
the largest in recent history.
Capping off a week of en
thusiastic "BeatCal" activities,
the rally helped sustain the
emotion until Saturday's game.
As one seasoned Big Ga(me
Week observer remarked while
wandering back to his car af
terward, "It was basically
amazing."
The game itself seemed al
most anticlimactic in compari
son.

—EMILY SACHAR
Band on the run
San Francisco — It seems
silly to write about Friday
night. Anyone who was there
knows what it was like — and
everyone was there.
The residents of Francisco
Street had undoubtedly never
seen anything like it before: a
flash flood of red, white and
drums.
They witnessed porch-to
porch people: a fast flowing de
luge three blocks long that ig
nored red lights, irate motorists
and the lackof a parade permit.
The natives seemed not to
mind. Having unwittingly lent
their street, they added their

yells of encouragement to
those outside.
Somewhere in midstream
(along with anorangeOpel that
had ventured in too deep) was
the excuse tor the incompara
ble demonstration: the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Almost like lemmings
Distinguishable in the dim
streetsonly by the tubas visible
above their heads, the Pied
Pipers of Stanford directed the
flow past Gh i rarde 11 i Square to
the shore of Aquatic Park.
If they had marched straight
on, wading into the Bay, there's
a good chance that several
thousand otherwise intelligent
and restrained students would
have followed.
But those "madcap masters
of musical mayhem" had
slightly warmer things in
mind.
Descending upon an inti
mate couple's beach fire, the
Band formed its standard rag
ged semicircle on the sand.
They faced a suddenly statio
nary audience, which had been
diverted into the park's
bleachers.
Illuminated by a half moon
and a single streetlight, the
LSJUMB filled the cold, clear
night with more than an hour
of music.
Practice makes perfect
Decked out in gas masks or
blinking helmets, playing cow
bells or 36-key toy pianos, the
musicians (and assorted rin
gers and groupies) put together
one of their best performances
of the year.
Perhaps the fact that it was
the group's 10th show of the
week had something to do with
that.
Microphones on a 15-foot
stand, swaying dangerously
above drum major Jim Jett,
helped record many of the 20-
some songs for stereophonic
posterity.
The lively audience partici
pated in the show, jingling
keys, clapping, singing along
— and a lone trumpeter some
where in the stands helped out
with the brassier refrains.

The Band played long and hard on the shores of the bay near
Ghirardelli Square Friday night (top center). Counterclockwise
from top right, drum major |im Jett gets a lift from Oski bear at
the Big Came; the cast nas a blast in a Caieties routine Friday
night; yell leaders join the Dollies and Band in a rousing Alma
Mater.

The crowd's activity was half
inspired by the need to keep
warm; concrete seats at mid
night had a chilling effect as
the night wore on.
"My toes have never been so
happy to hear 'All Right
Now,' " was one woman's reac
tion to the night's eventual
conclusion.
An apartment-dweller over
looking the beach tried to add
to the visual effect, but his
balcony-mounted strobe light
was sadlyout of synch with the
beat below.
Red cheeks, white noses
Let us not forget the yell
leaders and Dollies, who, in
addition to their usual duties,
spelledout"Stanford"by lying
on a cold sidewalk and de
monstrated conclusively that it
is possible to swing to the tune
of "Squeezebox."
No accurate crowd count
was possible. For one thing,

there was no one vantage point
from which to count several
thousand frosty noses. For
another, the police, who can
usually offer an estimate, were
nowhere to be seen.
(There were reports that two
police cars were seen in the
areaafter the rallybroke up,but
their presence wasn't made
known to the celebrants.)
At any rate, the spirited Big
Came Eve throng was certainly
the largest in recent history.
Capping off a week of en
thusiastic "BeatCal" activities,
the rally helped sustain the
emotion until Saturday's game.
As one seasoned Big Ga(me
Week observer remarked while
wandering back to his car af
terward, "It was basically
amazing."
The game itself seemed al
most anticlimactic in compari
son.

Two points are obvious. The
Cards retained the Axe. And
Band members slept about four
hours a night for a straight
week.
Behind these statistics were
an array of other events, the
total of which comprised the
revived Big Game "Fiesta"
Week.
For those who Ii ve to eat and
for others who enjoy a free
coke, the TDS Food Service
sponsored daily specials in
Tresidder and the Commons.
"Bearburgers," honey-covered
yogurt and bear claws were
some of the other discounted
items offered throughout the
week.
Wednesday noon brought
the traditional bear baiting of
the late '60s, as cheerleaders
marched Cal's Oski Bear up

White Plaza, dumping him into
the fountain for Big Game Bea
rial '77.
Not at Harvard
"I would have preferred
seeing Vale's Ely bulldog
drowning there. But it was hys
terica!. I never saw this at Ivy
League Harvard," one student
said.
"We're starting all over,"
said Boh Moog, Instant Rally
Commissioner and organizer
for Fiesta Week. "This could be
the beginning of a new era at
Stanford."
Student sentiment in favor of
the week mounted as the game
drew nearer. "This has been a
guaranteed write-off week,"
one student said. "It's been a
darned good excuse to party."

"l don't know what's going
on, but people sure seem to be
having fun with it," a middle
aged business student said.
The screen of Cubberley Au
ditorium evoked series of
screams and laughs as over 420
people watched movie clips of
yesteryear, narrated by Ralph
Hanson of the Stanford Arc
hives, Wednesday night.
All that jazz
Come Thursday, Stanford's
Jazz Band and the Glee Club
performed at Tresidder and
several frats unveiled decora
tions on their house facades
depicting the inevitable
downfall of Cal'sOski Bear.
Into Thursday evening,
quickly Friday morning, the
Leland Stanford Band rendez
voused the campus in an at
your-door rally.
"This is a really existential
experience," one woman re
marked as the Band scattered
apart down the road.
"I've never seen those trum
peters in such intense spirit.
Why doesn't the University
just cancel everything else ex
cept this happy-go-lucky
stuff?" another student
queried.
TGI F
Activities across the board
built up to Friday's Inter-
Fraternity Council sponsored
Mega-Nooner, held in the Flo
Mo field. Frisbees flew for over
three hours, and 50 kegs were
on hand for the live band.
"Gaieties," a satirical revue
of Stanford life drew many-a
smile and some walloping
laughs from audiences who
witnessed Dean Hargedon and
his angels strut across stage.
"It was rude, awful, but boy
was it great," remarked one
student on her way out the
door. "I was really going
crazy."
"Yeah, she was going crazy
all right," said another.
"I would usually say I've got
to study and work hard, you
know, be the typical diligent
Stanford student. The hell with
that. Who cares if I flunk a
course? I'm psyched forever,"
one woman said.
After a flaming non-fire
Band rally, Little Leland's
Latter-Day Railroad departed
for the legendary Frisco Band
march, a 11 of which culminated

in an all-campus slumber
party.
Yeah, team
"People seem to be really

—EMILY SACHAR
Band on the run
San Francisco — It seems
silly to write about Friday
night. Anyone who was there
knows what it was like — and
everyone was there.
The residents of Francisco
Street had undoubtedly never
seen anything like it before: a
flash flood of red, white and
drums.
They witnessed porch-to
porch people: a fast flowing de
luge three blocks long that ig
nored red lights, irate motorists
and the lackof a parade permit.
The natives seemed not to
mind. Having unwittingly lent
their street, they added their

yells of encouragement to
those outside.
Somewhere in midstream
(along with anorangeOpel that
had ventured in too deep) was
the excuse tor the incompara
ble demonstration: the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Almost like lemmings
Distinguishable in the dim
streetsonly by the tubas visible
above their heads, the Pied
Pipers of Stanford directed the
flow past Gh i rarde 11 i Square to
the shore of Aquatic Park.
If they had marched straight
on, wading into the Bay, there's
a good chance that several
thousand otherwise intelligent
and restrained students would
have followed.
But those "madcap masters
of musical mayhem" had
slightly warmer things in
mind.
Descending upon an inti
mate couple's beach fire, the
Band formed its standard rag
ged semicircle on the sand.
They faced a suddenly statio
nary audience, which had been
diverted into the park's
bleachers.
Illuminated by a half moon
and a single streetlight, the
LSJUMB filled the cold, clear
night with more than an hour
of music.
Practice makes perfect
Decked out in gas masks or
blinking helmets, playing cow
bells or 36-key toy pianos, the
musicians (and assorted rin
gers and groupies) put together
one of their best performances
of the year.
Perhaps the fact that it was
the group's 10th show of the
week had something to do with
that.
Microphones on a 15-foot
stand, swaying dangerously
above drum major Jim Jett,
helped record many of the 20-
some songs for stereophonic
posterity.
The lively audience partici
pated in the show, jingling
keys, clapping, singing along
— and a lone trumpeter some
where in the stands helped out
with the brassier refrains.

The Band played long and hard on the shores of the bay near
Ghirardelli Square Friday night (top center). Counterclockwise
from top right, drum major |im Jett gets a lift from Oski bear at
the Big Came; the cast nas a blast in a Caieties routine Friday
night; yell leaders join the Dollies and Band in a rousing Alma
Mater.

The crowd's activity was half
inspired by the need to keep
warm; concrete seats at mid
night had a chilling effect as
the night wore on.
"My toes have never been so
happy to hear 'All Right
Now,' " was one woman's reac
tion to the night's eventual
conclusion.

—EMILY SACHAR
Band on the run
San Francisco — It seems
silly to write about Friday
night. Anyone who was there
knows what it was like — and
everyone was there.
The residents of Francisco
Street had undoubtedly never
seen anything like it before: a
flash flood of red, white and
drums.
They witnessed porch-to
porch people: a fast flowing de
luge three blocks long that ig
nored red lights, irate motorists
and the lackof a parade permit.
The natives seemed not to
mind. Having unwittingly lent
their street, they added their

yells of encouragement to
those outside.
Somewhere in midstream
(along with anorangeOpel that
had ventured in too deep) was
the excuse tor the incompara
ble demonstration: the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Almost like lemmings
Distinguishable in the dim
streetsonly by the tubas visible
above their heads, the Pied
Pipers of Stanford directed the
flow past Gh i rarde 11 i Square to
the shore of Aquatic Park.
If they had marched straight
on, wading into the Bay, there's
a good chance that several
thousand otherwise intelligent
and restrained students would
have followed.
But those "madcap masters
of musical mayhem" had
slightly warmer things in
mind.
Descending upon an inti
mate couple's beach fire, the
Band formed its standard rag
ged semicircle on the sand.
They faced a suddenly statio
nary audience, which had been
diverted into the park's
bleachers.
Illuminated by a half moon
and a single streetlight, the
LSJUMB filled the cold, clear
night with more than an hour
of music.
Practice makes perfect
Decked out in gas masks or
blinking helmets, playing cow
bells or 36-key toy pianos, the
musicians (and assorted rin
gers and groupies) put together
one of their best performances
of the year.
Perhaps the fact that it was
the group's 10th show of the
week had something to do with
that.
Microphones on a 15-foot
stand, swaying dangerously
above drum major Jim Jett,
helped record many of the 20-
some songs for stereophonic
posterity.
The lively audience partici
pated in the show, jingling
keys, clapping, singing along
— and a lone trumpeter some
where in the stands helped out
with the brassier refrains.

The Band played long and hard on the shores of the bay near
Ghirardelli Square Friday night (top center). Counterclockwise
from top right, drum major |im Jett gets a lift from Oski bear at
the Big Came; the cast nas a blast in a Caieties routine Friday
night; yell leaders join the Dollies and Band in a rousing Alma
Mater.

The crowd's activity was half
inspired by the need to keep
warm; concrete seats at mid
night had a chilling effect as
the night wore on.
"My toes have never been so
happy to hear 'All Right
Now,' " was one woman's reac
tion to the night's eventual
conclusion.
An apartment-dweller over
looking the beach tried to add
to the visual effect, but his
balcony-mounted strobe light
was sadlyout of synch with the
beat below.
Red cheeks, white noses
Let us not forget the yell
leaders and Dollies, who, in
addition to their usual duties,
spelledout"Stanford"by lying
on a cold sidewalk and de
monstrated conclusively that it
is possible to swing to the tune
of "Squeezebox."
No accurate crowd count
was possible. For one thing,

there was no one vantage point
from which to count several
thousand frosty noses. For
another, the police, who can
usually offer an estimate, were
nowhere to be seen.
(There were reports that two
police cars were seen in the
areaafter the rallybroke up,but
their presence wasn't made
known to the celebrants.)
At any rate, the spirited Big
Came Eve throng was certainly
the largest in recent history.
Capping off a week of en
thusiastic "BeatCal" activities,
the rally helped sustain the
emotion until Saturday's game.
As one seasoned Big Ga(me
Week observer remarked while
wandering back to his car af
terward, "It was basically
amazing."
The game itself seemed al
most anticlimactic in compari
son.

Two points are obvious. The
Cards retained the Axe. And
Band members slept about four
hours a night for a straight
week.
Behind these statistics were
an array of other events, the
total of which comprised the
revived Big Game "Fiesta"
Week.
For those who Ii ve to eat and
for others who enjoy a free

sponsored daily specials in
Tresidder and the Commons.
"Bearburgers," honey-covered
yogurt and bear claws were
some of the other discounted
items offered throughout the
week.
Wednesday noon brought
the traditional bear baiting of
the late '60s, as cheerleaders
marched Cal's Oski Bear up

White Plaza, dumping him into
the fountain for Big Game Bea
rial '77.
Not at Harvard
"I would have preferred
seeing Vale's Ely bulldog
drowning there. But it was hys

Commissioner and organizer
for Fiesta Week. "This could be
the beginning of a new era at
Stanford."
Student sentiment in favor of
the week mounted as the game
drew nearer. "This has been a
guaranteed write-off week,"
one student said. "It's been a
darned good excuse to party."

"l don't know what's going
on, but people sure seem to be
having fun with it," a middle

The screen of Cubberley Au

screams and laughs as over 420

Come Thursday, Stanford's
Jazz Band and the Glee Club
performed at Tresidder and
several frats unveiled decora
tions on their house facades
depicting the inevitable
downfall of Cal'sOski Bear.
Into Thursday evening,
quickly Friday morning, the
Leland Stanford Band rendez
voused the campus in an at
your-door rally.
"This is a really existential

nary audience, which had been
diverted into the park's
bleachers.
Illuminated by a half moon
and a single streetlight, the
LSJUMB filled the cold, clear
night with more than an hour
of music.
Practice makes perfect
Decked out in gas masks or
blinking helmets, playing cow
bells or 36-key toy pianos, the
musicians (and assorted rin
gers and groupies) put together
one of their best performances
of the year.
Perhaps the fact that it was
the group's 10th show of the
week had something to do with
that.
Microphones on a 15-foot
stand, swaying dangerously
above drum major Jim Jett,
helped record many of the 20-
some songs for stereophonic
posterity.
The lively audience partici
pated in the show, jingling
keys, clapping, singing along
— and a lone trumpeter some
where in the stands helped out
with the brassier refrains.

The Band played long and hard on the shores of the bay near
Ghirardelli Square Friday night (top center). Counterclockwise
from top right, drum major |im Jett gets a lift from Oski bear at
the Big Came; the cast nas a blast in a Caieties routine Friday
night; yell leaders join the Dollies and Band in a rousing Alma
Mater.

The crowd's activity was half
inspired by the need to keep
warm; concrete seats at mid
night had a chilling effect as
the night wore on.
"My toes have never been so
happy to hear 'All Right
Now,' " was one woman's reac
tion to the night's eventual
conclusion.
An apartment-dweller over
looking the beach tried to add
to the visual effect, but his
balcony-mounted strobe light
was sadlyout of synch with the
beat below.
Red cheeks, white noses
Let us not forget the yell
leaders and Dollies, who, in
addition to their usual duties,
spelledout"Stanford"by lying
on a cold sidewalk and de
monstrated conclusively that it
is possible to swing to the tune
of "Squeezebox."
No accurate crowd count
was possible. For one thing,

there was no one vantage point
from which to count several
thousand frosty noses. For
another, the police, who can
usually offer an estimate, were
nowhere to be seen.
(There were reports that two
police cars were seen in the
areaafter the rallybroke up,but
their presence wasn't made
known to the celebrants.)
At any rate, the spirited Big
Came Eve throng was certainly
the largest in recent history.
Capping off a week of en
thusiastic "BeatCal" activities,
the rally helped sustain the
emotion until Saturday's game.
As one seasoned Big Ga(me
Week observer remarked while
wandering back to his car af
terward, "It was basically
amazing."
The game itself seemed al
most anticlimactic in compari
son.
