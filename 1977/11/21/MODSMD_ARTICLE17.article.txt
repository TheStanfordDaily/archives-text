# Best performance
## Cardinal defense traps Bears 
### David Georgette 
Three points.
Saturday morning if some
one had said Cal would get
only a field goal that afternoon
against Stanford, a breath
analysis would have been in
order.
But the Card defense did
control the Bear offense Satur
day in the 80th Big Game, limit
ing Cal to 317 total yards. That
figure is nearly 90 yards less
than the Cal offense had been
averaging or the Stanford de
fense had been yielding.
And when Cal mounted
three scoring threats late in the
second half, the Card defense
stopped the Bears on four
downs from inside the 16-yard
line every time.
Senior linebacker Ray Car
dinally the defensive signal cal
ler who finished with 10 tack
les, said, "It was a great defen
sive effort. We buckled down
and played defense."
In recording their best de
fensive effort of the season,
the Cards overcame the loss of
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, the team's leading
tackier, who took a mean hit to
the head in the second quarter
and had to be helped from the
field.
Defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said Ceresino was
missed but added, "I don't
think any part of our team is
dependent on any one indi
vidual."
Freshman Steve Budinger
covered for Ceresino's loss,
coming up with seven tackles.

"I haven't gotten that much ac
tion in a crucial part of the
game," he said, "but I figured I
could do the job. The first
series I just got used to what
they were doing."
Tried for Thompson
One thing Cal tried todowas
get the ball to wide receiver
Jesse Thompson. Nineteen
passes were thrown in
Thompson's direction, and he
got six of them.for 102 yards.
"We went to Jesse
Thompson because he is our
clutch player," said White,
"but Stanford did a great job of
covering him."
On the three fourth-down
plays that Stanford held Cal,
the passes were intended for
Thompson. Late in the third
quarter from the Card 16-yard
line he ran a crossing pattern
from the left side, and had the
pass from Gary Graumann in
his grasp before cornerback
Rick Parker stripped him of the
ball.
"With the formation they
were in, I thought the guy
(Thompson) might run a
streak," said Parker. "I hit the
ball. I don't know if he had it in
his hands or what."
Then the next time Cal got
the ball, it moved to the Stan
ford 7-yard line. A fourth-down
pass by Cal's other quarter
back, Charlie Young, was tip
ped by Parker, and Thompson
was unable to hold on.
Additional backs
According to Card defensive
back John Pigott, when Cal got
into scoring position, Stanford

put in additional pass defen
ders. "When they got close to
the goal line," he said, "we put
six defensive backs in. We had
a man under on all their receiv
ers and two back deep. Their
patterns came into the strength
of our defense."
"Everybody played good to
day," said cornerback Savann
Thompson. "It was a total team
effort."
The Card cornerback said
Cal's offense did mostly what
the Cards expected. "We
noticed they throw to Jesse
(Thompson) and (George)
Freitas a lot, especially in
third-down situations," he
said.
"Our defensive backs had by
far their best performance,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"They were great."
Many of the defenders men
tioned the emotion of the

game as a factor in their
superior showing. "For the
first time all season we had
some team meetings and sort
of took it upon ourselves to get
ready," said Kieburtz.
"We were prepared well for
the game, and we were emo
tionally up," said linebacker
Tom Hall.
Walsh called the defensive's
performance the key to the
game. But more than just hav
ing made the difference in the
game, the defense found satis
faction in having stopped a
good offensive threat, some
thing Stanford had not done
before.
"I have to say we deserved
the criticism we were getting
because we were doing
badly," said defensive back
Robby Chapman. "But this
time we showed we could do
it."

back John Pigott, when Cal got
into scoring position, Stanford

put in additional pass defen
ders. "When they got close to
the goal line," he said, "we put
six defensive backs in. We had
a man under on all their receiv
ers and two back deep. Their
patterns came into the strength
of our defense."
"Everybody played good to
day," said cornerback Savann
Thompson. "It was a total team
effort."
The Card cornerback said
Cal's offense did mostly what
the Cards expected. "We
noticed they throw to Jesse
(Thompson) and (George)
Freitas a lot, especially in
third-down situations," he
said.
"Our defensive backs had by
far their best performance,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"They were great."
Many of the defenders men
tioned the emotion of the

game as a factor in their
superior showing. "For the
first time all season we had
some team meetings and sort
of took it upon ourselves to get
ready," said Kieburtz.
"We were prepared well for
the game, and we were emo
tionally up," said linebacker
Tom Hall.
Walsh called the defensive's
performance the key to the
game. But more than just hav
ing made the difference in the
game, the defense found satis
faction in having stopped a
good offensive threat, some
thing Stanford had not done
before.
"I have to say we deserved
the criticism we were getting
because we were doing
badly," said defensive back
Robby Chapman. "But this
time we showed we could do
it."

Stanford freshman Ken Margerum snags a 16-yard pass from Guy
Benjamin on the Cards' 80-yard touchdown march in the third quar
ter Saturday. The 6-foot-1,175-pound wide receiver was hit hard by
John McMahon (57) and Ken McAllister (32) but held on to the ball
for his second reception of the game.
Three points.
Saturday morning if some
one had said Cal would get
only a field goal that afternoon
against Stanford, a breath
analysis would have been in
order.
But the Card defense did
control the Bear offense Satur
day in the 80th Big Game, limit
ing Cal to 317 total yards. That
figure is nearly 90 yards less
than the Cal offense had been
averaging or the Stanford de
fense had been yielding.
And when Cal mounted
three scoring threats late in the
second half, the Card defense
stopped the Bears on four
downs from inside the 16-yard
line every time.
Senior linebacker Ray Car
dinally the defensive signal cal
ler who finished with 10 tack
les, said, "It was a great defen
sive effort. We buckled down
and played defense."
In recording their best de
fensive effort of the season,
the Cards overcame the loss of
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, the team's leading
tackier, who took a mean hit to
the head in the second quarter
and had to be helped from the
field.
Defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said Ceresino was
missed but added, "I don't
think any part of our team is
dependent on any one indi
vidual."
Freshman Steve Budinger
covered for Ceresino's loss,
coming up with seven tackles.

"I haven't gotten that much ac
tion in a crucial part of the
game," he said, "but I figured I
could do the job. The first
series I just got used to what
they were doing."
Tried for Thompson
One thing Cal tried todowas
get the ball to wide receiver
Jesse Thompson. Nineteen
passes were thrown in
Thompson's direction, and he
got six of them.for 102 yards.
"We went to Jesse
Thompson because he is our
clutch player," said White,
"but Stanford did a great job of
covering him."
On the three fourth-down
plays that Stanford held Cal,
the passes were intended for
Thompson. Late in the third
quarter from the Card 16-yard
line he ran a crossing pattern
from the left side, and had the
pass from Gary Graumann in
his grasp before cornerback
Rick Parker stripped him of the
ball.
"With the formation they
were in, I thought the guy
(Thompson) might run a
streak," said Parker. "I hit the
ball. I don't know if he had it in
his hands or what."
Then the next time Cal got
the ball, it moved to the Stan
ford 7-yard line. A fourth-down
pass by Cal's other quarter
back, Charlie Young, was tip
ped by Parker, and Thompson
was unable to hold on.

In recording their best de
fensive effort of the season,
the Cards overcame the loss of
middle linebacker Gordy
Ceresino, the team's leading
tackier, who took a mean hit to
the head in the second quarter
and had to be helped from the
field.
Defensive tackle Geoff
Kieburtz said Ceresino was
missed but added, "I don't
think any part of our team is
dependent on any one indi
vidual."
Freshman Steve Budinger
covered for Ceresino's loss,
coming up with seven tackles.

"I haven't gotten that much ac
tion in a crucial part of the
game," he said, "but I figured I
could do the job. The first
series I just got used to what
they were doing."
Tried for Thompson
One thing Cal tried todowas
get the ball to wide receiver
Jesse Thompson. Nineteen
passes were thrown in
Thompson's direction, and he
got six of them.for 102 yards.
"We went to Jesse
Thompson because he is our
clutch player," said White,
"but Stanford did a great job of
covering him."
On the three fourth-down
plays that Stanford held Cal,
the passes were intended for
Thompson. Late in the third
quarter from the Card 16-yard
line he ran a crossing pattern
from the left side, and had the
pass from Gary Graumann in
his grasp before cornerback
Rick Parker stripped him of the
ball.
"With the formation they
were in, I thought the guy
(Thompson) might run a
streak," said Parker. "I hit the
ball. I don't know if he had it in
his hands or what."
Then the next time Cal got
the ball, it moved to the Stan
ford 7-yard line. A fourth-down
pass by Cal's other quarter
back, Charlie Young, was tip
ped by Parker, and Thompson
was unable to hold on.
Additional backs
According to Card defensive
back John Pigott, when Cal got
into scoring position, Stanford

put in additional pass defen
ders. "When they got close to
the goal line," he said, "we put
six defensive backs in. We had
a man under on all their receiv
ers and two back deep. Their
patterns came into the strength
of our defense."
"Everybody played good to
day," said cornerback Savann
Thompson. "It was a total team
effort."
The Card cornerback said
Cal's offense did mostly what
the Cards expected. "We
noticed they throw to Jesse
(Thompson) and (George)
Freitas a lot, especially in
third-down situations," he
said.
"Our defensive backs had by
far their best performance,"
said Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"They were great."
Many of the defenders men
tioned the emotion of the

game as a factor in their
superior showing. "For the
first time all season we had
some team meetings and sort
of took it upon ourselves to get
ready," said Kieburtz.
"We were prepared well for
the game, and we were emo
tionally up," said linebacker
Tom Hall.
Walsh called the defensive's
performance the key to the
game. But more than just hav
ing made the difference in the
game, the defense found satis
faction in having stopped a
good offensive threat, some
thing Stanford had not done
before.
"I have to say we deserved
the criticism we were getting
because we were doing
badly," said defensive back
Robby Chapman. "But this
time we showed we could do
it."
