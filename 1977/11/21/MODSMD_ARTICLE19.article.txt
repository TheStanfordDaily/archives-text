# Swimmers victorious, 154-72
## Cards down Pleasant Hills 
### Andy Lowe 
Propelled by strong early
season performances, the Stan
ford men's and women's swim
teams combined forces to de
feat the young, upset-minded
Pleasant Hills Swim Club,
154-72. The women's events
provided most of the meet'sex
citement, as little competition
was given by the male contin
gent from Pleasant Hills.
Several outstanding times
were recorded by Stanford
swimmers. National AIAW
standards were met by Laura
Raymond in the 200 freestyle
(1:52.3), )o Harshbarger in the
1650 free (17:10.9) and Olym
pian Kim Peyton (5:01.6) and
Anne Brodell (5:02.8) in the
500 free. The 400-yard freestyle
relay quartet of Peyton,
Hagstette, Thompson and
Raymond also qualified for the
National's, posting a fine
3:32.5.
Newcomer Raymond's 200
freestyle time, according to
swim coach Jim Gaughran,
may rank her first among the

nation's collegiate women
swimmers at this time, and it
was Laura's lifetime best in this
event. Other notable swims
came from Margot Hagstette
(200 1.M., 200 fly) and
freshmen Zena Herrmann (100
fly), Cathy Gaines (1650),
Thompson (50 and 100 free),
and Peggy Haslach (100 and
200 breast).
With the return of Valerie
Lee and continued team im
provement, the Cardinal
women look forward to a prom
ising season and a shot at the
national team title at the AIAW
championships in March.
Despite the lack of competi
tion, the men also swam fast
early season times. Senior Stu
Corliss led Stanford with three
first-place finishes, capturing
the 100 and 200 breaststrokes
and the 200 individual medley.
Mike Bruner (200 fly and 500
free) and Jon Powell (50 and
100 free) had two wins each;
Paul Hartloff (1650), Jack Con
nelly (200 back), Bob Hagberg
(100 fly) and Bill Chao (200

free) were all single winners.
Particularly impressive
times were recorded in the
1650 (Hartloff 15:52.8, Monte
Brown 16:15.8), 200 fly (Bruner
1:51.6, O'Brien 1:54.4), 200
breast (Corliss 2:11.5, Weber
2:13.3) and 100 free (Powell
46.9).
After the meet, coaches
Caughran and Thomas agreed
that "most of our swimmers are
swimming faster than they did
at the same time last year,
which is encouraging. Our
freshmen are swimming very
well, especially considering
the adjustment that has to be
made wheneverenteringa new
program."
Both the men's and women's
team look to the Stanford Invi
tational, Dec. 2-4, for a more
"rested" opportunity to make
national qualifying standards.
Among the teams expected to
make splashes in the Invita
tional are California, Univer
sity of Pacific, Santa Clara S.C.,
Pleasant Hills S.C., Laudera
Oaks A.C. and De Anza S.C.
