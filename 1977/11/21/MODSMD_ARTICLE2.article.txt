# Oregon board sells stock in S. Africa
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The Oregon Board of Education
voted 8-3 Friday to divest all of the
state's educational endowment
funds directly and indirectly invested
in South Africa.
The board, which oversees all in
vestments of endowment and
quasiendowment funds for the
states' public colleges and univer
sities, disregarded the recommenda
tion of its own finance committee not
to divest after hearing testimony
from more than 30 persons in a
four-hour meeting on the subject.
Several members indicated they
had been swayed by the testimony,
according to Walter Sheasby, a
spokesman tor People for Southern
African Freedom, a group supporting
divestment.
An Oregon newspaper, the
Eugene Register-Guard, quoted
board member Jonathan Ater as say
ing "I didn't believe (divestment)
would be the most effective course
of action. I've changed my mind. I
think I was wrong."
Thami Mhlambiso, the UN rep
resentative of the African National
Congress, one of the largest opposi
tion groups recently banned by the
South African government, urged di
vestment. Mhlambiso told the board
a vote to divest "would be clear warn
ing to lan Smith and |ohn Vorster that
the Western world is turning against
them," according to the Register-
Guard.
Mhlambiso also said U.S. invest

ments in South Africa made the white
minority government "stronger and
stronger because you lent it this
economic liability."
The total endowment of the De
partment of Higher Education comes
to $10.7 million, of which $4.2 million
are invested in businesses with in
terests in South Africa. The
guidelines for divesture call tor di
vesting stock in any firm which
employs more than 50 persons, has
earnings of more than $500,000 from
investments in South Africa or has
more than $500,000 invested in fixed
assets or portfolios there.
If the guidelines are followed the
board is expected to divest itself of
almost all of the $4.2 million in desig
nated firms, according to Sheasby.
Some firms included in the di
vestment plans in order of largest in
vestment are Ford, General Motors,
Phillips Petroleum, Exxon, IBM, Un
ited Technologies, CBS, Coca-Cola,
First National Bank of Boston, Gen
eral Foods, Dow Chemical and
Xerox, Sheasby said.
The board heard a letter from Rep.
lames Weaver (D-Ore.) supporting
divestiture as well as testimony from
several student body presidents and
faculty members.
In May University students voted
in a special referendum in favor of
divestment and prohibiting recruit
ers from corporations with invest
ments in South Africa, Rhodesia or
Southwest Africa to use University
facilities.

The Oregon Board of Education
voted 8-3 Friday to divest all of the
state's educational endowment
funds directly and indirectly invested
in South Africa.
The board, which oversees all in
vestments of endowment and
quasiendowment funds for the
states' public colleges and univer
sities, disregarded the recommenda
tion of its own finance committee not
to divest after hearing testimony
from more than 30 persons in a
four-hour meeting on the subject.
Several members indicated they
had been swayed by the testimony,
according to Walter Sheasby, a
spokesman tor People for Southern
African Freedom, a group supporting
divestment.
An Oregon newspaper, the
Eugene Register-Guard, quoted
board member Jonathan Ater as say
ing "I didn't believe (divestment)
would be the most effective course
of action. I've changed my mind. I
think I was wrong."
Thami Mhlambiso, the UN rep
resentative of the African National
Congress, one of the largest opposi
tion groups recently banned by the
South African government, urged di
vestment. Mhlambiso told the board
a vote to divest "would be clear warn
ing to lan Smith and |ohn Vorster that
the Western world is turning against
them," according to the Register-
Guard.
Mhlambiso also said U.S. invest

ments in South Africa made the white
minority government "stronger and
stronger because you lent it this
economic liability."
The total endowment of the De
partment of Higher Education comes
to $10.7 million, of which $4.2 million
are invested in businesses with in
terests in South Africa. The
guidelines for divesture call tor di
vesting stock in any firm which
employs more than 50 persons, has
earnings of more than $500,000 from
investments in South Africa or has
more than $500,000 invested in fixed
assets or portfolios there.
If the guidelines are followed the
board is expected to divest itself of
almost all of the $4.2 million in desig
nated firms, according to Sheasby.
Some firms included in the di
vestment plans in order of largest in
vestment are Ford, General Motors,
Phillips Petroleum, Exxon, IBM, Un
ited Technologies, CBS, Coca-Cola,
First National Bank of Boston, Gen
eral Foods, Dow Chemical and
Xerox, Sheasby said.
