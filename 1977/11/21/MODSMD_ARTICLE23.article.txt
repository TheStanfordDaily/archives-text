# Poloists splash Bears
## Cards top Cal, 11-8, claim No. 1 seed in nationals

Paced by junior Tom
Angelo's four goals, the Stan
ford water polo team defeated
California Saturday, 11-8, to
win the Pac-8 crown and earn
the No. 1 seeding for the NCAA
championships this Saturday.
The Cards capitalized on
seven out of eight man-up situ
ations, three of which were put
in by post man Angelo on pas
ses from junior Doug Burke.
Angelo's fourth goal also came
on a 6-on-5 situation when he
flipped in the ball after an out
side shot had rebounded off the
goal and landed in the water in
front of him.
Angelo, who played almost
the entire game with two per
sonal fouls before getting
kicked out in the last minute
with his third personal foul,
was very happy after the game.
Smiling, he said simply, "It felt
good to beat Cal."
"Tommy (Angelo) is tougher
than hell," said Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti. "Everybody
played really well, (junior
Dave) Egan had a good game
and Marty (Davis) had a super
game on defense."

"I tried to concentrate on de
fense," said Davis. "Cal has
good hole setters and I thought
that if we could stop the ball
trom going to the hole man, we
could shut down their of
fense."
The strategy worked, as only
three of the Bears' goals came
on natural, 6-on-6 play. The
other five came on 6-on-5 situa
tions, mostly from the arm of
Cal freshman Kevin Robertson.
"The game was close," said
Dettamanti. "It really didn't
feel like we won by three go
als."
The Cardinals struck first in
the game as Egan fired in a
weak side shot before the first
minute of play had elapsed.
The first quarter ended with
the score tied at two. By
halftime, the Cards had stroked
to a 6-4 lead but in the third
quarter, Cal fought back to tie
the game at six all. In a well
executed play, the two seniors,
Davis and Rick Johannsen,
combined to give Stanford a
7-6 advantage.
Recalled Davis: "I had the
ball right in frontof thegoalbut
the goalie had come out to cut

off the angle (on a shot). I was
working for a tour-meter (pen
alty shot) when the ball started
getting slapped around. It got
slapped over to Rick
(Johannsen, who was a few feet
away, also in front of the goal),
who put it in."
The fourth quarter was all
Stanford's as it outscored
Cal 4-2 with freshman goalie
John Gansel making three ex
cellent saves. Fittingly, the
man who started it all, Egan,
added the final touch by scor
ing on a driving shot with 49
seconds to go in the game.
Now, with both the Cards
and the Bears going to Provi
dence, R.I. for the Nationals,
the inevitable is raised.
"We know we're going to
play them again," explained
Dettamanti.
Unless Cal or Stanford gets
eliminated before the finals,
which is unlikely, the two will
meet to determine, officially,
the No. 1 team in the nation.
"It doesn't matter who goes
in seeded No. I," Johannsen
said. "The No. 1 team will be
the team that wins the tourna
ment."
