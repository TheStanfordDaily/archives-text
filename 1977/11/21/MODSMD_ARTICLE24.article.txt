## 
### Bill Burger 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team lost its chance at
an automatic regional berth by
losing to San Jose State in five
games Saturday night. The loss
dropped the Cards into a tie for
the NorCal Conference title,
forcing a playoff between the
two teams tomorrow at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion to de
termine which one goes to the
Regional Tournament Nov.
25-26 at Long Beach.
A disgusted Cardinal coach
Art Lambert said last night that
the decision to take only one
Nor-Cal team in the regional
"smells to high heaven. Others
have told me how fair the
AIAW was, but this is the
biggest bunch of crap I've
heard in a long time."
The winner of the playoff
match will be seeded fifth and
wi\\ face fourth-seeded UC-
Santa Barbara in the first round
of the tournament.
Lambert said that Stanford
andSJS would not have had the
playoff if both teams were
granted regional berths.
In action this weekend, the
Cards defeated California Fri

day 15-4, 7-15, 15-10, 15-7 in
Maples Pavilion. Lambert said
the team did not play particu
larly well but praised the play
of team captain Liz Hughes,
Sandy Harris and Shawn
Hoover, who served for 13 of
the Card's 15 points in the tinal
game.
Assistant coach Fred Sturm
said the team's "intensity
wasn'tvery consistent." during
the 15-12, 8-14,15-6,12-15,9-15
loss to SJS. He said the teams
were hurt by losing points in
big chunks.
Lambert said "volleyball
tends to bea streaky sport." He
described the Cards' problem
as a "mental thing — some
thing everybody in competitive
sports has to go through."
"The one thing I ask myself,"
Lambert said, "is how the hell
we can be ahead 8-0 and lose
the game (Stanford's fourth
game loss to S)S)."
This years' team is "a group
of people that have not had a
real lot of competitive
background," Lambert said.
"They are one of the youngest
teams in the northern part of
the state."
