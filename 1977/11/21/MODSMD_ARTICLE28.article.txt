Many Arabs angry with Sadat visit
Beirut — Anger over Anwar Sadat's visit to Israel inten
sified among many Arabs yesterday. Palestinian guerril
las vowed to assassinate the Egyptian president and the
Syrian state radio urged Egyptians to overthrow him.
Millions of Arabs listened in stunned silence to live
broadcasts of Sadat's offer in the Israeli parliament to
make peace with the Jewish state. Usual activity in Beirut
and other Mideast capitals came to virtual standstill as
people clustered around radios.
Sadat's speech drew mixed reaction from officials and
ordinary people in the Arab world. Leaders of radical
Arab states and Palestinians denounced it. Official
sources in Jordan praised the speech, but other conser
vative Arab regimes like Saudi Arabia were silent.
Abomb exploded in the Amman, Jordan, offices of the
Egyptian national airline, Egyptair, after Sadat's speech,
causing extensive damage but no casualties, police said.
The majority of Jordan's population is of Palestinian ori
gin.
Egyptian newspapers, under banner headlines, called
Sadat's welcome in Jerusalem "thunderous" and
"tumultuous" but ignored protests in Egypt and other
Arab countries. "The whole world watches the hero of
peace," said the headline in Cairo's al Akhbar.

Many Arabs angry with Sadat visit
Beirut — Anger over Anwar Sadat's visit to Israel inten
sified among many Arabs yesterday. Palestinian guerril
las vowed to assassinate the Egyptian president and the
Syrian state radio urged Egyptians to overthrow him.
Millions of Arabs listened in stunned silence to live
broadcasts of Sadat's offer in the Israeli parliament to
make peace with the Jewish state. Usual activity in Beirut
and other Mideast capitals came to virtual standstill as
people clustered around radios.
Sadat's speech drew mixed reaction from officials and
ordinary people in the Arab world. Leaders of radical
Arab states and Palestinians denounced it. Official
sources in Jordan praised the speech, but other conser
vative Arab regimes like Saudi Arabia were silent.
Abomb exploded in the Amman, Jordan, offices of the
Egyptian national airline, Egyptair, after Sadat's speech,
causing extensive damage but no casualties, police said.
The majority of Jordan's population is of Palestinian ori
gin.
Egyptian newspapers, under banner headlines, called
Sadat's welcome in Jerusalem "thunderous" and
"tumultuous" but ignored protests in Egypt and other
Arab countries. "The whole world watches the hero of
peace," said the headline in Cairo's al Akhbar.
