# Senators misinformed?
## ASSU fund control attacked 
### Jim Reitzes 
Candidates for the ASSU Senate
made erroneous statements about
ASSU finances during last month's
campaign according to Miles White,
ASSU financial manager.
The statements — some made by
former senators — point out the mis
conceptions and lack of familiarity
with finances that have plagued the
senate in the past, he asserted.
Dan Livingston, former chairper
son ot the Senate Finance Commit
tee, said senators don't understand
the complexities ot ASSU finances.
"The tinancial manager is the profes
sional manager of ASSU finances.
The senators are amateurs; they have
a vague understanding of the whole
financial system," Livingston said.
White said, "Usually no more than
one-halt ol the people on the senate
have a good teel lor what ASSU's ti
nances are about."
White proposed that the senate be
elected in the spring, enabling
senators to go through training
about ASSU finances during the
summer. This term would coincide
with the term ol the financial man
ager, who takes over in ]une.
"Now, by the time the senate
learns about finances, either their
term is up or my term is up," White
said.
Lred Crethel, this year's senate
chairperson, agreed that at least part
of the senate should be elected in the
spring. "With the present situation,
we're months behind the financial
manager and the Council of Presi
dents," Grethel said.

The result is that the general stu
dent body is the least intormed or
most misintormed of all. Rodney
Adams, University director ot fi
nance, said, "Typically the ASSU has
not given intormation to the stu
dents. It is very appropriate, how
ever, tor a student to expect to see a
periodic report on ASSU finances.
There should be some mechanism
tor public access to annual docu
ments.
ASSU officers disagree on the
power ot the financial manger. White
claimed he can pull ASSU money out
ot investments without senate au
thorization.
Livingston disagrees. "The senate
has the constitutional power over the
tunds. The tinancial manager cannot
retuse a senate directive concerning
investments," he said.
The divestment issue could cause a
conllict ot interest between the ti
nancial manager's responsibility by
the senate and his own administra
tive responsibilities. The Stanlord
Organizing Committee slate is al
ready on record as tavoring divest
ment ot holdings in tirms with South
Atrican investments.
Reinvesting the $i50,000 ot ASSU
tunds currently held in a University
investment pool "would cost the
ASSU substantially in transterence
and management commissions, such
as brokerage tees," according to
White.
Divestment, theretore, could hin
der the tinancial manager's ability to
administer ASSU tunds profitably.
By agreeing to a senate divestment
decision that reduces the profit on
ASSU investments, the financial
manager is open to legal action,
Adams said.
"To knowingly take money that be
longs to all students and to know
ingly reduce the return on that
money might well be against the

spirit and letter of the law," he said.
In the event ot a decision tor di
vestment, Adams said he had already
advised White to retrain trom rein
vesting any tunds until a legal opin
ion was sought.
Grethel said that White can not
constitutionally refuse a senate di
rective to divest.
The constitution defines the linan
cial manager's power as lollows:
"the financial manager shall he di
rectly responsible to the se
nate and shall exercise con
trol ot the budget and fi
nances of the ASSU, the ASSU
projects, and Students' Organization
Fund by insuring that expenditures
are duly documented and within the
purposes and functions of the
specific organization and project."
White said ambiguities in the con
stitution over the financial manager's
power could be dangerous. "The fi
nancial manager has a tremendous
amount ot individual power because
the senate doesn't realize how much
power he has until it's too late. This
certainly opens up the possibility tor
abuse," he remarked.
Grethel said, "I think the financial
manager has too much power. A lot
ot trust has to be placed with him
since it isn't clear what his duties
are."

The result is that the general stu
dent body is the least intormed or
most misintormed of all. Rodney
Adams, University director ot fi
nance, said, "Typically the ASSU has
not given intormation to the stu

ever, tor a student to expect to see a
periodic report on ASSU finances.
There should be some mechanism
tor public access to annual docu
ments.
ASSU officers disagree on the
power ot the financial manger. White
claimed he can pull ASSU money out
ot investments without senate au
thorization.
Livingston disagrees. "The senate
has the constitutional power over the
tunds. The tinancial manager cannot
retuse a senate directive concerning
investments," he said.
The divestment issue could cause a
conllict ot interest between the ti
nancial manager's responsibility by
the senate and his own administra
tive responsibilities. The Stanlord
Organizing Committee slate is al
ready on record as tavoring divest
ment ot holdings in tirms with South
Atrican investments.
Reinvesting the $i50,000 ot ASSU
tunds currently held in a University
investment pool "would cost the
ASSU substantially in transterence
and management commissions, such
as brokerage tees," according to
White.
Divestment, theretore, could hin
der the tinancial manager's ability to
administer ASSU tunds profitably.
By agreeing to a senate divestment
decision that reduces the profit on
ASSU investments, the financial
manager is open to legal action,
Adams said.
"To knowingly take money that be
longs to all students and to know
ingly reduce the return on that
money might well be against the

spirit and letter of the law," he said.
In the event ot a decision tor di
vestment, Adams said he had already
advised White to retrain trom rein
vesting any tunds until a legal opin
ion was sought.
Grethel said that White can not
constitutionally refuse a senate di
rective to divest.
The constitution defines the linan
cial manager's power as lollows:
"the financial manager shall he di
rectly responsible to the se
nate and shall exercise con
trol ot the budget and fi
nances of the ASSU, the ASSU
projects, and Students' Organization
Fund by insuring that expenditures
are duly documented and within the
purposes and functions of the
specific organization and project."
White said ambiguities in the con
stitution over the financial manager's
power could be dangerous. "The fi
nancial manager has a tremendous
amount ot individual power because
the senate doesn't realize how much
power he has until it's too late. This
certainly opens up the possibility tor
abuse," he remarked.
Grethel said, "I think the financial
manager has too much power. A lot
ot trust has to be placed with him
since it isn't clear what his duties
are."
Candidates for the ASSU Senate
made erroneous statements about
ASSU finances during last month's
campaign according to Miles White,
ASSU financial manager.
The statements — some made by
former senators — point out the mis
conceptions and lack of familiarity
with finances that have plagued the
senate in the past, he asserted.
Dan Livingston, former chairper
son ot the Senate Finance Commit
tee, said senators don't understand
the complexities ot ASSU finances.
"The tinancial manager is the profes
sional manager of ASSU finances.
The senators are amateurs; they have
a vague understanding of the whole
financial system," Livingston said.
White said, "Usually no more than
one-halt ol the people on the senate
have a good teel lor what ASSU's ti
nances are about."
White proposed that the senate be
elected in the spring, enabling
senators to go through training
about ASSU finances during the
summer. This term would coincide
with the term ol the financial man
ager, who takes over in ]une.
"Now, by the time the senate
learns about finances, either their
term is up or my term is up," White
said.
Lred Crethel, this year's senate
chairperson, agreed that at least part
of the senate should be elected in the
spring. "With the present situation,
we're months behind the financial
manager and the Council of Presi
dents," Grethel said.
