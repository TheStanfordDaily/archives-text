## Head of chicano affairs views job 
### Juan Zuniga 
"The chicano community stu
dents, faculty and staff needs to in
stitutionalize and make permanent
its persence on the Stanford cam
pus," said Maria Baeza, newly
appointed assistant to the president
for chicano affairs.
Baeza officially began work Nov. 7,
replacing Cecilia Burciaga, who has

become assistant provost tor faculty
affirmative action.
"I am assuming the office of assis
tant to the president at a moment in
which both the Stanford chicano
community and the University ad
ministration perceive that we face a
crucial turning point in our mutual
relationship," Baeza said.
"We are now in a period of critical
reassessment of past achievements
and the articulation of goals and
programs that will decisively shape
the future of chicanos at Stanford for
many years to come."
Baeza pointed to two areas of im
mediate concern for her office: stu
dent support services and financial
assistance programs, which are in
eed of improvement and expansion;
and employment, because many
chicano staff members have com
plained of probems in recruiting, hir
ing and promotion of chicano per
sonnel.
Baeza also noted issues such as the
Bakke case and undocumented im
migrant workers, which concern
chicanos here because of questions
of access to higher education and the
possible negative impact of Presi
dent |immy Carter's illegal alien plan
on the chicano and Mexican popula
tion here.
At an earlier interview, Baeza, 33,
who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico
and raised in East Los Angeles,
placed emphasis on the areas of con
tinuity and change since the estab
lishment of the Chicano Affairs Of
fice.
"When the initial presence of
chicanos at Stanford was felt in
1968-69 and the decision was made to
establish the office of Assistant to the
President for Chicano Affairs," Baeza

said, "Luis Nogales, the first to hold
the position, emphasized the need
for expanded efforts to recruit
chicanos at both the undergrad and
graduate levels.
"Cecilia Burciaga, my predeces
sor, continued strong support for
these programs but also took strong
initiative in the areas of chicano fa
culty recruitment and promotions."
Baeza noted that "in the past 10
years the chicano presence at Stan
ford has been established due to
constant efforts on the part of
chicano students, staff and faculty
together with the efforts of President
(Richard) Lyman and many other
University officials."
"While of course such efforts must
continue in the future, I see my prin
cipal responsibility as guiding the in
stitutionalization of the chicano pre
sence by means of increasing the
number of chicanos and other know*
ledgeable persons throughout the
administrative structure of the Uni
versity," said Baeza.
Baeza came here in 1969 for
graduate study in the Latin American
Studies Program, and was employed
here between 1970 and 1973, first as
research assistant for a select bib
liography on Mexican Americans and
then as director of the Chicano
Seminars.
Baeza then became assistant to the
dean of graduate studies. During
1974 and 1975 Baeza traveled to
Argentina and Mexico where she
pursued various educational pro
jects.
Sipce returning from Latin
America, Baeza has worked with the
Graduate Fellowship Program of the
Ford Foundation and most recently
as assistant to the dean for graduate
student affirmative action at UC-San
Diego.
