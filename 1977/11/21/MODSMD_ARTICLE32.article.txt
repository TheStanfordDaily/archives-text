# All undergraduate majors should have advisers from their own departments, report says
## 
### 
The following report of the Subcommittee on Advising
was discussed and approved by the Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies at its Oct. 19 and Nov. 2 meetings
The chairman of the Subcommittee was Prof. David Riygs.
English. Also serving on the Subcommittee were Profs. Julius
Moravcsik, philosophy; John B. Shoven, economics; John H.
Thomas, biology; students Wayne Laroque, Joan Trusty, and
Mamie Shih; Alexander Fetter, associate dean of undergradu
ate studies, and Norman Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs, ex officio.
Last year the Subcommittee on Advising made the first,
and so far as we can tell, the only comprehensive study of
advising within the undergraduate major at Stanford. That
report (C-US 218-77) analyzes the several "responsibilities"
of the University administration, the academic departments,
the individual faculty member, and the individual student.
This year's report has a narrowed focus; it is mainly
concerned with the departmental responsibility, and in par
ticular with the department's responsibility to provide its
majors with individual advisors. In preparing our report we
have relied upon the basic analysis and data included in last
year's report, additional data furnished by departmental
responses to section "E" of the questionnaire that Dean
Katchadourian circulated to all department chairmen last
autumn, and the expertise and experience of individual
committee members.
The results of this year's "senior survey" were not
available in time for us to make use of them in preparing this
report, but once they are available, the survey results should
enable the Dean to check our findings and recommendations
against the perceptions of the graduating seniors themselves
(The senior survey appeared in the Nov. 9 Campus Report.)
Last year's report does not in fact suggest that depart
ments are obliged to provide their majors with individual
advisors. Certainly there are inherent difficulties with the
idea -e.g., some students may not want to have an individual
advisor, while some departments or programs, such as Human
Biology, simply may not have enough faculty to do the job.
Of course, any committee is ill-advised to make recom
mendations which are unrealizable in practice. Nevertheless,
we have concluded that every undergraduate major ought to
have the opportunity to select, or be assigned, an able advisor
from within his or her department.
Many students wish to develop a continuing relationship
with at least one faculty member on whom they can regularly
depend for advice, and to whom they can turn for a letter of
reference when they graduate. The University ought to
provide one formal avenue for this kind of exchange, even
though it is to be expected that many students will prefer to
rely on their own, informal contacts.
It would be futile to try to achieve this goal by inventing
a uniform plan and applying it to all departments across-the
board. Most departments already have perfectly sound ad
vising plans that go some, if not all, of the way towards
providing their majors with good individual advisors.
We propose no drastic modifications in the status quo.
But we are concerned that the design of these plans should
provide for the best possible level of exchange between
student and advisor, and we make a number of recommenda
tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:
I. The status quo: general description and guidelines.
11. How does the department make advisors accessible to
the individual major?
111. How does the department compensate advisors?
IV. Individual departments problems and suggestions.
I. General description and Guidelines.
Departments with a relatively small number of undergrad
uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.

tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:
I. The status quo: general description and guidelines.
11. How does the department make advisors accessible to
the individual major?
111. How does the department compensate advisors?
IV. Individual departments problems and suggestions.
I. General description and Guidelines.
Departments with a relatively small number of undergrad
uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.

The following report of the Subcommittee on Advising
was discussed and approved by the Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies at its Oct. 19 and Nov. 2 meetings
The chairman of the Subcommittee was Prof. David Riygs.
English. Also serving on the Subcommittee were Profs. Julius
Moravcsik, philosophy; John B. Shoven, economics; John H.
Thomas, biology; students Wayne Laroque, Joan Trusty, and
Mamie Shih; Alexander Fetter, associate dean of undergradu
ate studies, and Norman Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs, ex officio.
Last year the Subcommittee on Advising made the first,
and so far as we can tell, the only comprehensive study of
advising within the undergraduate major at Stanford. That
report (C-US 218-77) analyzes the several "responsibilities"
of the University administration, the academic departments,
the individual faculty member, and the individual student.
This year's report has a narrowed focus; it is mainly
concerned with the departmental responsibility, and in par
ticular with the department's responsibility to provide its
majors with individual advisors. In preparing our report we
have relied upon the basic analysis and data included in last
year's report, additional data furnished by departmental
responses to section "E" of the questionnaire that Dean
Katchadourian circulated to all department chairmen last
autumn, and the expertise and experience of individual
committee members.
The results of this year's "senior survey" were not
available in time for us to make use of them in preparing this
report, but once they are available, the survey results should
enable the Dean to check our findings and recommendations
against the perceptions of the graduating seniors themselves
(The senior survey appeared in the Nov. 9 Campus Report.)
Last year's report does not in fact suggest that depart
ments are obliged to provide their majors with individual
advisors. Certainly there are inherent difficulties with the
idea -e.g., some students may not want to have an individual
advisor, while some departments or programs, such as Human
Biology, simply may not have enough faculty to do the job.
Of course, any committee is ill-advised to make recom
mendations which are unrealizable in practice. Nevertheless,
we have concluded that every undergraduate major ought to
have the opportunity to select, or be assigned, an able advisor
from within his or her department.
Many students wish to develop a continuing relationship
with at least one faculty member on whom they can regularly
depend for advice, and to whom they can turn for a letter of
reference when they graduate. The University ought to
provide one formal avenue for this kind of exchange, even
though it is to be expected that many students will prefer to
rely on their own, informal contacts.
It would be futile to try to achieve this goal by inventing
a uniform plan and applying it to all departments across-the
board. Most departments already have perfectly sound ad
vising plans that go some, if not all, of the way towards
providing their majors with good individual advisors.
We propose no drastic modifications in the status quo.
But we are concerned that the design of these plans should
provide for the best possible level of exchange between
student and advisor, and we make a number of recommenda
tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:

department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.

The following report of the Subcommittee on Advising
was discussed and approved by the Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies at its Oct. 19 and Nov. 2 meetings
The chairman of the Subcommittee was Prof. David Riygs.
English. Also serving on the Subcommittee were Profs. Julius
Moravcsik, philosophy; John B. Shoven, economics; John H.
Thomas, biology; students Wayne Laroque, Joan Trusty, and
Mamie Shih; Alexander Fetter, associate dean of undergradu
ate studies, and Norman Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs, ex officio.
Last year the Subcommittee on Advising made the first,
and so far as we can tell, the only comprehensive study of
advising within the undergraduate major at Stanford. That
report (C-US 218-77) analyzes the several "responsibilities"
of the University administration, the academic departments,
the individual faculty member, and the individual student.
This year's report has a narrowed focus; it is mainly
concerned with the departmental responsibility, and in par
ticular with the department's responsibility to provide its
majors with individual advisors. In preparing our report we
have relied upon the basic analysis and data included in last
year's report, additional data furnished by departmental
responses to section "E" of the questionnaire that Dean
Katchadourian circulated to all department chairmen last
autumn, and the expertise and experience of individual
committee members.
The results of this year's "senior survey" were not
available in time for us to make use of them in preparing this
report, but once they are available, the survey results should
enable the Dean to check our findings and recommendations
against the perceptions of the graduating seniors themselves
(The senior survey appeared in the Nov. 9 Campus Report.)
Last year's report does not in fact suggest that depart
ments are obliged to provide their majors with individual
advisors. Certainly there are inherent difficulties with the
idea -e.g., some students may not want to have an individual
advisor, while some departments or programs, such as Human
Biology, simply may not have enough faculty to do the job.
Of course, any committee is ill-advised to make recom
mendations which are unrealizable in practice. Nevertheless,
we have concluded that every undergraduate major ought to
have the opportunity to select, or be assigned, an able advisor
from within his or her department.
Many students wish to develop a continuing relationship
with at least one faculty member on whom they can regularly
depend for advice, and to whom they can turn for a letter of
reference when they graduate. The University ought to
provide one formal avenue for this kind of exchange, even
though it is to be expected that many students will prefer to
rely on their own, informal contacts.
It would be futile to try to achieve this goal by inventing
a uniform plan and applying it to all departments across-the
board. Most departments already have perfectly sound ad
vising plans that go some, if not all, of the way towards
providing their majors with good individual advisors.
We propose no drastic modifications in the status quo.
But we are concerned that the design of these plans should
provide for the best possible level of exchange between
student and advisor, and we make a number of recommenda
tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:
I. The status quo: general description and guidelines.
11. How does the department make advisors accessible to
the individual major?
111. How does the department compensate advisors?
IV. Individual departments problems and suggestions.
I. General description and Guidelines.
Departments with a relatively small number of undergrad
uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.

wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of

individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.

The following report of the Subcommittee on Advising
was discussed and approved by the Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies at its Oct. 19 and Nov. 2 meetings
The chairman of the Subcommittee was Prof. David Riygs.
English. Also serving on the Subcommittee were Profs. Julius
Moravcsik, philosophy; John B. Shoven, economics; John H.
Thomas, biology; students Wayne Laroque, Joan Trusty, and
Mamie Shih; Alexander Fetter, associate dean of undergradu
ate studies, and Norman Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs, ex officio.
Last year the Subcommittee on Advising made the first,
and so far as we can tell, the only comprehensive study of
advising within the undergraduate major at Stanford. That
report (C-US 218-77) analyzes the several "responsibilities"
of the University administration, the academic departments,
the individual faculty member, and the individual student.
This year's report has a narrowed focus; it is mainly
concerned with the departmental responsibility, and in par
ticular with the department's responsibility to provide its
majors with individual advisors. In preparing our report we
have relied upon the basic analysis and data included in last
year's report, additional data furnished by departmental
responses to section "E" of the questionnaire that Dean
Katchadourian circulated to all department chairmen last
autumn, and the expertise and experience of individual
committee members.
The results of this year's "senior survey" were not
available in time for us to make use of them in preparing this
report, but once they are available, the survey results should
enable the Dean to check our findings and recommendations
against the perceptions of the graduating seniors themselves
(The senior survey appeared in the Nov. 9 Campus Report.)
Last year's report does not in fact suggest that depart
ments are obliged to provide their majors with individual
advisors. Certainly there are inherent difficulties with the
idea -e.g., some students may not want to have an individual
advisor, while some departments or programs, such as Human
Biology, simply may not have enough faculty to do the job.
Of course, any committee is ill-advised to make recom
mendations which are unrealizable in practice. Nevertheless,
we have concluded that every undergraduate major ought to
have the opportunity to select, or be assigned, an able advisor
from within his or her department.
Many students wish to develop a continuing relationship
with at least one faculty member on whom they can regularly
depend for advice, and to whom they can turn for a letter of
reference when they graduate. The University ought to
provide one formal avenue for this kind of exchange, even
though it is to be expected that many students will prefer to
rely on their own, informal contacts.
It would be futile to try to achieve this goal by inventing
a uniform plan and applying it to all departments across-the
board. Most departments already have perfectly sound ad
vising plans that go some, if not all, of the way towards
providing their majors with good individual advisors.
We propose no drastic modifications in the status quo.
But we are concerned that the design of these plans should
provide for the best possible level of exchange between
student and advisor, and we make a number of recommenda
tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:
I. The status quo: general description and guidelines.
11. How does the department make advisors accessible to
the individual major?
111. How does the department compensate advisors?
IV. Individual departments problems and suggestions.
I. General description and Guidelines.
Departments with a relatively small number of undergrad
uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.

(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.

The following report of the Subcommittee on Advising
was discussed and approved by the Senate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies at its Oct. 19 and Nov. 2 meetings
The chairman of the Subcommittee was Prof. David Riygs.
English. Also serving on the Subcommittee were Profs. Julius
Moravcsik, philosophy; John B. Shoven, economics; John H.
Thomas, biology; students Wayne Laroque, Joan Trusty, and
Mamie Shih; Alexander Fetter, associate dean of undergradu
ate studies, and Norman Robinson, associate dean of student
affairs, ex officio.
Last year the Subcommittee on Advising made the first,
and so far as we can tell, the only comprehensive study of
advising within the undergraduate major at Stanford. That
report (C-US 218-77) analyzes the several "responsibilities"
of the University administration, the academic departments,
the individual faculty member, and the individual student.
This year's report has a narrowed focus; it is mainly
concerned with the departmental responsibility, and in par
ticular with the department's responsibility to provide its
majors with individual advisors. In preparing our report we
have relied upon the basic analysis and data included in last
year's report, additional data furnished by departmental
responses to section "E" of the questionnaire that Dean
Katchadourian circulated to all department chairmen last
autumn, and the expertise and experience of individual
committee members.
The results of this year's "senior survey" were not
available in time for us to make use of them in preparing this
report, but once they are available, the survey results should
enable the Dean to check our findings and recommendations
against the perceptions of the graduating seniors themselves
(The senior survey appeared in the Nov. 9 Campus Report.)
Last year's report does not in fact suggest that depart
ments are obliged to provide their majors with individual
advisors. Certainly there are inherent difficulties with the
idea -e.g., some students may not want to have an individual
advisor, while some departments or programs, such as Human
Biology, simply may not have enough faculty to do the job.
Of course, any committee is ill-advised to make recom
mendations which are unrealizable in practice. Nevertheless,
we have concluded that every undergraduate major ought to
have the opportunity to select, or be assigned, an able advisor
from within his or her department.
Many students wish to develop a continuing relationship
with at least one faculty member on whom they can regularly
depend for advice, and to whom they can turn for a letter of
reference when they graduate. The University ought to
provide one formal avenue for this kind of exchange, even
though it is to be expected that many students will prefer to
rely on their own, informal contacts.
It would be futile to try to achieve this goal by inventing
a uniform plan and applying it to all departments across-the
board. Most departments already have perfectly sound ad
vising plans that go some, if not all, of the way towards
providing their majors with good individual advisors.
We propose no drastic modifications in the status quo.
But we are concerned that the design of these plans should
provide for the best possible level of exchange between
student and advisor, and we make a number of recommenda
tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:
I. The status quo: general description and guidelines.
11. How does the department make advisors accessible to
the individual major?
111. How does the department compensate advisors?
IV. Individual departments problems and suggestions.
I. General description and Guidelines.
Departments with a relatively small number of undergrad
uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread

themselves.

munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if

of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question

advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re

believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.

of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.

Last year the Subcommittee on Advising made the first,
and so far as we can tell, the only comprehensive study of
advising within the undergraduate major at Stanford. That
report (C-US 218-77) analyzes the several "responsibilities"
of the University administration, the academic departments,
the individual faculty member, and the individual student.
This year's report has a narrowed focus; it is mainly
concerned with the departmental responsibility, and in par
ticular with the department's responsibility to provide its
majors with individual advisors. In preparing our report we
have relied upon the basic analysis and data included in last
year's report, additional data furnished by departmental
responses to section "E" of the questionnaire that Dean
Katchadourian circulated to all department chairmen last
autumn, and the expertise and experience of individual
committee members.
The results of this year's "senior survey" were not
available in time for us to make use of them in preparing this
report, but once they are available, the survey results should
enable the Dean to check our findings and recommendations
against the perceptions of the graduating seniors themselves
(The senior survey appeared in the Nov. 9 Campus Report.)
Last year's report does not in fact suggest that depart
ments are obliged to provide their majors with individual
advisors. Certainly there are inherent difficulties with the
idea -e.g., some students may not want to have an individual
advisor, while some departments or programs, such as Human
Biology, simply may not have enough faculty to do the job.
Of course, any committee is ill-advised to make recom
mendations which are unrealizable in practice. Nevertheless,
we have concluded that every undergraduate major ought to
have the opportunity to select, or be assigned, an able advisor
from within his or her department.
Many students wish to develop a continuing relationship
with at least one faculty member on whom they can regularly
depend for advice, and to whom they can turn for a letter of
reference when they graduate. The University ought to
provide one formal avenue for this kind of exchange, even
though it is to be expected that many students will prefer to
rely on their own, informal contacts.
It would be futile to try to achieve this goal by inventing
a uniform plan and applying it to all departments across-the
board. Most departments already have perfectly sound ad
vising plans that go some, if not all, of the way towards
providing their majors with good individual advisors.
We propose no drastic modifications in the status quo.
But we are concerned that the design of these plans should
provide for the best possible level of exchange between
student and advisor, and we make a number of recommenda
tions to that end. In presenting our recommendations, we
shall use the following general outline:
I. The status quo: general description and guidelines.
11. How does the department make advisors accessible to
the individual major?
111. How does the department compensate advisors?
IV. Individual departments problems and suggestions.
I. General description and Guidelines.
Departments with a relatively small number of undergrad
uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.

uate majors, e.g., 30 or less, often assign them all to one or
two designated advisors.
This arrangement seems to work fairly well in practice,
though the student should always have the option of request

ing another advisor. Also, we do not think it appropriate for
a designated departmental advisor to receive a reduction in
his or her teaching responsibilities as compensation for doing
this work.
Larger departments, such as English and Chemistry, may
delegate responsibility for undergraduate advising to an un
dergraduate studies committee that serves, in effect, as a
committee of advisors. We believe it is important that the
members of this committee should offer to take on students
as their individual advisees, and that the offer should be made
in writing (cf section 11, below).
It is also common for departments to distribute the
responsibility for undergraduate advising among a large num
ber—in some cases, virtually all—of the departmental faculty.
Here again, the department should encourage the student to
choose his or her individual advisor, or alternatively, to be
assigned one.
Moreover, the person in charge of undergraduate advising
should have a good deal of discretion in making individual
assignments. If faculty members are unforthcoming, or un
skillful, at this task, they should not be assigned advisees; if
others take on more than their share, they should get a
reduction in their share of departmental committee work or
some other compensation.
Finally, departments and programs with a lopsided ratio
of majors to faculty may adopt a system of "peer" advising.
The student advisors in Human Biology have, from all
accounts, been a highly successful team, and we do not wish
to suggest that peer-advising should be deemphasized in any
way.
Nevertheless, if the student advisor is conceived of as a
substitute for a regular faculty advisor, he or she may fall
short in two respects: since the peer only advises for one, or
at the most, two years, he or she cannot monitor the
student's progress very effectively, moreover, the student
rfdvisor is not in a position to write such a strong letter of
reference for the advisee.
In section IV of this report we shall offer some sugges
tions about how these problems might be alleviated or
remedied.
11. How does the department make its advisors accessible to
the individual major?
When a student declares a major he or she should be given
a brief, written description of the department's advising plan
The plan need be no more than one or two paragraphs
long. It should notify the student as to which members of the
department are available to take on individual undergraduate
advisees, and, insofar as is possible, allow the student to
choose among them. Of course the student should also be
given the option of having his or her advisor assigned by the
department. Where this is the case, the assignment should be
made by a faculty-member-in-charge who will first interview
ihe student and then seek to match him or her with the most
appropriate advisor.
If the student does not choose an advisor, and does not
wish to be assigned one at the time, the department is not
obliged to make an assignment; but the student should be
informed that both of these options will remain open from
the point of entry into the major through the last quarter of
the senior year.
Similarly, the student should be able to request a change
of advisor at any time, and should be encouraged to do so
whenever he or she has formed a strong academic connection
with a particular faculty member. Finally, whenever a stu
dent is matched with an individual advisor, both parties
should be notified in writing.
We believe that the written plan should encourage the
student to choose, or be assigned, the advisor who best serves
his or her needs; it should also encourage the student to
consult with the advisor an a quarterly basis.
If the student so desires, he or she should be able to have
the registrar send the advisor separate copies of the quarterly

transcript (i.e., apart from the copy which is deposited in the
departmental files), particularly in cases where the depart
ment is relatively large and overburdened. This practice
would put the advisor in a better position to monitor the
student's progress and might help encourage the quarterly
visit.
111. What compensation should the department provide for
its advisors?
It is unrealistic to suppose that advising students about
their choice of courses, career plans, etc., will play a signifi
cant role in decisions about salary and promotion. On the
other hand, instructional advising— i.e., helping a student with
his or her academic work and intellectual development
ought to count as part of a faculty member's teaching record
and should carry real weight in such decisions (compare the
Report of the Committee on the Professoriate at Stanford, p.
67).
So long as the number of majors is reasonably low in
absolute terms, there is not likely to be any serious problem:
Humanities Special Programs has a ratio of 28 majors to 2
faculty, but the chairman has been able to find advisors for
the 28 majors in the program without undue strain.
At the other extreme, the chairman of the Program in
Human Biology, with 2.9 roster faculty at his disposal, has a
formidable, if not impossible task in finding faculty advisors
for his 245 undergraduate majors. The chairman has dealt
with the problem by employing student advisors who have,
from all accounts, been very effective. Nevertheless, the
chairman believes that "students still are concerned that they
don't have adequate access to faculty for advising purposes,
and until we can change the ratio, I don't think we can
improve our performance in this area."
We propose two strategies which might go some way
towards alleviating the problem:
1) Canvass the 39 faculty members affiliated with the
program to see if some of them might be willing to take on a
limited number of undergraduate advisees on a voluntary
basis. Students who express a marked preference for an
individual faculty advisor could choose, or be assigned to,
those advisors on a first-come, first-served basis.
2) Employ post-doctoral fellows, advanced graduate stu
dents, or emeritus faculty in related fields to serve as advisors
in the program. The latter plan would of course require the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to allocate
additional funds to the Program, but we believe that such
funds would be well-spent.
It is our view that faculty members should not be
awarded course relief, or credit towards course relief, for
advising undergraduate majors. From the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies' point of view, this is a case of robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
Large departments may require a director of undergrad
uate studies whose duties include, among many other things,
a good deal of advising, and who receives some reduction in
his or her course load, but the ongoing task of advising
undergraduate majors is one of a faculty member's regular
responsibilities, and it should not divert his or her time from
the department's instructional program.
In cases where the job of undergraduate advising is
distributed pretty evenly throughout the entire department
(e.g.. History and Biology), the question of compensation is
essentially moot: no one is carrying any extra burdens.
When, however, the job mainly devolves upon a particular
faculty member or group of faculty members—either as
members of an advising committee, or simply as popular
active advisors—the department must , find some way of
rewarding them for this service. The department chairman
may reduce their other committee assignments, or he may
free them from other administrative work.
In any event, there should be some explicit understanding
between the chairman and the faculty member(s) who are
doing the bulk of the advising. If there is no corresponding
reduction in the advisor's departmental committee or ad

ministrative work, then his or her additional services should
be reflected in additional salary increases.
IV. Individual departments: problems and suggestions
In departments with a relatively small number of majors
(e.g., 30 or less), the classes will generally be small as well.
Hence, there is every likelihood of frequent exchange be
tween faculty members and individual majors, and advising
per se is usually not a problem.
In larger departments that have a relatively favorable ratio
of majors-to-faculty, such as Art, English, History, and Math,
there is a greater likelihood that the needs of the individual
major may be overlooked, but we believe that the practical
recommendations included in Section II of this report should
at least help to minimize those risks.
Large departments with a relatively unfavorable ratio of
Idculty-to-students—e.g., greater than 10:1—are likely to have
the additional problem of providing adequate incentives for
an already overburdened corps of undergraduate advisors.
In applying the recommendations outlined in Section 111,
the dean should recognize that the situation varies greatly
from department to department (and, of course, from year to
year; our information is based on enrollment figures for
1976-77).
Biology, for example, has the worst ratio of majors-to
faculty of any department in Humanities and Sciences
(23.5:1); but the department has relieved some of the
pressure by developing a highly effective system of peer
advising (the Biology Bridge), while its faculty have spread
the burden of undergraduate advising pretty evenly amongst
themselves.
On the other hand, in Political Science (10.7:1), Com
munication (1 2.3:1), and Economics (16.3:1), it appears as if
some faculty members consistently do more than their share
of advising, but receive little or no credit for this work (see,
for example, the chairmen's comments on the question
naires). The Psychology Department (12.28:1) "makes no
special effort to honor or credit advising," but undergraduate
advisors are relieved from other tasks, such as "heading
graduate admissions or search committees" (chairman's re
sponse to Dean Katchadourian's questionnaire).
In view of the fact that last year's Subcommittee on
Advising concluded that the Psychology Department was not
doing a good job of advising its undergraduate majors, we
believe that the chairman should consider strengthening his
group of advisors by providing them with a more clear and
well-defined set of incentives.
In the Economics Department, a highly unfavorable ratio
of 400 students to 30 faculty (16.3:1) is aggravated by the
fact that many of the regular faculty have their teaching time
reduced for sponsored research projects, while a fair propor
tion of the instructional program is carried out by short-term
visitors who are of little or no use in undergraduate advising.
Not surprisingly, the chairman notes that some faculty
members "carry a disproportionate load"—i.e., 40 or more
individual advisees (cf: the 1976 Report of this Subcommit
tee, p. 4)-and it does not appear that the department has
found adequate ways of acknowledging or rewarding this
effort. We believe that a ceiling of 25 students per advisor
would be preferable to the current arrangement.
If the department simply does not have enough faculty on
hand to advise its 400 majors, then the chairman should
apply to the School for whatever funds are required to "boy"
the needed additional advising. Such funds might be used to
reward those individuals who carry the "disproportionate
load"; alternatively the department might consider employ
ing advanced graduate students or emeritus faculty as advis
ors.
With interdisciplinary programs, the ratio of majors-to
faculty may be horrendous-iince the program is likely to
have only one or two roster faculty appointmer.ts-but also
misleading—since the chairman can call on faculty from
related departments to help with the advising.
