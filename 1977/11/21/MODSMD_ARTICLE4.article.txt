# Court orders doctor's hearing

A State SuperiorCourt judge has ordered the Stanford
Hospital Board of Directors to provide a hearing for Palo
Alto radiologist Dr. William Hayden by Feb. 6 to deter
mine why he was denied a position to the medical staff in
February 1976.
According to University counsel, Hayden was origi
nally granted a hearing by the board, but arbitration was
broken off when a key witness became critically ill.
Hayden then took the case to court, claiming he was
entitled to a medical staff position and that he deserved a
board meeting.
Superior Court Judge Barton Phelps signed the order
for the hearing earlier this month.
Hayden said he doesn't know why he was rejected a
staff position in the first place.
"I met or exceeded all of the qualifications to be a
member of the medical staff," he said. "The over
crowded situation at the hospital won't affect me be
cause the rooms I would be using are not overcrowded
and are, in fact, underutilized."
Hayden said he would be using heart catheterization
labs and added that "schedules for the labs are not full."
University counsel based their case for rejecting
Hayden on the hospital's "closed staff rule," which
limits use of radiology facilities to certain kinds of physi
cians, said Gale Mandry, assistant counsel for medical
affairs.
However, Mayden claims the University never offi
cially closed the staff, because no closing rule is stated in
the hospital by-laws.
"Stanford does have a closed staff rule with respect to

radiology," said )ohn Schwartz, counsel for medical af
fairs. "The rule is stated in a variety of places — in the city
contract and so on."
Schwartz said the closed staff rule is "hard toexplain."
He said the rule means "the staff is not open to every
physician wanting to be on the staff. Participating com
munity physicians have to meet certain conditions to be
admitted."
He declined to detail those conditions.
"The issue of a closed staff is crucial to the people and
doctors of Palo Alto," said Hayden. "It concerns the
right of the physician to practice medicine and the right
of the people to pick the doctor they want as opposed to
a system of doctor of the day.' "
He added that "the bottom line of a closed staff rule is
whether Stanford has a service where the patient takes
what is available or if it offers a choice of physicians."
Hayden said the University advocates a closed staff
rule because it claims to be a teaching hospital and
having an open staff would interfere with the teaching
system.
"As )udge Phelps pointed out, Stanford is not solely a
teaching hospital, but also a community hospital,"
Hayden said.
The judge's order states that at the upcoming hearing,
"the applicability and validity of a closed staff rule in the
Division of Diagnostic Radiology will inevitably be ques
tioned."
The order adds that in determining whether it is
reasonable to close the staff in any department, the
board must "consider the quality of patient care."

Hayden said he would be using heart catheterization
labs and added that "schedules for the labs are not full."
University counsel based their case for rejecting
Hayden on the hospital's "closed staff rule," which
limits use of radiology facilities to certain kinds of physi
cians, said Gale Mandry, assistant counsel for medical
affairs.
However, Mayden claims the University never offi
cially closed the staff, because no closing rule is stated in
the hospital by-laws.
"Stanford does have a closed staff rule with respect to

radiology," said )ohn Schwartz, counsel for medical af
fairs. "The rule is stated in a variety of places — in the city
contract and so on."
Schwartz said the closed staff rule is "hard toexplain."
He said the rule means "the staff is not open to every
physician wanting to be on the staff. Participating com
munity physicians have to meet certain conditions to be
admitted."
He declined to detail those conditions.
"The issue of a closed staff is crucial to the people and
doctors of Palo Alto," said Hayden. "It concerns the
right of the physician to practice medicine and the right
of the people to pick the doctor they want as opposed to
a system of doctor of the day.' "
He added that "the bottom line of a closed staff rule is
whether Stanford has a service where the patient takes
what is available or if it offers a choice of physicians."
Hayden said the University advocates a closed staff
rule because it claims to be a teaching hospital and
having an open staff would interfere with the teaching
system.
"As )udge Phelps pointed out, Stanford is not solely a
teaching hospital, but also a community hospital,"
Hayden said.
The judge's order states that at the upcoming hearing,
"the applicability and validity of a closed staff rule in the
Division of Diagnostic Radiology will inevitably be ques
tioned."
The order adds that in determining whether it is
reasonable to close the staff in any department, the
board must "consider the quality of patient care."
A State SuperiorCourt judge has ordered the Stanford
Hospital Board of Directors to provide a hearing for Palo
Alto radiologist Dr. William Hayden by Feb. 6 to deter
mine why he was denied a position to the medical staff in
February 1976.
According to University counsel, Hayden was origi
nally granted a hearing by the board, but arbitration was
broken off when a key witness became critically ill.
Hayden then took the case to court, claiming he was
entitled to a medical staff position and that he deserved a
board meeting.
Superior Court Judge Barton Phelps signed the order
for the hearing earlier this month.
Hayden said he doesn't know why he was rejected a
staff position in the first place.
"I met or exceeded all of the qualifications to be a
member of the medical staff," he said. "The over
crowded situation at the hospital won't affect me be
cause the rooms I would be using are not overcrowded
and are, in fact, underutilized."
Hayden said he would be using heart catheterization
labs and added that "schedules for the labs are not full."
