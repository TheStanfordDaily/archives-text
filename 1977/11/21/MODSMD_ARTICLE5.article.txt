# Anwar Sadat eyes peace with Israel

### 
Jerusalem (AP) â€” In an act unthink
able less than two weeks ago, Egyp
tian President Anwar Sadat stood in
the parliament of Israel yesterday
and declared: "We accept to live
with you in a lasting and just peace."
The declaration broadcast around
the globe was the closest any Arab
leader has come to recognizing Israel
as an independent nation in 30 years
of intermittent wars.
Sadat's mission captured the im
agination of millions, but infuriated
Palestinian and other Arab militants
to the point of calling for his assassi
nation as a traitor.
Greeted at the Knesset by a fanfare
of trumpets, Sadat read solemnly in
Arabic from his text. "When the bells
of peace ring, there will be no bands
to beat the drums of war. Even if they

existed, they would be soundless."
He insisted in his 55-minute
speech that Israel must withdraw
from Jerusalem and other lands oc
cupied in 1967 and that uprooted
Palestinians must receive a home
land.
Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin, following Sadat to the rostrum
of the Knesset, hailed the Egyptian
president for his "courage of heart"
in coming to Israel and invited other
Arabs to follow his path. Begin said
he personally was prepared to go to
the capitals of his Arab neighbors.
He called on Arab leaders to open
peace negotiations and declared:
"Everything must Joe negotiated and
can be negotiated."
The immense significance of the
day was not in its speeches, but in the
symbolism. Never before had an
Arab leader journeyed to Israel, let
alone stood before its parliament to
say:
"I wish to tell you today and I proc
laim to the whole world: We accept
to live with you in a lasting and just
peace."
Carter prays
In Washington, President Jimmy
Carter prayed for the success of the
Sadat-Begin meeting and said the
Egyptian's mission to Israel "might
very well break down the barrier to
peace."
The internationally broadcast offer
of peace before the Knesset climaxed
Sadat's history-making journey to
Jerusalem. It was the culmination of a
dramatic series of exchanges bet
ween Sadat and Begin that began
only 11 days before and caught most
world leaders by surprise.
Israel greeted Sadat as a hero, turn
ing out the entire cabinet to greet
him at the airport Saturday and de
corating Jerusalem with thousands of
Israeli and Egyptian flags.
After worshipping at the Al-Aqsa
mosque, visiting a Christian church
and touring the Yad Vashem monu
ment to Jewish victims of the Nazi
holocaust, Sadat arrived at the Knes
set hall accompanied by Israeli Presi
dent Ephraim Katzir and Knesset
speaker Yitzhak Shamir.
Israel listens
Military trumpeters sounded a fan
fare and the members and visitors
rose to their feet and applauded.
Then for the next 55 minutes the rab
bis in skullcaps, Arabs in flowing
headcloths, army generals who had
battled Egypt, current and former
government leaders, diplomats and
journalists sat in silence, listening
througii earphones.
"You would like to live with us in
this region of the world, and I tell you
in all honesty that we welcome you
among us with all the security and
peace," Sadat said.
His message, he said, "constitutes
an important juncture in the history
of the world."
