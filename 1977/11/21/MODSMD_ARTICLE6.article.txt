# What it means to be a radical
## 
### 
"The virtues of mercy, non
violence, love, and truth in any man
can be truly tested only when they
are pitted against ruthlessness, vio
lence, hatred, and untruth."
Mohatma Gandhi
"Let me say, at the risk of seeming
ridiculous, that the true revolutionary
is guided by great feelings of love."
Che Guevara
Having failed to observe the liqui
dation of my audience by the mass
exodus I was sure my last column
would precipitate (Daily, Oct. 31, "A
message to freshpeople: 'Get the hell
out of Stanford' "), I suppose I am
once again condemned to roll my
Sisyphusian rock up the hill.
Already humbled by the lack of in
stant results I had deluded myself
into believing the mighty pen was
capable of, I found myself sinking
into ever greater depths of despair, as
I began to formulate for today's piece
a full scale radical analysis of just
why Stanford can be so harmful to
mind, heart and soul.
For I could envision ever more
clearly the inevitable results: the
small minority who already agreed
with me would feel the suffusion of a
warmer and more gratifying sense of
identification with each passing
word, while the rest — the majority I
would really be trying to reach —
would be dropping off like flies with
each new assault on their beloved
provider of wisdom, wealth and
power, having stereotyped me from
the word "go" as another one of those
rabid, raving radicals.
To be read
Well, in fact I am a radical, and like
most people who care deeply about
something, I occasionally rave and
sometimes I become rabid. But like
any writer, I write to be read, and
preferably read with some minimal
comprehension. Stereotyping, how
ever, lends itself neither to reading
nor to comprehension.
So before I attempt a radical
analysis of any particular issue, I
thought I might be awarded at least
some small measure of understand
ing, if not agreement, if I first
explained a littlebitabout myself asa
radical and what it means tobeone in
general.
To begin with, perhaps I appear to
be exaggerating my isolation here as
a radical. I mean, after all, just look at
all the people who got involved with
the South African issue last spring:
1000 people attending rallies, 500
people sitting in at Old Union, 300
people getting arrested. But the prob
lem is that the majority of those
people were not radicals; they might
best be described as "concerned lib
erals" (i.e. modern welfare liberalism
as opposed to the classical liberalism
of laissez-faire).
World of difference
There is a world of difference bet
ween a liberal and a radical. A liberal
believes that whatever i I Is exist inthe
present system can be sufficiently
ameliorated through reform. A radi
cal (the word simply means going to
the root of th ings), on the other hand,

believes that the system is so funda
mentally flawed that major structural
changes are necessary.
Personally, I find myself — like
most radicals of the New Left —
drawing not only upon Marxist
thought, but a great deal from the
anarchist tradition as well. While all
leftists are united in their basic op
position to capitalism, New Leftists
tend to be more willing to also
criticize the bureaucratic socialism
(or state capitalism, as some would
call it) of the Soviet bloc.
While as a radical, I obviously find
the liberal response to such problems
as mass starvation in the Third World
and mass alienation in the industrial
world completely inadequate, I do
not mean to denigrate liberals al
together. Political action by liberals
is largely motivated by moral con
cern, and this moral concern can be
the first step towards their radicaliza
tion as it brings them into closer con
tact with the oppression of others, as
well as — surprise, surprise — their
own oppression.
'Over there'
Thus, many people initially got in
volved in the South African issue last
year out of a sense of outrage about
the exploitation "over there," but
soon discovered, lo and behold, that
the South African whites did not
have a monopoly on oppression, that
some of it, in fact, existed in the back
yards of their own experience.
For Afro-Americans and other ra
cial minorities, of course, the connec
tion was never difficult to make.
Women also already had some in
sight into what it means to be treated
as an inferior and objectified day in
and day out. All of us experienced
what it means to have structural
powerlessness enforced upon us in
this University. We thus learned that
not all our problems are individual
ones as the American ideology leads
us to believe.
At least as important as these nega
tive experiences in radicalizing
people, were tremendously positive
ones. We d iscovered that by work ing
collectively we do have the power to
affectour livesandthe livesofothers,
and that sometimes this power must
be expressed outside of the system.
By working together we also disco
vered what is so diff icu It to achieve at
this University, and increasingly
anywhere in this entire country, and
what is to me a value more important
than individual achievement or most
of the values forced upon us in this
society, and that is a sense of com
munity.
Strength of conviction
It is because radicals are willing to
value community and collective ac
tion that they often get stereotyped as
being power hungry and guilty of
"group think." Because they have
achieved a strength of conviction
that can only be arrived at by acting
on the world and not from mere
abstract intellectualizing, radicals
are often stereotyped as being
closed-minded and one-sided. This

Michael J. Jennings

is not to say that the tendencies pic
tured in these stereotypes are not real
dangers that must constantly be
guarded against by people working
for basic social change, but they are
not intrinsic tothe radical enterprise.
Finally, a word about where radi
cals draw their strength, sustenance,
and fire from. They draw it from
many sources, one of the most impor
tant being the healthy anger that
arises from an awarenessof their own
and others' oppression.
As for myself — my radical roots
are perhaps more "spiritual" than
those of some others: in part owing to
an early vocation to the priesthood, I
suppose I never quite got over in part
because — believe it or not — al
though my Catholicism was the first
victim of my radical meatgrinder, I
was actually radicalized through the
Catholic Church in my freshman year
at a Catholic high school (after all,
remember the Berrigan brothers!); fi
nally and most importantly because
everyday I am overwhelmed with an
awarenessof the incredible potential
for love and joy in the human spirit,
and yet every day I observe how that
potential is bottled up in myself, and
everywhere piteouslessly being
crushed.

some of it, in fact, existed in the back
yards of their own experience.
For Afro-Americans and other ra
cial minorities, of course, the connec
tion was never difficult to make.
Women also already had some in
sight into what it means to be treated
as an inferior and objectified day in
and day out. All of us experienced
what it means to have structural
powerlessness enforced upon us in
this University. We thus learned that
not all our problems are individual
ones as the American ideology leads
us to believe.
At least as important as these nega
tive experiences in radicalizing
people, were tremendously positive
ones. We d iscovered that by work ing
collectively we do have the power to
affectour livesandthe livesofothers,
and that sometimes this power must
be expressed outside of the system.
By working together we also disco
vered what is so diff icu It to achieve at
this University, and increasingly
anywhere in this entire country, and
what is to me a value more important
than individual achievement or most
of the values forced upon us in this
society, and that is a sense of com
munity.
Strength of conviction
It is because radicals are willing to
value community and collective ac
tion that they often get stereotyped as
being power hungry and guilty of
"group think." Because they have
achieved a strength of conviction
that can only be arrived at by acting
on the world and not from mere
abstract intellectualizing, radicals
are often stereotyped as being
closed-minded and one-sided. This

Michael J. Jennings

is not to say that the tendencies pic
tured in these stereotypes are not real
dangers that must constantly be
guarded against by people working
for basic social change, but they are
not intrinsic tothe radical enterprise.
Finally, a word about where radi
cals draw their strength, sustenance,
and fire from. They draw it from
many sources, one of the most impor
tant being the healthy anger that
arises from an awarenessof their own
and others' oppression.
As for myself — my radical roots
are perhaps more "spiritual" than
those of some others: in part owing to
an early vocation to the priesthood, I
suppose I never quite got over in part
because — believe it or not — al
though my Catholicism was the first
victim of my radical meatgrinder, I
was actually radicalized through the
Catholic Church in my freshman year
at a Catholic high school (after all,
remember the Berrigan brothers!); fi
nally and most importantly because
everyday I am overwhelmed with an
awarenessof the incredible potential
for love and joy in the human spirit,
and yet every day I observe how that
potential is bottled up in myself, and
everywhere piteouslessly being
crushed.

"The virtues of mercy, non

can be truly tested only when they

"Let me say, at the risk of seeming

Having failed to observe the liqui
dation of my audience by the mass
exodus I was sure my last column
would precipitate (Daily, Oct. 31, "A
message to freshpeople: 'Get the hell
out of Stanford' "), I suppose I am
once again condemned to roll my
Sisyphusian rock up the hill.
Already humbled by the lack of in
stant results I had deluded myself
into believing the mighty pen was
capable of, I found myself sinking
into ever greater depths of despair, as
I began to formulate for today's piece
a full scale radical analysis of just
why Stanford can be so harmful to
mind, heart and soul.
For I could envision ever more
clearly the inevitable results: the
small minority who already agreed
with me would feel the suffusion of a
warmer and more gratifying sense of
identification with each passing
word, while the rest — the majority I
would really be trying to reach —
would be dropping off like flies with
each new assault on their beloved
provider of wisdom, wealth and
power, having stereotyped me from
the word "go" as another one of those
rabid, raving radicals.
To be read
Well, in fact I am a radical, and like
most people who care deeply about
something, I occasionally rave and
sometimes I become rabid. But like
any writer, I write to be read, and
preferably read with some minimal
comprehension. Stereotyping, how
ever, lends itself neither to reading
nor to comprehension.
So before I attempt a radical
analysis of any particular issue, I
thought I might be awarded at least
some small measure of understand
ing, if not agreement, if I first
explained a littlebitabout myself asa
radical and what it means tobeone in
general.
To begin with, perhaps I appear to
be exaggerating my isolation here as
a radical. I mean, after all, just look at
all the people who got involved with
the South African issue last spring:
1000 people attending rallies, 500
people sitting in at Old Union, 300
people getting arrested. But the prob
lem is that the majority of those
people were not radicals; they might
best be described as "concerned lib
erals" (i.e. modern welfare liberalism
as opposed to the classical liberalism
of laissez-faire).
World of difference
There is a world of difference bet
ween a liberal and a radical. A liberal
believes that whatever i I Is exist inthe
present system can be sufficiently
ameliorated through reform. A radi
cal (the word simply means going to
the root of th ings), on the other hand,

believes that the system is so funda
mentally flawed that major structural
changes are necessary.
Personally, I find myself — like
most radicals of the New Left —
drawing not only upon Marxist
thought, but a great deal from the
anarchist tradition as well. While all
leftists are united in their basic op
position to capitalism, New Leftists
tend to be more willing to also
criticize the bureaucratic socialism
(or state capitalism, as some would
call it) of the Soviet bloc.
While as a radical, I obviously find
the liberal response to such problems
as mass starvation in the Third World
and mass alienation in the industrial
world completely inadequate, I do
not mean to denigrate liberals al
together. Political action by liberals
is largely motivated by moral con
cern, and this moral concern can be
the first step towards their radicaliza
tion as it brings them into closer con
tact with the oppression of others, as
well as — surprise, surprise — their
own oppression.
'Over there'
Thus, many people initially got in
volved in the South African issue last
year out of a sense of outrage about
the exploitation "over there," but
soon discovered, lo and behold, that
the South African whites did not
have a monopoly on oppression, that
some of it, in fact, existed in the back
yards of their own experience.
For Afro-Americans and other ra
cial minorities, of course, the connec

power, having stereotyped me from
the word "go" as another one of those
rabid, raving radicals.
To be read
Well, in fact I am a radical, and like
most people who care deeply about
something, I occasionally rave and
sometimes I become rabid. But like
any writer, I write to be read, and
preferably read with some minimal
comprehension. Stereotyping, how
ever, lends itself neither to reading
nor to comprehension.
So before I attempt a radical
analysis of any particular issue, I
thought I might be awarded at least
some small measure of understand
ing, if not agreement, if I first
explained a littlebitabout myself asa
radical and what it means tobeone in
general.
To begin with, perhaps I appear to
be exaggerating my isolation here as
a radical. I mean, after all, just look at
all the people who got involved with
the South African issue last spring:
1000 people attending rallies, 500
people sitting in at Old Union, 300
people getting arrested. But the prob
lem is that the majority of those
people were not radicals; they might
best be described as "concerned lib
erals" (i.e. modern welfare liberalism
as opposed to the classical liberalism
of laissez-faire).
World of difference
There is a world of difference bet
ween a liberal and a radical. A liberal
believes that whatever i I Is exist inthe
present system can be sufficiently
ameliorated through reform. A radi
cal (the word simply means going to
the root of th ings), on the other hand,

believes that the system is so funda
mentally flawed that major structural
changes are necessary.
Personally, I find myself — like
most radicals of the New Left —
drawing not only upon Marxist
thought, but a great deal from the
anarchist tradition as well. While all
leftists are united in their basic op
position to capitalism, New Leftists
tend to be more willing to also
criticize the bureaucratic socialism
(or state capitalism, as some would
call it) of the Soviet bloc.
While as a radical, I obviously find
the liberal response to such problems
as mass starvation in the Third World
and mass alienation in the industrial
world completely inadequate, I do
not mean to denigrate liberals al
together. Political action by liberals
is largely motivated by moral con
cern, and this moral concern can be
the first step towards their radicaliza
tion as it brings them into closer con
tact with the oppression of others, as
well as — surprise, surprise — their
own oppression.
'Over there'
Thus, many people initially got in
volved in the South African issue last
year out of a sense of outrage about
the exploitation "over there," but
soon discovered, lo and behold, that
the South African whites did not
have a monopoly on oppression, that
some of it, in fact, existed in the back
yards of their own experience.
For Afro-Americans and other ra
cial minorities, of course, the connec
tion was never difficult to make.
Women also already had some in
sight into what it means to be treated
as an inferior and objectified day in
and day out. All of us experienced
what it means to have structural
powerlessness enforced upon us in
this University. We thus learned that
not all our problems are individual
ones as the American ideology leads
us to believe.
At least as important as these nega
tive experiences in radicalizing
people, were tremendously positive
ones. We d iscovered that by work ing
collectively we do have the power to
affectour livesandthe livesofothers,
and that sometimes this power must
be expressed outside of the system.
By working together we also disco
vered what is so diff icu It to achieve at
this University, and increasingly
anywhere in this entire country, and
what is to me a value more important
than individual achievement or most
of the values forced upon us in this
society, and that is a sense of com
munity.
Strength of conviction
It is because radicals are willing to
value community and collective ac
tion that they often get stereotyped as
being power hungry and guilty of
"group think." Because they have
achieved a strength of conviction
that can only be arrived at by acting
on the world and not from mere
abstract intellectualizing, radicals
are often stereotyped as being
closed-minded and one-sided. This

Michael J. Jennings

is not to say that the tendencies pic
tured in these stereotypes are not real
dangers that must constantly be
guarded against by people working
for basic social change, but they are
not intrinsic tothe radical enterprise.
Finally, a word about where radi
cals draw their strength, sustenance,
and fire from. They draw it from
many sources, one of the most impor
tant being the healthy anger that
arises from an awarenessof their own
and others' oppression.
As for myself — my radical roots
are perhaps more "spiritual" than
those of some others: in part owing to
an early vocation to the priesthood, I
suppose I never quite got over in part
because — believe it or not — al
though my Catholicism was the first
victim of my radical meatgrinder, I
was actually radicalized through the
Catholic Church in my freshman year
at a Catholic high school (after all,
remember the Berrigan brothers!); fi
nally and most importantly because
everyday I am overwhelmed with an
awarenessof the incredible potential
for love and joy in the human spirit,
and yet every day I observe how that
potential is bottled up in myself, and
everywhere piteouslessly being
crushed.

Having failed to observe the liqui

would precipitate (Daily, Oct. 31, "A

once again condemned to roll my
Sisyphusian rock up the hill.
Already humbled by the lack of in
stant results I had deluded myself
into believing the mighty pen was
capable of, I found myself sinking
into ever greater depths of despair, as
I began to formulate for today's piece
a full scale radical analysis of just
why Stanford can be so harmful to
mind, heart and soul.
For I could envision ever more
clearly the inevitable results: the
small minority who already agreed
with me would feel the suffusion of a
warmer and more gratifying sense of
identification with each passing
word, while the rest — the majority I
would really be trying to reach —
would be dropping off like flies with
each new assault on their beloved
provider of wisdom, wealth and
power, having stereotyped me from
the word "go" as another one of those
rabid, raving radicals.

on the world and not from mere
abstract intellectualizing, radicals
are often stereotyped as being
closed-minded and one-sided. This

is not to say that the tendencies pic
tured in these stereotypes are not real
dangers that must constantly be
guarded against by people working
for basic social change, but they are
not intrinsic tothe radical enterprise.
Finally, a word about where radi
cals draw their strength, sustenance,
and fire from. They draw it from
many sources, one of the most impor
tant being the healthy anger that
arises from an awarenessof their own
and others' oppression.
As for myself — my radical roots
are perhaps more "spiritual" than
those of some others: in part owing to
an early vocation to the priesthood, I
suppose I never quite got over in part
because — believe it or not — al
though my Catholicism was the first
victim of my radical meatgrinder, I
was actually radicalized through the
Catholic Church in my freshman year
at a Catholic high school (after all,
remember the Berrigan brothers!); fi
nally and most importantly because
everyday I am overwhelmed with an
awarenessof the incredible potential
for love and joy in the human spirit,
and yet every day I observe how that
potential is bottled up in myself, and
everywhere piteouslessly being
crushed.
