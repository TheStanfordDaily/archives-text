# Ad hoc CIR
## Students differ with report 
###

An open letter to Stanford students
from the Student Members of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility
The ad hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) has made
its report public, but what must be
clarified are the deep disagreements
between the students and the major
ity of the committee. In its article of
Nov. 16, "CIR calls for maximum re
turn on stocks," the Daily blatantly
overlooks this.
The major student criticism was
not the failure of the majority of the
committee to include a provision for
the trustees to initiateor co-sponsor a
proxy issue as the Daily leads its
readership to believe, but the basic
principles that were accepted by the
majority of the committee.
Fiduciary duty
We set the fiduciary duty of the
trustees in managing the endowment
equal to their incurred duty as inves
tors — their duty to exercise control
over an asset in view of its social,
political and economic impact. The
majority of the committee could not
accept this. Instead, they recom
mended that the University first con
sider maximum economic return
when buying securities and only
when corporate policies are "ad
judged by the trustees to cause sub
stantial social injury" should it give
independent weight to social, politi
cal and economic impact.
For the University to act only on
such grievous cases as those that
cause substantial social injury is a
stilted perception of its shareholder
duties. Stanford, as a large economic
entity, employs thousands of people,
owns large amounts of property and
invests millions of dollars, and must
constantly monitor the impacts of its
investments, whether constituting a
case of social injury or not. The
majority of the committee felt that
this would take too much time and
would be too expensive; however,
wherever Stanford participates in the

economic sector, it must accept the
responsibilities as well as the be
nefits of its participation.
Dissatisfaction
Mostof our dissatisfaction with the
majority report derived from this
fundamental difference. We hope
students will take time to read the
whole report and perhaps some of the
minutes from committee meetings,
which are on reserve in UGLY and
Jackson Libraries, and talk with the
three of us to get a more complete
idea of what went on during commit
tee meetings.
For all three of us, working on this
committee has been a very educa
tional experience. Not only did we
learn a great deal about investment
responsibility — or better yet, how
undeveloped it is — but we also
gained a clearer view of the Univer
sity committee system and the Uni
versity power structure.
Students essential
First, we'd like to point out some
thing that is perhaps not as obvious
as it should be: as long as there are
university committees, it is essential
to have students on those commit
tees, students who are concerned and
willing to spend time on the issues
dealt with by their committees.
While we still have several key disag
reements with the recommendations
approved by the ad hoc CIR, it is fair
to say that were it not for our partici
pation and persistence, the invest
ment responsibility policy proposed
by the majority would not be nearly
so positive in either tone or content.
Second, we became aware that our
power does not lie within the system.
There is no provision in state law or
within the University codes requir
ing the trustees to follow community
sentiment in making their decisions.
Last spring
It is important to remember why
this ad hoc committee was even set
up. Last spring, 294 people were ar
rested.One of their demands was that
the University rewrite its investment

policy. Out of this outspoken dis
satisfaction came the trustees' charge
to the ad hoc CIR.
Richard Lyman has repeatedly told
the campus that the University is not
a democracy. He's right. It isn't. But
as long as that is true, there will be a
struggle for power — a struggle bet
ween the trustees and the administra
tion who hold the legal power, and
the community, which is entitled to
govern itself. When the community
cannot persuade the trustees to its
point of view through committees
and the appropriate university
policies, it must be willing to take
action outside of the system. It is
clear that any effect we had on this
committee was in direct proportion
to the degree of commitment within
the Stanford community to the issue.
One step
So how do we reconcile our first
point — i.e., the importance of hav
ing concerned students on commit
tees — with the understanding that,
ultimately, our power lies outside the
system? Working on this committee
has been one step in the struggle. We
did not pretend to attempt to end the
need for community action like the
sit-in last May.
Rather, we worked to clarify the
issue and ensure that at least some of
the battles fought last spring would
not have to be fought again. If the
trustees adopt any of our minority
recommendations — or even the
majority recommendations of the
committee, there is the possibility
that the system will be made a little
more responsible to the community.
If the community remains vigilant
and continues to assert its rights, the
struggle will continue on a higher
plane.

An open letter to Stanford students
from the Student Members of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility
The ad hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) has made
its report public, but what must be
clarified are the deep disagreements
between the students and the major
ity of the committee. In its article of
Nov. 16, "CIR calls for maximum re
turn on stocks," the Daily blatantly
overlooks this.
The major student criticism was
not the failure of the majority of the
committee to include a provision for
the trustees to initiateor co-sponsor a
proxy issue as the Daily leads its
readership to believe, but the basic
principles that were accepted by the
majority of the committee.
Fiduciary duty
We set the fiduciary duty of the
trustees in managing the endowment
equal to their incurred duty as inves
tors — their duty to exercise control
over an asset in view of its social,
political and economic impact. The
majority of the committee could not
accept this. Instead, they recom
mended that the University first con
sider maximum economic return
when buying securities and only
when corporate policies are "ad
judged by the trustees to cause sub
stantial social injury" should it give
independent weight to social, politi
cal and economic impact.
For the University to act only on
such grievous cases as those that
cause substantial social injury is a
stilted perception of its shareholder
duties. Stanford, as a large economic
entity, employs thousands of people,
owns large amounts of property and
invests millions of dollars, and must
constantly monitor the impacts of its
investments, whether constituting a
case of social injury or not. The
majority of the committee felt that
this would take too much time and
would be too expensive; however,
wherever Stanford participates in the

economic sector, it must accept the
responsibilities as well as the be
nefits of its participation.
Dissatisfaction
Mostof our dissatisfaction with the
majority report derived from this
fundamental difference. We hope
students will take time to read the
whole report and perhaps some of the
minutes from committee meetings,
which are on reserve in UGLY and
Jackson Libraries, and talk with the
three of us to get a more complete
idea of what went on during commit
tee meetings.
For all three of us, working on this
committee has been a very educa
tional experience. Not only did we
learn a great deal about investment
responsibility — or better yet, how
undeveloped it is — but we also
gained a clearer view of the Univer
sity committee system and the Uni
versity power structure.
Students essential
First, we'd like to point out some
thing that is perhaps not as obvious
as it should be: as long as there are
university committees, it is essential
to have students on those commit
tees, students who are concerned and
willing to spend time on the issues
dealt with by their committees.
While we still have several key disag
reements with the recommendations
approved by the ad hoc CIR, it is fair
to say that were it not for our partici
pation and persistence, the invest
ment responsibility policy proposed
by the majority would not be nearly
so positive in either tone or content.
Second, we became aware that our
power does not lie within the system.
There is no provision in state law or
within the University codes requir
ing the trustees to follow community
sentiment in making their decisions.
Last spring
It is important to remember why
this ad hoc committee was even set
up. Last spring, 294 people were ar
rested.One of their demands was that
the University rewrite its investment

policy. Out of this outspoken dis
satisfaction came the trustees' charge
to the ad hoc CIR.
Richard Lyman has repeatedly told
the campus that the University is not
a democracy. He's right. It isn't. But
as long as that is true, there will be a
struggle for power — a struggle bet
ween the trustees and the administra
tion who hold the legal power, and
the community, which is entitled to
govern itself. When the community
cannot persuade the trustees to its
point of view through committees
and the appropriate university
policies, it must be willing to take
action outside of the system. It is
clear that any effect we had on this
committee was in direct proportion
to the degree of commitment within
the Stanford community to the issue.
One step
So how do we reconcile our first
point — i.e., the importance of hav
ing concerned students on commit
tees — with the understanding that,
ultimately, our power lies outside the
system? Working on this committee
has been one step in the struggle. We
did not pretend to attempt to end the
need for community action like the
sit-in last May.
Rather, we worked to clarify the
issue and ensure that at least some of
the battles fought last spring would
not have to be fought again. If the
trustees adopt any of our minority
recommendations — or even the
majority recommendations of the
committee, there is the possibility
that the system will be made a little
more responsible to the community.
If the community remains vigilant
and continues to assert its rights, the
struggle will continue on a higher
plane.

An open letter to Stanford students
from the Student Members of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility
The ad hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR) has made
its report public, but what must be
clarified are the deep disagreements
between the students and the major
ity of the committee. In its article of
Nov. 16, "CIR calls for maximum re
turn on stocks," the Daily blatantly
overlooks this.
The major student criticism was
not the failure of the majority of the
committee to include a provision for
the trustees to initiateor co-sponsor a
proxy issue as the Daily leads its
readership to believe, but the basic
principles that were accepted by the
majority of the committee.
Fiduciary duty
We set the fiduciary duty of the
trustees in managing the endowment
equal to their incurred duty as inves
tors — their duty to exercise control
over an asset in view of its social,
political and economic impact. The
majority of the committee could not
accept this. Instead, they recom
mended that the University first con
sider maximum economic return
when buying securities and only
when corporate policies are "ad
judged by the trustees to cause sub
stantial social injury" should it give
independent weight to social, politi
cal and economic impact.
For the University to act only on
such grievous cases as those that
cause substantial social injury is a
stilted perception of its shareholder
duties. Stanford, as a large economic
entity, employs thousands of people,
owns large amounts of property and
invests millions of dollars, and must
constantly monitor the impacts of its
investments, whether constituting a
case of social injury or not. The
majority of the committee felt that
this would take too much time and
would be too expensive; however,
wherever Stanford participates in the

economic sector, it must accept the
responsibilities as well as the be
nefits of its participation.
Dissatisfaction
Mostof our dissatisfaction with the
majority report derived from this
fundamental difference. We hope
students will take time to read the
whole report and perhaps some of the
minutes from committee meetings,
which are on reserve in UGLY and
Jackson Libraries, and talk with the
three of us to get a more complete
idea of what went on during commit
tee meetings.
For all three of us, working on this
committee has been a very educa
tional experience. Not only did we
learn a great deal about investment
responsibility — or better yet, how
undeveloped it is — but we also
gained a clearer view of the Univer
sity committee system and the Uni
versity power structure.
Students essential
First, we'd like to point out some
thing that is perhaps not as obvious
as it should be: as long as there are
university committees, it is essential
to have students on those commit
tees, students who are concerned and
willing to spend time on the issues
dealt with by their committees.
While we still have several key disag
reements with the recommendations
approved by the ad hoc CIR, it is fair
to say that were it not for our partici
pation and persistence, the invest
ment responsibility policy proposed
by the majority would not be nearly
so positive in either tone or content.
Second, we became aware that our
power does not lie within the system.
There is no provision in state law or
within the University codes requir
ing the trustees to follow community
sentiment in making their decisions.
Last spring
It is important to remember why
this ad hoc committee was even set
up. Last spring, 294 people were ar
rested.One of their demands was that
the University rewrite its investment

policy. Out of this outspoken dis
satisfaction came the trustees' charge
to the ad hoc CIR.
Richard Lyman has repeatedly told
the campus that the University is not
a democracy. He's right. It isn't. But
as long as that is true, there will be a
struggle for power — a struggle bet
ween the trustees and the administra
tion who hold the legal power, and
the community, which is entitled to
govern itself. When the community
cannot persuade the trustees to its
point of view through committees
and the appropriate university
policies, it must be willing to take
action outside of the system. It is
clear that any effect we had on this
committee was in direct proportion
to the degree of commitment within
the Stanford community to the issue.
One step
So how do we reconcile our first
point — i.e., the importance of hav
ing concerned students on commit
tees — with the understanding that,
ultimately, our power lies outside the
system? Working on this committee
has been one step in the struggle. We
did not pretend to attempt to end the
need for community action like the
sit-in last May.
Rather, we worked to clarify the
issue and ensure that at least some of
the battles fought last spring would
not have to be fought again. If the
trustees adopt any of our minority
recommendations — or even the
majority recommendations of the
committee, there is the possibility
that the system will be made a little
more responsible to the community.
If the community remains vigilant
and continues to assert its rights, the
struggle will continue on a higher
plane.
