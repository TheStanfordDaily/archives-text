# Will sororities haunt Stanford?

"Most students are glad to find
they aren't pressured to conform to
any specific standards or lifestyles."
This quote from "Approaching
Stanford" describes an aspect of life
here which I was relieved to discover
upon arriving my freshman year. Al
though some students from the East
characterize this "easygoingness" as
superficial and lacking appropriate
intensity, for me it represents a qual
ity which distinguishes Stanford
from most other schoolsof its caliber.
When I'm asked why I like it here,
that's invariably part of the answer.
Fortunately, this atmosphere has
endured since freshman year, but the
imminent rescinding of the ban on
sororities in December shakes my
confidence in its survival. Please un
derstand that I'm not discriminating
and that I haven't taken sides — yet.
Initially, it's obvious that the cur
rent situation is unfair to women;
thus we must begin with the assump
tion that a change is necessary. Sec
ondly, though eastern prep schools
are often visualized as wall-to-wall
little boys wearing coats and ties, I
spent four years at one and feel the
experience was healthy and reward
ing for me. Some things can be
gained best or only by living with
peopleof the same sex, and the words
for them are fraternity and sorority:

brotherhood and sisterhood.
These are high ideals, but I ques
tion the logic of achieving them
through a system which has such po
tential to hurt people. Although
there's a va I id argument which states
that the benefits are worth any price, I
disagree — and am basically not en
thusiastic about fraternities either.
Specifically, it's the gross subjectiv
ity which gets me down: too often the
significance of being accepted or re
jected is blown out of proportion be
fore, during and after rush.
But from my point of view, it's the
interaction between sororities and
fraternities at other schools which in
flicts the most damage, because at
that point students with no direct
participation in the system are af
fected too. Closed parties, heavy
duty competition, fashion contests,
and a caste system complete with un
touchables (the rejected or unaf
filiatedones) are someof the wonder
ful extras included in the deal.
As I see it, Stanford is the best uni
versity in California, but I wonder

whether we're better enough to over
come these problems where USC,
Cal and UCLA have not. Stanford
students characterize the Creek sys
tem at USCas populatedbygirls with
pom pons for brains and boys with
flip-top lips; indeed the social life
there becomes almost absurd under
the influence of some of the "won
derful extras" I mentioned above.
Though these negative aspects are
tempered in our fraternity system, I
feel the situation would deteriorate if
sororities a la USCemerged. The lack
of a successful model elsewhere in
California is frightening, as are the
potential effects on life here. The
situation begs careful examination,
and alternatives need tobeexplored.
More than likely it will be the pro
sorority women's groups who deter
mine the fate of sororities on campus;
a "yes" trustee vote seems assured.
Thus, I feel the women must consider
whether a stereotypical sorority is
worth the price, whether they can as
sure a new, more constructive breed

of sorority, or whether some com
promise between the current situa
tion and sororities can be found.
The number of sororities and their
sizewill regulate their impact, as will
the continuedexistence and popular
ity of alternative housing on campus.
In any case, the relation of the soror
ity issue to the social atmosphere at
Stanford suggests that all students be
allowed a voice in the decision mak
ing.
A sorority system is owed to Stan
ford women if they want it. The ide
als they're fighting for are noble, yet
sororities involve ramifications
beyond equality and sisterhood. That
I have a fear is obvious, but as few
people around here have pom pons
forbrains I have faith in the preserva
tion of the lifestyle I respect at Stan
ford. Since we probably won't see the
real consequences of sororities until
much later, let's not create something
now which will grow to haunt Stan
ford after we've gone.
