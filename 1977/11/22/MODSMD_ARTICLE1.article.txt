# Suit filed for state monies

The University has filed suit against
State Controller Kenneth Cory and
Treasurer Jesse Unruh, claiming the
state owes it $448,000 in support for
increasing Medical School enroll
ment.
The University originally filed with
the California Supreme Court, but
the suit has since been transferred to
the Third District Court of Appeals in
Sacramento. Oral arguments were
heard on the case last week, said
John Schwartz, University counsel.
In 1973, the University signed a
written contract with the state which
said that by increasing its enroll
ment, the Medical School would re
ceive funds for each additional stu
dent enrolled, according to
Schwartz.
Cory told the Daily, "My position is
that the program which set up the
payments was ruled unconstitu
tional. Because of that ruling, I have
no choice but to refuse making pay
ments.
Article 9 of the California Constitu
tion states that "no public money
shall ever be appropriated for the
support" of any schools "not under
the exclusive control of the officers
of the public schools."
The stipulation in the constitution
was first questioned in 1975 when the
attorney general said the state could
not give money to Loma Linda Uni
versity because the school is run by
the Seventh-Day Adventist Church
and is not publicly controlled.
The University argues that con
tracts serving important public pur
poses are not "support" under the
terms of the California Constitution.
"We (Stanford) believe that the
funds were not given to us," said
Schwartz. "It was a contract with the
state. We had to do something to get
those funds; we had to increase our
enrollment.
"The state purchases services from
various companies," he added. "The
University is just like another com
pany, and the service we're provid
ing is education."
The Medical School enrolled 349
students in 1971, according to Carl
Hitchner, associate staff counsel for
the University. By the 1975-76 school
year, enrollment had jumped to 393.
The University claims the state ag
reed to pay up to $12,000 for each
student enrolled above a number
fixed by the school.
The state's contribution should
have been $10,200 per student,
Hitchner said.
The suit says the reimbursement
agreement was set up by the Califor
nia legislature to encourage univer
sities to increase enrollment in med
ical schools. The provisions were es
tablished because the state found
existing medical schools could pro
vide medical education at a cost sub
stantially lower than would be re
quired to build new medical
schools.
The University of Southern
California has filed suit against Cory
on the same grounds.
