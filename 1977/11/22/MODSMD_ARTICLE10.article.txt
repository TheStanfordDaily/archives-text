# Public ignorant of nuclear force

James Preston

Hearing Daniel Ellsberg's com
ments on nuclear weapons rein
forces my belief that the average
American is basically ignorant of the
command and control of our nuclear
force. To shed some lighton this sub
ject and dispel a few of Ellsberg's
false and misleading statements, I
will draw upon part of the unclas
sified data I obtained while serving in
the Air Force as a missile combat
crew commander in charge of 10 nuc
lear armed Minuteman 111 Inter-
Continental Ballistic Missiles (a posi
tion in which I served until my sep

aration from active duty on May 31).
1. Ellsberg stated that there is no
thing to prevent any military per
son from pushing "the button"
and starting World War 111. This is
completely false. It is impossible
for anyone to arm and launch a
nuclear weapon without the pres
idential nuclear strike order which
contains the "secure enable
code."
In oversimplified terms, this di
gital code is much like a combina
tion to a bank vault and must be
inserted into the weapon before it
will arm. For safety reasons, no
one ever has access to this code
until it is sent in the signal the pres
ident uses to authorize nuclear
strikes.
2. Ellsberg's contention that the
president has authorized military
commanders the power to employ
nuclear weapons at their own dis
cretion is totally false. No such au
thorization has or does exist.
Launching weapon
3. Ellsberg's contention that two
people can launch a weapon is to
tally false. Even after receipt of the
"secure enable code," it takes a
minimum of four men — in two
men crews — to go through a
complicated launch procedure
before the missiles are launched
(or the work of an entire crew of
an aircraft or Polaris submarine).
4. Ellsberg contends that there is no
way to recall bombers or stop a
war once it has started. To this I
can only say that just as the presi
dent has the power to order an
attack, he likewise has the power

and means to order a cessation of
hostilities.
5. Ellsberg contends that we have
our weapons targeted for a large
portion of the civilian populace of
the Soviet Union. Security forbids
me from commenting in any detail
on this sensitive area. However, I
can say that the prime objective of
our civilian and military leaders is
to limit as far as possible the col
lateral (i.e., civilian) casualties of
both sides in the event of war.
Military strength
6. Ellsberg's statements about our
military strength vis-a-vis the
Soviets in 1961 is totally mislead
ing. Far from having just the four
missiles he mentioned, they had
over 500 long-range bombers and
many more than four ICBMs.
7. Finally, Ellsberg's statement about
the possibility of an accidental
yield of a nuclear weapon is totally
false. For the sake of brevity, let it
just be said that the number of ac
cidents involving nuclear
weapons in the 1970s is minuscule
when compared to the early 19605,
and despite the worst accidents
involving aircraft crash and fire, no
device has ever come anywhere
near detonation.
In summation, I must say that to
the learned observer who has
worked with "nukes," Ellsberg's
comments on Nov. 11 demonstrate
that he knows as little about the
command and control of nuclear
weapons as he does about the rules
of secrecy and national security.

military strength vis-a-vis the
Soviets in 1961 is totally mislead
ing. Far from having just the four
missiles he mentioned, they had
over 500 long-range bombers and
many more than four ICBMs.
7. Finally, Ellsberg's statement about
the possibility of an accidental
yield of a nuclear weapon is totally
false. For the sake of brevity, let it
just be said that the number of ac
cidents involving nuclear
weapons in the 1970s is minuscule
when compared to the early 19605,
and despite the worst accidents
involving aircraft crash and fire, no
device has ever come anywhere
near detonation.
In summation, I must say that to
the learned observer who has
worked with "nukes," Ellsberg's
comments on Nov. 11 demonstrate
that he knows as little about the
command and control of nuclear
weapons as he does about the rules
of secrecy and national security.

Hearing Daniel Ellsberg's com
ments on nuclear weapons rein
forces my belief that the average
American is basically ignorant of the
command and control of our nuclear
force. To shed some lighton this sub
ject and dispel a few of Ellsberg's
false and misleading statements, I
will draw upon part of the unclas
sified data I obtained while serving in
the Air Force as a missile combat
crew commander in charge of 10 nuc
lear armed Minuteman 111 Inter-
Continental Ballistic Missiles (a posi
tion in which I served until my sep

aration from active duty on May 31).
1. Ellsberg stated that there is no
thing to prevent any military per
son from pushing "the button"
and starting World War 111. This is
completely false. It is impossible
for anyone to arm and launch a
nuclear weapon without the pres
idential nuclear strike order which
contains the "secure enable
code."
In oversimplified terms, this di
gital code is much like a combina
tion to a bank vault and must be
inserted into the weapon before it
will arm. For safety reasons, no
one ever has access to this code
until it is sent in the signal the pres
ident uses to authorize nuclear
strikes.
2. Ellsberg's contention that the
president has authorized military
commanders the power to employ
nuclear weapons at their own dis
cretion is totally false. No such au
thorization has or does exist.
Launching weapon
3. Ellsberg's contention that two
people can launch a weapon is to
tally false. Even after receipt of the
"secure enable code," it takes a
minimum of four men — in two
men crews — to go through a
complicated launch procedure
before the missiles are launched
(or the work of an entire crew of
an aircraft or Polaris submarine).
4. Ellsberg contends that there is no
way to recall bombers or stop a
war once it has started. To this I
can only say that just as the presi
dent has the power to order an
attack, he likewise has the power

and means to order a cessation of
hostilities.
5. Ellsberg contends that we have
our weapons targeted for a large
portion of the civilian populace of
the Soviet Union. Security forbids
me from commenting in any detail
on this sensitive area. However, I
can say that the prime objective of
our civilian and military leaders is
to limit as far as possible the col
lateral (i.e., civilian) casualties of
both sides in the event of war.
