# University policy on nondiscrimination on basis of handicap.
## 
### 
Following is a report from Associate Provost Wayne Price
on work under way at Stanford to provide increased program
accessibility for those who are disabled.
The issues involved in assuring equal opportunities for the
handicapped at Stanford University are important, interest
ing, and complicated. I have been asked by President Lyman
to coordinate the University's efforts to comply with Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing
regulations.
In essence, these regulations require that institutions
receiving federal financial assistance make their programs
accessible to handicapped students, that there be no discrimi
nation in admission, and that there be no discrimination in
hiring handicapped persons who are able to perform the
required job duties. (Copies of the implementing regulations
can be seen at the reserve desks in the Main Library and
Meyer Undergraduate Library, and at the Academic Informa
tion Center and the registrar's information window in the Old
Union.)
The regulations deal with a most important issue and are
broad in their scope, touching as they do on virtually all
phases of University life. In this report, I want to reaffirm
policy, note some recent activities and clarify aspects of the
student grievance procedure.
University Policy with Respect to Nondiscrimination
on the Basis of Handicap
Stanford University does not discriminate on the basis of
handicap against qualified handicapped persons by excluding
them from participation in, denying them the benefits of, or
otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any Uni
versity program or activity.
Recent Activities
During the past few months we have undertaken a
number of new steps to improve the accessibility of Stan
ford's programs for both disabled students and employees:
1) The office of the Dean of Student Affairs has publish
ed a brochure entitled "A Guide for the Disabled at Stan
ford." It was prepared by students and staff as members of
the Subcommittee on the Disabled Student and contains a
campus map showing ramps and entrances accessible to
wheelchairs, crossings without curbs, as well as imformation
of interest to the disabled on housing, transportation, physi
cal education, classroom accessibility, wheelchair repairs, and
available special equipment.
The brochure also lists the names and telephone numbers
of offices and people at Stanford who can provide informa
tion or assistance to disabled students and employees. Copies
of "A Guide for the Disabled" can be obtained from Harold
Boyd, associate dean of student affairs, ext. 7-3772.
2) The Facilities Planning Office has evaluated the acces
sibility of University buildings to the handicapped. This work

takes into account and is strengthened by a survey of grounds
and facilities conducted by the Subcommittee on the Dis
abled Student and the "Analysis of Facilities for the Handi
capped at Stanford University" prepared last year as a
SWOPSI report by Theresa Marie Rhyne, Charles Lockwood,
and Paisal Shusang. In the next few weeks I will be meeting
with interested persons to discuss the results of this work and
to plan the various structural changes which are necessary.
3) Admissions officers have been alerted to the changes
required in notices, applications, recruiting, and interviewing
to affirm Stanford's nondiscrimination policy in the admis
sion of handicapped students.
4) A policy statement on the employment of the handi
capped at Stanford was transmitted to all University officers
by the Vice-Presidents. Copies of the policy statement are
available from Rita Matkovich in the Personnel Department,
ext. 7-2744.
5) Personnel applications, advertisements, and manuals
are being updated to emphasize our policy of nondiscrimina
tion in hiring, salary, performance evaluation, promotion,
classification, and disciplinary decisions.
6) The Personnel Department on the main campus is
preparing a new self-identification program for current Uni
versity employees who believe themselves to be handicapped.
Employee identification will be voluntary and the informa
tion obtained will be kept confidential. It is hoped that this
self-identification program will assist the Personnel Depart
ment in ensuring that reasonable accommodations are made
to enable handicapped employees to perform their jobs
effectively.
I have also been reviewing with principal University
officers policies, programs, and general practices which may
relate to the handicapped. If any individual believes that a
particular current policy, program, or general practice is
unfair or inadvisable in terms of its effect on the handi
capped, it would assist our review if this were brought to my
attention. I can be reached at University ext. 7-2485. Cor
respondence may be sent to the Academic Planning Office,
Building 1, Room 2A.
On the whole, I am encouraged by the activities Stanford
has undertaken to make the campus more accessible and to
assure that equal opportunities are available to the handi
capped. We are, however, still very much in a process of
self-assessment and review. I anticipate the thoughtful in
volvement of many members of the community both in
identifying key issues and assisting in finding creative ways to
implement the basic policy of nondiscrimination on the basis
of handicap.
Grievance Procedures
One area that may assist in this overall process is the
clarification of what a student should do if he or she thinks

•r
there has been a direct violation of the policy itself. Regular
grievance procedures for faculty and staff should be followed
if a member of those groups thinks he or she has been
discriminated against on the basis of a physical or mental
handicap.
Insofar as student grievances are concerned, there is a
written procedure for dealing with student academic griev
ances. Any handicapped student who thinks there was a
violation of the policy described above in terms of an
academic decision affecting him or her should follow this
procedure.
"A student who has an academic grievance should go
first to the relevant department chairman. If the
grievance remains unresolved, the student's recourse is
the relevant school dean. A next recourse for graduate
students is the dean of graduate studies charged with
resolving grievances on issues pertaining to graduate
matters in the graduate and professional schools; an
undergraduate's parallel recourse is the dean of under
graduate studies. A student has the right to further
appeal to the vice-president and provost and ultimate
ly to the president."
Last year a procedure was established for responding to
student grievances involving possible sex discrimination in
nonacademic matters. We are establishing a very similar
process for dealing with student grievances asserting discrimi
nation on the basis of handicap in nonacademic matters:
A Procedure for Student Grievances Alleging Discrimina
tion on the Basis of Handicap in Areas Not Covered by
Procedures Governing Academic and Disciplinary Matters.
A student with a grievance should contact the person
in charge of thj activity where the action complained
of occurred. If satisfactory resolution of the matter is
not reached, the student should contact Wayne Price,
the University officer designated to coordinate Stan
ford's efforts to comply with Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The student will be asked
to make a written statement describing the action
complained of and efforts taken to remedy the situa
tion.
The subsequent procedures used in each case will
depend on such things as the gravity of the allegation
and the complexity of the matter. In many cases the
Dean of Student Affairs may be asked to participate in
efforts at resolution. Where appropriate, extant Uni
versity committees may become involved.
If satisfactory resolution cannot be reached, the
matter shall be referred to the cognizant vice-presi
dent, and if it remains unresolved at that level, to the
• president. If the officer involved wishes, he or she may
delegate the responsibility for the disposition of such
matters. In all instances, there must be persistent

M.
efforts from the outset to settle the matter in the least
formal and adversarial manner possible.
A distinction must be carefully observed between a
charge that a University policy has not been observed
or has been unfairly applied and a charge that a
University policy is, as a matter of general application,
unfair or inadvisable.
For the purpose of invoking the procedures de
scribed, the former constitutes a grievance, the latter
does not. Put another way, a grievance is an allegation
that an action has been taken against an individual, or
a right has been withheld from an individual, in
violation of a University policy of general application.
Such a charge constitutes a grievance and will be
treated under the procedures described above.
A charge that a policy is unfair or inadvisable in
and of itself is not governed by the grievance proce
dure. Such a charge, however, should also be brought
to the attention of Associate Provost Price because it
raises a legislative question which, if well-founded,
requires the invocation of internal University legisla
tive processes which cover most facets of University
life.
