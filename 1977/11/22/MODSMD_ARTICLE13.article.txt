# Door-to-door service aids auto-less folk
## 
### Todd Bauman 
For those without a car or
who don't like standing in line
at the supermarket, Sunrise
foods offers a grocery alterna
tive.
Sunrise Community Ser
vices, Inc. is a worker
managed nonprofit corpora
tion in Palo Alto providing
home delivered groceries at
supermarket prices — a boon
for cash-conscious students.
Unlike a consumer co
operative, Sunrise demands no
commitment of either time or
money from its clients. A per
son need only open an account
to join.
Customers order from a
catalog over the phone and the
groceries are delivered to their
door the next day, along with a
computerized statement
itemizing the cost of the food.
The total bill is automatically
deducted from the shopper's
account.
Shopping ease
Convenience is the greatest
advantage Sunrise offers. "I
like not having to get into my
car," commented an oldercus
tomer. "And then there's no
pushing and shoving with
people in a big store."
But a lack of variety has been
a major obstacle in attracting
consumers to the service. Sun
rise carries about 400 items,

compared to over 8000 in a
supermarket, and the organi
zation realizes it must offer
greater choice to compete with
the big retailers.
The planning involved in or
dering by phone also seems to
discourage customers. "Using
us does require some modifi
cation of one's consuming
habits," said Sunrise worker
Larry Litvak. "It takes some
forethought and a cut down on
impulse buying."
Survival
Sunrise was started a little
over a year ago, and since then
it has been busy simply in a
fight for survival. Losses last
winter were pushing $5000 a
month.
Coordinator )oshua Golds
tein said he borrowed $20,000
from friends to start up the bus
iness — $10,000 for equipment
and the rest for general ex
penses.
Because his is a nonprofit
business, hedoesn'tqualifyfor
federal small business loans
since the business is not
"working in the spirit of the
free market system," Golds
tein said.
Reality
The workers insist they have
learned a lot since the business
began, and through a system of
trial and error, have developed
a more efficient organization.

Fewer employes are now ac
complishing more and Sunrise
has just reached the point
where it is breaking even,
Goldstein said.
"We started out in a fantasy
world, borrowing money, and
it's a hard road to get back into
reality," Goldstein said.
"But looking at us as a small
business, the fact that it took us
a year to stop losing money is
really doing very well," he ad
ded.
Goldstein said that in the
grocery business everything
depends on volume and in
creasing its sales and the
number of accounts was Sun
rise's most immediate con
cern.
"We've come across with
this rational alternative for
consumers, but it's hard to get
people into the habit of order
ing here," he said.
Low wage
The goals for the corporation
in the near future are to stop
borrowing money to cover op
eration costs and to provide for
the minimum needs of the
workers. The present wage is
only about $2 an hour. Golds
tein would like to see it around
$3 to $4.
Despite the hardships, the
workers are dedicated to the
idea ot maintaining this type of
nonprofit community service
corporation. Litvak explained
that a grocery delivery service
is needed by senior citizens,
low-income persons without
transport and working parents.
"The needs of those three
groups are not recognized in
the normal economic market,"
Litvak said. "Some of the fi
nancial difficulties we had in
the past came from trying to
meet those needs which have
no profit incentive."
Energy efficient
"We provide a very neces
sary service for a certain seg
ment of the population,"

commented one worker. She
also emphasized the efficiency
of Sunrise in terms of energy,
marketing and real estate
costs.
Sunrise uses three trucks to
take groceries to customers
rather than having numerous
cars driving in. Because the
business is run out of a
warehouse, there is low over
head.
Sunrise is a workers co
operative with all employes
having an equal voice in for
mulating corporate policy. All
the workers cite this as a very
important reason for working
for Sunrise.
. "As opposed to a hierarchi
cal management organization,
this is a place where people can
actively participate in the day
to day decisions in the work
place, and that does make the
job more satisfying," Litvak
said.
"I think this is just one more
aspect of people taking control
over their own lives," he ad
ded.
"We could all sell out to the
capitalist system and get a bet
ter wage, I know I could," re
marked Goldstein. "But it's
important that the people who
work here have a say over the
work place."
Litvak explained that there
are difficulties in a worker con
trolled operation, especially in
trying to establish a proper mix
between the sharing of deci
sion making and co-ordinating
everyone's activities. He em
phasized that there were not
many good models of what
they are doing, and that they
had to learn the co-op business
on their own.
"We have a ways to go, but I
think we can do it,"he said.
Perhaps the spirit of the Sun
rise workers is best captured
by the Huey Newton quotation
on the office wall, "One step at
a time."


The warehouse isn't beautiful, but saves on the overhead costs
that other markets pass on to their customers.

winter were pushing $5000 a

Coordinator )oshua Golds
tein said he borrowed $20,000
from friends to start up the bus
iness — $10,000 for equipment
and the rest for general ex
penses.
Because his is a nonprofit
business, hedoesn'tqualifyfor
federal small business loans
since the business is not
"working in the spirit of the

Reality
The workers insist they have
learned a lot since the business
began, and through a system of
trial and error, have developed
a more efficient organization.

Fewer employes are now ac
complishing more and Sunrise
has just reached the point
where it is breaking even,
Goldstein said.
"We started out in a fantasy
world, borrowing money, and
it's a hard road to get back into
reality," Goldstein said.
"But looking at us as a small
business, the fact that it took us
a year to stop losing money is
really doing very well," he ad
ded.
Goldstein said that in the
grocery business everything
depends on volume and in
creasing its sales and the
number of accounts was Sun
rise's most immediate con
cern.
"We've come across with
this rational alternative for
consumers, but it's hard to get
people into the habit of order
ing here," he said.
Low wage
The goals for the corporation
in the near future are to stop
borrowing money to cover op
eration costs and to provide for
the minimum needs of the
workers. The present wage is
only about $2 an hour. Golds
tein would like to see it around
$3 to $4.
Despite the hardships, the
workers are dedicated to the
idea ot maintaining this type of
nonprofit community service
corporation. Litvak explained
that a grocery delivery service
is needed by senior citizens,
low-income persons without
transport and working parents.
"The needs of those three
groups are not recognized in
the normal economic market,"
Litvak said. "Some of the fi
nancial difficulties we had in
the past came from trying to
meet those needs which have
no profit incentive."
Energy efficient
"We provide a very neces
sary service for a certain seg
ment of the population,"

commented one worker. She
also emphasized the efficiency
of Sunrise in terms of energy,
marketing and real estate
costs.
Sunrise uses three trucks to
take groceries to customers
rather than having numerous
cars driving in. Because the
business is run out of a
warehouse, there is low over
head.
Sunrise is a workers co
operative with all employes
having an equal voice in for
mulating corporate policy. All
the workers cite this as a very
important reason for working
for Sunrise.
. "As opposed to a hierarchi
cal management organization,
this is a place where people can
actively participate in the day
to day decisions in the work
place, and that does make the
job more satisfying," Litvak
said.
"I think this is just one more
aspect of people taking control
over their own lives," he ad
ded.
"We could all sell out to the
capitalist system and get a bet
ter wage, I know I could," re
marked Goldstein. "But it's
important that the people who
work here have a say over the
work place."
Litvak explained that there
are difficulties in a worker con
trolled operation, especially in
trying to establish a proper mix
between the sharing of deci
sion making and co-ordinating
everyone's activities. He em
phasized that there were not
many good models of what
they are doing, and that they
had to learn the co-op business
on their own.
"We have a ways to go, but I
think we can do it,"he said.
Perhaps the spirit of the Sun
rise workers is best captured
by the Huey Newton quotation
on the office wall, "One step at
a time."


The warehouse isn't beautiful, but saves on the overhead costs
that other markets pass on to their customers.

The spiffy Sunrise Foods delivery vans make "shopping" much easier for persons without cars, by
bringing food to their doors. The year-old company is only now breaking even financially.
For those without a car or
who don't like standing in line
at the supermarket, Sunrise
foods offers a grocery alterna
tive.
Sunrise Community Ser
vices, Inc. is a worker
managed nonprofit corpora
tion in Palo Alto providing
home delivered groceries at
supermarket prices — a boon
for cash-conscious students.
Unlike a consumer co
operative, Sunrise demands no
commitment of either time or
money from its clients. A per
son need only open an account
to join.
Customers order from a
catalog over the phone and the
groceries are delivered to their
door the next day, along with a
computerized statement
itemizing the cost of the food.
The total bill is automatically
deducted from the shopper's
account.
Shopping ease
Convenience is the greatest
advantage Sunrise offers. "I
like not having to get into my
car," commented an oldercus
tomer. "And then there's no
pushing and shoving with
people in a big store."
But a lack of variety has been
a major obstacle in attracting
consumers to the service. Sun
rise carries about 400 items,

compared to over 8000 in a
supermarket, and the organi
zation realizes it must offer
greater choice to compete with
the big retailers.
The planning involved in or
dering by phone also seems to
discourage customers. "Using
us does require some modifi
cation of one's consuming
habits," said Sunrise worker
Larry Litvak. "It takes some
forethought and a cut down on
impulse buying."

Sunrise was started a little
over a year ago, and since then
it has been busy simply in a
fight for survival. Losses last

$3 to $4.
Despite the hardships, the
workers are dedicated to the
idea ot maintaining this type of
nonprofit community service
corporation. Litvak explained
that a grocery delivery service
is needed by senior citizens,
low-income persons without
transport and working parents.
"The needs of those three
groups are not recognized in
the normal economic market,"
Litvak said. "Some of the fi
nancial difficulties we had in
the past came from trying to
meet those needs which have
no profit incentive."
Energy efficient
"We provide a very neces
sary service for a certain seg
ment of the population,"

commented one worker. She
also emphasized the efficiency
of Sunrise in terms of energy,
marketing and real estate
costs.
Sunrise uses three trucks to
take groceries to customers
rather than having numerous
cars driving in. Because the
business is run out of a
warehouse, there is low over
head.
Sunrise is a workers co
operative with all employes
having an equal voice in for
mulating corporate policy. All
the workers cite this as a very
important reason for working
for Sunrise.
. "As opposed to a hierarchi
cal management organization,
this is a place where people can
actively participate in the day
to day decisions in the work
place, and that does make the
job more satisfying," Litvak
said.
"I think this is just one more
aspect of people taking control
over their own lives," he ad
ded.
"We could all sell out to the
capitalist system and get a bet
ter wage, I know I could," re
marked Goldstein. "But it's
important that the people who
work here have a say over the
work place."
Litvak explained that there
are difficulties in a worker con
trolled operation, especially in
trying to establish a proper mix
between the sharing of deci
sion making and co-ordinating
everyone's activities. He em
phasized that there were not
many good models of what
they are doing, and that they
had to learn the co-op business
on their own.
"We have a ways to go, but I
think we can do it,"he said.
Perhaps the spirit of the Sun
rise workers is best captured
by the Huey Newton quotation
on the office wall, "One step at
a time."


The warehouse isn't beautiful, but saves on the overhead costs
that other markets pass on to their customers.

The spiffy Sunrise Foods delivery vans make "shopping" much easier for persons without cars, by
bringing food to their doors. The year-old company is only now breaking even financially.
For those without a car or
who don't like standing in line
at the supermarket, Sunrise
foods offers a grocery alterna
tive.
Sunrise Community Ser
vices, Inc. is a worker
managed nonprofit corpora
tion in Palo Alto providing
home delivered groceries at
supermarket prices — a boon
for cash-conscious students.
Unlike a consumer co
operative, Sunrise demands no
commitment of either time or
money from its clients. A per
son need only open an account
to join.
Customers order from a
catalog over the phone and the
groceries are delivered to their
door the next day, along with a
computerized statement
itemizing the cost of the food.
The total bill is automatically
deducted from the shopper's
account.
Shopping ease
Convenience is the greatest
advantage Sunrise offers. "I
like not having to get into my
car," commented an oldercus
tomer. "And then there's no
pushing and shoving with
people in a big store."
But a lack of variety has been
a major obstacle in attracting
consumers to the service. Sun
rise carries about 400 items,

compared to over 8000 in a
supermarket, and the organi
zation realizes it must offer
greater choice to compete with
the big retailers.
The planning involved in or
dering by phone also seems to
discourage customers. "Using
us does require some modifi
cation of one's consuming
habits," said Sunrise worker
Larry Litvak. "It takes some
forethought and a cut down on
impulse buying."
Survival
Sunrise was started a little
over a year ago, and since then
it has been busy simply in a
fight for survival. Losses last
winter were pushing $5000 a
month.
Coordinator )oshua Golds
tein said he borrowed $20,000
from friends to start up the bus
iness — $10,000 for equipment
and the rest for general ex
penses.
Because his is a nonprofit
business, hedoesn'tqualifyfor
federal small business loans
since the business is not
"working in the spirit of the
free market system," Golds
tein said.
Reality
The workers insist they have
learned a lot since the business
began, and through a system of
trial and error, have developed
a more efficient organization.

Fewer employes are now ac
complishing more and Sunrise
has just reached the point
where it is breaking even,
Goldstein said.
"We started out in a fantasy
world, borrowing money, and
it's a hard road to get back into
reality," Goldstein said.
"But looking at us as a small
business, the fact that it took us
a year to stop losing money is
really doing very well," he ad
ded.
Goldstein said that in the
grocery business everything
depends on volume and in
creasing its sales and the
number of accounts was Sun
rise's most immediate con
cern.
"We've come across with
this rational alternative for
consumers, but it's hard to get
people into the habit of order
ing here," he said.
Low wage
The goals for the corporation
in the near future are to stop
borrowing money to cover op
eration costs and to provide for
the minimum needs of the
workers. The present wage is
only about $2 an hour. Golds
tein would like to see it around
$3 to $4.
