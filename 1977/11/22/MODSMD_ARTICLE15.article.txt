# Prevents pneumonia
## FDA approves vaccine 
### Associated Press 
Washington — The Food and
Drug Administration yesterday
approved a vaccine that scien
tists say can prevent most cases
of pneumococcal pneumonia,
which kills thousands of Ameri
cans each year.
The vaccine, called
Pneumovax, will be available
Feb. 1.
The FDA authorized the man
ufacturer, Merck Sharp &
Dohme, to recommend the vac
cine for all persons 50 years or

older; anyone with a chronic ill
ness; anyone living in a nursing
homeorother chronic care facil
ity where pneumonia could
spread easily, and anyone con
valescing from serious illness.
Despite the use of penicillin
and other antibiotics,
pneumonia is the nation's fifth
leading cause of death, killing at
least 25,000 Americans annu
ally. Some scientists say the
death toll may run as high as
66,000.
The FDA said pneumococcal

pneumonia, a bacterial infection
that strikes the lungs, causes a
major portion of these deaths.
The estimates of the total
number of cases of pneumococ
cal pneumonia annually among
Americans range from 200,000
to one million.
There are 83 known strains of
the pneumococcus organism,
but the 14 that Pneumovax pro
tects against are responsible for
80 percent of all pneumococcal
pneumonia.
The vaccine is not effective
against viral pneumonia, which
drugs cannot prevent or cure.
But scientists say most viral
pneumonia cases do hot become
as severe as pneumococcal
pneumonia.
The FDA said the vaccine may
be particularly useful for the na
tion's 50,000 sickle cell anemia
patients, who run a high risk of
severe pneumonia infections.
The blood cell disease strikes
two in every 500 black infants,
and an estimated two percent of
these victims die from
pneumonia before age 10.
