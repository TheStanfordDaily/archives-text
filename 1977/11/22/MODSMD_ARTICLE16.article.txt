# 'Equus' unevenly brilliant
## 
### 
As a play, "Equus" is a bril
liant piece of stylized theater:
John Dexter's production fea
tures a spare, one-set stage and
actors (wearing metallic heads
and hooves) as horses.
Through this imaginative con
trivance and the power of Peter
Shaffer's words, "Equus" be
came a huge success in both
London and New York (run
ning for three years on Broad
way).
It is the story of Alan Strang,
a boy who has blinded six
horses, and of Dr. Martin
Dysart, the psychiatrist who
treats him. There are essen
tially two main focuses: the
gradual discovery of the
reasons for the boy's act, and
Dysart's self-examination and
questioning of his role as a
"healer."
Alan Strang worships horses
as Cod. His devoutly religious
mother and atheist father
created an environment of be
lief vs. repression of belief that
deeply affected the young boy.
When his father replaces a pic
ture of Jesus in Alan's room
with that of a horse, Alan
transfers his dogmatic Christ
ian belief in Jesus to a worship
of Equus, a horse-god.
Dysart has lived a "normal"
life and is tormented by it; for
Dysart, the normal is the "av
erage made lethal." He envies
the boy's passion, passion he
has never felt. He can take
away the boy's pain (the pain
that caused him to blind the
horses), but in doing so he
takes away the boy's passion.
Dysart is constantly question
ing the nature of his profession
and its relationship to the prob
lems of pain and passion.
The conflicts of psychiatrist
vs. patient and psychiatrist vs.
himself reach their climax in
the powerful closing scene,
where Strang re-enacts his
crime of passion.

The movie version of
"Equus" has eliminated the
stylized action of the play. Sur
prisingly, this literalization
does not lessen the force the
play had, except for three
specific (and important)
scenes. What results is a wildly
uneven, oftentimes brilliant
transcription of a difficult sub
ject.
The film opens with a long
fluid shot, starting with the
naked Strang (Peter Firth) in a
field with his horse-god. It
moves to a shaded close-up of
Dysart's (Richard Burton) face.
The camera gradually draws
away from Burton's face as he
speaks the first ot his eight sol
iloquies (all spoken directly to
the camera). This shot is re
peated at the beginning of the
second half of the film.
This kind of take is unusual
for the director, Sidney Lumet.
His films ("Network," "Dog
Day Afternoon," "Murder on
the Orient Express," "Long
Day's Journey into Night") typ
ically feature little or no camera
movement, but with the aid of
cinematographer Oswald Mor
ris ("Lolita," "Fiddler on the
Roof"), Lumet has successfully
used extensive camera move
ment in "Equus."
Sidney Lumet, unlike Herb
Ross, is a "hot" director with
talent. His last four films have
each grossed $30 million or
more. Lumet has often been
criticized for working too fast
(indeed, he completed
"Equus" in 37 days, a very
quick shooting schedule), but
it seems to work for him. In
fact, this speed in filming may
help his films; they seem to
have an inherent tenseness
that always gives his films great
amounts of energy. In each
succeeding film, Lumet seems
to be combining this energy
with more and more skill.
This film is technically di
rected very well throughout,

and one sequence — the re
ligious ritual of the boy and
horse gallop which climaxes
the first half of the film — is
probably the best sequence
Lumet has done as a director.
Unfortunately, this combi
nation of spectacular
technique and thoughtful
planning does not characterize
the film as a whole. In three
scenes in particular, screenwri
ter Shaffer's desire to literalize
his own stage play runs to ex
cess.
Near the middle of the
movie, Burton talks with
Hesther (Eileen Atkins), the
magistrate who referred the
Strang case to him. The scene
is a key one because Burton
begins to refer to his wife and
to his "normal" life; we delve
deeper into his psyche. But the
scene is shot outdoors, where
Hesther is raking leaves. It
trivializes the whole scene.
Finally, the blinding of the
horses is graphically por
trayed. We see the naked
Strang take a scythe and physi
cally blind the horses. On
stage, this action was of course
pantomimed, and not seeing
the actual blinding was far
more forceful than having to
watch it, as we do here. Lumet
and Shaffer should have left
the blinding to the viewer's im
agination.
But Richard Burton's vir
tuoso performance almost
makes up for these serious de
ficiencies. Burton perfectly
captures Dysart's ravaged tor
ment and sense of inadequacy.
In his soliloquies, Burton gives
full range to his power of in
terpretation and to the sheer
strength of his voice. His acting
is near perfection; it is cer
tainly the best performance of
this year.
Burton's power tends to
overwhelm most actors, but
Lumet, who has always worked

well with actors, does a fine
balancing job. Peter Firth
comes off rather well as the
troubled Strang, as does Colin
Blakely as his father. Only Joan
Plowright, as Mrs. Strang, rings
false; she seems too elegant
for the role.
One of the most commonly
asked questions about this
moviewill probably be: "Is it as
good as the play?" No. Because
of some major lapses in
thought, over-literalization has
vitiated the effect of some key
scenes in the film. It doesn't
destroy the movie, but it
weakens it, and that's sad, be
cause there are many things in
this movie that are well hand
led. But even as an uneven
movie, "Equus" is worth se
eing.
