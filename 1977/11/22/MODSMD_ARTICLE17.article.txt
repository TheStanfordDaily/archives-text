# The 						Turning Point forgettable
## 
### 
"The Turning Point" is one
of those films that is difficult to
review; you just sit down,
watch the movie and walk out
after not having felt much of
anything except a vague disap
pointment.
Essentially, "The Turning
Point" is a series of ballet per
formances that pretends to be
a movie. Shirley Maclaine and
Anne Bancroft pretend to be
characters, but they seem to be
around to supply faces to the
"plot" that serves as a filler be
tween performances (they also
serve to create the illusion that
this is an important "women's
picture").
Supposedly, this is a movie
about choices, the "turning
points" in life. Deedee (Shirley
Maclaine) is a former ballerina
who chose marriage and a life
in Oklahoma City over a ballet
career. Emma (Anne Bancroft)
continued her career and is
now an aging, fading ballet
star, for some reason, they

envy each other.
Deedee's daughter, Emilia
(Leslie Browne), is a budding
and talented dancer. Emma
takes her under her wing, and
gets her a position with her
world-famous ballet company.
Emilia falls in love with star
dancer Yuri (Mikhail
Baryshnikov). The choices
Emilia may face remind
Deedee and Emma of the
choice they had to make years
before. "Career vs. love" or
something like that.
In concept, all this is tine; it
is the execution of it that goes
nowhere. You never begin to
care about the characters or
feel the emotion you think they
would feel from having to
make lite-determining deci
sions.
Anytime the plot begins to
develop, the film shifts to
scenes of either preparation
for or performance of ballet. In
and of itself, this isn't bad (I can
think of worse things to watch

or listen to than Baryshnikov
dancing to the music of
Tchaikovsky), but it really
doesn't do anything for the
movie.
The director, Herbert Ross,
is known as a "hot" director.
This means he is commercially
successful ("Funny Lady,"
"The Sunshine Boys," "The
Seven-Per-Cent Solution"); it
certainly has nothing to do
with his artistry. His films are
"stylish," tasteful and sate en
tertainments.
In this film, the ballet sequ
ences (they take up about half
the movie) are stylish, tasteful
and relatively entertaining (as
well as beautifully photo
graphed by veteran
cinematographer Robert Sur
teees), but the non-ballet
scenes offer none of these
qualities.
Ross seemingly has indulged
himself with this movie; he is a
former choreographer

("Funny Girl") whose roots are
in ballet. A self-indulgent di
rector with average talent gets
very tiresome, but Ross has co
vered his liases by making two
films this year. The other film is
called "The Goodbye Girl," a
comedy written by Neil Simon.
Perhaps that film will have
none of the pretension that
Ross has stuffed into "The
Turning Point."
As for the acting, Anne Ban
croft manages to show some of
her talent by making some
thing out of nothing; but Shir
ley Maclaine is undone by hav
ing no lines. It is an unfortu
nate return to cinema for this
multi-talented lady. As the
young waif, Emilia, Leslie
Browne is almost convincing,
and Mikhail Baryshnikov
dances, basically.
"The Turning Point" is un
remarkable, inoffensive and,
on the whole, forgettable.
