# Directing with an ear for music

"I don't see why people have fits about
things like this. Translating a play should
be the director's natural impulse. The di
rector should go to the original text and
find for himself what it says. That's what I
did with the Chekov. That's the only way to
handle the classics. If you want Schiller,
you go to the German."
Translator-director Judith Dresch has a
straightforward if demanding approach to
the theater, reflected in her "Uncle
Vanya," at the Manhattan Playhouse.
"For 'Vanya,' I took a translation I had
done some years ago. . . . I read the origi
nal Russian many times, used many dic
tionaries . . . The English language is so
rich, especially with colloquialisms. The
Russian is difficult becauseof puns. . .but
I finally captured the mood, the rhythm of
the play.
"It's very moving when you begin to un
derstand what Chekov tried, when you
match your words to his. I don't claim my
translation is the best, but it is the closest
of all I have read."

Dresch repeatedly modified her original
translation, some of the most important
changes coming during rehearsals. "The
cast would make grammatical changes,
not to the quality of the play but to make
the sound more harmonious. I always kept
the Russian beside me, though, to make
sure I never impeded the intended."
Creating that "harmonious sound" is
vital to Chekov because "the classic play is
a musical score with different pitches, a
variety of voices. Vou must use psycholog
ical means or pure technique to make it go
up where it goes up and to know when it
should go down. People without an ear for
music are absolute duds onstage."
For Vanya's crucial kissing scene,
Dresch was faced with a hundred ap
proaches to a confusing problem. "In this
episode, Vanya finds Dr. Astrov kissing
Yelena, whom Vanya loves deeply. We
didn't know how Astrov should react to
being discovered, whether he should stut
ter or be shy or what. I decided he should
be completely nonchalant. You see, you

must pay attention to what has happened
before the scene, to make sure it fits. Also,
you must avoid making the action stilted
or camouflaged with theatricality. The ac
tors cannot be actors. The kissing scene
worked simply and flowed well so it was
successful."
Dresch said most of her "Vanya" exper
iments have paid off. "We accomplished
something very important. Considering
we should have had half a year to work on
this play and that we are mostly amateurs,
we were able to capture that music, that
atmosphere which is the play."
"Vanya" has worked out, "capturing
the atmosphere which is so important to
Chekov, the pathos and pathetic, comic
elements which the characters must have.
You must always care, Dresch insists.
"The littlest cough or the biggest speech
cannot be lost." No shortcuts, no hedg
ing. That's Judith Dresch — and that's what
she's tried to make her "Uncle Vanya."

"I don't see why people have fits about
things like this. Translating a play should
be the director's natural impulse. The di
rector should go to the original text and
find for himself what it says. That's what I
did with the Chekov. That's the only way to
handle the classics. If you want Schiller,
you go to the German."
Translator-director Judith Dresch has a
straightforward if demanding approach to
the theater, reflected in her "Uncle
Vanya," at the Manhattan Playhouse.
"For 'Vanya,' I took a translation I had
done some years ago. . . . I read the origi
nal Russian many times, used many dic
tionaries . . . The English language is so
rich, especially with colloquialisms. The
Russian is difficult becauseof puns. . .but
I finally captured the mood, the rhythm of
the play.
"It's very moving when you begin to un
derstand what Chekov tried, when you
match your words to his. I don't claim my
translation is the best, but it is the closest
of all I have read."

Dresch repeatedly modified her original
translation, some of the most important
changes coming during rehearsals. "The
cast would make grammatical changes,
not to the quality of the play but to make
the sound more harmonious. I always kept
the Russian beside me, though, to make
sure I never impeded the intended."
Creating that "harmonious sound" is
vital to Chekov because "the classic play is
a musical score with different pitches, a
variety of voices. Vou must use psycholog
ical means or pure technique to make it go
up where it goes up and to know when it
should go down. People without an ear for
music are absolute duds onstage."
For Vanya's crucial kissing scene,
Dresch was faced with a hundred ap
proaches to a confusing problem. "In this
episode, Vanya finds Dr. Astrov kissing
Yelena, whom Vanya loves deeply. We
didn't know how Astrov should react to
being discovered, whether he should stut
ter or be shy or what. I decided he should
be completely nonchalant. You see, you

must pay attention to what has happened
before the scene, to make sure it fits. Also,
you must avoid making the action stilted
or camouflaged with theatricality. The ac
tors cannot be actors. The kissing scene
worked simply and flowed well so it was
successful."
Dresch said most of her "Vanya" exper
iments have paid off. "We accomplished
something very important. Considering
we should have had half a year to work on
this play and that we are mostly amateurs,
we were able to capture that music, that
atmosphere which is the play."
"Vanya" has worked out, "capturing
the atmosphere which is so important to
Chekov, the pathos and pathetic, comic
elements which the characters must have.
You must always care, Dresch insists.
"The littlest cough or the biggest speech
cannot be lost." No shortcuts, no hedg
ing. That's Judith Dresch — and that's what
she's tried to make her "Uncle Vanya."
