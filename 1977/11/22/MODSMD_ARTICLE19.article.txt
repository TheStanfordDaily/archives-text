Storm brings rain to northern Cal.
An old-fashioned winter storm front barrelled
into California yesterday, bringing heavy snow,
significant rain and thrashing winds across the
northern half of the state.
"This is certainly a better storm than what we've
had in a long time," said forecaster Phil Swain of
the National Weather Service. "It's more like the
winter storms we used to have before the
drought."
But the best part of the storm — which dumped
over a foot of snow and five inches of rain in some
areas — was that it appeared to be only the begin
ning of a wet week.
"The important thing about this is the duration
rather than just the heavy rain —we've had heavy
rain before," Swain noted. "It looks like this storm
is going to continue over a long enough period of
time that it will be helpful."
Meanwhile, bitter cold pierced the Northwest
and Northern Plains as residents dug out from
under a record-breaking autumn snowstorm yes
terday — even the highest temperatures were
below zero in some places.
Bozeman, Mont., reported a mid-day high of six
degrees below zero.
At least two deaths were attributed to the storm
in North Dakota.
Residents of North Dakota, Montana, Min
nesota, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming spent yester
day digging out from up to 18 inches of snow and
fighting off the freeze.
Vance gets human rights appeal
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Street demonstrators
called for help from U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance yesterday as he began talks with Argentine
officials on the status of thousands of jailed or
missing persons.
About 100 women, relatives of missing persons,
stood together in a crowd surrounding the tree
lined Plaza San Martin in downtown Buenos Aires
where Vance placed a wreath at the statue of the

hero of Argentine independence.
The women waved white handkerchiefs and
shouted in Spanish, "Vance, Vance, Ayudenos,
ayudenos," — help us, help us — urging the sec
retary to aid them in their efforts to locate family
members.
Vance smiled and waved to the women, who are
know as "the crazy women of Plaza de Mayo"
because they gather regularly at the plaza outside
the presidential palace to exchange scraps of news
about their relatives either missing or imprisoned
by security forces.
Vance is on a four-day trip to South America
which also will take him to Brazil and Venezuela.
He raised the human rights issue during meet
ings with Argentine President )orge Videla and top
military and Foreign Ministry officials.
FBI releases secret records
Washington — The FBI once considered instal
ling its own man as imperial wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan, and the agency wrote and published a fake
"student" newspaper in waging a campaign to dis
credit antiwar leaders, according to documents
released yesterday.
The FBI plans were revealed in painstaking detail
when the agency released its voluminous coun
terintelligence file showing the use of thefts and
dirty tricks to harass political groups.
The so-called COINTELPRO files, 53,000 pages
filling three government-green cabinets, showed
the questionable tactics employed by the FBI to
discredit student activists and organized political
groups.
Much of the material previously was made pub
lic, but the complete files at the J. Edgar
Hoover Building showed the scope of questiona
ble counterintelligence tactics, many used against
persons and groups never accused of criminal ac
tivities.
Vacationers killed in jet crash
Bariloche, Argentina — A chartered Argentine

jetiiner carrying honeymooning couples and other
vacationers to this lake and ski resort crashed dur
ing foul weather early yesterday. Austral Airline
officials said there were some survivors among the
79 persons aboard.
The national Noticias Argentinas and Telam
news agencies reported there were at least 40 sur
vivors among the 74 passengers and five crew
members. Rescue teams reached the crash scene
about 20 miles from here.
Absent congressman blocks bill
Washington — A globe-trotting congressman is
delaying final action on major Social Security legis
lation, a bill that both President Carter and Capitol
Hill leaders want passed this year.
Responsible for the delay is Rep. William
Ketchum (R-Calif.), who has blocked until at least
Nov. 29 conference committee sessions to work
out compromises between the different Social
Security bills passed by the House and Senate.
Ketchum, now on a taxpayer-financed, 17-day
trip to eight African and Middle Eastern nations,
was unavailable for comment.
Government debt over 700 billion
Washington — The government's debt surpas
sed $700 billion for the first time yesterday in the
Treasury Department's daily financial statement.
The Treasury said the government owed $700.12
billion at the most recent tally last Thursday. The
government passed the $600 billion debt total only
last year.
The main reason for the increase was a $66 bill
ion deficit for fiscal 1976.
