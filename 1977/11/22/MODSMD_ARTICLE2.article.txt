# Prof here is boosting national anti-shah group

Providing information to the
American people and supporting
Iranian resistance to their shah are
among the goals of the newly formed
U.S. People's Committee on Iran
(USPCI).
"There are more than 40,000
American military advisers, techni
cians, and their families now in Iran.
That's 10 times what was in Vietnam
during the Kennedy administration,"
said Pierre Noyes, SLAC professor
and a member of the USPCI's eight
member policy board.
The function of the committee was
announced last week, on the eve of
the shah of Iran's visit to the United
States, but it actually evolved two
months ago out of a support commit
tee designed to send a team of ob
servers to Iran.
Noyes said the USPCI was formed
to foster several goals: to provide in
formation of the nature, scope, and
implications of American involve
ment in Iran; make the American
people aware of the Iranian aspira
tions for a democratic society; sup
port Iranian resistance to repression;
bring international public pressure
on Iran by maintaining a permanent
international team of medical and
legal observers; and end American

intervention in Iran.
Noyes became involved in the
Iranian issue when some of his as
sociates asked him to go to Iran to
observe the first open trial there
since 1972.
Most trials in Iran are secret and
held before military courts, but in
what Noyes believes was a response
to President Carter's human rights
drive, the Iranian government
granted an open trial to 11 political
prisoners last April.
Noyes said, "The whole thing was
a fraud." All 11 prisoners confessed
to political crimes before the trial and
their confessions were read in court.
However, Noyes said he knows for
a fact that they had been rewritten
several times. Some of those on trial
had not even been arrested when the
trial was announced.
Noyes said he speculates several of
those who were supposed to be tried
died under torture before the trial
and had to be replaced.
USPCI has seven chapters across
the country, the Northern California
one being located in Berkeley. Be
sides Noyes, Linus Pauling and sev
eral other Stanford professors are
members of the commitee, Until
now they have not been very active in
this area, but Noyes said the USPCI

will begin more local programs to try
to gain membership and raise funds.
While the USPCI did not help or
ganize the recent demonstrations in
San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
(they were organized by various Ira
nian resistance groups), the commit
tee's goal of helping all aspects of
Iranian resistance assured that many
of its members were there.
Noyes stressed the breadth of
Iranian opposition to the shah who
was originally placed on the throne
by the Allies during WW 11. In a coun
try of 30 million, at least 60,000 are in
jail for political reasons, said Noyes.
There is no one liberation front, but
resistance from many different quar
ters: religious, nationalistic, democ
ratic, commercial and revolutionary.
Despite all President Jimmy Car
ter's talk on human rights, Noyes
said, the United States has already
sold Iran $17 billion worth of arms
and made a tactical commitment to
the country's defense.
Noyes said he thought American
interest in the shah's pro-Western
government stems not only from its
location on the Soviet border, but its
position on the Persian Gulf, an area
which supplies the United States and
its allies with more than half their oil.
