Correction
The article in last Friday's Daily
concerning the Honor Code in
cluded a statement by Faculty Senate
Chairperson Peter Stansky that a re
solution affirming faculty support for
the Honor Code was to be presented
to the entire Senate for considera
tion.
Stansky in fact said that no deci
sion on the resolution has come yet,
and that it is still under consideration
by the Steering Committee.
