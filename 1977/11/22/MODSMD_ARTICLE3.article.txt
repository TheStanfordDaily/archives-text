Cairo (AP) — President Anwar
Sadat returned home to a hero's wel
come yesterday after opening a new
chapter in Middle East history by tel
ling the Israeli people in their own
capital, "No more war."
Hundreds of thousands of Egyp
tians cheered their president at the
airport and along the motorcade
route into Cairo.
A government spokesman said
Sadat's historical visit to Israel had
succeeded "100 per cent" in prepar
ing for new Geneva peace talks.
"We can say that hostilities of the
past 30 years have been ended in 30
hours," the spokesman said, accord
ing to the official Middle East news
agency. It said the spokesman was a
member of Sadat's delegation on the
trip to Jerusalem.
No treaty now
The news agency quoted him as
saying Israeli leaders tried to per
suade Sadat to settle their differ
ences and sign a peace treaty but
Sadat refused, telling them the aim of
his visit was not to conclude a sepa
rate peace but to prepare carefully
for reconvening the Geneva confer
ence.
"Israeli leaders showed under
standing and real interest in peace,"
.the spokesman told the news
agency.
Sadat, addressing the Israelis be

fore leaving for Cairo, said, "We've
had enough — four wars in 30 years."
Gamble
The Egyptian president had gam
bled Arab unity, his political future
and even his life on the success of his
44-hour visit.
Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin telephoned President Jimmy
Carter yesterday and gave him a
"warm and encouraging" report
about Sadat's visit to Israel, the
White House announced.
The White House said Begin and
Carter spoke for about five to 10 mi
nutes about the Jerusalem summit.
Carter spoke with both Middle East
leaders by telephone last week be
fore they began their summit. Of Be
gin's telephone call yesterday, the
announcement said: "The prime
minister again expressed his ap
preciation for the president's efforts
in the Middle East, which the prime
minister said made the historical
meeting possible. The president ex
pressed his appreciation for the call
and characterized the conversation
as warm and encouraging."
Meanwhile in Beirut Palestinian
guerrillas and leftist-governed Arab
nations called Sa<3at as great an
enemy as Israel and stepped up ap
peals yesterday for his overthrow.
The Sadat opponents, who had al
ready vowed publicly to assassinate

him, took particular objection to his
declaration in Jerusalem that the 1973
war was Egypt's last with the Jewish
state.
"This is an outright unilateral ter
mination of the state of war involving
old Arab countries against Israel for
29 years," said a Beirut radio station
that speaks for guerrillas and their
Lebanese leftists allies.
'Arch enemy'
"This defection from Arab ranks is
not only treason but also makes
Sadat as much an arch enemy of the
Arabs as Israel, if not worse," said the
broadcast.
Meanwhile, the conservative rul
ers of the oil-rich Persian Gulf states,

marking the four-day Moslem holi
day of sacrifice, maintained their si
lence about the Sadat trip. This spot
lighted a growing gulf between them
and the angry leftist regimes that
denounced Sadat as a traitor.
Dr. George Habash's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
the most extreme guerrilla group,
vowed to sabotage Sadat's no-war
agreement with Begin.
"We shall escalate our operations
to prove to the world that no peace
can be worked out in the Middle East
as long as the Palestinian nation re
mains oppressed," said the front's
official spokesman, Basam Abu
Sharif.

trip to Jerusalem.
No treaty now
The news agency quoted him as
saying Israeli leaders tried to per
suade Sadat to settle their differ
ences and sign a peace treaty but
Sadat refused, telling them the aim of
his visit was not to conclude a sepa

for reconvening the Geneva confer
ence.
"Israeli leaders showed under
standing and real interest in peace,"
.the spokesman told the news

Israeli Prime Minister Menahem
Begin telephoned President Jimmy
Carter yesterday and gave him a
"warm and encouraging" report
about Sadat's visit to Israel, the
White House announced.
The White House said Begin and
Carter spoke for about five to 10 mi
nutes about the Jerusalem summit.
Carter spoke with both Middle East
leaders by telephone last week be
fore they began their summit. Of Be
gin's telephone call yesterday, the
announcement said: "The prime
minister again expressed his ap
preciation for the president's efforts
in the Middle East, which the prime
minister said made the historical
meeting possible. The president ex
pressed his appreciation for the call
and characterized the conversation
as warm and encouraging."
Meanwhile in Beirut Palestinian
guerrillas and leftist-governed Arab
nations called Sa<3at as great an
enemy as Israel and stepped up ap
peals yesterday for his overthrow.
The Sadat opponents, who had al
ready vowed publicly to assassinate

him, took particular objection to his
declaration in Jerusalem that the 1973
war was Egypt's last with the Jewish
state.
"This is an outright unilateral ter
mination of the state of war involving
old Arab countries against Israel for
29 years," said a Beirut radio station
that speaks for guerrillas and their
Lebanese leftists allies.
'Arch enemy'
"This defection from Arab ranks is
not only treason but also makes
Sadat as much an arch enemy of the
Arabs as Israel, if not worse," said the
broadcast.
Meanwhile, the conservative rul
ers of the oil-rich Persian Gulf states,

marking the four-day Moslem holi
day of sacrifice, maintained their si
lence about the Sadat trip. This spot
lighted a growing gulf between them
and the angry leftist regimes that
denounced Sadat as a traitor.
Dr. George Habash's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
the most extreme guerrilla group,
vowed to sabotage Sadat's no-war
agreement with Begin.
"We shall escalate our operations
to prove to the world that no peace
can be worked out in the Middle East
as long as the Palestinian nation re
mains oppressed," said the front's
official spokesman, Basam Abu
Sharif.
