# Stanford CIA group funded secret research
## Cover foundation was money source for MK-ULTRA experiments 
### Randy Keith Copyright 1977, The Stanford Daily 
A CIA cover foundation located at
Stanford funneled money nation
wide to researchers working under
the ClA's top secret MK-ULTRA mind
control program, according to
documents obtained by the Daily.
The now defunct Medical Sciences
Research Foundation funded at least
one of seven secret projects carried
on here for the CIA, sponsored CIA
research at another university, and
may have served as a front for CIA
grants to at least four other schools
across the country.
The foundation financed research
at Cornell University, Johns Hopkins
University, the University of Hous
ton, Montana State University and
Pennsylvania State University. All of
these schools have confirmed that
they participated in the ClA's mind
control research program during the
1950s and early '60s.
The project which the foundation
funded at Stanford appears identical
to "subproject 72," which is men
tioned in CIA files released to the
University this fall, according to
documents on the foundation.
In that project, Dr. Windsor Cut
ting, now deceased, of the Medical
School's Department of Pharmacol
ogy, was given a $41,000 grant to
study the effects of drugs on the

central nervous system, according to
the CIA files.
Files match
The dollar amount and the project
description given in the agency's
liles matches that given in a letter
acknowledging receipt of the found
ation'sgrant which Dr. Robert Alway,
then the dean of the Medical School,
sent to Dr. Wallace Chan, the execu
tive secretary-treasurer of the found
ation.
Chan was apparently the CIA
liaison here from 1957 to 1961 while
he was an assistant clinical professor
of medicine.
He has told the San Francisco
Chronicle that he worked for the
agency from 1956 to 1959, the same
years that most of the secret projects
were being conducted here. Biog
raphical data from the Medical Cent
er's files on Chan in the Daily's pos
session also show that he was the
ClA's director of medical and scien
tific research from 1953 until 1957.
Chan helped set up the Medical
Sciences Research Foundation here
on April 25,1957, only six days before
the May 1, 1957 date on the CIA file
memo on Cutting's experiments.
The foundation funded possible
CIA research at Montana State Uni
versity by a chemistry professor in
vestigating a species of mushroom
and a trailing vine from which hal
lucinogenic drugs can be derived.

The support totaled $67,400 over a
five-year period beginning in 1957.
Three CIA projects
At Pennsylvania State University,
the foundation sponsored three dif
ferent CIA projects totaling $83,000.
The principal researcher for a
physics project using solid and liquid
crystals, former Penn State Prof.
Raymond Pepinsky, told the Daily
that the Medical Sciences Research
Foundation had funded his project
and that it was definitely a CIA cover.
"I knew it was a cover, I absolutely
knew it,"he said.
Pepinsky, who has admitted he
worked for the CIA and who is now at
the University of Florida, said that the
inclusion of his work in the mind
control files "was a complete sur
prise."
Pepinsky also voiced criticism of
the CIA for listing his work as dealing
with materials which would affect the
human nervous system.
The CIA also used the foundation
to finance research at Penn State to
study the effects of pesticides on
biological activities in the soil and to
study the role of birds in the trans
mission of certain viral infections.
Johns Flopkins University, Cornell
University and the University of
Houston have all said the CIA con
ducted research projects at their in
stitutions, but spokesmen at all three
were unable to confirm whether the
Medical Sciences Research Founda
tion was paying specifically for the
CIA research.
The names of the foundations
funding the research for the CIA and
the names of all individuals involved
have been deleted from all files
which the CIA has released on the
mind control project.
'Financial neglect'
In a letter to Alway dated Nov. 17,
1957, Chan explained that the Medi
cal Sciences Research Foundation
"was the result of an idea that had
been germinating for some time . . .
namely, that the smaller and lesser
related medical sciences were being
greatly neglected in the area of fi
nancial support."
The foundation, which operated
from April 1957 until April 1972, had a
