# Much more than robots
## Stanford's Artifical Intelligence Center 
### Barbie Fields 
Artificial intelligence: these two words can conjure
up delight in the prospect of giving man a more man
ageable world — or more fears of a computer
dominated existence.
Tucked in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, far from a bustling campus, the Stanford Artifi
cial Intelligence Center (AIC) wrestles with the prob
lems and implications of teaching a computer to
"think."
AIC was opened in 1966 as an outgrowth of the
Computer Science Dept. At present it has six funded
projects and employs about 80 people. However,
there are at least 40 other people who use the services
of AIC and work on several individual projects.
Early work in artificial intelligence included design
ing programs to play games like chess and checkers.
Stanford boasts the world's champion checker prog
ram, designed in the early 19605. A recent challenger
has appeared from North Carolina, according to Les
Earnest, assistant director of AIC, but the only match
played so far ended up in a draw.
Applications
)ohn McCarthy, AIC director, sees applications of
this in the future: designing cars which will drive
themselves safely at a regulated speed. "It will be
possible to have a car park itself and come back when
required," he said.
Another area of extensive research at present is in
the field of music. Prof. Leland Smith is interested in
learning to "play" a computer as one would any mus
ical instrument.
"Eventually," said Smith, "computers will make
today's electronic music synthesizers look as ad
vanced as a Jew's harp looks compared to a sym
phony orchestra." It is possible now to print out a
whole musical score and revise it by using a compu
ter.
The most recent development at AIC is a new pro
cess called Dialnet. According to Earnest, Dialnet will
give users of a time-shared computer the ability to
communicate with any other computer in the world
by telephone. This will be done through standard
"protocols"; codes which all computers would rec
ognize.
Users of Dialnet will be able to leave messages, to
transfer files of information, and allow someone to
use another computer by long distance. The user
could have his message sent immediately, or have his
computer wait for low night telephone rates.
Earnest said that the appeal of Dialnet is wide.

"From corporations to the home computer owners
who use a computer as a hobby, Dialnet will interest
and benefit them," he said.
Work on Dialnet began in July under sponsorship
of the National Science Foundation and preliminary
protocols may be available in early 1978.
Funding of AIC has been a touchy subject. The
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the
Department of Defense supplies $2 million annually
in ARPA grants. The National Science Foundation, the
National Institute of Mental Health, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and some pri
vate institutions also contribute to AIC.
"None of the work at Stanford is classified. The
military pays for a lot of information processing re
search on the assumption that maybe someday some
thing useful will come out of it," said Earnest. "Com
mand control is one applicable area but our research
is not necessarily coincided with what ARPA wants
done."
In late August, an international conference on arti
ficial intelligence was held at M.I.T. "A wide variety of
topics was discussed in the week-long meetings,"
said Earnest.
"Common sense (reasoning) is about the hardest
thing to teach 3 machine to do. Intelligent machines
cannot be created until we have the capacity to prog
ram a machine for that."
New Einstein
How soon will that be? "Two or three brilliant ideas
away. We need several Einsteins working on it," said
Earnest.
There are tremendous benefits to designing a
'thinking machine,' according to Earnest.
"It will release a person from dull, repetitive jobs
and turn him into a supervisor of these activities. As a
result he simultaneously will have more leisure time
and increase his productivity. The expense of mate
rial goods should be less and it will be possible to
have customized houses, automobiles, etc., at a
reasonable cost,"he said*
Earnest readily concedes the "possible and real
abuses" of programming machines. He said that this
is no more dangerous than advancing other types of
technolgoy, however.
"There are already necessary laws dealing with the
right to challenge what records should be accessible
by computer and inappropriate use of records ob
tained. Also, a person has the right to examine any
record on himself that someone else has. So far there
is no secure way of promising that no snooping can
be done," he said.

Computer Science Dept. At present it has six funded
projects and employs about 80 people. However,
there are at least 40 other people who use the services
of AIC and work on several individual projects.
Early work in artificial intelligence included design
ing programs to play games like chess and checkers.
Stanford boasts the world's champion checker prog
ram, designed in the early 19605. A recent challenger
has appeared from North Carolina, according to Les
Earnest, assistant director of AIC, but the only match
played so far ended up in a draw.

)ohn McCarthy, AIC director, sees applications of
this in the future: designing cars which will drive
themselves safely at a regulated speed. "It will be
possible to have a car park itself and come back when
required," he said.
Another area of extensive research at present is in
the field of music. Prof. Leland Smith is interested in
learning to "play" a computer as one would any mus
ical instrument.
"Eventually," said Smith, "computers will make
today's electronic music synthesizers look as ad
vanced as a Jew's harp looks compared to a sym
phony orchestra." It is possible now to print out a
whole musical score and revise it by using a compu
ter.
The most recent development at AIC is a new pro
cess called Dialnet. According to Earnest, Dialnet will
give users of a time-shared computer the ability to
communicate with any other computer in the world
by telephone. This will be done through standard
"protocols"; codes which all computers would rec
ognize.
Users of Dialnet will be able to leave messages, to
transfer files of information, and allow someone to
use another computer by long distance. The user
could have his message sent immediately, or have his
computer wait for low night telephone rates.
Earnest said that the appeal of Dialnet is wide.

"From corporations to the home computer owners
who use a computer as a hobby, Dialnet will interest
and benefit them," he said.
Work on Dialnet began in July under sponsorship
of the National Science Foundation and preliminary
protocols may be available in early 1978.
Funding of AIC has been a touchy subject. The
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the
Department of Defense supplies $2 million annually
in ARPA grants. The National Science Foundation, the
National Institute of Mental Health, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and some pri
vate institutions also contribute to AIC.
"None of the work at Stanford is classified. The
military pays for a lot of information processing re
search on the assumption that maybe someday some
thing useful will come out of it," said Earnest. "Com
mand control is one applicable area but our research
is not necessarily coincided with what ARPA wants
done."
In late August, an international conference on arti
ficial intelligence was held at M.I.T. "A wide variety of
topics was discussed in the week-long meetings,"
said Earnest.
"Common sense (reasoning) is about the hardest
thing to teach 3 machine to do. Intelligent machines
cannot be created until we have the capacity to prog
ram a machine for that."
New Einstein
How soon will that be? "Two or three brilliant ideas
away. We need several Einsteins working on it," said
Earnest.
There are tremendous benefits to designing a
'thinking machine,' according to Earnest.
"It will release a person from dull, repetitive jobs
and turn him into a supervisor of these activities. As a
result he simultaneously will have more leisure time
and increase his productivity. The expense of mate
rial goods should be less and it will be possible to
have customized houses, automobiles, etc., at a
reasonable cost,"he said*
Earnest readily concedes the "possible and real
abuses" of programming machines. He said that this
is no more dangerous than advancing other types of
technolgoy, however.
"There are already necessary laws dealing with the
right to challenge what records should be accessible
by computer and inappropriate use of records ob
tained. Also, a person has the right to examine any
record on himself that someone else has. So far there
is no secure way of promising that no snooping can
be done," he said.
Artificial intelligence: these two words can conjure
up delight in the prospect of giving man a more man
ageable world — or more fears of a computer
dominated existence.
