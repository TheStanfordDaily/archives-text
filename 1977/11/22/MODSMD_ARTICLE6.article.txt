## We live in terrifying peace 
### 
Steve Barkan

In Japan there is a legend that any
one who folds 1000 paper cranes will
survive a serious illness. Sadako
Sasaki had folded 984 cranes when
she died of leukemia at the age of 12
in 1955.
Ten years earlier she'd been in a
crib in Hiroshima when the atomic
bomb fell. Sadako managed to sur
vive the blast that ki lied 80,000 others
instantaneously, but a decade later
the radiation ended her life as well.
Her friends from school folded the
remaining cranes and placed them
with the others in her coffin. Later
children from all over Japan sent
money for a monument to Sadako. It
is a poignant sight.
Atop an arch several feet high
stands a statue of Sadako, her out
stretched arms holding a crane. At
the base of the arch lie thousands of
paper cranes sent by Japanese chi!
dren every year. Hidden by the
cranes is the monument's inscrip
tion: "This is our cry, this is our
prayer: peace in the world."
Thirty-two years after the bomb
ings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuc
lear weapons far more powerful than

their 1945 ancestors hang like the
sword of Damocles over the world.
It is a terrifying peace we enjoy
these days, knowing that billions of
years of evolution could end in a hor
rible few seconds. And the price we
pay for this peace is high indeed, as
our taxes are wasted on weapons of
war instead of going to help the poor
and the needy.
On the anniversary of the
Hiroshima bomb Aug. 6, peace
groups across the world announced
the launching of the Mobilization for
Survival.
Noting that "the survival of our
planet is at stake," joint press con
ferences in Stockholm, Washington,
D.C., San Francisco and Hiroshima
announced a broad effort to unite
the peace and environmental
movements around four goals: zero
nuclear weapons, end the arms race,
ban nuclear power, fund human
needs.
"Instead of security," said the new
mobilization coalition, "the arms
race has brought more fear, distrust
and dislocation than the world has
ever known before."

As part of the mobilization, de
monstrations and other actions
against nuclear weapons and nuclear
power occurred in August in more
than 140 cities across the United
States. This fall teach-ins at colleges
and universities throughout the
country are taking place; Stanford
saw the likes of Barry Commoner,
Daniel Ellsberg and Tom Hayden
speaking at a series of public meet
ings last week.
Drawing on the 19605, when
teach-ins on the Vietnam War and
related issues helped educate a na
tion, the nuclear teach-ins are in
tended only as a first step in what
promises to be a long, difficult pro
cess.
Next spring the mobilization plans
a variety of activities, including
events and demonstrations in late
May during the United Nations Spe
cial Session on Disarmament.
This dry account cannot do justice
to the urgency of the mobilization
efforts. The teach-ins this fall may or
may not signify the resurgence of
waves of protest similar to those that
helped end the Vietnam War. But if
they do not at least spark a new be
ginning where the people of this
country and across the world speak
out for life, then nuclear death will
surely be our destiny.
The children of Japan know this all
too well. In their sorrow they built a
monument to Sadako Sasaki to re
mind the rest of the world of the hor
rors of the atom. Other children
wrote stories or poems that stand as
similar testimonies. One poem was
written by a boy who was five when
Nagasaki was bombed:
I'm a boy in the fourth grade now
At a primary school called Yamazato
The playground is cleared up now.
There's no trace of that terrible day
now:
My playmates do not know that
Many people were once burnt to
ashes.
I recall casually that very day.
I crouch where mother was burnt
And feel the earth with my fingers.
When I dig deep with a bamboo there
Pieces of black charcoal appear
And mother's face is seen dim in the
earth.
