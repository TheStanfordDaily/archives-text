Mussa speech
Your account of the speech of the
Consul General of Italy, Paolo
Mussa, to the Casa Italiana (Daily,
Nov. 14) shows an official of the Ita
lian government arguing for the pol
icy of the Italian Communist Party
without admitting it — at a moment
when his government, which is en
tirely Christian Democratic, is in
volved in a difficult and dangerous
holding action against the Com
munists.
What Mussa calls a coalition gov
ernment is what the Italian Com
munist Party calls the "historic com
promise." The "historic com
promise" is a technique of under
mining democracy from within by
compelling the Christian Democrats
to discredit themselves by joining in
a coalition with the Communists.
In order to succeed in this strategy
the Italian Communists have to win
at least the tacit consent of the Vati
can and the United States. Lately, the
leader of the Italian Communist
Party, Berlinguer, has intensified his
courtship of Catholic Italy and the
Vatican. Mussa's disingenuous
speech at Stanford is part of an effort
to dull American awareness of the
serious threat to the liberty of Italy.
Your reporter was properly cir
cumspect in reporting Mussa's out
rageous allegation that Berlinguer
and the Italian Communist Party had
renounced Marx and Lenin. About to
leave for Moscow a few days ago for
the celebration of the Bolshevik sei
zure of power, Berlinguer told a baf
fled Italian reporter that the Italian
Communist Party was not "Marxist-
Leninist" but "Marxist and Leninist."
The missing hyphen — that's what
the Consul General of Italy meant by
Berlinguer's rejection of Marx and
Lenin.

Community service center
An act of arson completely de
stroyed the East Palo Alto Commun
ity Service Center on the evening of
November 13.
For the past 22 years, the Service
Center under the direction of
Oneida Branch, has provided essen
tial food, clothing and monetary as
sistance to all members of the East
Palo Alto and East Menlo Park com
munities.
The demands on the Center will be
particularly acute this week due to
the Thanksgiving holiday. Many
people in the community are and will
be looking to the center for help.
The Center has been relocated at
1189 Willow Road in Menlo Park.
However, food, clothing, and money
reserves have been destroyed.
The need is immediate and acute.
However, we feel that the Stanford
community can go a long way to
meet it.
In addition, the Black Student Un
ion, Black Activities Center, Black
Caucus and Black Students' Cultural
Center are organizing an intensive
donations drive with the aid of
Memorial Church to meet the needs
of the community at Christmas.

icy of the Italian Communist Party
without admitting it — at a moment
when his government, which is en
tirely Christian Democratic, is in
volved in a difficult and dangerous
holding action against the Com
munists.
What Mussa calls a coalition gov
ernment is what the Italian Com
munist Party calls the "historic com
promise." The "historic com
promise" is a technique of under
mining democracy from within by
compelling the Christian Democrats
to discredit themselves by joining in
a coalition with the Communists.
In order to succeed in this strategy
the Italian Communists have to win
at least the tacit consent of the Vati
can and the United States. Lately, the
leader of the Italian Communist
Party, Berlinguer, has intensified his
courtship of Catholic Italy and the
Vatican. Mussa's disingenuous
speech at Stanford is part of an effort
to dull American awareness of the
serious threat to the liberty of Italy.
Your reporter was properly cir
cumspect in reporting Mussa's out
rageous allegation that Berlinguer
and the Italian Communist Party had
renounced Marx and Lenin. About to
leave for Moscow a few days ago for
the celebration of the Bolshevik sei
zure of power, Berlinguer told a baf
fled Italian reporter that the Italian
Communist Party was not "Marxist-
Leninist" but "Marxist and Leninist."
The missing hyphen — that's what
the Consul General of Italy meant by
Berlinguer's rejection of Marx and
Lenin.

Community service center
An act of arson completely de
stroyed the East Palo Alto Commun
ity Service Center on the evening of
November 13.
For the past 22 years, the Service
Center under the direction of
Oneida Branch, has provided essen
tial food, clothing and monetary as
sistance to all members of the East
Palo Alto and East Menlo Park com
munities.
The demands on the Center will be
particularly acute this week due to
the Thanksgiving holiday. Many
people in the community are and will
be looking to the center for help.
The Center has been relocated at
1189 Willow Road in Menlo Park.
However, food, clothing, and money
reserves have been destroyed.
The need is immediate and acute.
However, we feel that the Stanford
community can go a long way to
meet it.
In addition, the Black Student Un
ion, Black Activities Center, Black
Caucus and Black Students' Cultural
Center are organizing an intensive
donations drive with the aid of
Memorial Church to meet the needs
of the community at Christmas.
