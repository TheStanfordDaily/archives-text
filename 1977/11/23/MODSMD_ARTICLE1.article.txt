### Hardy Iredale 
Chemistry Prof. Henry Taube was
one of 15 recipients of the National
Medal of Science, presented by Pres
ident jimmy Carter yesterday at a
White House ceremony.
Taube has been working in the
field of inorganic chemistry for the
past 30 years, and has pioneered
many of the experimental
techniques used in observing inor
ganic reactions today.
He has been recognized as one of
today's most creative and influential
scientists, and is generally regarded
as America's foremost inorganic
chemist.
The National Medal of Science is
the nation's highest award for distin
guished science. It is
given to persons judged "deserving
of special recognition by reason of
their outstanding contributions to
knowledge in the physical, biologi
cal, mathematical, or engineering
sciences."
Taube is the 10th recipient of the
National Science Medal. Previous
winners include such distinguished
scientists as Linus Pauling, Frederick
Terman and Rudolf Kompfner.
Prof, lames Collman of the
Chemistry Dept. described Taube as
"probably the world's authority on
the reactions of oxidation and reduc
tion for inorganic substances."
"He has worked out most of the
mechanisms for researching the de
tails of these reactions," Collman
said. He noted that most researchers
in the field today are following along
lines developed by Taube.
"There's a general consensus that
in the field of inorganic reactions
he's the most famous name around,"
Collman said.
Gerald Lieberman, Vice Provost
for Research, noted, "The Medal of
Science is one of the highest scien
tific honors this country can bestow.
They are rare, and it is indeed an
honor to be a recipient of one."
Taube was officially recognized for
his "contributions to the under
standing of reactivity and reaction
mechanisms in inorganic chemis
try."
Taube came to Stanford in 1962
from the University of Chicago,
where he was the head of that uni
versity's Chemistry Dept. He has
been the recipient of numerous
honors previously, including the
American Chemical Society's 1967
Award for Distinguished Service in
the Advancement of Inorganic
Chemistry, the 1971 Nicholas Medal
of the New York ACS, and the 1971
Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago
ACS.
Taube is the author of more than
200 scientific articles. He is a member
of the National Academy of Sciences
and the National Academy of Arts
and Sciences.

of the New York ACS, and the 1971
Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago
ACS.
Taube is the author of more than
200 scientific articles. He is a member
of the National Academy of Sciences
and the National Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
Chemistry Prof. Henry Taube was
one of 15 recipients of the National
Medal of Science, presented by Pres
ident jimmy Carter yesterday at a
White House ceremony.
Taube has been working in the
field of inorganic chemistry for the
past 30 years, and has pioneered
many of the experimental
techniques used in observing inor
ganic reactions today.
He has been recognized as one of
today's most creative and influential
scientists, and is generally regarded
as America's foremost inorganic
chemist.
The National Medal of Science is
the nation's highest award for distin
guished science. It is
given to persons judged "deserving
of special recognition by reason of
their outstanding contributions to
knowledge in the physical, biologi
cal, mathematical, or engineering
sciences."
Taube is the 10th recipient of the
National Science Medal. Previous
winners include such distinguished
scientists as Linus Pauling, Frederick
Terman and Rudolf Kompfner.
Prof, lames Collman of the
Chemistry Dept. described Taube as
"probably the world's authority on
the reactions of oxidation and reduc
tion for inorganic substances."
"He has worked out most of the
mechanisms for researching the de
tails of these reactions," Collman
said. He noted that most researchers
in the field today are following along
lines developed by Taube.
"There's a general consensus that
in the field of inorganic reactions
he's the most famous name around,"
Collman said.
Gerald Lieberman, Vice Provost
for Research, noted, "The Medal of
Science is one of the highest scien
tific honors this country can bestow.
They are rare, and it is indeed an
honor to be a recipient of one."
Taube was officially recognized for
his "contributions to the under
standing of reactivity and reaction
mechanisms in inorganic chemis
try."
Taube came to Stanford in 1962
from the University of Chicago,
where he was the head of that uni
versity's Chemistry Dept. He has
been the recipient of numerous
honors previously, including the
American Chemical Society's 1967
Award for Distinguished Service in
the Advancement of Inorganic
Chemistry, the 1971 Nicholas Medal
of the New York ACS, and the 1971
Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago
ACS.
Taube is the author of more than
200 scientific articles. He is a member
of the National Academy of Sciences
and the National Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
