# Fraternity/sorority systems will stratify Stanford
## 
### 
Jeff Stoler

At the outset it is necessary that we
define the question and choices pre
sented the Stanford community by
the sorority issue. I would contend
that it isn't merely a question of hav
ing sororities or not having sororities,
but of whether we are to have a
fraternity-sorority system or not.
Recognition that this is really the
question facing our school has curi
ously eluded many students. If it
were just a question of whether to
have sororities or not, of whether it
would make any difference to the
Stanford community if all the frat
houses were instead sorority houses,
I would agree with the general feel
ing of "why not."
But such an analysis ignores one of
the most important aspects of
sororities; that of their interaction
with fraternities. The whole system
of fraternities and sororities is quite a
different animal from the sum of its
two halves taken by themselves.

Fraternities or sororities, each
without the other would be unlikely
to separate themselves away from
general campus life. The importance
of meeting with the members of the
other sex finds them joining into
campus activities and in turn inviting
non-members to join into their own
activites.
This, I think, is adequately borne
out by the present fraternity-only
system which in many ways is a posi
tive social force on campus. Vet, that
is not to say that a tendency for
fraternities to isolate themselves
from Stanford does not exist, as the
occasional bus-load of imported
Mills girls will attest.
Yet, having sororities and frater
nities at the same time partially, if not
totally, destroys this link with the
campus community. The natural ad
vantages of a fraternity/sorority sys
tem in facilitating the logisitics of as
sociating with the opposite sex are

overwhelming. The two groups to
gether can be very much self
sufficient in this aspect of human in
teraction and quite probably rela
tions with the general student
populous would be chilled.
All students know how important
socializing is, and the prospect of
being able to do so easily with be
nefit of large social budgets and the
other attributes of 'fraternal' living is
one which will make the system a
seductive one. Clearly a better
mousetrap will be present in this re
gard, and it is unlikely that students
will not beat a path to it.
Moreover, if we are to assume a
system which is physically limited in
the number of students who may
participate, it is only realistic to rec
ognize that membership will be ex
tended only to those whose social
credentials, however defined, are
the best.
Stepping back a moment, I must
admit I'm not sure why one should
want to inhibit a social elite from
socializing selectively within itself. I
know it rubs me the wrong way in
ternally. Egalitarianism, I suppose, is
the value which it most offends in
me. This is not, however, to say that
there aren't reasons against such a
system which are more broadly
based than one individual's.
Most important of these reasons is
that any community will be im
poverished to the extent that it be
comes stratified in any way. The
people at Stanford, by and large,
were not chosen solely on what they
could come away from Stanford
with, but on what they could give

while here.
Indeed, for most of us it is what we
will give each other that will most
define what we gain from Stanford.
Therefore to the extent that a
sorority/fraternity system will segre
gate itself from the community, we
all would be a little poorer.
The contention that a traditional
Greek system would tend to stratify
Stanford is an important one, and
bears substantiation. As a graduate
student I come in contact with stu
dents from all parts of the nation; 112
colleges are represented in all. Over
and over again, whether the student
favors a fraternity/sorority system or
not, the aspect that it was divisive of
their alma mater is conceded.
To think that Stanford will be diffe
rent is complete folly. Stanford stu
dents labor under the same hopes,
aspirations and fears as does the rest
of college America. The students
here may be endowed with a few
more IQ points, but I doubt many
would suggest they make us better
socially â€” in fact it is not uncommon
to hear the opposite opinion.
Stanford does not need a full
sorority/fraternity system, and I fail
to see why we seem willing to give up
so much for it.
Yet something must necessarily
change at Stanford. Title IX and a
general feeling of fair play make it
incumbent that the present
fraternity-only system be modified.
As may be apparent from my tenor so
far, I would rather see no system
then a complete one, but as it is
probably infeasible to abolish the frat
system, I would suggest the follow

ing alternatives to a full-fledged
Creek scene at Stanford.
One possibility is to make the
fraternity/sorority system very small
so as to minimize the stratification to
some imperceptible quanity. This
solution, however, seems unappeal
ing for for the reason that Stanford is
so small that to make the fraternity/
sorority system insignificant would
be tantamount to abolition.
Another possibility would be to
require that the system be an open
one, thereby blurring if not destroy
ing the strata line between the com
munity and the sorority/fraternities.
Under such a system the joining of a
fraternity or sorority would not be
the product of a socially Darwinistic
selection process, but would be the
result of a choice by the student, sub
ject at most to a demonstration of
interest such as required by houses
like Lambda Nu. All members could
participate in the functions of the
group, and to prevent exclusivity be
tween those living in and out of the
house, possibly some sort of senior
ity system might be developed to de
termine the issue.
In any event, whatever system is
adopted, it is important we face the
question of whether Stanford is wil
ling to stratify itself as is implicit in
the standard sorority/fraternity sys
tem. I would contend that the costs
of this ancient system are far too
great, and that we all have a stake in
the building of a still better mouse
trap.

ing sororities or not having sororities,
but of whether we are to have a
fraternity-sorority system or not.
Recognition that this is really the
question facing our school has curi
ously eluded many students. If it
were just a question of whether to
have sororities or not, of whether it
would make any difference to the
Stanford community if all the frat
houses were instead sorority houses,
I would agree with the general feel
ing of "why not."
But such an analysis ignores one of
the most important aspects of
sororities; that of their interaction
with fraternities. The whole system
of fraternities and sororities is quite a
different animal from the sum of its
two halves taken by themselves.

Fraternities or sororities, each
without the other would be unlikely
to separate themselves away from
general campus life. The importance
of meeting with the members of the
other sex finds them joining into
campus activities and in turn inviting
non-members to join into their own
activites.
This, I think, is adequately borne
out by the present fraternity-only
system which in many ways is a posi
tive social force on campus. Vet, that
is not to say that a tendency for
fraternities to isolate themselves
from Stanford does not exist, as the
occasional bus-load of imported
Mills girls will attest.
Yet, having sororities and frater
nities at the same time partially, if not
totally, destroys this link with the
campus community. The natural ad
vantages of a fraternity/sorority sys
tem in facilitating the logisitics of as
sociating with the opposite sex are

overwhelming. The two groups to
gether can be very much self
sufficient in this aspect of human in
teraction and quite probably rela
tions with the general student
populous would be chilled.
All students know how important
socializing is, and the prospect of
being able to do so easily with be
nefit of large social budgets and the
other attributes of 'fraternal' living is
one which will make the system a
seductive one. Clearly a better
mousetrap will be present in this re
gard, and it is unlikely that students
will not beat a path to it.
Moreover, if we are to assume a
system which is physically limited in
the number of students who may
participate, it is only realistic to rec
ognize that membership will be ex
tended only to those whose social
credentials, however defined, are
the best.
Stepping back a moment, I must
admit I'm not sure why one should
want to inhibit a social elite from
socializing selectively within itself. I
know it rubs me the wrong way in
ternally. Egalitarianism, I suppose, is
the value which it most offends in
me. This is not, however, to say that
there aren't reasons against such a
system which are more broadly
based than one individual's.
Most important of these reasons is
that any community will be im
poverished to the extent that it be
comes stratified in any way. The
people at Stanford, by and large,
were not chosen solely on what they
could come away from Stanford
with, but on what they could give

while here.
Indeed, for most of us it is what we
will give each other that will most
define what we gain from Stanford.
Therefore to the extent that a
sorority/fraternity system will segre
gate itself from the community, we
all would be a little poorer.
The contention that a traditional
Greek system would tend to stratify
Stanford is an important one, and
bears substantiation. As a graduate
student I come in contact with stu
dents from all parts of the nation; 112
colleges are represented in all. Over
and over again, whether the student
favors a fraternity/sorority system or
not, the aspect that it was divisive of
their alma mater is conceded.
To think that Stanford will be diffe
rent is complete folly. Stanford stu
dents labor under the same hopes,
aspirations and fears as does the rest
of college America. The students
here may be endowed with a few
more IQ points, but I doubt many
would suggest they make us better
socially â€” in fact it is not uncommon
to hear the opposite opinion.
Stanford does not need a full
sorority/fraternity system, and I fail
to see why we seem willing to give up
so much for it.
Yet something must necessarily
change at Stanford. Title IX and a
general feeling of fair play make it
incumbent that the present
fraternity-only system be modified.
As may be apparent from my tenor so
far, I would rather see no system
then a complete one, but as it is
probably infeasible to abolish the frat
system, I would suggest the follow

ing alternatives to a full-fledged
Creek scene at Stanford.
One possibility is to make the
fraternity/sorority system very small
so as to minimize the stratification to
some imperceptible quanity. This
solution, however, seems unappeal
ing for for the reason that Stanford is
so small that to make the fraternity/
sorority system insignificant would
be tantamount to abolition.
Another possibility would be to
require that the system be an open
one, thereby blurring if not destroy
ing the strata line between the com
munity and the sorority/fraternities.
Under such a system the joining of a
fraternity or sorority would not be
the product of a socially Darwinistic
selection process, but would be the
result of a choice by the student, sub
ject at most to a demonstration of
interest such as required by houses
like Lambda Nu. All members could
participate in the functions of the
group, and to prevent exclusivity be
tween those living in and out of the
house, possibly some sort of senior
ity system might be developed to de
termine the issue.
In any event, whatever system is
adopted, it is important we face the
question of whether Stanford is wil
ling to stratify itself as is implicit in
the standard sorority/fraternity sys
tem. I would contend that the costs
of this ancient system are far too
great, and that we all have a stake in
the building of a still better mouse
trap.

ously eluded many students. If it
were just a question of whether to
have sororities or not, of whether it
would make any difference to the
Stanford community if all the frat
houses were instead sorority houses,
I would agree with the general feel
ing of "why not."
But such an analysis ignores one of
the most important aspects of
sororities; that of their interaction
with fraternities. The whole system
of fraternities and sororities is quite a
different animal from the sum of its
two halves taken by themselves.

Fraternities or sororities, each
without the other would be unlikely
to separate themselves away from
general campus life. The importance
of meeting with the members of the
other sex finds them joining into
campus activities and in turn inviting
non-members to join into their own
activites.
This, I think, is adequately borne
out by the present fraternity-only
system which in many ways is a posi
tive social force on campus. Vet, that
is not to say that a tendency for
fraternities to isolate themselves
from Stanford does not exist, as the
occasional bus-load of imported
Mills girls will attest.
Yet, having sororities and frater
nities at the same time partially, if not
totally, destroys this link with the
campus community. The natural ad
vantages of a fraternity/sorority sys
tem in facilitating the logisitics of as
sociating with the opposite sex are

overwhelming. The two groups to
gether can be very much self
sufficient in this aspect of human in
teraction and quite probably rela
tions with the general student
populous would be chilled.
All students know how important
socializing is, and the prospect of
being able to do so easily with be
nefit of large social budgets and the
other attributes of 'fraternal' living is
one which will make the system a
seductive one. Clearly a better
mousetrap will be present in this re
gard, and it is unlikely that students
will not beat a path to it.
Moreover, if we are to assume a
system which is physically limited in
the number of students who may
participate, it is only realistic to rec
ognize that membership will be ex
tended only to those whose social
credentials, however defined, are
the best.
Stepping back a moment, I must
admit I'm not sure why one should
want to inhibit a social elite from
socializing selectively within itself. I
know it rubs me the wrong way in
ternally. Egalitarianism, I suppose, is
the value which it most offends in
me. This is not, however, to say that
there aren't reasons against such a
system which are more broadly
based than one individual's.
Most important of these reasons is
that any community will be im
poverished to the extent that it be
comes stratified in any way. The
people at Stanford, by and large,
were not chosen solely on what they
could come away from Stanford
with, but on what they could give

while here.
Indeed, for most of us it is what we
will give each other that will most
define what we gain from Stanford.
Therefore to the extent that a
sorority/fraternity system will segre
gate itself from the community, we
all would be a little poorer.
The contention that a traditional
Greek system would tend to stratify
Stanford is an important one, and
bears substantiation. As a graduate
student I come in contact with stu
dents from all parts of the nation; 112
colleges are represented in all. Over
and over again, whether the student
favors a fraternity/sorority system or
not, the aspect that it was divisive of
their alma mater is conceded.
To think that Stanford will be diffe
rent is complete folly. Stanford stu
dents labor under the same hopes,
aspirations and fears as does the rest
of college America. The students
here may be endowed with a few
more IQ points, but I doubt many
would suggest they make us better
socially â€” in fact it is not uncommon
to hear the opposite opinion.
Stanford does not need a full
sorority/fraternity system, and I fail
to see why we seem willing to give up
so much for it.
Yet something must necessarily
change at Stanford. Title IX and a
general feeling of fair play make it
incumbent that the present
fraternity-only system be modified.
As may be apparent from my tenor so
far, I would rather see no system
then a complete one, but as it is
probably infeasible to abolish the frat
system, I would suggest the follow

ing alternatives to a full-fledged
Creek scene at Stanford.
One possibility is to make the
fraternity/sorority system very small
so as to minimize the stratification to
some imperceptible quanity. This
solution, however, seems unappeal
ing for for the reason that Stanford is
so small that to make the fraternity/
sorority system insignificant would
be tantamount to abolition.
Another possibility would be to
require that the system be an open
one, thereby blurring if not destroy
ing the strata line between the com
munity and the sorority/fraternities.
Under such a system the joining of a
fraternity or sorority would not be
the product of a socially Darwinistic
selection process, but would be the
result of a choice by the student, sub
ject at most to a demonstration of
interest such as required by houses
like Lambda Nu. All members could
participate in the functions of the
group, and to prevent exclusivity be
tween those living in and out of the
house, possibly some sort of senior
ity system might be developed to de
termine the issue.
In any event, whatever system is
adopted, it is important we face the
question of whether Stanford is wil
ling to stratify itself as is implicit in
the standard sorority/fraternity sys
tem. I would contend that the costs
of this ancient system are far too
great, and that we all have a stake in
the building of a still better mouse
trap.
