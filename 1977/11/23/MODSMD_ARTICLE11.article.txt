# Motive in S. Africa: profit maximization
## 
### 
Ellen Byrne

Arguments for U.S. corporations
as a "progressive force" in South Af
rica demonstrate a naivete about the
motives of U.S. companies in South
Africa, a failure to appreciate the past
ineffectiveness of these firms in op
posing apartheid, and most impor
tantly, a gross exaggeration of the
potential of corporate equal oppor
tunity programs to improve the lives
of black South Africans.
The corporate motive for being in
South Africa is profit maximization,
not social transformation. Although
the current recession in South Africa
has depressed current profit mar
gins, as recently as 1974 U.S. manufac
turing companies there were earning
net profits on average of 16 percent
as compared to 12-13 percent
worldwide.
U.S. investors have been quite
forthright about their reasons for
operating in South Africa. For exam
ple, IBM states that "IBM is in South
Africa because it makes good busi
ness sense. IBM South Africa is pro
fitable and has a potential for future
growth."
For nearly a decade American firms
have been under fire for putting pro
fits before people in their South Afri
can subsidiaries. This pressure for
workplace reform has produced very
little. A Wall Street journal article last
March evaluating the equal oppor
tunity performance of U.S. com
panies in South Africa cites "a pat
tern of uneven efforts and sporadic
accomplishments in ending job
bias."
The most extensive study of these
employment practices to date, by the
Investor Responsibility Research
Center, states that "the bulk of
American companies doing business
in South Africa probably are no more

innovative than South African or
British or other foreign businesses."
Pledge to reform
A recent pledge by several corpo
rations to work for reform in South
Africa "through appropriate chan
nels" shows little promise of sub
stantive change. South Africa's major
business weekly, the Financial Mail,
called the pledge (known as the Six
Principles) a "damp squib" (a firec
racker that fizzles). It went on to say,
"As a head-on confrontation with the
broader policies of South African
apartheid, it is just not on."
But what if Stanford was able to
convince American corporations to
abandon their basic business objec
tives in South Africa and work for
more serious equal employment op
portunity programs? For example,
willfully violating any labor laws that
act as constraints on non
discrimination. The impact of this un
likely development would be margi
nal and limited in scope.
The most fundamental bars to
black advancement are not those
which American corporations can
unilaterally eliminate. There can be
no equality of opportunity in a coun
try where one group of workers on
the basis of skin color is excluded
from the educational system; is
forced to live under exhausting con
ditions, often in crowded hostels,
away from family or friends; is con
stantly subject to the threat of being
arrested under a battery of special
laws which control movement, the
right to be in a particular place, the
right to work for a certain employer;
is denied participation in govern
ment.
Oppression of apartheid
Moreover, the number of people
which American corporations are in a

position to benefit through labor
practice reforms is minimal when
compared with the number of
people suffering the oppression of
apatheid.
Although American firms hold a
strategic position in the South Afri
can economy, they employ only
100,000 out of 7,000,000 blacks in the
labor force. This is the result of the
corporations' extreme capital inten
siveness and comparatively high
proportion of white personnel.
We must not allow legitimate con
cern with employment practices to
obscure the true dimension of the
problem in South Africa. The issue is
not whether Ford Motor Company

workers have apprenticeship prog
rams designed for black upward mo
bility, but that 84 per cent of the
population does not have political
self-determination.
Even in a liberal welfare state like
America, corporate equal employ
ment strategies have barely
scratched the surface of our more
subtle racism, yet some
would have us believe that
such an approach in South Africa,
where racism is an institutionalized
way of life, can significantly improve
the lives of the black population.

Pledge to reform
A recent pledge by several corpo
rations to work for reform in South
Africa "through appropriate chan
nels" shows little promise of sub
stantive change. South Africa's major
business weekly, the Financial Mail,
called the pledge (known as the Six
Principles) a "damp squib" (a firec
racker that fizzles). It went on to say,
"As a head-on confrontation with the
broader policies of South African
apartheid, it is just not on."
But what if Stanford was able to
convince American corporations to
abandon their basic business objec
tives in South Africa and work for
more serious equal employment op
portunity programs? For example,
willfully violating any labor laws that
act as constraints on non
discrimination. The impact of this un
likely development would be margi
nal and limited in scope.
The most fundamental bars to
black advancement are not those
which American corporations can
unilaterally eliminate. There can be
no equality of opportunity in a coun
try where one group of workers on
the basis of skin color is excluded
from the educational system; is
forced to live under exhausting con
ditions, often in crowded hostels,
away from family or friends; is con
stantly subject to the threat of being
arrested under a battery of special
laws which control movement, the
right to be in a particular place, the
right to work for a certain employer;
is denied participation in govern
ment.
Oppression of apartheid
Moreover, the number of people
which American corporations are in a

position to benefit through labor
practice reforms is minimal when
compared with the number of
people suffering the oppression of
apatheid.
Although American firms hold a
strategic position in the South Afri
can economy, they employ only
100,000 out of 7,000,000 blacks in the
labor force. This is the result of the
corporations' extreme capital inten
siveness and comparatively high
proportion of white personnel.
We must not allow legitimate con
cern with employment practices to
obscure the true dimension of the
problem in South Africa. The issue is
not whether Ford Motor Company

workers have apprenticeship prog
rams designed for black upward mo
bility, but that 84 per cent of the
population does not have political
self-determination.
Even in a liberal welfare state like
America, corporate equal employ
ment strategies have barely
scratched the surface of our more
subtle racism, yet some
would have us believe that
such an approach in South Africa,
where racism is an institutionalized
way of life, can significantly improve
the lives of the black population.

Arguments for U.S. corporations
as a "progressive force" in South Af
rica demonstrate a naivete about the
motives of U.S. companies in South
Africa, a failure to appreciate the past
ineffectiveness of these firms in op
posing apartheid, and most impor
tantly, a gross exaggeration of the
potential of corporate equal oppor
tunity programs to improve the lives
of black South Africans.
The corporate motive for being in
South Africa is profit maximization,
not social transformation. Although
the current recession in South Africa
has depressed current profit mar
gins, as recently as 1974 U.S. manufac
turing companies there were earning
net profits on average of 16 percent
as compared to 12-13 percent
worldwide.
U.S. investors have been quite
forthright about their reasons for
operating in South Africa. For exam
ple, IBM states that "IBM is in South
Africa because it makes good busi
ness sense. IBM South Africa is pro
fitable and has a potential for future
growth."
For nearly a decade American firms
have been under fire for putting pro
fits before people in their South Afri
can subsidiaries. This pressure for
workplace reform has produced very
little. A Wall Street journal article last
March evaluating the equal oppor
tunity performance of U.S. com
panies in South Africa cites "a pat
tern of uneven efforts and sporadic
accomplishments in ending job
bias."
