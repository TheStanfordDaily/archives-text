# Cousins calls for disarmament
## 
### Cheryl Eschbach 
Norman Cousins, editor and
publisher of Saturday Review
magazine, advocated total nuc
lear disarmament and a more
powerful and representative
United Nations in a San Fran
cisco speech Friday night.
Addressing a capacity crowd
of 400 at the First Unitarian
Church, Cousins characterized
the citizens of the United
States and the Soviet Union as
"hostages on a plane" hijacked
by their governments in the
scramble for nuclear superior
ity.
Cousins discussed the
reasons and future prospects
for a global predicament which
is the "ultimate in insanity,"
where the destructive force ac
cumulated by the U.S. and
U.S.S.R. averages to 30,000

pounds for every man, women
and child in the world. This
"balance of terror" situation is
due to our bilateral world view
and the dominant political
ideal of absolute national
sovereignty, he said.
The sense of "utter
helplessness" resulting from
bilateralism and national
sovereignty has also prevented
the U.S. from addressing fun
damental political and
philosophical issues, Cousins
said, such as world hunger and
the need for international jus
tice and order.
Bilateralism causes each na
tion to view world peace "in
terms of deployment of power
rather than control of power,"
Cousins explained. It involves
each side in the "mirror im
ages" game, exemplified by

their obsession to match milit
ary expenditures rather than
reduce them.
Absolute national
sovereignty — far from ennobl
ing life — will only be a "suici
dal sovereignty," he stated.
This underscores the impera
tive for upgrading our interna
tional institutional framework,
added Cousins.
Cousins has been a U.S. de
legate to the 11 U.S.
Dartmouth Conferences bet
ween leading Soviet and
American private citizens since
their inception in 1960.
Designed to supplement
government diplomacy — "so
the diplomats won't have to
start at ground zero" — these
conferences indicate that
"there is a higher plateau" for
Soviet-American relations than

bilateralism, Cousins stated.
Cousins said that last sum
mer's conference held at Jur
mula, Latvia eased the tension
caused by Carter's human
rights campaign. There the
Soviet representatives
explained that publicizing
human rights only made the
Kremlin more intransigent, ac
cording to Cousins.
Cousins said we need to "build
the floor over the quicksand"
of national sovereignty.
He denounced the "lifeboat
ethics" position that the threat
of overpopulation gives the
U.S. the right to ignore the
poverty of other countries. The
idea that circumstances lock us
to an inescapable future is one
which "Thomas Jefferson
would not understand nor be
able to accept," Cousins said.
