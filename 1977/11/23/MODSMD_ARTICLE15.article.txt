# Once upon a time in Mechanical Engineering 101...
## 
### Paulette Truman 
If you had been in room 556 of Ter
man Engineering Building Monday be
tween 1 and 5 p.m., you might have
thought you had accidentally stum
bled upon a grade school class during
show and tell. Scenes depicting a ferris
wheel, a tunnel of love, a saloon from
the Old West and a fraternity party
might have deceived you into believ
ing that you were right in the middle of
a Hollywood set. In actuality, this was
all part of a visual thinking project for
Mechanical Engineering 101.
The project was entitled "101 in
Wonderland" and required the stu
dents to design and build a moving
three dimensional fairy tale to be
"told" in one minute. Students used
mechanical energy systems such as fal
ling weights, pendulums and sand
clocks to trigger their stories. No elec
tricity was allowed and the cost of each
scene could not exceed more than $10
in materials. Each of the five students
in a group was responsible for design
ing one scene of the tale.
Most of the projects had their share
of kinks and false starts. In one scene
of mechanical engineering student
Pam Eibeck's group "the rabbit
wouldn't go till Pete (another student
in the group) pushed it," she said. "I
hate to admit that it did give me satis
faction to realize that everybody else
had as many problems in getting their
projects to work as I did," Eibeck said.

"We have found that students doing
their first design projects typically
overextend themselves and will am
bitiously attempt to build things that
exceed their available skills and time,"
said Professor Larry Leifer, an instruc
tor for the course.
"I think it was mainly luck. I reached
the point that I really believed that if
you squinted your eyes, held your
breath, crossed your fingers, and
grunted, your project would work,"
Eibeck said.
One humorous project followed the
escapades of the cartoon characters
Roadrunner and the coyote. After
being pursued by the coyote from
Mexico, the Roadrunner comes to the
Big Came at Stanford. The Roadrunner
parachutes down from a KZSU obser
vation deck at the Stanford stadium.
As he lands in Stanford's end zone the
score board changes and lights up.
The coyote fires a canon which
backfires. A sign pops up out of the
field saying "That's all folks!"
"The goals of the course are to put
the individual in touch with his or her
imagination and creativity. The princi
ple mechanism for teaching these
skills is through two-dimensional
drawing and three-dimensional object
building," said Leifer.
Mechanical Engineering 101 was a
course invented around 1962 by Pro
fessor Robert McKim in order to de
velop students' visual thinking.

"That kind of creativeness is valu
able in every field," said McKim. "Ein
stein thought primarily in images of
visual and muscle imagery and only
after he had developed his thinking in
this form of imagery and was able to
reproduce at will, did he transfer it
into the verbal and mathematical lan
guages of science."
The students recorded their images
by sketching the story plans before ac
tually constructing their project.
"The project itself is of secondary
interest to us. Our primary interest is
the idea log — we want to see a lot of
drawing, we want to see flexibility in
their approach to solve the problem,
and we want to see evidence of an
uninhibited flow of their imagina
tion," said Leifer.
Students were graded based on the
design process and idea log, the in
genuity of the production, mechanical
execution, reliability, drama, humor,
elegance, and timing.
"We have freshmen and doctoral
candiates in the same class. We have
people majoring in physics, creative
writing, biology, and all areas of en
gineering in this class," Leifer said.
When the course first started in the
'60s, there were about six people in it,
according to Leifer. Now the 3-unit
course must allow no more than 120
people in it during one quarter. "Ab
out 50 or 60 people are turned away
now," Leifer said.

in a group was responsible for design
ing one scene of the tale.
Most of the projects had their share
of kinks and false starts. In one scene
of mechanical engineering student
Pam Eibeck's group "the rabbit
wouldn't go till Pete (another student
in the group) pushed it," she said. "I
hate to admit that it did give me satis
faction to realize that everybody else
had as many problems in getting their
projects to work as I did," Eibeck said.

"We have found that students doing
their first design projects typically
overextend themselves and will am
bitiously attempt to build things that
exceed their available skills and time,"
said Professor Larry Leifer, an instruc
tor for the course.
"I think it was mainly luck. I reached
the point that I really believed that if
you squinted your eyes, held your
breath, crossed your fingers, and
grunted, your project would work,"
Eibeck said.
One humorous project followed the
escapades of the cartoon characters
Roadrunner and the coyote. After
being pursued by the coyote from
Mexico, the Roadrunner comes to the
Big Came at Stanford. The Roadrunner
parachutes down from a KZSU obser
vation deck at the Stanford stadium.
As he lands in Stanford's end zone the
score board changes and lights up.
The coyote fires a canon which
backfires. A sign pops up out of the
field saying "That's all folks!"
"The goals of the course are to put
the individual in touch with his or her
imagination and creativity. The princi
ple mechanism for teaching these
skills is through two-dimensional
drawing and three-dimensional object
building," said Leifer.
Mechanical Engineering 101 was a
course invented around 1962 by Pro
fessor Robert McKim in order to de
velop students' visual thinking.

"That kind of creativeness is valu
able in every field," said McKim. "Ein
stein thought primarily in images of
visual and muscle imagery and only
after he had developed his thinking in
this form of imagery and was able to
reproduce at will, did he transfer it
into the verbal and mathematical lan
guages of science."
The students recorded their images
by sketching the story plans before ac
tually constructing their project.
"The project itself is of secondary
interest to us. Our primary interest is
the idea log — we want to see a lot of
drawing, we want to see flexibility in
their approach to solve the problem,
and we want to see evidence of an
uninhibited flow of their imagina
tion," said Leifer.
Students were graded based on the
design process and idea log, the in
genuity of the production, mechanical
execution, reliability, drama, humor,
elegance, and timing.
"We have freshmen and doctoral
candiates in the same class. We have
people majoring in physics, creative
writing, biology, and all areas of en
gineering in this class," Leifer said.
When the course first started in the
'60s, there were about six people in it,
according to Leifer. Now the 3-unit
course must allow no more than 120
people in it during one quarter. "Ab
out 50 or 60 people are turned away
now," Leifer said.

Junior Pam Eibetk, a mechanical engineering major, watches as the tortoise and the hare exit from their
ferris wheel down a chute in one of Monday's "ME 101 in Wonderland" presentations.
If you had been in room 556 of Ter
man Engineering Building Monday be
tween 1 and 5 p.m., you might have
thought you had accidentally stum
bled upon a grade school class during
show and tell. Scenes depicting a ferris
wheel, a tunnel of love, a saloon from
the Old West and a fraternity party
might have deceived you into believ
ing that you were right in the middle of
a Hollywood set. In actuality, this was
all part of a visual thinking project for
Mechanical Engineering 101.
The project was entitled "101 in
Wonderland" and required the stu
dents to design and build a moving
three dimensional fairy tale to be
"told" in one minute. Students used
mechanical energy systems such as fal
ling weights, pendulums and sand
clocks to trigger their stories. No elec
tricity was allowed and the cost of each
scene could not exceed more than $10
in materials. Each of the five students
in a group was responsible for design
ing one scene of the tale.
Most of the projects had their share
of kinks and false starts. In one scene
of mechanical engineering student
Pam Eibeck's group "the rabbit
