# Inflation creates public pension 'timebomb'
## 
### Associated Press 
California taxpayers are $24
billion in debt for pensions
promised to their teachers,
policemen and other public
employees.
It's a debt that affects every
Californian — either as a tax
payer or one of the 1.5 million
participants and benefactors.
The state's public pension
funds have obligations of $36
billion and assests of only $12
billion.
This year, California tax
payers will pour about $2 bill
ion into 170 public employee
retirement funds at every level
of government, a cost spread
over several taxes of $364 a year

for the average California fam
ily of four.
Day-to-day
Almost 350,000 retired public
workers currently count on
those funds for their day-to
day support. About 1.2 million
other public employees are
earning retirement credits
daily in funds which already
have promised $24 billion
more in benefits than they
have the current assets to pay.
And taxpayers face bigger
and bigger annual bills to help
meet those obligations.
For example, unless major
changes are made in the
teachers' fund, the state's
second-biggest pension plan,

the per capita cost to taxpayers
for public pensions in Califor
nia could triple by the 1990s to
$1100 in taxes annually for a
family of four. Debts in local
funds could push that total
higher.
Pensions minimal
Still, despite the huge bur
den on taxpayers, most public
pensions are not lavish.
Wilfred and Martha Abbott
of Banning, for example, re
ceive pensions totaling $8965
annually for a combined total
of 52 years teaching in Los
Angeles-area schools. Both
work part time to bring family
income up to $14,000 annually,
a figure just below the average

household income in Califor
nia.
Abbott, 68, says he often
asks himself what will happen
if the day comes that he can no
longer work. But the Abbotts
are well off compared to most
retirees.
A psychiatic technician who
worked more than 24 years at
Camarillo State Hospital has a
$271 monthy pension. A claims
referee who worked 21 Vi years
for the state's employment de
partment gets a $320 monthly
pension.
A teacher who retired in 1957
after 42 years in Los Angeles
elementary schools is living on
a $320 monthly pension.
Tough choices
"I visted one retired teacher
who told me she turned the
lights off early at night because
she had to cut her electricity
bill. But then she worried
about burglars. What a horri
ble choice to make," said Ruth
Blackman, president of the Los
Angeles chapter of the Retired
Teachers Association of
California.
"We have thousands of re
tirees receiving only $300 to
$400amonth pensionsfor3oor
40 years' service," said Rich
Martin of the California State
Employees Association.
The reasons that pension
costs have skyrocketed despite
generally modest individual

benefits are easy to identify —
inflation, poor planning, ear
lier retirements and longer life
expectancies.
Court ruling
And pension costs will grow
in future years because courts
have ruled that pensions, once
granted, are enforceable debts
which employees may collect
from government.
That means the pension
crisis is hard to reverse, and the
cure will be painful.
Experts say one-third of each
tax dollar spent this year on
pensions is paying for what

state Finance Director Roy Bell
describes as "the neglect, de
liberate avoidances or non
recognition of costs ... of the
last two or three generations."
The biggest problem facing
both pensioners and pension
fund managers is inflation.
Most plans base retirement
benefits on the highest annual
salary or the average of the
highest three years.
Inflation
That means employees retir
ing in recent years with
inflation-swollen salaries have
qualified for bigger pensions

than the funds anticipate.
At the same time, many
employees who retired with
adequate pensions have been
pushed below the poverty
level within a fewyears by infla
tion because most public pen
sion plans limit annual cost-of
living increases to 2 percent.
That means that a 5 percent
inflation rate and a 2 percent
cap on cost-of-living raises re
duces a pension that initially
equaled 60 percent of salary to
45.9 percent in uninflated dol
larss after 10 years, and to 33.6
percent after 20 years.

benefits on the highest annual
salary or the average of the
highest three years.
Inflation
That means employees retir
ing in recent years with
inflation-swollen salaries have
qualified for bigger pensions

than the funds anticipate.
At the same time, many
employees who retired with
adequate pensions have been
pushed below the poverty
level within a fewyears by infla
tion because most public pen
sion plans limit annual cost-of
living increases to 2 percent.
That means that a 5 percent
inflation rate and a 2 percent
cap on cost-of-living raises re
duces a pension that initially
equaled 60 percent of salary to
45.9 percent in uninflated dol
larss after 10 years, and to 33.6
percent after 20 years.
California taxpayers are $24
billion in debt for pensions
promised to their teachers,
policemen and other public
employees.
It's a debt that affects every
Californian — either as a tax
payer or one of the 1.5 million
participants and benefactors.
The state's public pension
funds have obligations of $36
billion and assests of only $12
billion.
This year, California tax
payers will pour about $2 bill
ion into 170 public employee
retirement funds at every level
of government, a cost spread
over several taxes of $364 a year

for the average California fam
ily of four.
Day-to-day
Almost 350,000 retired public
workers currently count on
those funds for their day-to
day support. About 1.2 million
other public employees are
earning retirement credits
daily in funds which already
have promised $24 billion
more in benefits than they
have the current assets to pay.
And taxpayers face bigger
and bigger annual bills to help
meet those obligations.
For example, unless major
changes are made in the
teachers' fund, the state's
second-biggest pension plan,

the per capita cost to taxpayers
for public pensions in Califor
nia could triple by the 1990s to
$1100 in taxes annually for a
family of four. Debts in local
funds could push that total
higher.
Pensions minimal
Still, despite the huge bur
den on taxpayers, most public
pensions are not lavish.
Wilfred and Martha Abbott
of Banning, for example, re
ceive pensions totaling $8965
annually for a combined total
of 52 years teaching in Los
Angeles-area schools. Both
work part time to bring family
income up to $14,000 annually,
a figure just below the average

household income in Califor
nia.
Abbott, 68, says he often
asks himself what will happen
if the day comes that he can no
longer work. But the Abbotts
are well off compared to most
retirees.
A psychiatic technician who
worked more than 24 years at
Camarillo State Hospital has a
$271 monthy pension. A claims
referee who worked 21 Vi years
for the state's employment de
partment gets a $320 monthly
pension.
A teacher who retired in 1957
after 42 years in Los Angeles
elementary schools is living on
a $320 monthly pension.
Tough choices
"I visted one retired teacher
who told me she turned the
lights off early at night because
she had to cut her electricity
bill. But then she worried
about burglars. What a horri
ble choice to make," said Ruth
Blackman, president of the Los
Angeles chapter of the Retired
Teachers Association of
California.
"We have thousands of re
tirees receiving only $300 to
$400amonth pensionsfor3oor
40 years' service," said Rich
Martin of the California State
Employees Association.
The reasons that pension
costs have skyrocketed despite
generally modest individual

benefits are easy to identify —
inflation, poor planning, ear
lier retirements and longer life
expectancies.
Court ruling
And pension costs will grow
in future years because courts
have ruled that pensions, once
granted, are enforceable debts
which employees may collect
from government.
That means the pension
crisis is hard to reverse, and the
cure will be painful.
Experts say one-third of each
tax dollar spent this year on
pensions is paying for what

state Finance Director Roy Bell
describes as "the neglect, de
liberate avoidances or non
recognition of costs ... of the
last two or three generations."
The biggest problem facing
both pensioners and pension
fund managers is inflation.

costs have skyrocketed despite
generally modest individual

benefits are easy to identify —
inflation, poor planning, ear
lier retirements and longer life
expectancies.
Court ruling
And pension costs will grow
in future years because courts
have ruled that pensions, once
granted, are enforceable debts
which employees may collect
from government.
That means the pension
crisis is hard to reverse, and the
cure will be painful.
Experts say one-third of each
tax dollar spent this year on
pensions is paying for what

state Finance Director Roy Bell
describes as "the neglect, de
liberate avoidances or non
recognition of costs ... of the
last two or three generations."
The biggest problem facing
both pensioners and pension
fund managers is inflation.
Most plans base retirement
benefits on the highest annual
salary or the average of the
highest three years.
Inflation
That means employees retir
ing in recent years with
inflation-swollen salaries have
qualified for bigger pensions

than the funds anticipate.
At the same time, many
employees who retired with
adequate pensions have been
pushed below the poverty
level within a fewyears by infla
tion because most public pen
sion plans limit annual cost-of
living increases to 2 percent.
That means that a 5 percent
inflation rate and a 2 percent
cap on cost-of-living raises re
duces a pension that initially
equaled 60 percent of salary to
45.9 percent in uninflated dol
larss after 10 years, and to 33.6
percent after 20 years.
