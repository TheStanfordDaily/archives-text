# Few in California
## Multi-pensioners get big bucks 
### 
(AP) — Double dipping. The
name sound like something
you do to an ice cream cone,
but actually it applies to pen
sions and gives a very few re
tired workers double or triple
funds.
The derisively-labeled
double-dippers collect sepa
rate pensions from two or
morepublicpension plans, but
in most cases, they still retire
on a lower income than they
earned in their working years.
Multiple pensions are most
common among retirees of the
California National Guard who
also held other government
jobs, among judges and other
elected officials who also had
other government jobs and
peace officers who landed jobs
after early retirement.
Rich Martin of the California
State Employees Association

says stories of the generous
legislative and judges' pension
plans and employees collect
ing two or more pensions
create misconceptions in the
public mind about state pen
sions.
"The legislators and the
judges have their own system,
and they come up smelling like
roses after a minimal amount
of time, and people say, 'Hey,
look at what those public
employees are getting.' Well,
that's not what the rank and file
get," Martin said.
Nobody has an exact count
on the double-dippers. But
they are only a small fraction of
the retired population, be
cause relatively few people
work in those fields that qualify
for multiple pensions.
Well-feathered pension
The most publicized case of
multiple pensions in California
is that of Evelle Younger, who
now earns $42,500 a year as at
torney general and a $530
monthly pension from Los
Angeles County for his six
years' service as district attor

ney.
Next year, when Younger
turns 60, he will be eligible for
an additional pension of $850
monthly as a retired major
general in the U.S. Air Force
Reserve.
When he turns 65 in 1983,
Younger will be eligible for an
additional $1638.88 pension for
the Judges' Retirement System
for his 12 years as Municipal
and Superior Court judge in
Los Angeles County.
And if he fails in his bid to be
elected governor next year,
Younger will collect another
$1416.67 monthly beginning in
1979 from the legislators' and
constitutional officers' pen
sion fund.
All combined, that's a pen
sion of $53,266 annually —
more than any of Younger's
jobs paid.
A Younger aide, Jerry
Liftman, said each pension was
earned under rules that apply
to all public employees, and
that Younger's military pen
sion is based on service dating
back through World War 11.

The most publicized case of
multiple pensions in California
is that of Evelle Younger, who
now earns $42,500 a year as at
torney general and a $530
monthly pension from Los
Angeles County for his six
years' service as district attor

ney.
Next year, when Younger
turns 60, he will be eligible for
an additional pension of $850
monthly as a retired major
general in the U.S. Air Force
Reserve.
When he turns 65 in 1983,
Younger will be eligible for an
additional $1638.88 pension for
the Judges' Retirement System
for his 12 years as Municipal
and Superior Court judge in
Los Angeles County.
And if he fails in his bid to be
elected governor next year,
Younger will collect another
$1416.67 monthly beginning in
1979 from the legislators' and
constitutional officers' pen
sion fund.
All combined, that's a pen
sion of $53,266 annually —
more than any of Younger's
jobs paid.
A Younger aide, Jerry
Liftman, said each pension was
earned under rules that apply
to all public employees, and
that Younger's military pen
sion is based on service dating
back through World War 11.
(AP) — Double dipping. The
name sound like something
you do to an ice cream cone,
but actually it applies to pen
sions and gives a very few re
tired workers double or triple
funds.
The derisively-labeled
double-dippers collect sepa
rate pensions from two or
morepublicpension plans, but
in most cases, they still retire
on a lower income than they
earned in their working years.
Multiple pensions are most
common among retirees of the
California National Guard who
also held other government
jobs, among judges and other
elected officials who also had
other government jobs and
peace officers who landed jobs
after early retirement.
Rich Martin of the California
State Employees Association

says stories of the generous
legislative and judges' pension
plans and employees collect
ing two or more pensions
create misconceptions in the
public mind about state pen
sions.
"The legislators and the
judges have their own system,
and they come up smelling like
roses after a minimal amount
of time, and people say, 'Hey,
look at what those public
employees are getting.' Well,
that's not what the rank and file
get," Martin said.
Nobody has an exact count
on the double-dippers. But
they are only a small fraction of
the retired population, be
cause relatively few people
work in those fields that qualify
for multiple pensions.
