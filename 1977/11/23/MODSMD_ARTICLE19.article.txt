# DiBiaso's cagers commence chapter three
## Card hoopsters begin season with 2 home games

It has been four years since Stanford finished
a basketball season with a winning record.
This season, though, that streak may end.
Third-year Cardinal coach Dick Dißiaso has 10
lettermen returning, including eight players
who have started at one time or another during
the last seasons.
To what degree are the Cards improved,
though? A partial answer should be provided in
the Cards' season opener this weekend. Friday
night Stanford hosts Cal Poly-Pomona and
Saturday San Jose State visits Maples Pavilion.
Both games start at 8 p.m.
The two games begin a string of eight noncon
ference games and a Christmas tournament that
will take the Cards into the Pacific-8 regular sea
son in lanuary. The nonconference slate is "a
very aggressive one," said Dißiaso. "It'll tell us
how much depth we have. During December
we'll see just who we are."
One gone
With one exception, Dißiaso will have back
the starting lineup he went with for most of the
Pac-8 schedule last season. That one exception
is guard Mike Bratz, the team's leading scorer
who now plies the hardwood of the NBA for the
Phoenix Suns.
The other four — junior guard Wolfe Perry,
senior center Jeff McHugh, and sophomore
forwards Kimberly Belton and Tom Schmalzried
— will get a whole lot of help from two key
players coming off injuries.
Before 6-foot-5 swingman Jay Carter injured
his ankle in the Pac-8 opener last season, the
Cards were 7-3. But when Carter was sidelined,
the Cards' big skid to an 11-16 record began.
Carter is back for his fourth season, and he will
start at forward Friday although he is still not at
full strength following a car accident several
weeks ago.
Co-captain along with Carter this season is
George Schader. Two seasons ago, the junior

college transfer averaged 13.1 point* and 7.1
rebounds per game for the Cards. Then before
the opening of last season, the rugged forward
was sidelined by a knee injury that kept him out
the whole season.
More trouble
While recovering from the first knee injury,
Schader injured his other knee. Then over the
summer he suffered a deep cut in his foot from
some glass, and he is just now getting back into
condition.
"If he's healthy, George is one of the premier
players on the West Coast," Dißiaso said. "He's
not 100 per cent yet, but he continues to im
prove daily."
When Schader is finally teamed with Belton in
the front court, Stanford will have a tandem of
powerful forwards. The 6-foot-6'/2 Belton mus
cles his way to an average of 8.4 rebounds and
12.5 points per game last season, the best
freshman figures in the conference.
Freshman help
The 6-toot-2 Perry and his 11.4 scoring average
will be joined in the backcourt by 6-foot-1 junior
Paul Giovacchini. Freshman Mark Pitchford, a
two time All-Washington D.C. performer who
averaged 19.9 points a game his senior year,
should also see a lot of playing time at guard.
Another freshman who could contribute im
mediately to the Cards' cause is 6-foot-7 forward
Jeff Ryan, a two-time All-Chicago performer
who averaged 19 points and 11 rebounds per
game last season.
Theadded strength in thecornersshould help
out the 6-foot-9 McHugh who often ran up
against outstanding pivotmen last season.
"For the first time, we'll have the depth neces
sary to be competitive in the Pacific-8," said
Dißiaso. "We should be able to go eight or nine
deep this year without a real dropoff in quality."
Dißiaso is looking for the improved depth to
help in stopping opponents. "I'm hoping we'll
play defense much better," he said, "along with
fast-breaking more."
