# Lyman defends Med School; speaks on divestment moves

### Kurt Cobb 
Piesident Richard Lyman defended the University
Medical Center on KZSU's Campus Conference last
night. He said the recent controversies over the use of
that facility by community physicians is an outgrowth of
differing interpretations of the agreements reached in
the mid 60s between those physicians and the Medical
Center.
Lyman said that, as most agreements are, this one was
subject to "interpretation and reinterpretation" which
has resulted in much disagreement as to "what our obli
gations are to the community."
Lyman added that the problems result from the fact
that "people with different interests run into each other.
I don't think you're seeing a case of maladministration.
You're seeing a not very surprising case of friction"
between regular practicing physicians and teaching
ones.
Responding to recent criticism about the Med Cent
er's billing practices, Lyman said, "It's just about impos
sible to imagine how you could run a medical school. . .
with very advanced specialized care going on and not
have physicians billing for that care."
Not in violation
"We don't believe we're in violation and nobody has
really authoritatively told usthatweare. I think if the law
were to be construed as forbidding us to do what we do,
we would just have to seek changes in the law. Other
wise the Medical School could hardly operate."
Lyman explained that the failure of the Medical School
to receive the full two-year accreditation last spring was
due to empty chairmanships in some academic depart
ments.
Lyman also discussed recent moves by the Oregon
public university system, the University of Mas
sachusetts and Hampshire College to divest themselves
of investments in South Africa.
"It's perfectly clear that we're not dealing with the
kind of situation we would have at Stanford if we were to
divest ourselves of 125 to 140 million dollars worth of
stocks in an endowment that plays a much bigger role in
our total financial picture than those invested funds play
in the financial pictures of these other institutions,"
Lyman said.
He noted that political pressures had been involved in

the two cases where public institutions had divested. He
said he expected to see more public universities, espe
cially those not heavily dependent on endowments, to
follow the same pattern because they may think it is
"politically advantageous."
He added that private educational institutions do not
have "to yield to political pressures of that kind. I think if
we view it in general and overall terms and not in terms
of South Africa you would be hard-pressed not to see
that as an advantage. I certainly don't think it's an advan
tage to have our endowment subject to a series of politi
cal pressures."
Lyman said he felt an analogy concerning investment
policy could not be drawn between Stanford and other
universities and thus he felt divestment by these other
schools would have little impact on the Board of Trus
tees' decision about divestment here.
He said that the Committee on Investment Responsi
bility formed by the Trustees has recommended forma
tion of a permanent committee to deal with divestment
and other financial issues.
"Once that mechanism gets set up it can address
specific questions like South Africa, but we're a bit of a
distance, weeks, a few months, from being in a position
to do that," Lyman commented.
Advising system
Lyman said a recent survey undertaken by the Univer
sity has revealed great student dissatisfaction here with
the current advising system. He said there is a problem
of "recruitment and motivation" of advisors.
Lyman explained, "We are often toid that the reward
system has to be changed so that advising plays a more
meaningful part. That's hard to work out. It's hard to give
people organized Brownie points for doing a good job of
advising, but we've got to come closer to that than we
have in the past. Maybe more searching questions on
promotion and salary forms about the individual faculty
member's contributions to the advising program would
be a helpful step."
Lyman also said, "I have every reason to hope and
even I daresay believe that they (the Board of Trustees)
will vote on the issue of sororities in December.
In reference to budget cuts in the Overseas Studies
budget, Lyman called the cuts "essential" but not "crip
pling." He added, "If not there it would have had to have
come from someplace equally painful."
