# Stanford opens NCAAs against Brown
## Water polo team defends crown 
### Brad Brockbank 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
water polo team faces host
Brown University Saturday in
the first round of the NCAA
Championships in Providence,
R.I.
Brown boasts a 20-4 record,
but Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said he does not ex
pect any problems.
"It shouldn't be too difficult
to win," he said. "We're going
to approach the game in the
same way we approached the
game against San Jose State.
The Eastern teams are improv
ing, though. It should be a
pretty good game."
Since the first NCAA champ
ionships in 1969, no Eastern
team has ever beaten a Califor
nia team in the tournament.
Should Stanford defeat
Brown, the Cards will face the

winner of the game between
UC-lrvine and the University of
Arizona. Dettamanti said he
expects the Anteaters to pre
vail in that game. If so, Irvine
and Stanford will battle in a
Saturday evening game to de
termine who will enter the final
round.
"Irvine has given us the most
trouble in the past," said De
ttamanti. "They match up well
with our team and we know
what to expect from them."
In the other bracket,

California will play Bucknell of
Pennsylvania in the first round
and Pepperdine will face
Loyola of Chicago. The win
ners of those two games will
face off to determine who will
enter the championship
round.
Though Dettamanti said that
Cal and Pepperdine would
probably be the semi-finalists,
he was uncertain as to the out
come of the matchup between
the two.
"Pepperdine is an unor
thodox team, they're hard to

figure out," he explained. "Cal
might have trouble with
them."
If the past is any indication,
Dettamanti may be right. In
previous games, Pepperdine
has been edged out by both
Cal and Stanford by a single
goal.
Conceivably, the champion
ship match could be between
the Bears and the Cardinals.
Stanford has won two out of
the three matchups between
the teams this year.

First-year Stanford water polo coach Dante Dettamanti instructs the Cardinals in their 11-8 victory over
California last Saturday. Stanford travels to Brown University in Providence, R. 1., this weekend to aefend
the NCAA water polo crown. The Cardinals meet Brown in their opening name Saturday.
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
water polo team faces host
Brown University Saturday in
the first round of the NCAA
Championships in Providence,
R.I.
Brown boasts a 20-4 record,
but Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti said he does not ex
pect any problems.
"It shouldn't be too difficult
to win," he said. "We're going
to approach the game in the
same way we approached the
game against San Jose State.
The Eastern teams are improv
ing, though. It should be a
pretty good game."
Since the first NCAA champ
ionships in 1969, no Eastern
team has ever beaten a Califor
nia team in the tournament.
Should Stanford defeat
Brown, the Cards will face the

winner of the game between
UC-lrvine and the University of
Arizona. Dettamanti said he
expects the Anteaters to pre
vail in that game. If so, Irvine
and Stanford will battle in a
Saturday evening game to de
termine who will enter the final
round.
"Irvine has given us the most
trouble in the past," said De
ttamanti. "They match up well
with our team and we know
what to expect from them."
In the other bracket,

California will play Bucknell of
Pennsylvania in the first round
and Pepperdine will face
Loyola of Chicago. The win
ners of those two games will
face off to determine who will
enter the championship
round.
Though Dettamanti said that
Cal and Pepperdine would
probably be the semi-finalists,
he was uncertain as to the out
come of the matchup between
the two.
"Pepperdine is an unor
thodox team, they're hard to

figure out," he explained. "Cal
might have trouble with
them."
If the past is any indication,
Dettamanti may be right. In
previous games, Pepperdine
has been edged out by both
Cal and Stanford by a single
goal.
Conceivably, the champion
ship match could be between
the Bears and the Cardinals.
Stanford has won two out of
the three matchups between
the teams this year.
