IM wrestling
There was such an over
whelming feeling of
camaraderie. Wrestlers on the
sidelines were yelling words of
encouragement to those en

the mat were not only intent on

winning, but also on playing
fairly. And excitement was vi
brating throughout Encina
Gym.
Last Wednesday night the I M

Ten weight classes divided the
61 competitors in the competi
tion.
lohn DeWilbiss and Terry

pounds and 177 pounds re
spectively, for their team, the
Armadillos. For the Law
School, Steve Williams (142)
and Cabot Christianson (158)
placed first in their divisions.
With these four wins, the Law
School and the Armadillos be
came co-championship teams
for the 1977 wrestling meet.
