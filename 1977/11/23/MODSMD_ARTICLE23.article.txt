# Benjamin gets A-A honors; Ceresino on second team
## 
### 
Quarterback Guy Benjamin
made the first of what is ex
pected to be many All-
American teams when Football
News selected the Stanford
senior to head its Ail-American
offensive unit.
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino made the
Football News second team.
Benjamin finished the sea
son with a number of impres
sive statistical accomplish
ments which justify his selec
tion to the year's first post
season All-America team.
The 6-foot-4, 202-pound
quarterback established a
Pacific-8 career completion
percentage mark by connect
ing on .604 per cent of his pas
ses in four years on the Farm.
He also set a new school mark
by completing .630 per cent of
his passes this season.
With 16 completions against
California Saturday, Benjamin
also tied the Pac-8 standard for
season completions of 208 set
last season by WSU's Jack
Thompson.
The Card co-captain is ex
pected to be named to another
pair of All-America teams
which will be announced
shortly. By season's end Ben

jamin should join past Stanford
greats Frankie Albert, John
Brodie and Jim Plunkett as con
sensus All-America quarter
backs.
Ceresino, who said yester
day he feels fine after suffering
a mild concussion in Saturday's
game with Cal, led the Cards in
tackles this year with a school
record 174. The 6-foot-2, 219-
pound junior was named sec
ond team All-Coast last season
in his first year as a starter.
James Lofton, the Pac-B's
leading receiver with 53 recep
tions for 931 yards and 12 TDs,

was not selected to the Foot
ball News teams. The confer
ence was represented on the
team, however, as USC's
Randy Simmrin was named to
the third team.
Simmrin was not ranked
among the Pac-B's top ten re
ceivers but his play drew praise
from Trojan head coach John
Robinson who said before the
USC Stanford game that
"Randy couldn't catch a cold
right now."
Lofton, on the other hand
spent this season setting
school marks for touchdowns
and touchdown receptions
with 12.
Kellar, Lofton, Ceresino,
Benjamin and the rest of the
Cards are scheduled to begin
practice again Dec. 17 in prep
aration for the Dec. 31 Sun
Bowl in El Paso, Texas.
The Cards will practice
through Dec. 22, take three
days off for Christmas, return
to Stanford for two days of
practice, then leave for El Paso
Dec. 28.
The Sun Bowl will be nation
ally televised on CBS at 10:30
a.m. (PST) on New Year's Eve
Day.

Quarterback Guy Benjamin
made the first of what is ex
pected to be many All-
American teams when Football
News selected the Stanford
senior to head its Ail-American
offensive unit.
Stanford middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino made the
Football News second team.
Benjamin finished the sea
son with a number of impres
sive statistical accomplish
ments which justify his selec
tion to the year's first post
season All-America team.
The 6-foot-4, 202-pound
quarterback established a
Pacific-8 career completion
percentage mark by connect
ing on .604 per cent of his pas
ses in four years on the Farm.
He also set a new school mark
by completing .630 per cent of
his passes this season.
With 16 completions against
California Saturday, Benjamin
also tied the Pac-8 standard for
season completions of 208 set
last season by WSU's Jack
Thompson.
The Card co-captain is ex
pected to be named to another
pair of All-America teams
which will be announced
shortly. By season's end Ben

jamin should join past Stanford
greats Frankie Albert, John
Brodie and Jim Plunkett as con
sensus All-America quarter
backs.
Ceresino, who said yester
day he feels fine after suffering
a mild concussion in Saturday's
game with Cal, led the Cards in
tackles this year with a school
record 174. The 6-foot-2, 219-
pound junior was named sec
ond team All-Coast last season
in his first year as a starter.
James Lofton, the Pac-B's
leading receiver with 53 recep
tions for 931 yards and 12 TDs,

was not selected to the Foot
ball News teams. The confer
ence was represented on the
team, however, as USC's
Randy Simmrin was named to
the third team.
Simmrin was not ranked
among the Pac-B's top ten re
ceivers but his play drew praise
from Trojan head coach John
Robinson who said before the
USC Stanford game that
"Randy couldn't catch a cold
right now."
Lofton, on the other hand
spent this season setting
school marks for touchdowns
and touchdown receptions
with 12.
Kellar, Lofton, Ceresino,
Benjamin and the rest of the
Cards are scheduled to begin
practice again Dec. 17 in prep
aration for the Dec. 31 Sun
Bowl in El Paso, Texas.
The Cards will practice
through Dec. 22, take three
days off for Christmas, return
to Stanford for two days of
practice, then leave for El Paso
Dec. 28.
