Stanford's women's volleyball team
came back from a 14-5 deficit in the final
game of last night's playoff match with
Nor-Cal Conference co-champion San
Jose State to win the five-game set
11-15, 15-5, 15-12, 10-15, 16-14 and ad
vance to the AIAW regionals Friday and
Saturday at Long Beach State.
The dramatic comeback left the
shell-shocked Spartans speechless and
the jubilant Cards jumping up and down
in a group on the Maples Pavilion court.
There was, as Stanford setter Shawn
Hoover said, "no way we could have
made it more exciting."
San lose State played "very very
well," according to Cardinal coach Art
Lambert. "They are a well-coached
team — as good as we've played this
year. I guess it was just our turn this
time."
Indeed it was. Only last Saturday
night in San Jose the Cards were beaten
in five games by the Spartans. Stanford
defeated San Jose State earlier in the
season in a four-game match.
In the first game of the match, Stan
ford played listlessly en route to an
11-15 loss. Four missed serves hurt the
Cards as San Jose State showed the
consistency that aided the Spartans
throughout the match.
Stanford came out in the second
game with Jane Bassett replacing Sherry
Norman who Lambert said was having
"an off game. She's (Norman) a tre
mendous player," Lambert said, "but
we put Jane in and she did a tremend
ous job. It takes a lot of guts to come in
like she did and do the job she did."
"I wasn't expecting to play that much
at all but I was really ready for it," Bas
sett said after the victory.
The Cards' inspired play carried them
to their 15-5 second game win and sus
tained them through the third game
when spikes by Cindy Whitaker and
Sandy Harris closed the contest with
Stanford ahead 15-12.
San Jose State led 8-3 in the final
game of the match and the Cards'

chances of making the regional in Long
Beach seemed even dimmer when the
score reached 14-5. The mini-surge the
Cards pulled to reduce the margin to
14-10 served to bring the crowd to its
feet but there still appeared little
chance that Stanford could pull the
game out.
There was "no room for error" as
Shawn Hoover put it as the Cards
worked their way back into the game.
But nine side-outs helped them even
the score at 14-14. Then a Hoover tip
over the net which landed outside the
reach of a diving San Jose State player
and a searing spike by Basset brought
the stunned crowd to its feet as an
equally excited Lambert rushed the
floor to join the team.
"I was pleased with the heart they
(Stanford) showed," said a smiling
Lambert. "I worried about that sort of
thing before but I don't worry about it
anymore.
"The fans were great," Lambert said.
"I've never heard them like this be
fore."
"Tell them from all of us (the team),"
Whitaker added, "that they made such
a difference."
Lambert praised the play of Carol
Meihaus who, Lambert said, "did a
tremendous job in her first time in the
middle (middle blocker position)."
"A great deal of the credit for this
team goes to Fred," Lambert said after
the match of assistant coach Fred
Sturm.
The Cards will face fourth-seeded
UC-Santa Barbara in the first round of
the double-eliminiation regionals at 9
a.m. Friday.
The eight teams in the regional in
order of seeding are: (JSC, UCI A, Pep
perdine, UC-Santa Barbara, Stanford,
San Diego State, Long Beach State and
UC-Davis.
Two teams from the regional will ad
vance to the nationals in Provo, Utah,
Dec. 2-3. Lambert said there is also a
possibility that two more teams may be
selected for nationals from this region.

made it more exciting."
San lose State played "very very
well," according to Cardinal coach Art
Lambert. "They are a well-coached
team — as good as we've played this
year. I guess it was just our turn this
time."
Indeed it was. Only last Saturday
night in San Jose the Cards were beaten
in five games by the Spartans. Stanford
defeated San Jose State earlier in the
season in a four-game match.
In the first game of the match, Stan
ford played listlessly en route to an
11-15 loss. Four missed serves hurt the
Cards as San Jose State showed the
consistency that aided the Spartans
throughout the match.
Stanford came out in the second
game with Jane Bassett replacing Sherry
Norman who Lambert said was having
"an off game. She's (Norman) a tre
mendous player," Lambert said, "but
we put Jane in and she did a tremend
ous job. It takes a lot of guts to come in
like she did and do the job she did."
"I wasn't expecting to play that much
at all but I was really ready for it," Bas
sett said after the victory.
The Cards' inspired play carried them
to their 15-5 second game win and sus
tained them through the third game
when spikes by Cindy Whitaker and
Sandy Harris closed the contest with
Stanford ahead 15-12.
San Jose State led 8-3 in the final
game of the match and the Cards'

chances of making the regional in Long
Beach seemed even dimmer when the
score reached 14-5. The mini-surge the
Cards pulled to reduce the margin to
14-10 served to bring the crowd to its
feet but there still appeared little
chance that Stanford could pull the
game out.
There was "no room for error" as
Shawn Hoover put it as the Cards
worked their way back into the game.
But nine side-outs helped them even
the score at 14-14. Then a Hoover tip
over the net which landed outside the
reach of a diving San Jose State player
and a searing spike by Basset brought
the stunned crowd to its feet as an
equally excited Lambert rushed the
floor to join the team.
"I was pleased with the heart they
(Stanford) showed," said a smiling
Lambert. "I worried about that sort of
thing before but I don't worry about it
anymore.
"The fans were great," Lambert said.
"I've never heard them like this be
fore."
"Tell them from all of us (the team),"
Whitaker added, "that they made such
a difference."
Lambert praised the play of Carol
Meihaus who, Lambert said, "did a
tremendous job in her first time in the
middle (middle blocker position)."
"A great deal of the credit for this
team goes to Fred," Lambert said after
the match of assistant coach Fred
Sturm.
The Cards will face fourth-seeded
UC-Santa Barbara in the first round of
the double-eliminiation regionals at 9
a.m. Friday.
The eight teams in the regional in
order of seeding are: (JSC, UCI A, Pep
perdine, UC-Santa Barbara, Stanford,
San Diego State, Long Beach State and
UC-Davis.
Two teams from the regional will ad
vance to the nationals in Provo, Utah,
Dec. 2-3. Lambert said there is also a
possibility that two more teams may be
selected for nationals from this region.
