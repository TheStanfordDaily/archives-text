Cyclone in India Kills 10,000
New Delhi, India — Indians burned the bodies of
cyclone victims on huge funeral pyres in south
eastern India yesterday as the death toll from the
weekend storm and tidal waves was reported as at
least 10,000.
"Overnight, villages have been turned into bu
rial grounds," siad Khrishna Rao, minister of edu
cation in Andbra Pradesh state which bore the
brunt of the storm.
). Vengal Rao, chief minister of Andbra Pradesh,
said after a helicopter tour of the stricken area that
he saw hundreds of bodies floating in the flood
waters. He said the bodies that could not be iden
tified immediately were being destroyed to pre
vent the spread of disease.
The 10,000 death figure from the storm which for
two days battered a 250-mile stretch of coastline in
Andbra Pradesh was given to reporters at
Hyderabad, the state capital, by P.N. Reddy, state
revenue minister.
Meanwhile, weather stations said another
threatening cyclone approaching the mainland
from the Arabian Sea on the west coast had
weakened to a rain squall.
Workers' real earnings rise
Washington — The government had good holi
day news for Americans yesterday, reporting a
moderate rise in inflation in October and the
biggest monthly gain in workers' buying power
since June.
It said consumer prices increased a moderate
0.3 per cent, the same as in August and Sep
tember. Grocery prices rose only slightly for the
fourth consecutive month.
Workers benefitted from an increase of 1.1 per
cent in the purchasing power of their paychecks in
October, raising the level of their real earnings —
take home pay adjusted for taxes and inflation —
to a level 4.G per cent above that of a year ago.
Prices have increased at a 3.8 per cent annual
rate over the past three months in sharp contrast

with the 10 per cent rate at the beginning of the
year.
The cooling of inflation since midyear is ex
pected to boost consumer confidence in the
economy and make it easier for the Carter Ad
ministration in its battle against unemployment.
FDA requests alcohol warning
Washington — The Food and Drug Administra
tion has asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms to require labels on alcoholic beverages
warning women that heavy drinking during pre
gnancy may cause birth defects in their babies.
In a letter dated Nov. 15 and released Tuesday,
Commissioner Donald Kennedy told bureau di
rector Rex Davis, "Quite frankly, if the FDA re
tained jurisdiction over the labeling of alcoholic
beverages, it would waste no time in commencing
proceedings to require labelling warnings" tor
pregnant women.
"This is a problem not only for women who
habitually abuse alcohol but also for those who
consume alcohol in moderation but might occa
sionally imbibe more than two drinks a day," Ken
nedy said.
A spokesman for Davis, who was out of town
yesterday, said the letter had been received and
turned over to the general counsel's office for
study.
First Concordes land in New York
New York — Supersonic Concordes from Paris
and London zoomed in to )ohn F. Kennedy Inter
national Airport yesterday morning, inaugurating
regular airline service that cuts the flight time ac
ross the Atlantic in half.
The planes made the 3500-mile crossing in 3Vi
hours, landing here at a local time earlier than the
time they departed from Europe.
Although pickets showed up to demonstrate
against the start of commercial SST service, de
layed by court battles involving the Concorde's
noise levels for 20 months, the general feeling was

that faster-than-sound flight had come to New
York to stay.
Earthquake strikes N. California
Willits — A moderate earthquake rumbled
through parts of Northern California yesterday,
smashing some store windows and causing offi
cials here to close all three schools as a safety
precaution. No injuries or serious damage was
reported.
The University of California seismograph station
at Berkeley reported the tremor registered 5 on
the Richter scale, sufficient to cause considerable
damage in a heavily populated area.
However, sheriff's departments in the counties
involved said no reports of damage were received.
The center of the tremor was three miles east of
Willits in Mendocino County, UC scientists re
ported. That is about 120 miles north of San Fran
cisco.
