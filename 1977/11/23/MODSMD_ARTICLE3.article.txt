Cairo (AP) — Division in the Arab
camp deepened yesterday in the af
termath of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's journey to Jerusalem.
At the United Nations in New York,
the Egyptian ambassador walked out
when the Syrian ambassador at
tacked the Sadat peace effort. It was
the first such walkout by one Arab on
another in the memory of U.N. ob
servers.
Syrian Ambassador Mowaffak Al
laf, kicking off a week-long debate
on the Middle East, accused Sadat of
"surrendering to the Zionist butch
ers" and "stabbing the fellow Arabs
in the back" by going to Israel.
"As a result of this diversionary
tragicomedy, the Middle East has be
come a theater of the absurd," Allaf
said. "We are so confused that we
are no longer able to tell an ally from
an enemy. We don't know whether
we should weep or laugh, feel shame
or pity."
"I don't have to listen to these in
sults," Egyptian Ambassador A.

Esmat Abdel Meguid tola newsmen
after he staged the first Arab walkout
on another Arab speech.
Sadat won a demonstration of
support from allied Sudan when
Sudanese President Jaafer el Numairi
flew to Cairo and was quoted as cal
ling Sadat's trip a victory and appeal
ing for support from other Arabs.
"On this mission and this trip we
scored another big victory. . . We
must be proud in all Arab countries
over this victory," he was quoted by
Cairo Radio as saying. Warmly em
baraced on arrival and departure,
Numairi spent Vh hours with Sadat at
the Kubeb Palace.
Bitter critics met meanwhile in
Damascus and Baghdad and de
nounced Sadat as a "traitor" who had
destroyed Arab unity, and
threatened to assassinate him.
On the Persian Gulf, conservative,
oil-rich regimes whose wealth has in
the past settled many Arab argu
ments, were silent.
Palestinian guerrilla chieftain Yasir
Arafat met in Damascus with Syrian
President Hafen Assad who a week
ago refused to give Sadat endorse
ment for his Jerusalem journey.
A Palestinian statement said the
purpose was to "coordinate the
Palestinian and Syrian positions in
order to counter the major plot
against the Palestinian cause and the
Arab nation."
Another visitor in Damascus was
Jordanian Premier Mudar Badran,
sent by King Hussein with a special
message for Assad regarding Syria's
and Jordan's position on the Sadat
visit.
Neither Badran nor the king has
commented on the controversial
trip, but Information Minister Adnan
Odeb indicated some support for
Sadat by saying the trip "broke the
psychological barrier and provided

fresh hopes for the reconvening of
the Geneva Conference."
Sadat has also received support
from Morocco and Oman.
One of his sharpest critics, Libyan
Prime Minister Abdul Salam Jalloud
conferred with Iraqi leaders in
Baghdad, where he arrived Monday
from Damascus.
Sources said Jalloud is trying to re
concile the feuding regimes in Syria
and Iraq in order to form a wide front
against Sadat.
Libya's state-run Tripoli Radio cal
led on all Arabs to "blow up this
crime from its roots and let it fall
upon the head of this man Sadat who
sold the dignity of the Arabs and
butchered their honor."
An official statement by the South
Yemen Foreign Minister declared
Sadat's trip was "a stab against Arab
solidarity that brought immense
harm both to the Palestinian cause
and the Arab nation."
Meanwhile in Israel as signs of the
welcome for Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat disappeared, the coun
try's leaders were doing some hard
thinking. Prime Minister Menahem
Begin planned to convene his
cabinet tomorrow to report on his
talks with Sadat and perhaps to con
sider his call on Israel to take "hard
and drastic decisions."
Israelis were left breathless by the
44-hour visit which Sadat said he
"can never forget," the incredible
sight of an Egyptian president hear
tily shaking hands with Begin and cal
ling him "my friend," Sadat joking
and trading tributes with "that old
lady." former Prime Miniser Golda
Meir, and taking bows before a
wildly applauding Israeli parliament.
"I never thought I'd live to see the
day," said one young Israeli. "I cer
tainly never thought Golda would."
