# San Jose hospital corrects problems
## 
### Andrea James 
After being threatened with loss of
accreditation last year, the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center (VMC) is
correcting the multimillion dollar de
ficiencies cited by the State Depart
ment of Health.
The Stanford Medical School
works closely with VMC in maintain
ing residency and clerkship prog
rams.
The VMC received a one-year con
ditional accreditation after the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of
Hospitals and the State Department
of Health inspected the hospital ear
lier this year, according to Denny
Oreb, assistant hospital adminis
trator at VMC.
The accreditation team found de
ficiences in fireproofing and unfulfil
led space requirements in the inten
sive care and emergency room areas

as well as burn and neo-natal units.
"The fire safety improvements
should be made within the next six
months," said Oreb. "We originally
estimated $270,000 for the improve
ments, but it looks like it's going to
run about $445,000. We have to ob
tain approval for the extra monies
and open bidding to architects."
The major renovations of the hos
pital will be handled by master facil
ity planners who will inspect the
hospital on Dec. 8, Oreb said.
"We should have fairly accurate
estimates on the amount of needed
renovation in about July," said Oreb.
An earlier estimate placed renno
vation cost anywhere from $5 to $10
million, Oreb added.
Yvonne Russell, associate dean of
the Medical School, told the Daily last
year that the county is considering
construction of an entirely new hos
pital facility because of the extreme
costs involved in complete renova
tion.
"We won't know about a new
building until the master facility
planners finish their evaluation,"
said Oreb.
Oreb said that if the one-year con
ditional accreditation expires before
the estimates are completed, "the
state and joint commission will look
favorably on the hospital as long as
we are progressing to satisfy their re
quirements."
Stanford has 58 residences cur
rently working at VMC, according to
the house staff office at the Medical
School. Medical students and clerk
ships also rotate through VMC said
an office spokesman.
