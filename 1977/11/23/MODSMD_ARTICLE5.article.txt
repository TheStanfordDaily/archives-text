# Gould's S. African thoughts

### Juan Zuniga 
Labor unions may be the most log
ical remaining starting point for
equal rights efforts in South Africa,
according to Law School Prof.
William Gould.
Speaking at Bechtel International
Center yesterday, Gould recently re
turned from a seven-week trip to
South Africa sponsored by the State
Department and the Ford Founda
tion.
Black Africans compose the great
majority of the work force, Gould
said. Yet there are only 28 black Afri
can unions with approximately
50,000 members, compared to a
population of 19 million Black Afri
cans, two million people of mixed
race (coloreds), and 4.5 million
whites.
The South African government
contends black Africans are not
suited to labor unions since they are
tribal and used to taking orders from
chiefs, Gould said.
"Yet one-half of all black Africans
live in urban areas," he said.
Gould further pointed to injustices
levied against the black African
through labor laws such as the In
dustrial and Conciliation Acts which
ban the black Africans from being
considered as employes. He also said
black African unions or workers can
not compel an employer to negotiate
salaries or arrange for union deduc
tions from salaries and, since many
blacks are given permission to live in
a given township because they are
employed, that if for any reason the
worker should go on strike or be
fired he must in turn move out of the
township.
These migratory labor acts are
especially prejudicial towards black
women, said Could. "Since 1968 there
exists a complete embargo on
women from entering any white
area."
As a result there are entire town
ships being built where only men can
live, which creates a very unstable
family life and breeds crime, he
claimed.
With regard to the question of Un
ited States policy toward investment
in apartheid South Africa, Gould said
that removal of U.S. investments
would lead to a lack of technology
which could eventually cause South
Africa to lose its competitive edge.
He also pointed out that there are
many countries which depend on
South Africa's coal exports as well as
other raw materials which would
possibly take up the slack if the Un
ited States were to leave.
As a more affirmative type of policy
Gould suggested that the United
States might adopt a "code of con
duct" such as that being formulated
by Europe which requires multi
national corporations investing in

South Africa recognize and facilitate
the formation of black Africa unions
in order to alleviate some of the in
equalities.
"It seems to me that we should be
taking a leaf from the book of the
European code and establishing
what codes of conduct we would re
quire of our multi-national corpora
tions," said Gould.
He also suggested the implemen
tation of training programs which
would allow blacks to learn more
skills as well as pressure on the gov
ernment to end policies such as the
current law forbidding a company
from allowing a black to supervise a
white.
Gould concluded that "no revolu
tion is around the corner in South
Africa. . . The system is not about to
change in many fundamental areas,"
he said.

whites.
The South African government
contends black Africans are not
suited to labor unions since they are
tribal and used to taking orders from
chiefs, Gould said.
"Yet one-half of all black Africans
live in urban areas," he said.
Gould further pointed to injustices
levied against the black African
through labor laws such as the In
dustrial and Conciliation Acts which
ban the black Africans from being
considered as employes. He also said
black African unions or workers can
not compel an employer to negotiate
salaries or arrange for union deduc
tions from salaries and, since many
blacks are given permission to live in
a given township because they are
employed, that if for any reason the
worker should go on strike or be
fired he must in turn move out of the
township.
These migratory labor acts are
especially prejudicial towards black
women, said Could. "Since 1968 there
exists a complete embargo on
women from entering any white
area."
As a result there are entire town
ships being built where only men can
live, which creates a very unstable
family life and breeds crime, he
claimed.
With regard to the question of Un
ited States policy toward investment
in apartheid South Africa, Gould said
that removal of U.S. investments
would lead to a lack of technology
which could eventually cause South
Africa to lose its competitive edge.
He also pointed out that there are
many countries which depend on
South Africa's coal exports as well as
other raw materials which would
possibly take up the slack if the Un
ited States were to leave.
As a more affirmative type of policy
Gould suggested that the United
States might adopt a "code of con
duct" such as that being formulated
by Europe which requires multi
national corporations investing in

South Africa recognize and facilitate
the formation of black Africa unions
in order to alleviate some of the in
equalities.
"It seems to me that we should be
taking a leaf from the book of the
European code and establishing
what codes of conduct we would re
quire of our multi-national corpora
tions," said Gould.
He also suggested the implemen
tation of training programs which
would allow blacks to learn more
skills as well as pressure on the gov
ernment to end policies such as the
current law forbidding a company
from allowing a black to supervise a
white.
Gould concluded that "no revolu
tion is around the corner in South
Africa. . . The system is not about to
change in many fundamental areas,"
he said.
Labor unions may be the most log
ical remaining starting point for
equal rights efforts in South Africa,
according to Law School Prof.
William Gould.
Speaking at Bechtel International
Center yesterday, Gould recently re
turned from a seven-week trip to
South Africa sponsored by the State
Department and the Ford Founda
tion.
Black Africans compose the great
majority of the work force, Gould
said. Yet there are only 28 black Afri
can unions with approximately
50,000 members, compared to a
population of 19 million Black Afri
cans, two million people of mixed
race (coloreds), and 4.5 million
whites.
