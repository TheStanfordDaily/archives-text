# Younger hopes to beat Brown on issues

San Francisco — "I don't think
that I could run a cute campaign
even if I tried — it's not my style.
You can't beat Gov. Brown by
out-Browning Gov. Brown," stated
Attorney General Evelle Younger,
candidate for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination.
"I think that the cute things —
sleeping on a bed board, driving a
used Plymouth, entertaining visit
ing royalty on alfalfa sprouts salad
— may turn people on for a while
but then it turns them off,"
Younger commented while dis
cussing his opinion of Gov. Jerry
Brown's "style rather than sub
stance" technique.
Younger stated that if people
would critically examine Brown's
track record, Younger will win the
election. "If I can't (make them
look at Brown's record) and they
listen instead to what Brown says
and fail to examine what he does,
Brown will win."
For any candidate to success
fully challenge Brown, Younger
feels that he must convince the
people to vote on how they think,
rather than on the mystique or
rhetoric of the governor.
"Many of the polls that show
Brown as the most popular choice
also show that many people disag

ree with him on the issues,"
Younger said.
Before he faces Brown, how
ever, Younger must hurdle
the political aspirations of three
declared contenders for the Re
publican nomination: Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis;
Pete Wilson, mayor of San Diego;
and Ken Maddy, an assemblyman
from Fresno.
"I believe I am going to win the
primary," Younger asserted. With
a significant lead in the polls,
Younger's main campaign strategy
is not to lose any Republican sup
port on his way to the nomination.
"Being the minority candidate
going in, I can't afford to lose any
support, so I will be conducting a
low-key campaign," he said. Tip
toeing away from alienating any
Republican votes, Younger con
firmed his campaign plan to "run
like hell as attorney general and
ignore the opposition."
At 59, the two-term attorney
general does not feel he is smug
concerning the nomination. "I've
run twice statewide and the
people have demonstrated confi
dence in me," he said.
Younger, as attorney general,
cannot take a political position on
many issues because of the nature

of his job. "It is not appropriate
for me to take a position on an
issue that I may be defending for
the state in court,"he said.
When asked, Younger stated
that he has no opinion on the
Bakke case. He feels that it is the

most "over-lawyered" case ever
before the Supreme Court. He
said the most important thing, re
gardless of personal feelings on
the issue, is a prompt resolution
of the procedure for admittance.
"If we felt that any part of the
case would not be adequately co

vered by the lawyers in the case,
we would be right in there,"
Younger stated.
The Briggs initiative, which
would mandate the firing of
homosexual teachers, is unneces
sary, Younger feels. "People who
are knowledgeable in this area of
the law are satisfied that as a prac
tical matter the law is adequate to
protect school children from
homosexual teachers," he said.
The laws that the Briggs initiative
would instigate are already on the
books in the form of case law, he
stated.
Younger feels the key to en
virionmental issues is balance. "I
realize that to environmentalists
the word balance means you al
ways go with the developers, and
to the developers balance means
knuckling down to the environ
mentalists, but I really mean that
we must strike a balance between
the two," he said.
The challenge that Younger
faces, he states, is to maintain a
middle position. "I don't believe
in the no-growth philosophy and I
don't believe in a philosophy that
says we will build what we want
where we want it."
Younger said he feels that he
has no problem keeping his job
and his candidacy separate. "It's

not hard for me to do but it is
diffjcult to convince people that I
separate the two," Younger said.
The issues that he deals with daily
in his job take on a political tinge
as election time draws closer.
Younger stated that he feels the
job of attorney general is the "best
possible preparation for the gov
ernorship. If the fates deter
mined who would govern and you
wanted to farm him out for eight
years in some other job to prepare
him, the attorney general's office
would be the best possible train
ing ground," Younger said.
"We deal with all the critical is
sues that the people of California
are concerned with on a daily
basis. Not only rape, robbery and
murder but the environment, the
economy, taxation, problems of
agriculture, highways — there is
no issue that is affected by state
government that we are not in
volved with.
"The job involves every issue, I
get involved in every aspect of life
in California. What might not be a
legitimate use of time for a mayor
or a police chief is, in my case, a
perfectly proper use of time,"
Younger said. This is one of the
reasons that in the past the post of
attorney general has often lead to
the governor's mansion, he said.

agriculture, highways — there is
no issue that is affected by state
government that we are not in
volved with.
"The job involves every issue, I
get involved in every aspect of life
in California. What might not be a
legitimate use of time for a mayor
or a police chief is, in my case, a
perfectly proper use of time,"
Younger said. This is one of the
reasons that in the past the post of
attorney general has often lead to
the governor's mansion, he said.


State Attorney General Younger
San Francisco — "I don't think
that I could run a cute campaign
even if I tried — it's not my style.
You can't beat Gov. Brown by
out-Browning Gov. Brown," stated
Attorney General Evelle Younger,
candidate for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination.
"I think that the cute things —
sleeping on a bed board, driving a
used Plymouth, entertaining visit
ing royalty on alfalfa sprouts salad
— may turn people on for a while
but then it turns them off,"
Younger commented while dis
cussing his opinion of Gov. Jerry
Brown's "style rather than sub
stance" technique.
Younger stated that if people
would critically examine Brown's
track record, Younger will win the
election. "If I can't (make them
look at Brown's record) and they
listen instead to what Brown says
and fail to examine what he does,
Brown will win."
For any candidate to success
fully challenge Brown, Younger
feels that he must convince the
people to vote on how they think,
rather than on the mystique or
rhetoric of the governor.
"Many of the polls that show
Brown as the most popular choice
also show that many people disag

ree with him on the issues,"
Younger said.
Before he faces Brown, how
ever, Younger must hurdle
the political aspirations of three
declared contenders for the Re
publican nomination: Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis;
Pete Wilson, mayor of San Diego;
and Ken Maddy, an assemblyman
from Fresno.
"I believe I am going to win the
primary," Younger asserted. With
a significant lead in the polls,
Younger's main campaign strategy
is not to lose any Republican sup
port on his way to the nomination.
"Being the minority candidate
going in, I can't afford to lose any
support, so I will be conducting a
low-key campaign," he said. Tip
toeing away from alienating any
Republican votes, Younger con
firmed his campaign plan to "run
like hell as attorney general and
ignore the opposition."
At 59, the two-term attorney
general does not feel he is smug
concerning the nomination. "I've
run twice statewide and the
people have demonstrated confi
dence in me," he said.
Younger, as attorney general,
cannot take a political position on
many issues because of the nature

of his job. "It is not appropriate
for me to take a position on an
issue that I may be defending for
the state in court,"he said.
When asked, Younger stated
that he has no opinion on the
Bakke case. He feels that it is the

most "over-lawyered" case ever
before the Supreme Court. He
said the most important thing, re
gardless of personal feelings on
the issue, is a prompt resolution
of the procedure for admittance.
"If we felt that any part of the
case would not be adequately co

vered by the lawyers in the case,
we would be right in there,"
Younger stated.
The Briggs initiative, which
would mandate the firing of
homosexual teachers, is unneces
sary, Younger feels. "People who
are knowledgeable in this area of
the law are satisfied that as a prac
tical matter the law is adequate to
protect school children from
homosexual teachers," he said.
The laws that the Briggs initiative
would instigate are already on the
books in the form of case law, he
stated.
Younger feels the key to en
virionmental issues is balance. "I
realize that to environmentalists
the word balance means you al
ways go with the developers, and
to the developers balance means
knuckling down to the environ
mentalists, but I really mean that
we must strike a balance between
the two," he said.
The challenge that Younger
faces, he states, is to maintain a
middle position. "I don't believe
in the no-growth philosophy and I
don't believe in a philosophy that
says we will build what we want
where we want it."
Younger said he feels that he
has no problem keeping his job
and his candidacy separate. "It's

not hard for me to do but it is
diffjcult to convince people that I
separate the two," Younger said.
The issues that he deals with daily
in his job take on a political tinge
as election time draws closer.
Younger stated that he feels the
job of attorney general is the "best
possible preparation for the gov
ernorship. If the fates deter
mined who would govern and you
wanted to farm him out for eight
years in some other job to prepare
him, the attorney general's office
would be the best possible train
ing ground," Younger said.
"We deal with all the critical is
sues that the people of California
are concerned with on a daily
basis. Not only rape, robbery and
murder but the environment, the
economy, taxation, problems of
agriculture, highways — there is
no issue that is affected by state
government that we are not in
volved with.

job of attorney general is the "best
possible preparation for the gov
ernorship. If the fates deter
mined who would govern and you
wanted to farm him out for eight
years in some other job to prepare
him, the attorney general's office
would be the best possible train
ing ground," Younger said.
"We deal with all the critical is
sues that the people of California
are concerned with on a daily
basis. Not only rape, robbery and
murder but the environment, the
economy, taxation, problems of
agriculture, highways — there is
no issue that is affected by state
government that we are not in
volved with.
"The job involves every issue, I
get involved in every aspect of life
in California. What might not be a
legitimate use of time for a mayor
or a police chief is, in my case, a
perfectly proper use of time,"
Younger said. This is one of the
reasons that in the past the post of
attorney general has often lead to
the governor's mansion, he said.

San Francisco — "I don't think
that I could run a cute campaign
even if I tried — it's not my style.
You can't beat Gov. Brown by
out-Browning Gov. Brown," stated
Attorney General Evelle Younger,
candidate for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination.
"I think that the cute things —
sleeping on a bed board, driving a
used Plymouth, entertaining visit
ing royalty on alfalfa sprouts salad
— may turn people on for a while
but then it turns them off,"
Younger commented while dis
cussing his opinion of Gov. Jerry
Brown's "style rather than sub
stance" technique.
Younger stated that if people
would critically examine Brown's
track record, Younger will win the
election. "If I can't (make them
look at Brown's record) and they
listen instead to what Brown says
and fail to examine what he does,
Brown will win."
For any candidate to success
fully challenge Brown, Younger
feels that he must convince the
people to vote on how they think,
rather than on the mystique or
rhetoric of the governor.
"Many of the polls that show
Brown as the most popular choice
also show that many people disag

ree with him on the issues,"
Younger said.
Before he faces Brown, how
ever, Younger must hurdle
the political aspirations of three
declared contenders for the Re
publican nomination: Los
Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis;
Pete Wilson, mayor of San Diego;
and Ken Maddy, an assemblyman
from Fresno.
"I believe I am going to win the
primary," Younger asserted. With
a significant lead in the polls,
Younger's main campaign strategy
is not to lose any Republican sup
port on his way to the nomination.
"Being the minority candidate
going in, I can't afford to lose any
support, so I will be conducting a
low-key campaign," he said. Tip
toeing away from alienating any
Republican votes, Younger con
firmed his campaign plan to "run
like hell as attorney general and
ignore the opposition."
At 59, the two-term attorney
general does not feel he is smug
concerning the nomination. "I've
run twice statewide and the
people have demonstrated confi
dence in me," he said.
Younger, as attorney general,
cannot take a political position on
many issues because of the nature

of his job. "It is not appropriate
for me to take a position on an
issue that I may be defending for
the state in court,"he said.
When asked, Younger stated
that he has no opinion on the
Bakke case. He feels that it is the

most "over-lawyered" case ever
before the Supreme Court. He
said the most important thing, re
gardless of personal feelings on
the issue, is a prompt resolution
of the procedure for admittance.
"If we felt that any part of the
case would not be adequately co

vered by the lawyers in the case,
we would be right in there,"
Younger stated.
The Briggs initiative, which
would mandate the firing of
homosexual teachers, is unneces
sary, Younger feels. "People who
are knowledgeable in this area of
the law are satisfied that as a prac
tical matter the law is adequate to
protect school children from
homosexual teachers," he said.
The laws that the Briggs initiative
would instigate are already on the
books in the form of case law, he
stated.
Younger feels the key to en
virionmental issues is balance. "I
realize that to environmentalists
the word balance means you al
ways go with the developers, and
to the developers balance means
knuckling down to the environ
mentalists, but I really mean that
we must strike a balance between
the two," he said.
The challenge that Younger
faces, he states, is to maintain a
middle position. "I don't believe
in the no-growth philosophy and I
don't believe in a philosophy that
says we will build what we want
where we want it."
Younger said he feels that he
has no problem keeping his job
and his candidacy separate. "It's

not hard for me to do but it is
diffjcult to convince people that I
separate the two," Younger said.
The issues that he deals with daily
in his job take on a political tinge
as election time draws closer.
Younger stated that he feels the
job of attorney general is the "best
possible preparation for the gov
ernorship. If the fates deter
mined who would govern and you
