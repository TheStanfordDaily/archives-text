## Define goals Picking a major hazardous 
### 
Allan Chen

About this time of life, we students
reach an important juncture in our
lives' pathways. We have to choose a
major and therefore make a number
of decisions about our lives' paths.
But this, as we are all well aware, is a
hazardous undertaking, fraught with
uncertainty and frustration.
How are we to decide what to do
with our lives, given the fluctuations
of the job market and the mood of
uncertainty, the inconsistency of the
advising system and our own lack of
self-knowledge or desire to face the
question? How can we balance our
desires with our imperatives, and
how can we remain true to our ideals
while being realistic about our
needs?
For this column, I will drop the
modest journalistic third person in
favor of a more personal attempt to
answer these questions for myself
and those who may read this.
The major problem is resolving the
conflict between doing what we want
to do and doing something that will
provide for our basic needs. The two
do not always overlap. It reduces to a
question of idealism vs. realism:
major in a field that you enjoy and
you run the risk of not finding a job
after college; major in something
practical like economics or engineer
ing, and even though you might
enjoy it less, you stand a better
chance of surviving, even flourish
ing.
Another, less prominent, conflict
is in the nature of the subject majors
themselves. The science and en
gineering fields are rational, discip
lined and very difficult. They concen
trate, for the most part, on the mate
rial universe, and in some sense,
they are dehumanizing.
The humanities and social sciences
are very human-oriented. They de
pend less on the ability to think
mathematically and reductionisti
cally and more on intuitive or unde
finable talents. Some would call
them fuzzy fields. Is one area better
than the other?
Construct goals
The third concern is developing
that special ability to see far ahead
into your own life to construct goals.
For most, the long-range goals derive
from three viewpoints: (1) achieving
contentment, i.e. happiness, suc
cess, fame, wealth, power; (2)
achieving understanding, a know
ledge of the way the universe runs,
the reasons people behave the way
they do, and the reasons for our exis
tence; and (3) achieving some last
ing, beneficial mark on humanity
through artistic or humanistic vision,
or through solving human problems.

I had tended toward the second
alternative and hence toward
physics. Physics requires rigorous,
structured thinking; it is a kind of
universal philosophy, and I derive
much pleasure and enrichment from
studying the mechanism of the uni
verse.
But there is a disadvantage in
majoring in physics, one that is true
of specializing in any field, but is
most especially true of fields that re
quire a substantial commitment of
time and energy: one who is not
careful could find him/herself im
mersed in a narrowness of view
point. Physics is a good way of look
ing at the universe, but it is only one
way.
I found myself, like most freshmen
and sophomores, on uncertain
ground. We all have many interests,
and how is it possible to choose
among them? Like most, I desire a
major and a career that would bring
me understanding and a chance to
contribute beneficial works to hu
manity. For a while, I also wished to
achieve contentment and material
sucess. Now, I wonder.
It may not be possible to be both
happy and wise. Those who achieve
success might in later life close their
minds to understanding. A truly wise
human, it seems, would be forever
disturbed by what s/he sees in the

surroundings: human suffering,
confusion, narrow-mindedness. The
more questions you ask, the less
reason to be content, the less reason
to support society and the status
quo. The less reason to major in
something practical.
The more you try to do good works
and solve human problems, the
more brick walls you run up against,
the more futile your efforts are. And
the more you try to choose a major
that compromises those three goals,
the less successful you are likely to
be.
I am weary of human foibles and
stupidity, of my own inability to un
derstand many things from physics
to life, and of that once-held desire
to be a success. My goal in life is
understanding â€” an idealistic and
probably unrealistic choice, but not
and unreasonable one.
For those of you who are trying to
construct your goals and choose
your major: ask the question, do I
want happiness, understanding or
humanistic contribution as a life
goal, and is there a major which fits
well with this goal, one that allows
me to be pragmatic, idealistic or
something inbetween, as I wish? And
for those of you who know what you
are majoring in, ask the question, too.
