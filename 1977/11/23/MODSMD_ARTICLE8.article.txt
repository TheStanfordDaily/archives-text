# Mistakes honest
## ERB 'harsh' to Rappaport 
### 
Dwight Pridham

Now that the Elections Review
Board has handed down its deci
sions, I feel that a few facts about
lanet Rappaport's case should be
publicized.
First of all, although I feel that the
ERB may have been a little harsh in
disqualifying Janet when others were
merely reprimanded, I support their
decisions and feel that they were an
absolute necessity. Janet was
charged with failure to report full
campaign expenses with extenuating
circumstances, and exceeding the
campaign spending limit through
negligence. The first charge is
ridiculous, because she went to the
elections commissioner before the
elections were held, and told him of
her mistakes; no action was taken on
this charge. I will therefore address
the other charge.
Janet's expenses in the campaign
consisted of a poster (3000 copies)
and a flyer (500 copies). The flyer was
a small expense and no problem. I
will concentrate on the problems
caused by the poster.
Being new to the elections game,
lanet took the advice of several
people, including ASSU personnel,
that 3000 posters would be adequate
to cover the campus. As it turned
out, barely 1000 posters were
needed.
Misunderstandings
A series of misunderstandings with
an inexperienced employe at the

print shop led to an incorrect esti
mate. Janet was told that a certain
quality of paper was necessary to
prevent the ink from running
through. An inferior grade could
have been used. She was also told
that colored paper was not an addi
tional charge; it was later billed as an
extra charge.
Thus, Janet expected the price to
be under her limits. It was $108 in
stead ($5B over the limit). However,
Janet didn't find out about this until
five days after receiving the posters.
By unfortunate coincidence, I picked
up and paid for the posters, as she
had a class until after the print shop
closed. I dropped the posters off at
her apartment without seeing her.
I wasn't alarmed by the high bill
because until the present mess, I had
been as unconcerned with student
government as possible, and I was
unaware of the campaign spending
limit. I figured Janet knew what she
was doing, and I let the matter slide
until I saw her at the UCLA game Oct.
8. She was shocked at the size of the
bill.
Monday, Janet went to the elec
tions commissioner and the senate
chairman, explained her problem,
and offered to withdraw from the
race. Both told her this would be un
necessary if she could'turn in her un
used posters, of which approxi
mately two-thirds were left. She did
so immediately.
Thus, Janet Rappaport was elected
by students who saw only $50 worth
of campaign materials. She was en
couraged throughout the campaign
by the elections commissioner to
stay in the race. He assured her that
there would be no problem since she
had turned in the posters, and that
he would pro-rate them (charge her
only for the percentage used).
The elections commissioner also
advised her not to make any state
ments to the media, advice which
she unfortunately followed.
Now Janet Rappaport has been
disqualified. She and Dan Livingston
were the only ones really punished,
making them the scapegoats for all
the irregularities in the campaign. I
think this is unfortunate.
Janet would have made a great
senator. She is active, interested,
and a hard worker. Instead her name
was degraded. Her mistakes were

honest ones, based on inexperience.
There was no intention to deceive
anyone. I can only hope that with her
newly gained experience, she retains
enough of her enthusiasm for stu
dent government to run again.

extra charge.
Thus, Janet expected the price to
be under her limits. It was $108 in
stead ($5B over the limit). However,
Janet didn't find out about this until
five days after receiving the posters.
By unfortunate coincidence, I picked
up and paid for the posters, as she
had a class until after the print shop
closed. I dropped the posters off at
her apartment without seeing her.
I wasn't alarmed by the high bill
because until the present mess, I had
been as unconcerned with student
government as possible, and I was
unaware of the campaign spending
limit. I figured Janet knew what she
was doing, and I let the matter slide
until I saw her at the UCLA game Oct.
8. She was shocked at the size of the
bill.
Monday, Janet went to the elec
tions commissioner and the senate
chairman, explained her problem,
and offered to withdraw from the
race. Both told her this would be un
necessary if she could'turn in her un
used posters, of which approxi
mately two-thirds were left. She did
so immediately.
Thus, Janet Rappaport was elected
by students who saw only $50 worth
of campaign materials. She was en
couraged throughout the campaign
by the elections commissioner to
stay in the race. He assured her that
there would be no problem since she
had turned in the posters, and that
he would pro-rate them (charge her
only for the percentage used).
The elections commissioner also
advised her not to make any state
ments to the media, advice which
she unfortunately followed.
Now Janet Rappaport has been
disqualified. She and Dan Livingston
were the only ones really punished,
making them the scapegoats for all
the irregularities in the campaign. I
think this is unfortunate.
Janet would have made a great
senator. She is active, interested,
and a hard worker. Instead her name
was degraded. Her mistakes were

honest ones, based on inexperience.
There was no intention to deceive
anyone. I can only hope that with her
newly gained experience, she retains
enough of her enthusiasm for stu
dent government to run again.

Now that the Elections Review
Board has handed down its deci
sions, I feel that a few facts about
lanet Rappaport's case should be
publicized.
First of all, although I feel that the
ERB may have been a little harsh in
disqualifying Janet when others were
merely reprimanded, I support their
decisions and feel that they were an
absolute necessity. Janet was
charged with failure to report full
campaign expenses with extenuating
circumstances, and exceeding the
campaign spending limit through
negligence. The first charge is
ridiculous, because she went to the
elections commissioner before the
elections were held, and told him of
her mistakes; no action was taken on
this charge. I will therefore address
the other charge.
Janet's expenses in the campaign
consisted of a poster (3000 copies)
and a flyer (500 copies). The flyer was
a small expense and no problem. I
will concentrate on the problems
caused by the poster.
Being new to the elections game,
lanet took the advice of several
people, including ASSU personnel,
that 3000 posters would be adequate
to cover the campus. As it turned
out, barely 1000 posters were
needed.
Misunderstandings
A series of misunderstandings with
an inexperienced employe at the

print shop led to an incorrect esti
mate. Janet was told that a certain
quality of paper was necessary to
prevent the ink from running
through. An inferior grade could
have been used. She was also told
that colored paper was not an addi
tional charge; it was later billed as an
extra charge.
Thus, Janet expected the price to
be under her limits. It was $108 in
stead ($5B over the limit). However,
Janet didn't find out about this until
