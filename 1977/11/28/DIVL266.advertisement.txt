WHAT'S NEW IN SOCIOLOGY?
New Courses for Winter Quarter
Sociology 2: American Society Through Film and Literature
This course is based on observations on American society made by films and novels. It will explore
such process in American society as industrialization, urbanization and immigration, and the impact
of these processes on American social structure, both at the community and national level. Among
the novels to be read are Steinbeck's In Dubious Battle, Ellison's The Invisible Man, Faulkner's The
Hamlet, and Fitzgerald's The Creat Catsby. Films include Grapes of Wrath, Place in the Sun, Meet
John Doe and Hester Street.
TTH 1:15-2:45 plus section. Zelditch.
Sociology 5: Status, Friendship and Social Pressure: An Experiential Approach
Will explore basic social processes in interpersonal situations, including group pressure on
individual choices, operation of status distinctions (such as sex and race), and formation of friend
ships and intimate relationships (such as love relationships). Students will first have the opportunity
to experience these processes through simulation gaming and structured exercises. Lectures will
then examine these processes from theoretical, empirical and clinical perspectives.
TTh 11 plus section T or Th 2:15-4:00. Berger and Talley.
Sociology 40: Race and Ethnic Relations
This course addresses two kinds of questions: how does one classify information about race and
ethnic relations; and how does one conduct research in this field? Several lines of research in the
field are considered according to their adherence to different theoretical orientations. Policy
implications of these types of research programs will also be explored. Illustrative examples will be
drawn mainly (but not exclusively) from the U.S. experience.
MWF 9. Harris and Walker.
Sociology 136: Sociology of Religion
Will explore the structure of cultural systems in general and religious ones in particular by
examining their components: ritual, myth, and sacred/profane. The structure of religious systems
will then be related to aspects of nature and the social structure, emphasizing the works of
Durkheim, Marx, Weber, and Levi-Strauss. Two classical problems, totemism,and the reformation
and rise of individualism, will be examined. Most of the applications, however, will be in contem
porary society, including the less obvious religious forms such as technology and sex as sacred, mass
media and pop psychology as myth, national politics and individualistic humanism as religion,etc.
MWF 11. Thomas.
Sociology 183: How to do Your Own Research: Training for Undergraduate Independent Research
Designed to assist and facilitate undergraduates in doing independent research in the social
sciences. Includes defining a research problem, stating hypotheses, examining the theoretical and
empirical literature, designing the research, collecting data, and analyzing the results. Students may
work on projects for other courses or select a project specifically for this course. ARLO and SCIRE
will assist us in gaining access to research projects in the community.
M 2:15-5:05 Hallinan.
Returning courses also of interest to general studies students:
Sociology 30: World of Organizations
A variety of organizational forms are discussed and their impact on individuals and society
evaluated. Organizations studied include schools, hospitals, prisons, public bureaus, and corpora
tions.
MWF 10:00. Scott.
Sociology 102: Physiological Sociology
An examination of the evidence and theory fragments which bear on the question of how
physiological processes both reflect and have impact upon the social system in which the individual
is embedded.
MWF 1:15. Barchas.

New Courses for Winter Quarter
Sociology 2: American Society Through Film and Literature
This course is based on observations on American society made by films and novels. It will explore
such process in American society as industrialization, urbanization and immigration, and the impact
of these processes on American social structure, both at the community and national level. Among
the novels to be read are Steinbeck's In Dubious Battle, Ellison's The Invisible Man, Faulkner's The
Hamlet, and Fitzgerald's The Creat Catsby. Films include Grapes of Wrath, Place in the Sun, Meet
John Doe and Hester Street.
TTH 1:15-2:45 plus section. Zelditch.
Sociology 5: Status, Friendship and Social Pressure: An Experiential Approach
Will explore basic social processes in interpersonal situations, including group pressure on
individual choices, operation of status distinctions (such as sex and race), and formation of friend
ships and intimate relationships (such as love relationships). Students will first have the opportunity
to experience these processes through simulation gaming and structured exercises. Lectures will
then examine these processes from theoretical, empirical and clinical perspectives.
TTh 11 plus section T or Th 2:15-4:00. Berger and Talley.
Sociology 40: Race and Ethnic Relations
This course addresses two kinds of questions: how does one classify information about race and
ethnic relations; and how does one conduct research in this field? Several lines of research in the
field are considered according to their adherence to different theoretical orientations. Policy
implications of these types of research programs will also be explored. Illustrative examples will be
drawn mainly (but not exclusively) from the U.S. experience.
MWF 9. Harris and Walker.
Sociology 136: Sociology of Religion
Will explore the structure of cultural systems in general and religious ones in particular by
examining their components: ritual, myth, and sacred/profane. The structure of religious systems
will then be related to aspects of nature and the social structure, emphasizing the works of
Durkheim, Marx, Weber, and Levi-Strauss. Two classical problems, totemism,and the reformation
and rise of individualism, will be examined. Most of the applications, however, will be in contem
porary society, including the less obvious religious forms such as technology and sex as sacred, mass
media and pop psychology as myth, national politics and individualistic humanism as religion,etc.
MWF 11. Thomas.
Sociology 183: How to do Your Own Research: Training for Undergraduate Independent Research
Designed to assist and facilitate undergraduates in doing independent research in the social
sciences. Includes defining a research problem, stating hypotheses, examining the theoretical and
empirical literature, designing the research, collecting data, and analyzing the results. Students may
work on projects for other courses or select a project specifically for this course. ARLO and SCIRE
will assist us in gaining access to research projects in the community.
