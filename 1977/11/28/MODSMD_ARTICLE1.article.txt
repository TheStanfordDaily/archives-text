The position is equivalent in rank
to an assistant secretary. EIA staffing

formation source.
Many sides

sides of the energy question," Moses
said. EIA will act as a "source of
trustworthy information that any
body can use no matter what his pol
icy position."
He said, if confirmed, his organiza
tion would strive to be "objective,
thoughtful and thorough."
"I'd like to see us with a well
designed system for collection and
analysis of energy data which runs
well by the time I leave," Moses said.
Moses, a Kansas City Mo., native
who grew up in San Bernadino, has
served as Statistics Dept. chairman
for four years, dean of graduate
studies for six years, president of the
Association of Graduate Schools
within the Association of American
Universities and as head of the re
search committee of the Graduate
Record Examination board.
Committee work

tees of the National Academy of Sci
ences and the National Research
Council.

cess in adapting statistical theory and
techniques to medical research. Be
sides his appointment in the Statis
tics Department, Moses also teaches

of Family, Community and Preventa
tive Medicine.

Lincoln Moses
Statistics Prof. Lincoln Moses has
been nominated as administrator of
the Energy Information Administra
tion (EIA) of the U.S. Department of
Energy by President Jimmy Carter, a
White House announcement re
leased last Wednesday said.
The EIA has been formed to collect
and analyze data on reserves, pro
duction, sales and like on the na
tion's energy resources,according to
Moses.
The agency's basic purpose is to
develop comprehensive, credible
energy statistics.
The Moses nomination is subject
to Senate approval. Moses said yes
terday he has no idea when confir
mation hearings will be held or if
they would be held before the end of
the year.
'Unexpected'
Moses, contacted first in early Sep
tember about the job, said the initial
contact was "totally unexpected."
He said the job would be his "hardest
ever" and his duties would be largely
managerial.
Moses said by law EIA has a great
deal of autonomy. The EIA adminis
trator will report directly to the Sec
retary of Energy and the deputy sec
retary.
The position is equivalent in rank
to an assistant secretary. EIA staffing
is expected to total about 700 per
sons.
Moses said he has asked for a
two-year leave from the University.
Moses said he sees EIA as an in
formation source.
