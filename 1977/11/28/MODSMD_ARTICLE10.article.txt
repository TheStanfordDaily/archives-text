# Gifts encourage waste
## Holiday season disregards ecology 
### 
Dahle, Abramson

Megawatt hairdryers, shaving
cream warmers, food processors,
peeling wands, Mastercharge, Bank-
Americard. It must be Christmas
again.
Every year, the gift barrage rises in
energy intensity. Every year, exploi
tation leads to the dehumanizing of
the holiday season. Instead of joy
fully anticipating the warmth of fam
ily and friends in this season of celeb
ration, we are forced to worry about
what gift to get what person, and in
evitably wind up with an item waste
ful of energy and materials, disre

gardful of theenvironment, and lack
ing a part of ourselves.
The holiday season is greeted each
year earlier and earlier, with lay-away
plans, or incentives to shop early and
avoid the rush. Commercialism has
been able to capitalize on the gift
giving process, by making us feel it is
an obligation we must fulfill before
celebrating with friends and family.
Lack of time is the pressure which
is undoubtedly felt by most as we
search for that perfect gift. Rather
than use our own resources and
creative talents, it is simply easier

and less time consuming to purchase
presents.
The burden of last minute Christ
mas shopping can be avoided if sim
ple alternatives are practiced. Plants
grown from your own cuttings add
that personal touch. Consider small
local merchants for handmade items
if purchases are desired. Consider an
outing with friends as a celebration
idea. Gift certificates of personal ser
vices to be rendered are well ac
cepted. (The greatest alternative you
can offer is yourself.)
Disregard for energy
As the increasingly commercial
holidays move away from concern
about people, they also show disre-_
gard for energy and the environ
ment. The ethic of conservation, re
cycling and ecology seems to disap
pear under the onslaught of ever
more energy intensive gift items, and
disposable decorations ranging from
plastic ornaments to throw-away
trees.
Each year can be characterized by
the increased wattage of hand-held
hair dryers, and the appearance of a
new kitchen convenience, such as
this year's electric tomato peeler.
The search for more interesting, exo
tic gifts leads away from necessity
towards frivolity.
What alternatives are there? As a
minimum, gifts can encourage con
servation rather than waste: water
saving devices, bike equipment,
tools, candles, donations to conser-

vation groups, energy-related
books, backpacking gear, are a few
examples.

Decorations and wrappings can be
made from recycled and natural
materials. Natural foods can be en
joyed and shared. The holidays can
bring about a celebration among
people rather than an exchange of
commodities.
Strain on relationships
Perhaps the worst by-product of
the continuing prostitution of the
holiday season is the resulting strain
on interpersonal relationships. It
seems to be more and more difficult
to get together with friends solely to
enjoy the holiday spirit. Gift giving is
the main event. Human interaction is
secondary.
As we buy more and more, we lose
the necessary human element, and
we encourage the unnecessary waste
of energy and natural resources. It is
about time to stop and take a look at
where we're headed. This year at
Stanford, the holidays should be a
time to explore alternatives to the
annual madness familiar to us all.
We owe it to ourselves to experi
ence the season this year by reducing
our consumption of energy and non
sensible resources and increasing
our supply of human resources:
celebrate as if people and the envi
ronment mattered.
