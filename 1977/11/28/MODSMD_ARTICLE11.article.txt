# University investment policy
## Maximizing financial return necessary 
### 
Rodney Adams

I would like to respond to some
comments made in Randall Schutt's
column (Daily, Nov. 15) addressed to
the ad hoc Committee on Investment
Responsibility. In that column, he
states that "only when the viability of
the institution is jeopardized should
financial concerns be allowed to take
precedence" over moral concerns in
seeking to optimize the financial re
turn on our investment resources.
Schutt has used an excellent
choice of words, although I find it
difficult to get a precise handle on
"viability" of the institution that is
"jeopardized." I would argue Schutt
is presenting a very naive approach.
Over the past years, we have pro
vided to the Stanford community, to
all those who are interested, expla
nations of our investment planning
and processes. The desire to obtain
the maximum financial return isn't
just because this is a worthwhile pur
suit. Rather, it is the only way in
which we can maintain the dynamic
balance of the University's budget,
while providing funds for improved
programs and innovation.
It is very hard to obtain a consistent
return that offsets inflation. That is, it
is very hard to keep running fast
enough to just stay in place. We hope
to achieve that.
Further, we hope that we can ob
tain superior returns, to not only stay
in place, but also to provide some
thing more. That is what Stanford
University is all about, and I suspect
is one of the reasons, if not the prim
ary one, why Schutt chose to come
here as a student.
I am concerned about Schutt's re
ferences to actions of last spring. He
states that the petitions urged that
"the University vote its proxies
against corporate investment in
South Africa." Unfortunately, this is
a very emotionally grabbing state
ment, which happens to be wrong.

Schutt should re-read the proxy
proposals again. They proposed di
vestment of assets in South Africa in
most instances, and limits on new
investments in other cases. I am also
concerned by his reference to the
fact that the Stanford Committee for
Responsible Investment Policy re
commendations were "callously ig
nored by the CIR and the trustees."
This is a very prejudicial comment,
and just out and out untrue.
The CIR deliberated over the
SCRIP "demands" and rendered an

opinion and recommendation to the
University. In turn, the trustees de
liberated the issue and invited in
SCRIP representatives to amplify
their concerns. I thought that this
was adequately covered by the press
and reported to most of those con
cerned. Was Schutt unaware of what
was going on at that time?
I would disagree with Schutt's de
finition of community. He points out
that the University has made deci
sions contrary to the desires of the
community, and he defines the ac-

tive constituencies of the community
in a very narrow sense. He does not
include alumni in that category.
I suspect that, as apparently a new
alumnus, Schutt has a paradoxical
situation. He appears to be active, at
least responsive. I suggest in the fu
ture that his definition of community
include alumni. This must of course
include alumni of all ages (and inci
dentally, of differing viewpoints).
