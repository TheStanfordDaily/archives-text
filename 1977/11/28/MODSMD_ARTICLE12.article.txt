Corporate profits
Richard Fearon's column (Daily,
Oct. 14) in defense of corporate pro
fits contains some fundamental mis
statements of fact. The contention
that corporations take only a
"teensy" profit is misleadingly ar
gued on the basis of profits expres
sed as a percentage of sales.
In fact, all the corporations men
tioned have been achieving annual
returns on assets in excess of 16 per
cent (Forbes magazine). These are
substantial returns and possibly in
excess of what might be expected in
a more competitive situation.
Statistics aside, narrowly defined
economic efficiency is not the cent
ral issue in this question. Large con
centration of economic (and thus
political) power and the implications
of this on efficient and equitable
societal operation is the key issue.
Aside from a plea for the rights of the
corporation (which is not generally a
person), the author does not treat
this issue and thus misses the mark
entirely. C D . Kolstad

Lack of consideration
The recent letters to the editor on
the subject of bicycle safety seem to
emphasize the idea that this subject
is one of general concern to bicyc
lists as well as pedestrians. It is clear
to anyone who views the goings-on
between classes that there are very
many, if not too many, bicycles cruis
ing about the campus.
When I am riding, my main con
cern is how I can avoid pedestrians as
well as other bicyclists. I have been
only somewhat successful, suffering
from some near-misses and two
minor collisions.
The main problem lies not simply
in the overcrowdedness; rather it
lies in a lack of consideration as well
as blatant violation of traffic laws by
many bicyclists. It is difficult to make
people more courteous; the best
thing one can do is make all aware of
the problem.
It is possible, however, to issue an
occasional citation for running a stop
sign (for both cyclists and drivers) or
for riding at night with no light; this
might bringthe populace back in line.

This is not an entire solution to the
problem, but possibly it can help to
allevtote it to some minor degree.

Bike hazards
I recently read with great interest
Barry Bakin's letter (Daily, Nov. 15)
concerning the bike hazards on
campus. Unquestionably, bicyclists
who race around campus neglectful
of everything around them are a
hazard to pedestrians, cars, and
other bicyclists. A solution to this
problem might be a speed limit of
five or 10 mph on all bicycles on
campus.
The speed limit could be enforced
by perhaps a bike patrol who had the
authority to issue tickets.
This plan was adopted at Foothill
Jr. College and met with great suc
cess. The bike hazards that existed at
Foothill exist at Stanford. A bike
speed limit solved their problems;
maybe we should let one try to solve
ours.
