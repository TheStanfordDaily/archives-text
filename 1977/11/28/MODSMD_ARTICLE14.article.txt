# Energy exhibition slated
##

Karl Johnson, coordinator of the University's
Energy Conservation Center, hopes to teach the
Stanford community how to "give something of
themselves for Christmas" while reducing its
energy consumption over the holidays through
the New Ways Holidays Events and Exhibits
program.
The program will be held today and tomorrow
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the second floor
lounges of Tresidder.
"It's ironic how Christmas has become the
apex of commercial times when it started out as
a spiritual and reflective time," said Johnson.
According to German Studies Prof. Orrin
Robinson, who served as a faculty liaison in
planning the project, "Interest in energy con
servation has been goirg pretty strong here for
the last year and a half."
In September ASSU Co-President Anne Hen
kels received the National Energy Conservation
Challenge from Colorado University (NACC).
The NACC encourages student bodies to ex
change energy conservation information with
other schools and to compete with them in re
ducing energy consumption.
Henkels, Johnson, Robinson, the SWOPSII73
class on energy conservation and several other
students held a series of conferences earlier this
quarter on this challenge. During this period
Johnson developed the New Ways Holidays
idea.

The program offers many suggestions on how
to recycle materials during the holidays.
The Sierra Club, for example, will be renting
three-foot high live redwood trees for $12-$l4.
After Christmas the club will replant the trees in
the Big Basin and Castle Rock national parks in
Santa Cruz County.
Interactive displays will demonstrate how to
make Christmas candles, cards, wrappings and
decorations.
Some of the exhibits will display alternative
lifestyles for year round use. The Office of Ap
propriate Technology from Sacramento will
bring its "New Possibilities Show" which fea
tures ideas for resource conservation in the
home.
These new technologies reduce costs and
energy intensities in recycling, waste disposal,
transportation, agriculture, and building de
sign.
Representatives from San Jose State will pre
sent "Project Sunshower," their system of solar
collectors which heat water for dorm showers.
About 80 per cent of the shower water in six of
the San Jose State University dorms is now solar
heated. Johnson said the system cost around
$135,000 and should start its pay back period
within 12 to 14 years.
Other exhibits will demonstrate backpacking
skills, organic gardening techniques, bicycle
maintenance and repairs, a windmill, a recycling
process, and a solar oven.

collectors which heat water for dorm showers.
About 80 per cent of the shower water in six of
the San Jose State University dorms is now solar
heated. Johnson said the system cost around
$135,000 and should start its pay back period
within 12 to 14 years.
Other exhibits will demonstrate backpacking
skills, organic gardening techniques, bicycle
maintenance and repairs, a windmill, a recycling
process, and a solar oven.

Karl Johnson, coordinator of the University's
Energy Conservation Center, hopes to teach the
Stanford community how to "give something of
themselves for Christmas" while reducing its
energy consumption over the holidays through
the New Ways Holidays Events and Exhibits
program.
The program will be held today and tomorrow
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the second floor
lounges of Tresidder.
"It's ironic how Christmas has become the
apex of commercial times when it started out as
a spiritual and reflective time," said Johnson.
According to German Studies Prof. Orrin
Robinson, who served as a faculty liaison in
planning the project, "Interest in energy con
servation has been goirg pretty strong here for
the last year and a half."
In September ASSU Co-President Anne Hen
kels received the National Energy Conservation
Challenge from Colorado University (NACC).
The NACC encourages student bodies to ex
change energy conservation information with
other schools and to compete with them in re
ducing energy consumption.
Henkels, Johnson, Robinson, the SWOPSII73
class on energy conservation and several other
students held a series of conferences earlier this
quarter on this challenge. During this period
Johnson developed the New Ways Holidays
idea.

The program offers many suggestions on how
to recycle materials during the holidays.
The Sierra Club, for example, will be renting
three-foot high live redwood trees for $12-$l4.
After Christmas the club will replant the trees in
the Big Basin and Castle Rock national parks in
Santa Cruz County.
Interactive displays will demonstrate how to
make Christmas candles, cards, wrappings and
decorations.
Some of the exhibits will display alternative
lifestyles for year round use. The Office of Ap
propriate Technology from Sacramento will
bring its "New Possibilities Show" which fea
tures ideas for resource conservation in the
home.
These new technologies reduce costs and
energy intensities in recycling, waste disposal,
transportation, agriculture, and building de
sign.
Representatives from San Jose State will pre
sent "Project Sunshower," their system of solar
collectors which heat water for dorm showers.
