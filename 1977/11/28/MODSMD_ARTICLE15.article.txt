# Pavilion repairs near end
## 
### 
The old Encina Pavilion
will be reoccupied by Uni
versity offices Dec. 5 after
completion of renovations
costing nearly $1 million,
according to Gene
Kerschner, associate direc
tor of facilities planning.
The building has been
closed since April.
The pavilion, used from
1921 to 1969 as a basketball
stadium, was converted into
a temporary administration
office building after the 1972
fire in Encina Hall.
University planners
found it would cost one
third less to restructure En
cina Pavilion into a perma
nent office building than to
buy or lease another build
ing, said Kerschner.
