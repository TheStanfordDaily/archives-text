# The
						most desired gifts this season

Leftover Thanksgiving turkey has barely left
the refrigerator shelf and students are as
tonished that the awesome phenomenon called
Christmas is already upon them.
"One of the biggest shopping days of the year
is the day after Thanksgiving," said Linda
Moore, fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue at
the Stanford Shopping Center. And most stores
have spread out their most desired and expen
sive wares to attract the holiday-hungry hordes.
For those with whom price is no object, the
possibilities for costly, eccentric gifts abound.
For the special woman, Saks offers Jean Patou
5000, probably the most expensive perfume in
the world, which sells for $175 an ounce.
For the practical-minded woman who wants
good use along with the high price, there are
Louis Vuitton handbags that average about $300
each with the more elaborately styled ones in
the $600 to $700 range.
A real eye-opener is the price tag on any Salva
tore Ferragamo silk blouse — $150 or more. Four
Christian Dior cotton hankies cost $20. "Defi
nitely what you're paying for is the name,"
Moore said.
Men aren't forgotten during the holidays.
Saks offers a cashmere robe for $285 and Yves
Saint Laurent cashmere socks complete with the
famous YSL initials for $6.50 a pair. To really spoil
a man, there's Givenchy Gentleman bubblebath
— V/i pounds for $16.50.
Barbara Strassberger, manager of Prestige
Inc. at Town and Country Village, said cashmere
sweaters, which range from $55 to $75, silk
blouses and blazers are in, Her shop sells
pigskin blazers which go for $175.
Fourteen karat or more gold chains ranging in
price from $10 to hundreds of dollars are some
of the hottest jewelry items this season, said
Kick Krauss, assistant manager of jewels by
josef. "Diamonds are not that big today.
Watches are, chains and pendants," he said.
Doug Tyler, manager of Mr. Calculator, said
his big seller is the thin-line shirt-pocket cal
culator. His Commodore model which sells for
$19.95 with a liquid crystal display, offers 5000
hoursof computertime. "It'sgreat forbalancing
checkbooks. Everyone uses it . . . business
executives, students, housewives," he said.
Out for its first Christmas season is a com
puterized chess challenger game that allows a
person to play chess with a computer at three
levels of difficulty. Tyler said his $IHO Video
Computer System by Atari is getting a lot of
attention. It offers 27 games with over 138 varia

tions that can be played on any television set.
To satisfy the snob-streak in all calculator to
ters, Tyler sells polished wood executive cal
culator stands for $5.
Retailers indicate that backgammon and Star
Wars games are the big items this season, ac
cording to local reports. Macy's salesclerk Eva
Page said a popular new item is the Wonderful
Waterful series of basketball, ringtoss, or tic tac
toe. The games are encased in a hand-held con
tainer of water. Depressing a button shoots the
ball, ring or kinney through the water towards
its target.
"This game appeals to everyone from age five
to 90. My husband, who's an intern at Stanford
Hospital, plays it all the time," Page said.
A good stocking stuffer for "kids about 20
years old" is the $1.89 puddle jumper, a wooden
propeller that is spun between the palms and
launched'into the air, Page said. In the pet rock
vein, Saks offers a small bag with a lump of coal
in it for $5 for energy-conscious folk.
If the area around Stanford does not inspire
one to unique gift-buying, one can always refer
to the Neiman-Marcus Christmas Book. The
book, printed by the Dallas-based store, has as
its big holiday gift, his and hers windmills for
generating electrical power. Cost? A paltry
$16,000 apiece.
