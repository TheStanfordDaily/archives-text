# Stanford cagers down Cal Poly-Pomona, San Jose St.
## 2 overtime wins thrill crowd as Cards find another freshman sensation 
### 
By David Georgette
Fifty-five turnovers, two
overtimes and two one-point
margins after it all began, the
Stanford Cardinals have a 2-0
basketball record — and a new
star.
Freshman guard Mark Pitch
ford scored 41 points, mostly
on outside jumpers, over the
weekend to spark the Cards to
a 92-91 overtime win over Cal
Poly-Pomona Friday night and
an 81-80 overtime win over San
Jose State Saturday night.
Friday Pitchford excited the
Maples Pavilion crowd with his
deadly shooting (13 of 16) on
the way to a school freshman
record of 28 points. Saturday
he sent the fans into a frenzy
with a jumper from the left side
of the free throw line that gave
Stanford the win.
Pitchford said he was think
ing "just get it up on the
board." That Pitchford and the
Cards even had a shot for the
win, though, was amazing in
itself.
With 44 seconds remaining
in the overtime, the Spartans
led 80-76, and had Mike Men
dez at the foul line for a one
and-one opportunity.
Mendez missed the first free
throw, though, and Pitchford
went down and hit a foul line

jumper with 31 seconds left to
cut the deficit to 80-78.
After the Cards managed to
call time out before the Spar
tans inbounded the ball, Stan
ford applied full-court pres
sure which paid off when
George Schader intercepted a
length-of-the-court pass.
Wolfe Perry missed a
jumper, and San Jose's Stan
Hill came up with the ball —
and one foot out-of-bounds.
When the Cards put the ball
into play, Perry was fouled with
13 seconds remaining. He hit
the first free throw, but missed
the second. Schader grabbed
the rebound, though, and got
it over to Pitchford for the win
ning shot.
Pitchford's heroics in over
time did for Stanford what it
had been unable to do at the
end of regulation. The largest
lead for either team in the sec
ond half had been four points,
and with the score tied at 72
with 13 seconds left, Stanford
had the ball. But Schader's shot
missed, and the tip try by Jay
Carter rolled off the rim as reg
ulation expired.
But on Friday, a miss at the
end of regulation kept the
Cards from losing. Cal Poly-
Pomona center Don Johnson
couldn't convert on his second
free throw with three seconds
left, and the game knotted at
80.
In the overtime, Card center
Je " McHugh scored six of his
17 points, including the two

clinching free throws with nine
seconds left, to help the Cards
to the win.
Stanford had trailed by as
much as seven in the second
half against the Broncos before
Pitchford scored 16 of Stan
ford's 20 points in little over
eight minutes to bring the
Cards within one.
"I thought I was ready," said
Pitchford. "I knew my role. I'm
one of the shooting guards.
They (the Broncos) were play
ing a zone. A quick swing pass,
and there was an open shot."
Pitchford wasn't the only
shooting guard in Maples dur

ing the weekend. The Broncos'
Charles Johnson led Cal Poly-
Pomona with 27 points Friday,
many coming from the out
side, and Saturday the Cards'
Paul Giovacchini netted 19.
The Spartans didn't get a lot
of points from any one of their
backcourt players, but Hill and
forward Tracy Haynes com
bined for 41 points. A 48 per
cent performance by the Spar
tans at the foul line, though,
prevented them from building
a lead. The Spartans missed the
front end of a one-and-one
situation six times in the sec
ond half.

Fifty-five turnovers, two
overtimes and two one-point
margins after it all began, the
Stanford Cardinals have a 2-0
basketball record — and a new
star.
Freshman guard Mark Pitch
ford scored 41 points, mostly
on outside jumpers, over the
weekend to spark the Cards to
a 92-91 overtime win over Cal
Poly-Pomona Friday night and
an 81-80 overtime win over San
Jose State Saturday night.
Friday Pitchford excited the
Maples Pavilion crowd with his
deadly shooting (13 of 16) on
the way to a school freshman
record of 28 points. Saturday
he sent the fans into a frenzy
with a jumper from the left side
of the free throw line that gave
Stanford the win.
Pitchford said he was think
ing "just get it up on the
board." That Pitchford and the
Cards even had a shot for the
win, though, was amazing in
itself.
With 44 seconds remaining
in the overtime, the Spartans
led 80-76, and had Mike Men
dez at the foul line for a one
and-one opportunity.
Mendez missed the first free
throw, though, and Pitchford
went down and hit a foul line

jumper with 31 seconds left to
cut the deficit to 80-78.
After the Cards managed to
call time out before the Spar
tans inbounded the ball, Stan
ford applied full-court pres
sure which paid off when
George Schader intercepted a
length-of-the-court pass.
Wolfe Perry missed a
jumper, and San Jose's Stan
Hill came up with the ball —
and one foot out-of-bounds.
When the Cards put the ball
into play, Perry was fouled with
13 seconds remaining. He hit
the first free throw, but missed
the second. Schader grabbed
the rebound, though, and got
it over to Pitchford for the win
ning shot.
Pitchford's heroics in over
time did for Stanford what it
had been unable to do at the
end of regulation. The largest
lead for either team in the sec
ond half had been four points,
and with the score tied at 72
with 13 seconds left, Stanford
had the ball. But Schader's shot
missed, and the tip try by Jay
Carter rolled off the rim as reg
ulation expired.
But on Friday, a miss at the
end of regulation kept the
Cards from losing. Cal Poly-
Pomona center Don Johnson
couldn't convert on his second
free throw with three seconds
left, and the game knotted at
80.
In the overtime, Card center
Je " McHugh scored six of his
17 points, including the two

clinching free throws with nine
seconds left, to help the Cards
to the win.
Stanford had trailed by as
much as seven in the second
half against the Broncos before
Pitchford scored 16 of Stan
ford's 20 points in little over
eight minutes to bring the
Cards within one.
"I thought I was ready," said
Pitchford. "I knew my role. I'm
one of the shooting guards.
They (the Broncos) were play
ing a zone. A quick swing pass,
and there was an open shot."
Pitchford wasn't the only
shooting guard in Maples dur

ing the weekend. The Broncos'
Charles Johnson led Cal Poly-
Pomona with 27 points Friday,
many coming from the out

Paul Giovacchini netted 19.

with 13 seconds left, Stanford
had the ball. But Schader's shot
missed, and the tip try by Jay
Carter rolled off the rim as reg
ulation expired.
But on Friday, a miss at the
end of regulation kept the
Cards from losing. Cal Poly-
Pomona center Don Johnson
couldn't convert on his second
free throw with three seconds
left, and the game knotted at
80.
In the overtime, Card center
Je " McHugh scored six of his
17 points, including the two

clinching free throws with nine
seconds left, to help the Cards
to the win.
Stanford had trailed by as
much as seven in the second
half against the Broncos before
Pitchford scored 16 of Stan
ford's 20 points in little over
eight minutes to bring the
Cards within one.
"I thought I was ready," said
Pitchford. "I knew my role. I'm
one of the shooting guards.
They (the Broncos) were play
ing a zone. A quick swing pass,
and there was an open shot."
Pitchford wasn't the only
shooting guard in Maples dur

ing the weekend. The Broncos'
Charles Johnson led Cal Poly-
Pomona with 27 points Friday,
many coming from the out
side, and Saturday the Cards'
Paul Giovacchini netted 19.
The Spartans didn't get a lot
of points from any one of their
backcourt players, but Hill and
forward Tracy Haynes com
bined for 41 points. A 48 per
cent performance by the Spar
tans at the foul line, though,
prevented them from building
a lead. The Spartans missed the
front end of a one-and-one
situation six times in the sec
ond half.
