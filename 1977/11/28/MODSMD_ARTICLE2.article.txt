Developing new and better ways
to replace damaged skin and repair
severed nerves are two of the objec
tives of the Collagen Corporation, a
group of Stanford affiliated doctors
and researchers.
Collagen is the "primary structural
component of the body," according
to Dr. Rod Perkins, a Palo Alto physi
cian and member of the corporation.
According to Perkins, parts of the
body are made up of collagen, such
as tendons, bones, heart valves, the
cornea of the eye and the dura mater,
or brain covering.
The corporation, by producingthis
structural protein in a purified form,
is able to experiment with what Per
kins terms "biosynthetic grafts of col
lagen material." He cited several
examples: eardrum substitutes, a
type of "splint" for severed nerves
and implantation of collagen under
the skin to correct skin damage re
sulting from congenital defects or
disease.
"In addition, a special dressing of
collagen for application to burn
wounds is under development and
testing," Perkins said.
Dr. John Daniels, assistant profes
sor of medicine here, and Dr. Terry
Knapp, a member of the University's
clinical faculty and a plastic surgeon,
were working on developing a colla
gen implant for skin defects when
they joined forces with Edward Luck
and Perkins in 1975 to form the Col
lagen Corporation.
Liquid form
Knapp is currently experimenting
with two types of collagen products.
One is "a liquid form of collagen

which is injected into the body for
the correction of contour problems"
such as result from skin disease.
"When injected, (collagen) be
comes the frame for new living tissue
— it becomes a part of the new living
tissue," Knapp said.
Knapp's second project involves
burn dressing using collagen pro
duced by the corporation. This burn
dressing "is made of highly purified
collagen, then applied to burn
wounds as a skin substitute of a tem
porary nature."
Knapp explained, "The cardinal
principle of reconstructive surgery is
to replace like with like. Collagen
implants tend to swing towards that

basic principle."
Though still in the experimental
mode in both of his projects, Knapp
said he estimates that the clinical
tests thus far have been "promising"
and he said there have been
"enough favorable results to make
widespread use in the future (ap
pear) optimistic."
Edward Luck, on leave from the
University of Washington Medical
School, began developing a unique
method of making a membrane from
collagen molecules for use as ear
drum implants in 1971. Luck was
working for Project HEAR, a non
profit medical institute for ear re
search at the time.

The initial clinical trials of collagen
for correcting skin tissue defects
took place at the Stanford Plastic
Surgery Clinic under the direction of
Knapp and Dr. Ernest Kaplan.
Kaplan, an associate professor of
surgery, has been experimenting
with projects involving the use of
solid rather than liquid (implantable)
collagen. One Kaplan described as
an experimental process whereby
skin tissue can be "grown outside
the body."
'Thin sheet'
A biopsy, or "separation of the
epidermal from the dermal or colla
gen layer of the skin" is performed,
and a small piece of epidermis from
an individual is placed on a "thin
sheet" of collagen membrane.
The epidermis "expands" as a re
sult of the protein from the collagen
and special laboratory conditions
and may then theoretically be trans
planted back onto the patient, Kap
lan explained.
The objective of the process, still
in the developing stages, is im
provement in skin grafting for larger
areas of damage such as result from
burns, Kaplan said.
Another application of solid
purified collagen is repairing nerves
which have been severed or other
wise damaged. Kaplan, working in
conjunction with Joseph Rosen, a

fourth year medical student here,
reported "improved results in terms
of nerve function" when collagen
membrane instead of suturing is
used in tests on animal nerves.
Kaplan, Rosen and members of the
Collagen Corporation all stressed
that developments in collagen thus
far are still in the experimental stage.
"Work, discipline, time and
money," are necessary for further
improvements in purified collagen
according to Perkins. However, he
said he foresees good prospects for
collagen. "In the future, the de
velopment (of collagen) and the
amplification of this development
could contribute to the quality and
length of life."

Liquid form
Knapp is currently experimenting
with two types of collagen products.
One is "a liquid form of collagen

which is injected into the body for
the correction of contour problems"
such as result from skin disease.
"When injected, (collagen) be
comes the frame for new living tissue
— it becomes a part of the new living
tissue," Knapp said.
Knapp's second project involves
burn dressing using collagen pro
duced by the corporation. This burn
dressing "is made of highly purified
collagen, then applied to burn
wounds as a skin substitute of a tem
porary nature."
Knapp explained, "The cardinal
principle of reconstructive surgery is
to replace like with like. Collagen
implants tend to swing towards that

basic principle."
Though still in the experimental
mode in both of his projects, Knapp
said he estimates that the clinical
tests thus far have been "promising"
and he said there have been
"enough favorable results to make
widespread use in the future (ap
pear) optimistic."
Edward Luck, on leave from the
University of Washington Medical
School, began developing a unique
method of making a membrane from
collagen molecules for use as ear
drum implants in 1971. Luck was
working for Project HEAR, a non
profit medical institute for ear re
search at the time.

The initial clinical trials of collagen
for correcting skin tissue defects
took place at the Stanford Plastic
Surgery Clinic under the direction of
Knapp and Dr. Ernest Kaplan.
Kaplan, an associate professor of
surgery, has been experimenting
with projects involving the use of
solid rather than liquid (implantable)
collagen. One Kaplan described as
an experimental process whereby
skin tissue can be "grown outside
the body."
'Thin sheet'
A biopsy, or "separation of the
epidermal from the dermal or colla
gen layer of the skin" is performed,
and a small piece of epidermis from
an individual is placed on a "thin
sheet" of collagen membrane.
The epidermis "expands" as a re
sult of the protein from the collagen
and special laboratory conditions
and may then theoretically be trans
planted back onto the patient, Kap
lan explained.
The objective of the process, still
in the developing stages, is im
provement in skin grafting for larger
areas of damage such as result from
burns, Kaplan said.
Another application of solid
purified collagen is repairing nerves
which have been severed or other
wise damaged. Kaplan, working in
conjunction with Joseph Rosen, a

fourth year medical student here,
reported "improved results in terms
of nerve function" when collagen
membrane instead of suturing is
used in tests on animal nerves.
Kaplan, Rosen and members of the
Collagen Corporation all stressed
that developments in collagen thus
far are still in the experimental stage.
"Work, discipline, time and
money," are necessary for further
improvements in purified collagen
according to Perkins. However, he
said he foresees good prospects for
collagen. "In the future, the de
velopment (of collagen) and the
amplification of this development
could contribute to the quality and
length of life."
Developing new and better ways
to replace damaged skin and repair
severed nerves are two of the objec
tives of the Collagen Corporation, a
group of Stanford affiliated doctors
and researchers.
Collagen is the "primary structural
component of the body," according
to Dr. Rod Perkins, a Palo Alto physi
cian and member of the corporation.
According to Perkins, parts of the
body are made up of collagen, such
as tendons, bones, heart valves, the
cornea of the eye and the dura mater,
or brain covering.
The corporation, by producingthis
structural protein in a purified form,
is able to experiment with what Per
kins terms "biosynthetic grafts of col
lagen material." He cited several
examples: eardrum substitutes, a
type of "splint" for severed nerves
and implantation of collagen under
the skin to correct skin damage re
sulting from congenital defects or
disease.
"In addition, a special dressing of
collagen for application to burn
wounds is under development and
testing," Perkins said.
Dr. John Daniels, assistant profes
sor of medicine here, and Dr. Terry
Knapp, a member of the University's
clinical faculty and a plastic surgeon,
were working on developing a colla
gen implant for skin defects when
they joined forces with Edward Luck
