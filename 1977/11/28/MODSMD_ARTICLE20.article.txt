# Card poloists yield title to Cal
## No. 3 Irvine upends top-seeded Stanford in NCAA semifinal 9-7; Cardinals turn back Pepperdine, 10-6 in 'no-consolation' match

Providence, R.I. â€” UC-lrvine
edged Stanford's water polo
team, 9-7, in a NCAA Champ
ionship semifinal match at
Brown Universitv Saturday
night to end the Ca.dinals' bid
for a second consecutive na
tional crown.
Sunday California downed
the Anteaters, 8-6, to clam the
NCAA title and Stanford de
feated Pepperdine, 10-6, to
take third.
Stanford coasted to an easy
14-2 victory over host Brown in
the opening round >of play
Saturday morning.
"We lived and died by the
extra-man situation," said
Stanford coach Dante De
ttamanti about the Irvine
game.
Stanford, which scored con

sistently on six-on-five situa
tions during the season, con
verted on only one out of five
against the Anteaters. Irvine,
on the other hand, scored on
all seven of its opportunities.
According to Dettamanti Ir
vine's success was partiallydue
to the Anteaters switching their
players to different positions
each time, making it confusing
for Stanford to guess where the
shot might come from.
"We started out by guarding
(Irvine's star) Gary Figueroa
man-to-man. That left some
one open and Irvine found the
open man," Dettamanti said.
Stanford's inability to score
on the extra-man situations
was caused by a combination
of numerous near misses and a
pre-planned Irvine defense to
shut down Stanford's Doug

Burke-to-Tom Angelo play that
had been so successful for the
Cards this season.
Stanford led for most of the
game and at the end of the
third quarter the Cardinals
held a 7-6 advantage.
The fourth quarter, how
ever, was all Irvine as the An
teaters scored three while
shutting out the Cardinal of
fense entirely.
Echoing the team's disap
pointment, senior Rick
Johannsen said, "It was disap
pointing; but some things just
happen. We didn't play a super
game, but I think we played
well enough to win except for
our six-on-five defense,"
Burke said.
Dettamanti also said that he
was dissatisfied with the seed
ingforthe tournament. He said
he felt that Irvine should have

been seeded ahead of third
ranked Pepperdine. That seed
ing would have pitted Pepper
dine, instead of Irvine, against
Stanford in the semifinal.
As it happened, the Cards
faced the Waves in the anti
climatic battle for the bronze
plague.
The two teams played the
first half even as the first and
second quarters ended in 2-2
and 4-4 ties, respectively.
Coming out in the second
half, however, Robby Arnold
scored two goals in the first
three minutes and the Cards
never looked back.
Senior Marty Davis and
freshman goalie John Gansel
were chosen to the all
tournament team which was
announced after the final
game.
