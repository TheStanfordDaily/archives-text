Rhodesian leader, blacks to talk
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Prime Minister lan Smith
and moderate black politicians are expected to
start talks this week about an internal settlement
despite the opposition of guerrilla leaders and
skepticism abroad.
While the politicians prepared, Rhodesian jet
tighter-bombers swept in and out of a military base
near Salisbury without official explanation.
Neighboring Mozambique claimed Rhodesia had
launched a major offensive against black
nationalist guerrilla forces based in Mozambique.
In a surprise statement Thursday, Smith offered
to open immediate talks with black leaders based
inside Rhodesia and pledged himself to elections
with universal suffrage. Government officials said
they expect the talks to open late this week.
Sources said that the moderate blacks accepted
the proposed talks after secret consultations with
Smith.
Smith is said to believe that the moderates can
command support for an internal settlement from
more than 85 per cent of Rhodesia's 6.4 million
blacks.
Congress back for energy work
Washington — A Congress frustrated by deep
seated disagreements on energy, abortion and
other issues goes back to work tomorrow in an
effort to salvage a record of achievement in 1977.
While the lawmakers have enacted substintial
legislation, they have not attained President Jimmy
Carter's number one goal for the year — writing a
comprehensive energy policy.
House and Senate conferees, who have been
working off and on for more than a month to
reconcile widely different versions, take up the
task again today amid predictions they will not
finish the job before mid-December at the earliest.
The two chambers themselves reconvene to

morrow. They had hoped to adjourn early in Oc
tober, but instead have taken an informal recess
since Oct. 20 while their spokesmen deliberated.
The House has scheduled an ambitious legisla
tive program designed to clear the decks of legisla
tion already essentially agreed upon or likely to
be.
Carter's foreign trip after Xmas
Camp David, Md. — President Jimmy Carter in
tends to leave after Christmas on a foreign trip,
and will look for signs this week that Congress will
complete an acceptable energy program by then,
his chief spokesman said yesterday.
Press Secretary Jody Powell said he didn't know
when Carter would officially announce the
scaled-down trip and the departure date.
Asked whether that meant the trip was off, Pow
ell replied, "No." He said several details remain to
be worked out.
Carter originally had planned to leave Nov. 22,
on an 11-day, nine-country journey to South
America, Africa, Asia and Europe, butcalled off the
trip to follow the progress of his energy program.
Zbigniew Brzezinski, the president's foreign
policy adviser, has said Carter will divide the De
cember trip into two parts — perhaps visiting Af
rica, Asia and Europe, but postponing stops in
South America until the spring.
Many die in Thanksgiving traffic
Madison, Wis. — As the four-day Thanksgiving
weekend neared an end and holiday travelers
headed home over snow- and ice-covered roads in
some parts of the country, authorities reported
that more than 450 persons died on the nation's
highways.
By 9 p.m. PST yesterday, the death toll was 458.
In addition to the usual crush of holiday traffic,
motorists had to cope with hazardous driving

conditions.
A snowstorm roared through the Midwest and
headed east on one of the year's busiest traveling
days yesterday, knotting traffic on the interstate
highway system as the Thanksgiving holiday death
toll climbed.
"The troopers are going to one accident and if
there's no one injured they go on to the next one
until they find someone that's injured," Jim
Rockweiler, a Wisconsin State Patrol officer said.
"They're taking care of the ones with injuries first
and then going back to the others."
The National Safety Council had predicted 460
to 560 persons could die in traffic accidents during
the holiday weekend period from 6 p.m. Wednes
day to midnight yesterday.
The record for most traffic deaths on the holiday
is 764 in 1968.
