## 
### 
Cairo (AP) — Egypt delivered for
mal invitations yesterday to a pre
paratory peace conference in Cairo
next week while Syria soughfto un
dermine President Anwar Sadat's in
itiative.
Sadat said in a television interview
that representatives at the Cairo
summit would sit around a table and
work without a mediator. He said he
was forging ahead toward a com
prehensive Mideast settlement at
Geneva even if the Arab world disag
reed.
The Egyptian president said he had
informed neither the United States
nor his Arab allies in advance about
the Cairo meeting. He said he in
tended to call an Arab summit con
ference after reaching a settlement at
Geneva.
Sadat said the Cairo meeting could
start as early as next Saturday, but
official sources said it might be de
layed for a week beyond that.
U.S. invitation
Sadat's acting foreign minister,
Butros Ghali, delivered the formal
invitations to the ambassadors of the
United States and the Soviet Union,

co-chairmen of the Geneva peac£
conference, and those of Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Syria yesterday for
mally rejected Sadat's invitation to a
pre-Geneva conference and called it
a ploy to justify visits by Israeli offi
cials to Cairo.
However, Syrian Ambassador
Ahmed al Assaad said he would for
ward it to his government. He was
asked if there was a chance Syria
might attend and replied, "Until
now, no."
In a statement broadcast over
Damascus Radio, a government
spokesman said Syria "definitely re
jects" the meeting.
'Rejectionist summit'
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim
Khaddam said Syria would attend an
Arab "rejectionist summit" in
Tripoli, Libya, on Thursday "to create
a strong anti-Sadat front."
That meeting, reportedly initiated
by Libya and Algeria, will be ah effort
to isolate Sadat in his latest peace
efforts. Iraq, South Yemen and the
PLO were also expected to attend.
Syrian sources said the govern

ment has launched a major diploma
tic offensive to undermine Sadat's
meeting. They said Syria asked Jor
dan, Lebanon and the Palestine Lib
eration Organization to refuse
Sadat's invitation to the meeting.
It was not immediately know if the
United States was given an invitation
to deliver to Israel or if one had been
extended to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which has said it
would not attend anyway.
Palestinians invited
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry offi
cial told reporters that Palestinians
had been invited and added,
"Everyone will interpret who the
Palestinians are according to their
own position. Egypt's position is
clear."
Egypt accepted a resolution at the
1974 Arab summit conference calling
the PLO the sole representative of
the Palestinian people. But the offi
cial's statement appeared to indicate
Egypt was looking for a way to over
come Israeli objections to sitting
down with the PLO.
A spokesman for Israeli Prime
Minister Menahem Begin said in
Jerusalem that Israel would not go to
Cairo if the PLO sent a representa-
Cairo meeting
Begin also said Israel would attend
the Cairo meeting even if it meant
negotiating only with Egyptians.
Sadat said Saturday that if no Arabs
came he would talk with the Israelis.
The Israeli leader said his cabinet
would choose its negotiator after the
formal invitation has been received.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan was
considered a likely choice.
In ruling out a trip to Cairo, Syria
and the PLO announced they would
attend an Arab "refusal summit"
scheduled Thursday in Tripoli, Libya,
to form a unified opposition to
Sadat's initiative. Also expected to at
tend that meeting are representa
tives' from Algeria, Iraq and South
Yemen that are opposed to any deals

to isolate Sadat in his latest peace
efforts. Iraq, South Yemen and the
PLO were also expected to attend.
Syrian sources said the govern

ment has launched a major diploma
tic offensive to undermine Sadat's
meeting. They said Syria asked Jor
dan, Lebanon and the Palestine Lib
eration Organization to refuse
Sadat's invitation to the meeting.
It was not immediately know if the
United States was given an invitation
to deliver to Israel or if one had been
extended to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which has said it
would not attend anyway.
Palestinians invited
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry offi
cial told reporters that Palestinians
had been invited and added,
"Everyone will interpret who the
Palestinians are according to their
own position. Egypt's position is
clear."
Egypt accepted a resolution at the
1974 Arab summit conference calling
the PLO the sole representative of
the Palestinian people. But the offi
cial's statement appeared to indicate
Egypt was looking for a way to over
come Israeli objections to sitting
down with the PLO.
A spokesman for Israeli Prime
Minister Menahem Begin said in
Jerusalem that Israel would not go to
Cairo if the PLO sent a representa-
Cairo meeting
Begin also said Israel would attend
the Cairo meeting even if it meant
negotiating only with Egyptians.
Sadat said Saturday that if no Arabs
came he would talk with the Israelis.
The Israeli leader said his cabinet
would choose its negotiator after the
formal invitation has been received.
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan was
considered a likely choice.
In ruling out a trip to Cairo, Syria
and the PLO announced they would
attend an Arab "refusal summit"
scheduled Thursday in Tripoli, Libya,
to form a unified opposition to
Sadat's initiative. Also expected to at
tend that meeting are representa

Yemen that are opposed to any deals
with Israel.

a ploy to justify visits by Israeli offi

asked if there was a chance Syria
might attend and replied, "Until
now, no."
In a statement broadcast over
Damascus Radio, a government
spokesman said Syria "definitely re
jects" the meeting.
'Rejectionist summit'
Foreign Minister Abdul Halim
Khaddam said Syria would attend an
Arab "rejectionist summit" in
Tripoli, Libya, on Thursday "to create
