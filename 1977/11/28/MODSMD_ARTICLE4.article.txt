"In arthritis, nothing can be done," goes a
common phrase. With a three-year, $335,000 grant
from the National Institutes of Health, the Stan
ford Arthritis Center hopes to counter that claim.
Although funding is for only three years, the
center is implementing 10-year studies to evaluate
and develop ways of managing arthritis, said Dr.
Halsted Holman, director of the center.
The center was one of 15 institutions to receive
funds made available by the National Arthritis Act
of 1974. Some 65 institutions applied for the grant,
according to Jim Fries, associate director of the
center.
The Stanford facility is working with the Vete
rans Hospital, Children's Hospital, Valley Medical
Center and various medical clinics in Palo Alto to
research the 128 types of arthritis and to evaluate
the outcomes of current treatment.
Funding for the center began Oct. 1. Since then,
the center has been investigating arthritis treat

merit and surgery and the benefits of drugs used to
manage arthritis.
Like diabetes, some forms of arthritis cannot be
treated, but only managed, typically through bed
rest and drug use, said Holman.
Other projects planned for the arthritis institu
tions include checking the outcome of improved
patient education and self-care, examining the
benefits of patients seeing teams of specialists
rather than one physician and studying disabling
effects of arthritis in children.
80 per cent
"Arthritis is becoming increasingly prevalent,"
said Holman. "It is estimated that 80 percent of the
population will eventually contract some form of
the disease."
He added that since arthritis hampers mobility
and limits patients in their work, it is both bother
some and costly to the nation.
"Arthritis is one of the three most common dis
eases in the world today and is one of the leading

causes of disability," Holman said.
Fries explained that the federal government has
appropriated about $5 million for arthritis re
search.
Maximum leverage
"This boils down to 10 cents for each afflicted
person," he said. "There's not much direct care
you can give for a dime. We have to make
maximum leverage of that money, by training
young physicians and evaluating new research re
sults."
Holman said the center is trying to find an inex
pensive way for arthritis sufferers to at least cope
with the disease.
Fries said that in about six months, the center
will be fully staffed by about 50 persons, including
clinical scholars, medical students, paid staff fa
culty and two undergraduates. He added that at
least 2000 patients will be involved in the research
and treatment programs.

population will eventually contract some form of
the disease."
He added that since arthritis hampers mobility
and limits patients in their work, it is both bother
some and costly to the nation.
"Arthritis is one of the three most common dis
eases in the world today and is one of the leading

causes of disability," Holman said.
Fries explained that the federal government has
appropriated about $5 million for arthritis re
search.
Maximum leverage
"This boils down to 10 cents for each afflicted
person," he said. "There's not much direct care
you can give for a dime. We have to make
maximum leverage of that money, by training
young physicians and evaluating new research re
sults."
Holman said the center is trying to find an inex
pensive way for arthritis sufferers to at least cope
with the disease.
Fries said that in about six months, the center
will be fully staffed by about 50 persons, including
clinical scholars, medical students, paid staff fa
culty and two undergraduates. He added that at
least 2000 patients will be involved in the research
and treatment programs.
"In arthritis, nothing can be done," goes a
common phrase. With a three-year, $335,000 grant
from the National Institutes of Health, the Stan
ford Arthritis Center hopes to counter that claim.
Although funding is for only three years, the
center is implementing 10-year studies to evaluate
and develop ways of managing arthritis, said Dr.
Halsted Holman, director of the center.
The center was one of 15 institutions to receive
funds made available by the National Arthritis Act
of 1974. Some 65 institutions applied for the grant,
according to Jim Fries, associate director of the
center.
The Stanford facility is working with the Vete
rans Hospital, Children's Hospital, Valley Medical
Center and various medical clinics in Palo Alto to
research the 128 types of arthritis and to evaluate
the outcomes of current treatment.
Funding for the center began Oct. 1. Since then,
the center has been investigating arthritis treat

merit and surgery and the benefits of drugs used to
manage arthritis.
Like diabetes, some forms of arthritis cannot be
treated, but only managed, typically through bed
rest and drug use, said Holman.
Other projects planned for the arthritis institu
tions include checking the outcome of improved
patient education and self-care, examining the
benefits of patients seeing teams of specialists
rather than one physician and studying disabling
effects of arthritis in children.
80 per cent
"Arthritis is becoming increasingly prevalent,"
said Holman. "It is estimated that 80 percent of the
population will eventually contract some form of
the disease."
He added that since arthritis hampers mobility
and limits patients in their work, it is both bother
some and costly to the nation.
