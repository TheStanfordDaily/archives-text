# Financial problems forestall an end to Manzanita

Manzanita Park should be es
tablished as "emergency hous
ing" intended to be in use for
three to five years, a Board of
Trustees resolution stated in 1969.
"The University should pro
ceed immediately with the plan
ning necessary to construct 460
permanent spaces to replace
Manzanita Park," stated a 1974 re
port on undergraduate student
housing needs.
And, now that Manzanita is in
its ninth year of occupancy, Uni
versity officials still say the trailers
should be replaced, although no
specific plans to do so have been
made.
According to Residential Educa
tion Director Norm Robinson, a
study is being conducted this year
through the Office of Residential
Education concerning the future
of Manzanita Park.
The trailers have not been re
placed "primarily because of
money,'' said Robinson. How
ever, if the report shows that re
placing the trailers is absolutely
necessary, the University would
borrow the money needed to
build new residences, Robinson
added.
- Money to repay housing loans
comes from a debt service charge
included in students' room and
board rates, Robinson explained.
The results of the study on
housing needs are expected by
June, said Robinson, but it would
be "a minimum of two years" be
fore new housing could be built.
"We know that Manzanita Park

has to be replaced," said Robin
son, "but the study will also de
termine if we need more spaces in
the housing system than just the
460 needed to replace Man
zanita."
Edward Scoles, director of
housing and food services, said
the study will also look into
"where new resident spaces
should be allocated, such as to
graduates or undergraduates, and
where they should be built."
However, new spaces being
built does not guarantee Man
zanita's replacement. In the years
since the 1974 report was submit
ted calling for housing spaces to
replace the trailers, 250 new
spaces have been created.
Approximately 100 of these
were provided by putting rooms
in the first floor of Florence
Moore Hall. Three new Row
houses (American Studies, Casa
Italiana and 558 Mayfield) pro
vided an additional 150 spaces.
No spaces in the trailers were
eliminated, however, because
"there is still a very strong de
mand for undergraduate on
campus housing," said Scoles.
Even if new residences are built
within the next several years, the
decision to abolish Manzanita
Park "could go either way,"
Scoles said. He added that the
issue is "ultimately a trustee deci
sion."
In the meantime, Manzanita has
undergone several major repairs
"done with the idea of making it
last until something else is built to
replace it," said Robinson.

According to Scoles, the Uni
versity has spent "approximately
$150,000 in the last couple years"
for major repairs. New furniture
and carpeting was purchased in
1976 and the front steps to the
trailers were recently replaced.
In addition, at least half the
showers had to be replaced be
cause "there was a flaw in the way
in which the showers were built.
Apparently some of them were
leaking and rotting away the floor
underneath the shower," Scoles
explained.
Scoles also said the University

spends "about $20,000 to $25,000
annually in ongoing repairs" for
the trailers.
"The park has pretty much paid
for itself," said Scoles, although
"it took about seven and a half
years of operation to break even."
The initial cost of the park "ran
about $1,350,000," he added.
Students also complain that
"paper-thin walls" take away from
their privacy and provide insuffi
cient insulation against cold and
heat.
However, the 1974 housing re
port urged that the park be re

placed not because of its physical
limitations, but "because the facil
ity, largely because of the ar
chitecture, cannot provide the
most important elements of suc
cessful undergraduate life at Stan
ford — group living and dining —
characteristics which all other un
dergraduate residences except
Mirrielees share."
Greg Wallace, one of five house
associates (RAs) at Manzanita,
said "We are trying this year to
have a lot of activities which are
section-oriented to get more a
