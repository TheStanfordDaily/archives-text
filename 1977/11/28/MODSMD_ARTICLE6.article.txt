# Through economic warfare
## Rhodesia needs change 
### 
Rodney Johnson

The illegal white minority regime
in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) has been
under continuous attack from both
the international community and in
ternal movements sponsored by the
Zimbabwe Patriotir Front which is
composed of the Zimbabwe African
National Union (ZANU) and the Zim
babwe African People's Union
(ZAPU).
These pressures are a result of
Prime Minister lan Smith's Rhode
sian Front government's Unilateral
Declaration of Independence from
Great Britain. After UDI, economic
sanctions were imposed on Smith's
regime to coerce them into a settle
ment. FHowever, these sanctions
have not yet been successful.
The British government im
mediately imposed economic sanc
tions against the rebel regime.
Rhodesia was expelled from the
Sterling area, and Commonwealth
preference on purchases of Rhode
sian goods was ended. Sanctions
went on to include a ban on the sale
of oil by British firms to Rhodesia.
In 1968, President Lyndon lohnson
issued an executive order, still in
force, which forbids: "sale or supply
by any person subject to the jurisdic
tion of the United States, or any
other activities by any such person
which promote or are calculated to
promote the sale or supply, to any
body in Southern Rhodesia or to any
person or anybody for the purpose
of any business carried on in or oper
ated from Southern Rhodesia, of any
commodities or products."
But as is the case with most embar
gos and economic sanctions on
Rhodesia, they are either token sanc
tions or are violated.
Sanction breaking
In june 1976, the United Church of
Christ released a booklet entitled
"The Oil Conspiracy" which charged
Mobil Oil Corp. of diverting pet
roleum products to Rhodesia
through Mobil of South Africa —
fully owned by Mobil Oil Corp. of
America. This charge implies that top
Mobil executi .es might be guilty of
criminal violations of United States
law.
The booklet says that three parties
set up an elaborate paper chase,

which included false billing, phony
mail drops, bogus accounts with
existing South African firms, and
dummy corporations.
No proof
In late May, the U.S. Treasury
Dept. announced that it could find
no proof in the United States that
Mobil Oil Corp. had violated the
American embargo against
Rhodesia, and that South African
secrecy laws had prevented the de
partment from looking at the files of
Mobil's South African subsidiary. As
a result, the issue remains in limbo.
Oil, arms and other goods are en
tering Rhodesia in violation of sanc
tions. South Africa has provided the
Rhodesian regime with the most ef
fective economic and military sup
port. This underlines the need to
support actions to secure change in
South Africa. South African support
serves to undermine the already
weak attempts of the Western pow
ers to effect change in Rhodesia.
Western powers have good
reasons for offering impotent
methods of dealing with Rhodesia.
First, Rhodesia is in a strategic loca
tion and is the second largest non
communist producer of chromium.
Secondly, if the white minority re
gime folds in Rhodesia, it will cer
tainly hasten the same eminent
change in South Africa.
Effects of sanctions
Theoretically, economic sanctions
on Rhodesia can have varied nega
tive effects. Sanctions could make it
difficult to preserve equilibrium in
the balance of payments and main
tain the value of the Rhodesian
pound.
Sanctions could make it difficult to
secure the internal credit position,
and make it difficult to maintain as far
as possible, levels of income and
employment.
Rhodesia's four per cent white
population has a lot at stake and is
not relinquishing its control without
continued pressure from both within
and without the state. The 96 per cent
black population has a lot to gain and
a lot to lose. But blacks in South Af
rica are saying that they are willing to
share the costs.

The South African Students Or
ganization (SASO) is indirectly sup
porting the international com
munity's actions to effect change in
Rhodesia by supporting sanctions
against South Africa. "SASO sees
foreign investments as giving stabil
ity to South Africa's exploitative re
gime, committing South Africa's
steady partners to supporting this
regime. For this reason, SASO rejects
foreign investment."
Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert
Luthuli said, "The economic boycott
of South Africa will entail undoubted
hardships for Africans. We do not
doubt that. But if it is a method which
the day of blood, the suffer
ing to us will be a price we are willing
to pay."
Token measures have been insti
tuted against Rhodesia — token
sanctions, embargosand token talks.
If Great Britain, the U.S. or the UN
want to truly effect change in
Rhodesia, it must support strong
economic warfare against Rhodesia
and South Africa. Again the Western
world has provided lip service and
empty policies.

No proof
In late May, the U.S. Treasury
Dept. announced that it could find
no proof in the United States that
Mobil Oil Corp. had violated the
American embargo against
Rhodesia, and that South African
secrecy laws had prevented the de
partment from looking at the files of
Mobil's South African subsidiary. As
a result, the issue remains in limbo.
Oil, arms and other goods are en
tering Rhodesia in violation of sanc
tions. South Africa has provided the
Rhodesian regime with the most ef
fective economic and military sup
port. This underlines the need to
support actions to secure change in
South Africa. South African support
serves to undermine the already
weak attempts of the Western pow
ers to effect change in Rhodesia.
Western powers have good
reasons for offering impotent
methods of dealing with Rhodesia.
First, Rhodesia is in a strategic loca
tion and is the second largest non
communist producer of chromium.
Secondly, if the white minority re
gime folds in Rhodesia, it will cer
tainly hasten the same eminent
change in South Africa.
Effects of sanctions
Theoretically, economic sanctions
on Rhodesia can have varied nega
tive effects. Sanctions could make it
difficult to preserve equilibrium in
the balance of payments and main
tain the value of the Rhodesian
pound.
Sanctions could make it difficult to
secure the internal credit position,
and make it difficult to maintain as far
as possible, levels of income and
employment.
Rhodesia's four per cent white
population has a lot at stake and is
not relinquishing its control without
continued pressure from both within
and without the state. The 96 per cent
black population has a lot to gain and
a lot to lose. But blacks in South Af
rica are saying that they are willing to
share the costs.

The South African Students Or
ganization (SASO) is indirectly sup
porting the international com
munity's actions to effect change in
Rhodesia by supporting sanctions
against South Africa. "SASO sees
foreign investments as giving stabil
ity to South Africa's exploitative re
gime, committing South Africa's
steady partners to supporting this
regime. For this reason, SASO rejects
foreign investment."
Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert
Luthuli said, "The economic boycott
of South Africa will entail undoubted
hardships for Africans. We do not
doubt that. But if it is a method which
the day of blood, the suffer
ing to us will be a price we are willing
to pay."
Token measures have been insti
tuted against Rhodesia — token
sanctions, embargosand token talks.
If Great Britain, the U.S. or the UN
want to truly effect change in
Rhodesia, it must support strong
economic warfare against Rhodesia
and South Africa. Again the Western
world has provided lip service and
empty policies.

The illegal white minority regime
in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) has been
under continuous attack from both
the international community and in
ternal movements sponsored by the
Zimbabwe Patriotir Front which is
composed of the Zimbabwe African
National Union (ZANU) and the Zim
babwe African People's Union
(ZAPU).
These pressures are a result of
Prime Minister lan Smith's Rhode
sian Front government's Unilateral
Declaration of Independence from
Great Britain. After UDI, economic
sanctions were imposed on Smith's
regime to coerce them into a settle
ment. FHowever, these sanctions
have not yet been successful.
The British government im
mediately imposed economic sanc
tions against the rebel regime.
Rhodesia was expelled from the
Sterling area, and Commonwealth
preference on purchases of Rhode
sian goods was ended. Sanctions
went on to include a ban on the sale
of oil by British firms to Rhodesia.
In 1968, President Lyndon lohnson
issued an executive order, still in
force, which forbids: "sale or supply
by any person subject to the jurisdic
tion of the United States, or any
other activities by any such person
which promote or are calculated to
promote the sale or supply, to any
body in Southern Rhodesia or to any
person or anybody for the purpose
of any business carried on in or oper
ated from Southern Rhodesia, of any
commodities or products."
But as is the case with most embar
gos and economic sanctions on
Rhodesia, they are either token sanc
tions or are violated.

The illegal white minority regime
in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) has been
under continuous attack from both
the international community and in
ternal movements sponsored by the
Zimbabwe Patriotir Front which is
composed of the Zimbabwe African
National Union (ZANU) and the Zim
babwe African People's Union
(ZAPU).
These pressures are a result of
Prime Minister lan Smith's Rhode
sian Front government's Unilateral
Declaration of Independence from
Great Britain. After UDI, economic
sanctions were imposed on Smith's
regime to coerce them into a settle
ment. FHowever, these sanctions
have not yet been successful.
The British government im
mediately imposed economic sanc
tions against the rebel regime.
Rhodesia was expelled from the
Sterling area, and Commonwealth
preference on purchases of Rhode
sian goods was ended. Sanctions
went on to include a ban on the sale
of oil by British firms to Rhodesia.
In 1968, President Lyndon lohnson
issued an executive order, still in
force, which forbids: "sale or supply
by any person subject to the jurisdic
tion of the United States, or any
other activities by any such person
which promote or are calculated to
promote the sale or supply, to any
body in Southern Rhodesia or to any
person or anybody for the purpose
of any business carried on in or oper
ated from Southern Rhodesia, of any
commodities or products."
But as is the case with most embar
gos and economic sanctions on
Rhodesia, they are either token sanc
tions or are violated.
Sanction breaking
In june 1976, the United Church of
Christ released a booklet entitled
"The Oil Conspiracy" which charged
Mobil Oil Corp. of diverting pet
roleum products to Rhodesia
through Mobil of South Africa —
fully owned by Mobil Oil Corp. of
America. This charge implies that top
Mobil executi .es might be guilty of
criminal violations of United States
law.
The booklet says that three parties
set up an elaborate paper chase,

which included false billing, phony
mail drops, bogus accounts with
existing South African firms, and
dummy corporations.
No proof
In late May, the U.S. Treasury
Dept. announced that it could find
no proof in the United States that
Mobil Oil Corp. had violated the
American embargo against
Rhodesia, and that South African
secrecy laws had prevented the de
partment from looking at the files of
Mobil's South African subsidiary. As
a result, the issue remains in limbo.
Oil, arms and other goods are en
tering Rhodesia in violation of sanc
tions. South Africa has provided the
Rhodesian regime with the most ef
fective economic and military sup
port. This underlines the need to
support actions to secure change in
South Africa. South African support
serves to undermine the already
weak attempts of the Western pow
ers to effect change in Rhodesia.
Western powers have good
reasons for offering impotent
methods of dealing with Rhodesia.
First, Rhodesia is in a strategic loca
tion and is the second largest non
communist producer of chromium.
Secondly, if the white minority re
gime folds in Rhodesia, it will cer
tainly hasten the same eminent
change in South Africa.
Effects of sanctions
Theoretically, economic sanctions
on Rhodesia can have varied nega
tive effects. Sanctions could make it
difficult to preserve equilibrium in
the balance of payments and main
tain the value of the Rhodesian
pound.
Sanctions could make it difficult to
secure the internal credit position,
and make it difficult to maintain as far
as possible, levels of income and
employment.
Rhodesia's four per cent white
population has a lot at stake and is
not relinquishing its control without
continued pressure from both within
and without the state. The 96 per cent
black population has a lot to gain and
a lot to lose. But blacks in South Af
rica are saying that they are willing to
share the costs.
