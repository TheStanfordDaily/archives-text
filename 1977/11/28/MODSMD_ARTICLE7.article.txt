# Employe grievance system reviewed

Henry Organ

In the few years I have been at
Stanford, I have beer involved in
grievances filed by a number of Stan
lord employes. Within the last few
weeks I have had the dubious honor
of having had to file my own.
As a result I have gained a new
insight from this experience that I
wish to share with other Stanford
staff members who might find them
selves in such a situation, because
my suspicion is that more and more
black staff members are going to be
faced with three options: leaving
Stanford, filing a grievance, or both
of the above.
I should first attempt to put aside
any thought that I am writing this ar
ticle for the purpose of assisting my
own case, because I strongly believe
that any employe who files a grie
vance, irrespective of race, has al
ready lost the war. So, whatever I
shall say will not be to my benefit, but
perhaps it might be for others.
The employe who files a grievance
should understand that the grie
vance machinery and its workings
are the products and property of
Stanford. The procedures are written
by Stanford; the individual to whom
the grievance is initially referred is a
Stanford employe, and the hearing
officer is chosen from a list of indi
viduals that has been compiled by
Stanford.
So at the initial stages you are en
countering Stanford on its own turf
and by its own ground rules.
What is particularly critical in a
grievance is the role that is and
should be played by the Employee
Relations section in the personnel of
fice, also "fellow Stanford
employes." My experience in the
past, and now, is that Employee Rela
tions seeks to protect Stanford.

I am of the opinion that the role of
Employee Relations should be to in
sure that (a) the employe clearly un
derstands what is required to file a
complete grievance, (b) the employe
and the hearing officer understand
the grievance procedure, and (c) the
grievance procedure is properly car
ried out by the hearing officer. I be
lieve that the hearing officer and the
affected parties should be the only
ones involved in the merits of the
case, not the Employee Relations
section.
Also critical is the outside hearing
officer who is chosen, if initial efforts
to resolve the problem fail. The out
side hearing officer, who is not an
employe of Stanford, is selected
from a list of five names established
by the president.
According to the grievance proce
dures, this "list will be established
from time to time, and shall consist
of persons experienced in labor ar
bitration recommended to the presi
dent by a panel of three persons simi
larly experienced, chosen by the
president from the faculties of other
universities or colleges."
Chosen by Stanford
So, even though the hearing of
ficer may be considered an indi
vidual outside Stanford, he or she is,
nevertheless, chosen to be on the list
by Stanford procedures. And, with
the affluent fees paid by Stanford,
the officers are not likely to be in
clined to render decisions that are
contrary to Stanford's interests.
It should be noted in passing that
United Stanford Employees has not
been particularly helpful to black
employes who are covered by the
collective bargaining agreement.
Not only does Stanford discriminate
against black employes, but so does

the union that is supposed to protect
black employes in the bargaining
unit from discriminatory practices of
management. There must be better
university policies, and better unions
than USE.
With the above in mind, I believe it
is appropriate to submit the follow
ing recommendations to the Univer
sity's Ombudsman:
1) thoroughly review the grie
vance procedures and the role of the
Employee Relations section for fair
ness;
2) review grievances (without

names) filed over the last two or
three years to determine such infor
mation as the percentage of blacks
and other minorities who file grie
vances and who have approached
Employee Relations about same; de
termine the nature of the grievances
and the outcomes; and
3) interview grievants to obtain
their views about the procedures
(not the merits of their cases), and
the actual and desired role of the
Employee Relations section.

universities or colleges."
Chosen by Stanford
So, even though the hearing of
ficer may be considered an indi
vidual outside Stanford, he or she is,
nevertheless, chosen to be on the list
by Stanford procedures. And, with
the affluent fees paid by Stanford,
the officers are not likely to be in
clined to render decisions that are
contrary to Stanford's interests.
It should be noted in passing that
United Stanford Employees has not
been particularly helpful to black
employes who are covered by the
collective bargaining agreement.
Not only does Stanford discriminate
against black employes, but so does

the union that is supposed to protect
black employes in the bargaining
unit from discriminatory practices of
management. There must be better
university policies, and better unions
than USE.
With the above in mind, I believe it
is appropriate to submit the follow
ing recommendations to the Univer
sity's Ombudsman:
1) thoroughly review the grie
vance procedures and the role of the
Employee Relations section for fair
ness;
2) review grievances (without

names) filed over the last two or
three years to determine such infor
mation as the percentage of blacks
and other minorities who file grie
vances and who have approached
Employee Relations about same; de
termine the nature of the grievances
and the outcomes; and
3) interview grievants to obtain
their views about the procedures
(not the merits of their cases), and
the actual and desired role of the
Employee Relations section.

In the few years I have been at
Stanford, I have beer involved in
grievances filed by a number of Stan
lord employes. Within the last few
weeks I have had the dubious honor
of having had to file my own.
As a result I have gained a new
insight from this experience that I
wish to share with other Stanford
staff members who might find them
selves in such a situation, because
my suspicion is that more and more
black staff members are going to be
faced with three options: leaving
Stanford, filing a grievance, or both
of the above.
I should first attempt to put aside
any thought that I am writing this ar
ticle for the purpose of assisting my
own case, because I strongly believe
that any employe who files a grie
vance, irrespective of race, has al
ready lost the war. So, whatever I
shall say will not be to my benefit, but
perhaps it might be for others.
The employe who files a grievance
should understand that the grie
vance machinery and its workings
are the products and property of
Stanford. The procedures are written
by Stanford; the individual to whom
the grievance is initially referred is a
Stanford employe, and the hearing
officer is chosen from a list of indi
viduals that has been compiled by
Stanford.
So at the initial stages you are en
countering Stanford on its own turf
and by its own ground rules.
What is particularly critical in a
grievance is the role that is and
should be played by the Employee
Relations section in the personnel of
fice, also "fellow Stanford
employes." My experience in the
past, and now, is that Employee Rela
tions seeks to protect Stanford.

I am of the opinion that the role of
Employee Relations should be to in
sure that (a) the employe clearly un
derstands what is required to file a
complete grievance, (b) the employe
and the hearing officer understand
the grievance procedure, and (c) the
grievance procedure is properly car
ried out by the hearing officer. I be
lieve that the hearing officer and the
affected parties should be the only
ones involved in the merits of the
case, not the Employee Relations
section.
Also critical is the outside hearing
officer who is chosen, if initial efforts
to resolve the problem fail. The out
side hearing officer, who is not an
employe of Stanford, is selected
from a list of five names established
by the president.
According to the grievance proce
dures, this "list will be established
from time to time, and shall consist
of persons experienced in labor ar
bitration recommended to the presi
dent by a panel of three persons simi
larly experienced, chosen by the
president from the faculties of other
universities or colleges."
