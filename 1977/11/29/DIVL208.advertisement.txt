A reading of
The Song of Songs
Love Poems from the Bible
by the Author, Marcia Falk
Wednesday, 4:15, Briggs Room, Bldg. 50
"I thought until now that the Song of Songs could not be
translated better than it is done in the King James' trans
lation. Marcia Falk really managed to do an exceptional
poetic job. She has great power in her language."
—Isaac Bashevis Singer
Cosponsored by Stanford Hillel and Stanford English Dept.
