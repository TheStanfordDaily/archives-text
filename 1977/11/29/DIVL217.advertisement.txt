STANFORD LINEAR ACCELERATOR CENTER,
sponsors of PEP
the Positron-Electron CoHiding-Beam Storage
Ring Project at Stanford, California, invite appli
cations for the following engineering positions in
the design and construction of apparatus to sup
port the planned experimental physics program:
MECHANICAL ENGINEERS with interest in stress analysis heat
transfer, mechanical design. A strong mathematical background is
desirable. Will be involved in the design of magnets, magnetic
detectors, cryogenic or super-conducting systems, particle detec
tors, high vacuum equipment and systems BSME or MSME.
ELECTRONIC ENGINEERS with an interest in digital circuit de
sign, mini-computer and microprocessor applications and high
speed electronics. You will be involved in the design of electronics
circuits and data acquisition and control systems for detectors
such as scintillation hodoscopes, multiwire proportional and drift
chambers, and shower counter and calorimeter arrays BSEE or
MSEE.
This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy.
