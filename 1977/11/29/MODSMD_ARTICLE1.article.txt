# University seeks compliance with handicapped rights rules
## 
### Susan Rosegrant News Analysis 
When people are slow to move, it sometimes
takes an act of Congress to set in motion long
awaited changes in American institutions.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is
the first federal civil rights statute protecting rights
of disabled persons and the accompanying regula
tions issued by the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, effective June 3, have involved
many persons here in efforts to comply.
According to a special report prepared by the
National Association of College and University
Business Officers, "(Section 504) may be remem
bered someday for bringing together more indi
viduals from different campus offices and depart
ments than any previous federal initiative or local
campus program."
The basic policy provides that "no otherwise
qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by
reason of his handicap, be excluded from the par
ticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub
jected to discrimination under any program or ac
tivity receiving federal financial assistance."
Self-evaluation
Assoc. Provost Wayne Price is responsible for
the one-year self-evaluation program required by
HEW regulations.
His job is to assess how the University can be
come more accessible to disabled persons, includ
ing students, community members and employes.
"People like me can sit up here in our second
floor inaccessible offices and try and decide what
to do. That isn't right."
Inaccessibility
According to HEW, an institution which has
been found to discriminate against disabled per
sons and which has not taken remedial action may
be taken to court or no longer receive federal
financial assistance.
Inaccessibility of classes is one example of dis
crimination.
However, it is each program, not every Univer
sity facility, which must be made accessible.

"The thing that's key to what we're about is
making programs accessible," said Price.
Assoc. Director of Planning Gene Kershner ag
reed.
"To make every building accessible would
probably cost in the neighborhood of $10 million,
so we're looking at the programs in the buildings,"
said Kershner.
Stanford has until Dec. 3 to complete a study of
the accessibility of campus facilities, including
possible changes.
"I wouldn't say that Stanford was any worse than
any other campus," said Kershner.
"Any campus that is old just naturally has steps
up to the doors instead of ramps."
New construction
Under the regulations, facilities whose con
struction began after June 3 must be readily acces
sible to disabled persons.
But it is not the new buildings which pose a
problem, Kershner said.
"It's the old sandstone buildings, the Quad it
self ... all of the older buildings we have to do
work in.
"The Stanford Museum, for example, doesn't
even have a way to get to the first floor, let alone
the second."
Structural changes are not always necessary to
make a program accessible. Classes can be reas
signed to different buildings to facilitate a disabled
student.
Rescheduling classes has been a regular proce
dure, but until last year there was apparently no
group on campus which specifically addressed tne
needs of disabled persons.
Subcommittee
Last Feb. 23 the Subcommittee on the Disabled
Student was established.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Harold Boyd,
who served on the subcommittee, said, "As a kind
of intangible bit of evidence, I think that the com
mittee made the members of Stanford more in
tune with what a university community could be
doing and ought to be doing."
Members of the subcommittee prepared the

brochure, "A Guide for the Disabled at Stanford,"
which includes a map showing wheelchair
accessible entrances and elevators in campus
buildings, wheelchair ramps and "handicapped
parking" areas.
Although the subcommittee is no longer active,
Boyd said, "I think the committee did a tremend
ous amount of groundwork."
Peter Axelson, a paraphlegic and junior here,
also served on the subcommittee.
When asked whether or not the University has
improved recently in its ability to meet the needs
of disabled persons, Axelson replied, "Only from
what work I did last year. Anything I want to get
done I have to get done myself."
Laundry problem
Axelson cited a laundry problem he had last
year. The washing machines in his dormitory were
inaccessible by wheelchair and he tried to find
someone to help him through the Student Affairs
office — with no results.
The difficulty was eventually solved.
"I ran an ad," Axelson recalled.
The problem is not insensitivity, said Axelson,
but a lack of personnel who are specifically con
cerned with the needs of disabled persons.
Whether or not the small number of disabled
persons here reflects the lack of needed facilities
is difficult to say, Price said.
Axelson said he thinks there may be a connec
tion, and he contrasted Stanford with UC-
Berkeley, where there are facilities for disabled
persons such as the Center for Independent Liv
ing.
"If someone's accepted here and at Berkeley,
they're likely to say, 'Well, why put up with this?' "
Now that policy for disabled persons here is
being considered by a specific person, Price, Axel
son said he hopes there will be improvements.
Boyd agreed that high-level attention is impor
tant.
"It has a kind of ripple effect because it's going
from one level to all levels," he said.
Boyd sees the ripples spreading here.

Possibilities Show" from Sacramento to White Plaza yes

The problem is not insensitivity, said Axelson,
but a lack of personnel who are specifically con
cerned with the needs of disabled persons.
Whether or not the small number of disabled
persons here reflects the lack of needed facilities
is difficult to say, Price said.
Axelson said he thinks there may be a connec
tion, and he contrasted Stanford with UC-
Berkeley, where there are facilities for disabled
persons such as the Center for Independent Liv
ing.
"If someone's accepted here and at Berkeley,
they're likely to say, 'Well, why put up with this?' "
Now that policy for disabled persons here is
being considered by a specific person, Price, Axel
son said he hopes there will be improvements.
Boyd agreed that high-level attention is impor
tant.
"It has a kind of ripple effect because it's going
from one level to all levels," he said.
Boyd sees the ripples spreading here.

The exhibits offered ideas for conservation in the home
during the Christmas season and throughout the year. The
exhibits will continue through today.
When people are slow to move, it sometimes
takes an act of Congress to set in motion long
awaited changes in American institutions.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is
the first federal civil rights statute protecting rights
of disabled persons and the accompanying regula
tions issued by the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, effective June 3, have involved
many persons here in efforts to comply.
According to a special report prepared by the
National Association of College and University
Business Officers, "(Section 504) may be remem
bered someday for bringing together more indi
viduals from different campus offices and depart
ments than any previous federal initiative or local
campus program."
The basic policy provides that "no otherwise
qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by
reason of his handicap, be excluded from the par
ticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub
jected to discrimination under any program or ac
tivity receiving federal financial assistance."
Self-evaluation
Assoc. Provost Wayne Price is responsible for
the one-year self-evaluation program required by
HEW regulations.
His job is to assess how the University can be
come more accessible to disabled persons, includ
ing students, community members and employes.
"People like me can sit up here in our second
floor inaccessible offices and try and decide what
to do. That isn't right."
Inaccessibility
According to HEW, an institution which has
been found to discriminate against disabled per
sons and which has not taken remedial action may
be taken to court or no longer receive federal
financial assistance.
Inaccessibility of classes is one example of dis
crimination.
However, it is each program, not every Univer
sity facility, which must be made accessible.

"The thing that's key to what we're about is
making programs accessible," said Price.
Assoc. Director of Planning Gene Kershner ag
reed.
"To make every building accessible would
probably cost in the neighborhood of $10 million,
so we're looking at the programs in the buildings,"
said Kershner.
Stanford has until Dec. 3 to complete a study of
the accessibility of campus facilities, including
possible changes.
"I wouldn't say that Stanford was any worse than
any other campus," said Kershner.
"Any campus that is old just naturally has steps
up to the doors instead of ramps."
New construction
Under the regulations, facilities whose con
struction began after June 3 must be readily acces
sible to disabled persons.
But it is not the new buildings which pose a
problem, Kershner said.
"It's the old sandstone buildings, the Quad it
self ... all of the older buildings we have to do
work in.
"The Stanford Museum, for example, doesn't
even have a way to get to the first floor, let alone
the second."
Structural changes are not always necessary to
make a program accessible. Classes can be reas
signed to different buildings to facilitate a disabled
student.
Rescheduling classes has been a regular proce
dure, but until last year there was apparently no
group on campus which specifically addressed tne
needs of disabled persons.
Subcommittee
Last Feb. 23 the Subcommittee on the Disabled
Student was established.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Harold Boyd,
who served on the subcommittee, said, "As a kind
of intangible bit of evidence, I think that the com
mittee made the members of Stanford more in
tune with what a university community could be
doing and ought to be doing."
Members of the subcommittee prepared the

brochure, "A Guide for the Disabled at Stanford,"
which includes a map showing wheelchair
accessible entrances and elevators in campus
buildings, wheelchair ramps and "handicapped
parking" areas.
Although the subcommittee is no longer active,
Boyd said, "I think the committee did a tremend
ous amount of groundwork."
Peter Axelson, a paraphlegic and junior here,
also served on the subcommittee.
When asked whether or not the University has
improved recently in its ability to meet the needs
of disabled persons, Axelson replied, "Only from
what work I did last year. Anything I want to get
done I have to get done myself."
Laundry problem
Axelson cited a laundry problem he had last
year. The washing machines in his dormitory were
inaccessible by wheelchair and he tried to find
someone to help him through the Student Affairs
office — with no results.
The difficulty was eventually solved.
"I ran an ad," Axelson recalled.
The problem is not insensitivity, said Axelson,

Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Harold Boyd,
who served on the subcommittee, said, "As a kind
of intangible bit of evidence, I think that the com
mittee made the members of Stanford more in
tune with what a university community could be
doing and ought to be doing."
Members of the subcommittee prepared the

brochure, "A Guide for the Disabled at Stanford,"
which includes a map showing wheelchair
accessible entrances and elevators in campus
buildings, wheelchair ramps and "handicapped
parking" areas.
Although the subcommittee is no longer active,
Boyd said, "I think the committee did a tremend
ous amount of groundwork."
Peter Axelson, a paraphlegic and junior here,
also served on the subcommittee.
When asked whether or not the University has
improved recently in its ability to meet the needs
of disabled persons, Axelson replied, "Only from
what work I did last year. Anything I want to get
done I have to get done myself."
Laundry problem
Axelson cited a laundry problem he had last
year. The washing machines in his dormitory were
inaccessible by wheelchair and he tried to find
someone to help him through the Student Affairs
office — with no results.
The difficulty was eventually solved.
"I ran an ad," Axelson recalled.
The problem is not insensitivity, said Axelson,
but a lack of personnel who are specifically con
cerned with the needs of disabled persons.
Whether or not the small number of disabled
persons here reflects the lack of needed facilities
is difficult to say, Price said.
Axelson said he thinks there may be a connec
tion, and he contrasted Stanford with UC-
Berkeley, where there are facilities for disabled
persons such as the Center for Independent Liv
ing.
"If someone's accepted here and at Berkeley,
they're likely to say, 'Well, why put up with this?' "
Now that policy for disabled persons here is
being considered by a specific person, Price, Axel
son said he hopes there will be improvements.
Boyd agreed that high-level attention is impor
tant.
"It has a kind of ripple effect because it's going
from one level to all levels," he said.
Boyd sees the ripples spreading here.

The exhibits offered ideas for conservation in the home

When people are slow to move, it sometimes
takes an act of Congress to set in motion long
awaited changes in American institutions.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is
the first federal civil rights statute protecting rights
of disabled persons and the accompanying regula
tions issued by the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, effective June 3, have involved
many persons here in efforts to comply.
According to a special report prepared by the
National Association of College and University
Business Officers, "(Section 504) may be remem
bered someday for bringing together more indi
viduals from different campus offices and depart
ments than any previous federal initiative or local
campus program."
The basic policy provides that "no otherwise
qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by
reason of his handicap, be excluded from the par
ticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub
jected to discrimination under any program or ac
tivity receiving federal financial assistance."
Self-evaluation
Assoc. Provost Wayne Price is responsible for
the one-year self-evaluation program required by
HEW regulations.
His job is to assess how the University can be
come more accessible to disabled persons, includ
ing students, community members and employes.
"People like me can sit up here in our second
floor inaccessible offices and try and decide what
to do. That isn't right."
Inaccessibility
According to HEW, an institution which has
been found to discriminate against disabled per
sons and which has not taken remedial action may
be taken to court or no longer receive federal
financial assistance.
Inaccessibility of classes is one example of dis
crimination.
However, it is each program, not every Univer
sity facility, which must be made accessible.

"The thing that's key to what we're about is
making programs accessible," said Price.
Assoc. Director of Planning Gene Kershner ag
reed.
"To make every building accessible would
probably cost in the neighborhood of $10 million,
so we're looking at the programs in the buildings,"
said Kershner.
Stanford has until Dec. 3 to complete a study of
the accessibility of campus facilities, including
possible changes.
"I wouldn't say that Stanford was any worse than
any other campus," said Kershner.
"Any campus that is old just naturally has steps
up to the doors instead of ramps."
New construction
Under the regulations, facilities whose con
struction began after June 3 must be readily acces
sible to disabled persons.
But it is not the new buildings which pose a
problem, Kershner said.
"It's the old sandstone buildings, the Quad it
self ... all of the older buildings we have to do
work in.
"The Stanford Museum, for example, doesn't
even have a way to get to the first floor, let alone
the second."
Structural changes are not always necessary to
make a program accessible. Classes can be reas
signed to different buildings to facilitate a disabled
student.
Rescheduling classes has been a regular proce
dure, but until last year there was apparently no
group on campus which specifically addressed tne
needs of disabled persons.
