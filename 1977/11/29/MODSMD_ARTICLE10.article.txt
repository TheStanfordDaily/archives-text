Open letter to
Stanford Police
I go to Stanford, not Berkeley. This
little clue is just to put you on the
right track, since some of your more
brilliant officers seem to have been
misled the night before the Cal
game.
You see, two weeks ago was Big
Game week, so me and some of da
boys got together and decided to
build a big red screw to be inserted
through da statue in front of da Law
School which kinda looks like four
nuts (bolts) piled on top of one
another. Da idea was "screw Cal" —
right? — school spirit at least, if not
humor at work. Sixty laborious hours
and upwards of $35 later, the screw
was in place.

Wei!, some Stanford policeman,
tireless in his search for burnt-out
bicycle lights, arrives on the scene —
probably with his siren on. After re
flecting almost as long as those little
red things on bike tires which spin by
in your headlights, he declares the
display obscene and orders Plant
Services to have this disgrace to hu
manity and obstacle to landing pi
geons removed. One half hour after
insertion, while we laughed unknow
ingly at the Gaieties, the screw was
extracted. Tight security.
Vou guys patrol Stanford Univer
sity — not Soweto, not Belfast, not
even USC. So why the heck do you
crush something reflecting only
school spirit and humor? Anybody
with one head could have told you
there was no harm in that prank; by
your definition of obscene the Stan
ford Band should have been locked
up in Plant Services long ago.
Get the message? Remember
where you're working and tolerate
this s< hool's healthy idiosyncrasies.
Tackle the real problems, not the
football fans looking for souvenir
footballs. Granted I've ignored your
,u I) < v. menls — like multi-colored
paiking st ' s but you haven't
put me in mood to emphasize
them.
ltseemstometi;.il ice at least
here could I-.* a constluctive force,
though it seems to me that at least
here you're not.

Ii been widely reported that
the Board < t r rustees of Stanford de
cided to retain its investments in
companies thpt operate in South Af
rica, largely e 1 the basis of the Massv
report arguing, in ; ~rt, that the s.i'o
of tH se investments would jeop u
dize luture contributions to the Uni
versity.
"I his decision has in one case had
the opposite effect. I have decided as
a matter of conscience that I will no
longer contribute financially to Stan
ford.
I value highly the education I re
ceived, and I certainly intend to con
tinue making non-financial contribu
tions as a business school alumna. I
cannot, however, allow my money to
be used in what I consider a socially
irresponsible manner. My horror of
apartheid outweighs my loyalty to my
alma mater.
I would like to add that I feel Stan
ford is missing an opportuity to use
its academic prestige and financial
strength to help end a heartbreaking
situation in South Africa. I hope that
in the future my university will be
more willing to exercise leadership
in the area of human rights.
