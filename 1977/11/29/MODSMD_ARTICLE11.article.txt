# The
						Xylitol issue: Latvian self-respect

In the midst of these many cries
demanding the establishment of a
Palestinian homeland and the pro
tection of the Jewish homeland, the
"Letters to the editor" writers of our
campus seem to have forgotten that
three countries in Eastern Europe,
having establish"d homelands long
ago, have never had a chance to
exercise any of the rights or
privileges of that status.
I refer, of course, to Latvia,
Lithuania, and Estonia, presently
parts of the 1 <viet Union. All are na
ons with long and proud h -ritages.
But Friday, Nov. 18 was special for
one of these lands.
That Friday was the 59th anniver
sary of Latvia's attainment of inde
pendence. It is important that we in
the United States periodically
examine the state of affairs in Latvia,
remaining ever mindful of the strug
gle undertaken by those freedom
fighters, both past and present.
Many are unaware that the Soviet
Union is the world's sole producer of
Xylitol. This sugar substitute is used
in only one product in our country,
gum, a well known addictor of young
adults. Xylitol is produced from the
exotic Xylitol shrub (Xylitae gumae)
found only in the dry wastelands of
southern Latvia.
Until Ceorgii Antrakas, the re
nowned Baltic patriot, revealed the
scandalous working conditions of
the farmers, very little was known
about the crop itself except for the
final price (in gum form, 15 cents for
eight sticks). We now know fully of

the ravaging and scarring of so many
lives due to this terrible drug.
Young schoolchildren, just learn
ing their ABCs, are forced to work 16
hours a day (even more per week!!)
with their tender young ippetitc 1
satisfied only by their dail itic
the addictive Xylitol.
Pregnant mothers, seen dragging
swaddled young by the hand, carry
the 200 pound sacks of Xvlitol over
their weary and fragile backs for the
same 16 hours a day
Even precious household >>cis (the
rat, the otter and the electric eel) are
corrupted. It is little wonder that
every Latvian creature, both human
and non-human, has bladder trou
ble. Incontinence is one of the many
terrible tolls that Xylitol addiction
wreaks upon the unfortunate Lat
vian.
It is time for all right-thinking men
and women to assist in returning
some self-respect to the Latvian
people.
Today, at noon in White Plaza, the
Stanford Committee for the Re
establishment of an Independent
Latvia (SCRIL) will gather to rally and
to deliver our single demand to the
Stanford establishment: that local
stores divest themselves of all Xylitol
stock.
We intend to carry this demand to
store managers by crazy-gluing it to
their doors. We will also form 10 to 12
ad-hoc committees to study the
problem of Latvian incontinence.
