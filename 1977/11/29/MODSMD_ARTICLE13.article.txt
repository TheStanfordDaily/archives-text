# Relationship study views gay couples

### Cheryl Eschbach 
In an extensive study on
straight, male homosexual,
and lesbian couples, two Uni
versity of Washington
sociologists want to discover
the secret of successful rela
tionships.
Under a three-year National
Science Foundation grant, Drs.
Pepper Schwartz and Philip
Blumstein are surveying 3000
couples in San Francisco, Seat
tle and New York.
The homosexual dimension
makes their look at love un
ique, Schwartz and Blumstein
said in a Daily interview last
week. Past research on couples
has been limited "almost exc
lusively" to heterosexual mar
ried couples, according to
Schwartz.
"No one has ever seriously
studied gay couples," Blums
tein added.
Another reason for their
study is that successful couples
are becoming "unique and
fragile entities," Schwartz said.
Citinga4l per cent divorce rate
in the United States, she said
traditional values no longerde
fine nor give meaning to
couple relationships.

The study will not singularly
compare straight and gay
couples, Blumstein said, but
will analyze relationships ac
cording to many factors such as
professional status, income
and political beliefs.
The sociologists require only
that two partners be cohabitat
ing to qualify as a "couple" for
their research.
From the questionnaire,
which will be distributed
equally among straight,
homosexual and lesbian
couples, Blumstein and
Schwartz will select 600
couples for interviews.
The sociologists say their re
sults should provide some val
uable clues about what makes
a relationship work. It will beat
least three years before they
publish these in books and
academic journals.
Schwartz and Blumstein
have done extensive research
on sexual identity and
minorities, and both have been
active in gay civil rights move
ments in Washington state.
Schwartz and Blumstein
were in the Bay Area last week
to begin the San Francisco por
tion of their project.
