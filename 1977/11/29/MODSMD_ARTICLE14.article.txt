# Jacobson earning a Ph.D. at the age of 19

### Sue Goldfarb 
"I had hoped to leave all the
attention and recognition be
hind and start over again when
I got to Stanford," said Mark
Jacobson, 19-year-old Ph.D.
candidate in statistics. "But
after the first two or three
weeks, the cat was out of the
bag."
Jacobson's outstanding
math ability influenced him to
skip high school and go di
rectly from ninth j, rac 'e to
George Washington Univer
sity. He had participated in a
summer program for high
school students at GW and de
cided it made sense to con
tinue his education there. He
had taken the SAT and recalls,
"My math score was fine, and
my verbal must have been
okay, too." His parents talked
to the dean of GW, and Jacob
son was granted admission.
"I remember registration
day my first year at GW. I was
14, but I looked 11. Lots of
people questioned my pre
sence, but the woman at the
payments window reacted
more than anyone else. I went
forward, and she sort of smiled
and said hello, and I, too, said
hello. Then she went back to
her work, neglecting me.
When I remained at the win
dow, she finally came back and
asked if she could help me. I
told her I wanted to pay my tui
tion, and she exclaimed,
'You're a student here?' "
Frats 'strange'
Since Jacobson's home is
fairly close to GW he didn't
spend a lot of time on campus
his first year. But by his second
year he was working several
part time jobs arid meeting
people. After that he didn't
spend a lot of time at home,
although he lived there
throughout his undergraduate
years.
"Some fraternities at GW cal
led me, but I wasn't really in
terested in joining. They were
joking material, and the people
in them were pretty strange.
One time a fraternity across the
street from where I worked
tried to drive a jeep up the
steps of the house. It created a
real ruckus, especially since
GW is located in the middle of
Washington, D.C.
"I didn't do any dating at
GW, but I don't feel like I mis
sed anything. If there had been
a girl I wanted to date, I could
have." Although Jacobson was
considerably younger than
other students his first two
years, by the time he was a
junior and senior, the entering
students were his age.
"The only thing I may have
missed is collegiate athletics.
I'm a real baseball fan, but a 15

year old isn't likely to make the
college baseball team.
'No regrets'
"I have no regrets about my
choice to skip high school,"
Jacobson emphasized. "I en
joyed not spending six hours a
day in high school, and if I had
wanted to, I could have gone to
high school football games and
other activities.
"I think, though, that there is
an advantage to not knowing
what you're missing. I had only
a vague idea of what was going
on from my friends."

Jacobson admitted he didn't
want to spend much time at his
high school because the ad
ministration hadn't been very
pleasant when it heard of his
choice to go to GW. "I at
tended high school for a
couple days, before the plans
at GW were finalized, and the
people weren't very friendly.
'Junk'
"When my admission to GW
was granted, the high school
just gave me my release so the
truancy officer wouldn't come
after me. I remember the vice
principal took me aside and
said, 'We'll let you go, but if
you mess up, you'll have to
come back,' and he outlined a
bunch of junk classes I'd have
to take.
"I did go back for one semes
ter to take driver education. It
was less expensive through the
school than through a private
company, and the school ob
jected that since I wasn't a stu
dent I shouldn't be allowed to
take it through the school. My
parents pointed out that they
paid taxes, and I would have
attended the school, so they
gave in, reluctantly."
Jacobson says his parents
were very encouraging and
helpful, putting in lots of time
to talk to others about him, but
they didn't pressure him.

When it came time to choose
a graduate school, Jacobson
turned to his professors at GW.
Several schools kept coming
up, but Stanford was out in
front, he said.
According to Prof. Bradley
Efron, chairman of the Statis
tics Department, Jacobson is
the youngest Ph.D. candidate
ever to enroll in the depart
ment.
"We had about 80 applicants
for 10 spots. He was one of our
top candidates. His age is no
handicap. In fact, he'll proba
bly do better, because he's
done so well already," Efron
said.
Jacobson was awarded the
department's Allan Abrams
award and he was one of only
five students nationwide to win
a fellowship in statistics from
the National Science Founda
tion.
"I really like the climate
here, and the people in my de
partment are very nice. I ha
ven't met a lot of people out
side the department, but that
will come in time."
The O'
Jacobson recalls one inci
dent at the beginning of the
school year. "Some guys from
the department decided to go
out to a movie. On the way
they , decided to stop at the
Oasis. Of course, we were all
carded, and the bouncer
wouldn't let me in. I assured
him I wouldn't drink, but he
told me that it was a rule. I got
pretty upset, I guess. My
friends didn't know my situa
tion, and they were really sur
prised to find out that I was
only 19. So I told them about
my background. That episode

at the Oasis was really embar
rassing to me.
"I'm glad I don't live on
campus. I spend enough time
at Stanford to get involved in
student activities, but by living
off campus I get to know out
side areas as well. It surprises
me how few people have cars,
though. Back at GW everyone
had cars and there was no av
ailable parking. Here, with all
the available land that could be
used for parking, very few
people have cars."
About his future, Jacobson
comments, "I find there are
gaps I must fill in between
where undergraduate educa
tion leaves off and graduate
school picks up. That is my first
goal. Then I want to get my de
gree, which will take about
four years. After that, I don't
know. I'm interested in teach
ing, research and business, but
none of these sticks out in my
mind right now. I'm sure I'll
take a special interest in one
some day. In the meantime, I
have plenty of time todecide."
Jacobson believes other stu
dents can do what he has done,
although different attitudes
might make other students feel
uncomfortable. "I saw my
friends winning scholarships
and prizes in high school while
I was at GW, and I thought they
were really missing out. But
lots of people think I really
missed out on the best years of
my social life, too."
Although some people feel
Jacobson missed the best so
cial years of his life, an equal, if
not greater, number believe
what he's doing is great. And
Mark Jacobson is one of these.

to the dean of GW, and Jacob

Frats 'strange'
Since Jacobson's home is
fairly close to GW he didn't
spend a lot of time on campus
his first year. But by his second
year he was working several
part time jobs arid meeting
people. After that he didn't
spend a lot of time at home,
although he lived there
throughout his undergraduate
years.
"Some fraternities at GW cal
led me, but I wasn't really in
terested in joining. They were
joking material, and the people
in them were pretty strange.
One time a fraternity across the
street from where I worked
tried to drive a jeep up the
steps of the house. It created a
real ruckus, especially since
GW is located in the middle of
Washington, D.C.
"I didn't do any dating at
GW, but I don't feel like I mis
sed anything. If there had been
a girl I wanted to date, I could
have." Although Jacobson was
considerably younger than
other students his first two
years, by the time he was a
junior and senior, the entering
students were his age.
"The only thing I may have
missed is collegiate athletics.
I'm a real baseball fan, but a 15

year old isn't likely to make the
college baseball team.
'No regrets'
"I have no regrets about my
choice to skip high school,"
Jacobson emphasized. "I en
joyed not spending six hours a
day in high school, and if I had
wanted to, I could have gone to
high school football games and
other activities.
"I think, though, that there is
an advantage to not knowing
what you're missing. I had only
a vague idea of what was going
on from my friends."

Jacobson admitted he didn't
want to spend much time at his
high school because the ad
ministration hadn't been very
pleasant when it heard of his
choice to go to GW. "I at
tended high school for a
couple days, before the plans
at GW were finalized, and the
people weren't very friendly.
'Junk'
"When my admission to GW
was granted, the high school
just gave me my release so the
truancy officer wouldn't come
after me. I remember the vice
principal took me aside and
said, 'We'll let you go, but if
you mess up, you'll have to
come back,' and he outlined a
bunch of junk classes I'd have
to take.
"I did go back for one semes
ter to take driver education. It
was less expensive through the
school than through a private
company, and the school ob
jected that since I wasn't a stu
dent I shouldn't be allowed to
take it through the school. My
parents pointed out that they
paid taxes, and I would have
attended the school, so they
gave in, reluctantly."
Jacobson says his parents
were very encouraging and
helpful, putting in lots of time
to talk to others about him, but
they didn't pressure him.

When it came time to choose
a graduate school, Jacobson
turned to his professors at GW.
Several schools kept coming
up, but Stanford was out in
front, he said.
According to Prof. Bradley
Efron, chairman of the Statis
tics Department, Jacobson is
the youngest Ph.D. candidate
ever to enroll in the depart
ment.
"We had about 80 applicants
for 10 spots. He was one of our
top candidates. His age is no
handicap. In fact, he'll proba
bly do better, because he's
done so well already," Efron
said.
Jacobson was awarded the
department's Allan Abrams
award and he was one of only
five students nationwide to win
a fellowship in statistics from
the National Science Founda
tion.
"I really like the climate
here, and the people in my de
partment are very nice. I ha
ven't met a lot of people out
side the department, but that
will come in time."
The O'
Jacobson recalls one inci
dent at the beginning of the
school year. "Some guys from
the department decided to go
out to a movie. On the way
they , decided to stop at the
Oasis. Of course, we were all
carded, and the bouncer
wouldn't let me in. I assured
him I wouldn't drink, but he
told me that it was a rule. I got
pretty upset, I guess. My
friends didn't know my situa
tion, and they were really sur
prised to find out that I was
only 19. So I told them about
my background. That episode

at the Oasis was really embar
rassing to me.
"I'm glad I don't live on
campus. I spend enough time
at Stanford to get involved in
student activities, but by living
off campus I get to know out
side areas as well. It surprises
me how few people have cars,
though. Back at GW everyone
had cars and there was no av
ailable parking. Here, with all
the available land that could be
used for parking, very few
people have cars."
About his future, Jacobson
comments, "I find there are
gaps I must fill in between
where undergraduate educa
tion leaves off and graduate
school picks up. That is my first
goal. Then I want to get my de
gree, which will take about
four years. After that, I don't
know. I'm interested in teach
ing, research and business, but
none of these sticks out in my
mind right now. I'm sure I'll
take a special interest in one
some day. In the meantime, I
have plenty of time todecide."
Jacobson believes other stu
dents can do what he has done,
although different attitudes
might make other students feel
uncomfortable. "I saw my
friends winning scholarships
and prizes in high school while
I was at GW, and I thought they
were really missing out. But
lots of people think I really
missed out on the best years of
my social life, too."
Although some people feel
Jacobson missed the best so
cial years of his life, an equal, if
not greater, number believe
what he's doing is great. And
Mark Jacobson is one of these.

"I had hoped to leave all the
attention and recognition be
hind and start over again when
I got to Stanford," said Mark
Jacobson, 19-year-old Ph.D.
candidate in statistics. "But
after the first two or three
weeks, the cat was out of the
bag."
Jacobson's outstanding
math ability influenced him to
skip high school and go di
rectly from ninth j, rac 'e to
George Washington Univer
sity. He had participated in a
summer program for high
school students at GW and de
cided it made sense to con
tinue his education there. He
had taken the SAT and recalls,
"My math score was fine, and
my verbal must have been
okay, too." His parents talked

fairly close to GW he didn't
spend a lot of time on campus
his first year. But by his second
year he was working several
part time jobs arid meeting
people. After that he didn't
spend a lot of time at home,
although he lived there
throughout his undergraduate
years.
"Some fraternities at GW cal
led me, but I wasn't really in
terested in joining. They were
joking material, and the people
in them were pretty strange.
One time a fraternity across the
street from where I worked
tried to drive a jeep up the
steps of the house. It created a
real ruckus, especially since
GW is located in the middle of
Washington, D.C.
"I didn't do any dating at
GW, but I don't feel like I mis
sed anything. If there had been
a girl I wanted to date, I could
have." Although Jacobson was
considerably younger than
other students his first two
years, by the time he was a
junior and senior, the entering
students were his age.
"The only thing I may have
missed is collegiate athletics.
I'm a real baseball fan, but a 15

year old isn't likely to make the
college baseball team.
'No regrets'
"I have no regrets about my
choice to skip high school,"
Jacobson emphasized. "I en
joyed not spending six hours a
day in high school, and if I had
wanted to, I could have gone to
high school football games and
other activities.
"I think, though, that there is
an advantage to not knowing
what you're missing. I had only
a vague idea of what was going
on from my friends."

Jacobson admitted he didn't
want to spend much time at his
high school because the ad
ministration hadn't been very
pleasant when it heard of his
choice to go to GW. "I at
tended high school for a
couple days, before the plans
at GW were finalized, and the
people weren't very friendly.
'Junk'
"When my admission to GW
was granted, the high school
just gave me my release so the
truancy officer wouldn't come
after me. I remember the vice
principal took me aside and
said, 'We'll let you go, but if
you mess up, you'll have to
come back,' and he outlined a
bunch of junk classes I'd have
to take.
"I did go back for one semes
ter to take driver education. It
was less expensive through the
school than through a private
company, and the school ob
jected that since I wasn't a stu
dent I shouldn't be allowed to
take it through the school. My
parents pointed out that they
paid taxes, and I would have
attended the school, so they
gave in, reluctantly."
Jacobson says his parents
were very encouraging and
helpful, putting in lots of time
to talk to others about him, but
they didn't pressure him.

When it came time to choose
a graduate school, Jacobson
turned to his professors at GW.
Several schools kept coming
up, but Stanford was out in
front, he said.
According to Prof. Bradley
Efron, chairman of the Statis
tics Department, Jacobson is
the youngest Ph.D. candidate
ever to enroll in the depart
ment.
"We had about 80 applicants
for 10 spots. He was one of our
top candidates. His age is no
handicap. In fact, he'll proba
bly do better, because he's
done so well already," Efron
said.
Jacobson was awarded the
department's Allan Abrams
award and he was one of only
five students nationwide to win
a fellowship in statistics from
the National Science Founda
tion.
"I really like the climate
here, and the people in my de
partment are very nice. I ha
ven't met a lot of people out
side the department, but that
will come in time."
The O'
Jacobson recalls one inci
dent at the beginning of the
school year. "Some guys from
the department decided to go
out to a movie. On the way
they , decided to stop at the
Oasis. Of course, we were all
carded, and the bouncer
wouldn't let me in. I assured
him I wouldn't drink, but he
told me that it was a rule. I got
pretty upset, I guess. My
friends didn't know my situa
tion, and they were really sur
prised to find out that I was
only 19. So I told them about
my background. That episode

at the Oasis was really embar
rassing to me.
"I'm glad I don't live on
campus. I spend enough time
at Stanford to get involved in
student activities, but by living
off campus I get to know out
side areas as well. It surprises
me how few people have cars,
though. Back at GW everyone
had cars and there was no av
ailable parking. Here, with all
the available land that could be
used for parking, very few
people have cars."
About his future, Jacobson
comments, "I find there are
gaps I must fill in between
where undergraduate educa
tion leaves off and graduate
school picks up. That is my first
goal. Then I want to get my de
gree, which will take about
four years. After that, I don't
know. I'm interested in teach
ing, research and business, but
none of these sticks out in my
mind right now. I'm sure I'll
take a special interest in one
some day. In the meantime, I
have plenty of time todecide."
Jacobson believes other stu
dents can do what he has done,
although different attitudes
might make other students feel
uncomfortable. "I saw my
friends winning scholarships
and prizes in high school while
I was at GW, and I thought they
were really missing out. But
lots of people think I really
missed out on the best years of
my social life, too."
Although some people feel
Jacobson missed the best so
cial years of his life, an equal, if
not greater, number believe
what he's doing is great. And
Mark Jacobson is one of these.

"I had hoped to leave all the
attention and recognition be
hind and start over again when
I got to Stanford," said Mark
Jacobson, 19-year-old Ph.D.
candidate in statistics. "But
after the first two or three
weeks, the cat was out of the
bag."
Jacobson's outstanding
math ability influenced him to
skip high school and go di
rectly from ninth j, rac 'e to
George Washington Univer
sity. He had participated in a
summer program for high
school students at GW and de
cided it made sense to con
tinue his education there. He
had taken the SAT and recalls,
"My math score was fine, and
my verbal must have been
okay, too." His parents talked
to the dean of GW, and Jacob
son was granted admission.
"I remember registration
day my first year at GW. I was
14, but I looked 11. Lots of
people questioned my pre
sence, but the woman at the
payments window reacted
more than anyone else. I went
forward, and she sort of smiled
and said hello, and I, too, said
hello. Then she went back to
her work, neglecting me.
When I remained at the win
dow, she finally came back and
asked if she could help me. I
told her I wanted to pay my tui
tion, and she exclaimed,
'You're a student here?' "

GW, but I don't feel like I mis
sed anything. If there had been
a girl I wanted to date, I could
have." Although Jacobson was
considerably younger than
other students his first two
years, by the time he was a
junior and senior, the entering
students were his age.
"The only thing I may have
missed is collegiate athletics.
I'm a real baseball fan, but a 15

year old isn't likely to make the
college baseball team.
'No regrets'
"I have no regrets about my
choice to skip high school,"
Jacobson emphasized. "I en
joyed not spending six hours a
day in high school, and if I had
wanted to, I could have gone to
high school football games and
other activities.
"I think, though, that there is
an advantage to not knowing
what you're missing. I had only
a vague idea of what was going
on from my friends."

Jacobson admitted he didn't
want to spend much time at his
high school because the ad
ministration hadn't been very
pleasant when it heard of his
choice to go to GW. "I at
tended high school for a
couple days, before the plans
at GW were finalized, and the
people weren't very friendly.
'Junk'
"When my admission to GW
was granted, the high school
just gave me my release so the
truancy officer wouldn't come
after me. I remember the vice
principal took me aside and
said, 'We'll let you go, but if
you mess up, you'll have to
come back,' and he outlined a
bunch of junk classes I'd have
to take.
"I did go back for one semes
ter to take driver education. It
was less expensive through the
school than through a private
company, and the school ob
jected that since I wasn't a stu
dent I shouldn't be allowed to
take it through the school. My
parents pointed out that they
paid taxes, and I would have
attended the school, so they
gave in, reluctantly."
Jacobson says his parents
were very encouraging and
helpful, putting in lots of time
to talk to others about him, but
they didn't pressure him.

When it came time to choose
a graduate school, Jacobson
turned to his professors at GW.
Several schools kept coming
up, but Stanford was out in
front, he said.
According to Prof. Bradley
Efron, chairman of the Statis
tics Department, Jacobson is
the youngest Ph.D. candidate
ever to enroll in the depart
ment.
"We had about 80 applicants
for 10 spots. He was one of our
top candidates. His age is no
handicap. In fact, he'll proba
bly do better, because he's
done so well already," Efron
said.
Jacobson was awarded the
department's Allan Abrams
award and he was one of only
five students nationwide to win
a fellowship in statistics from
the National Science Founda
tion.
"I really like the climate
here, and the people in my de
partment are very nice. I ha
ven't met a lot of people out
side the department, but that
will come in time."
The O'
Jacobson recalls one inci
dent at the beginning of the
school year. "Some guys from
the department decided to go
out to a movie. On the way
they , decided to stop at the
Oasis. Of course, we were all
carded, and the bouncer
wouldn't let me in. I assured
him I wouldn't drink, but he
told me that it was a rule. I got
pretty upset, I guess. My
friends didn't know my situa
tion, and they were really sur
prised to find out that I was
only 19. So I told them about
my background. That episode

at the Oasis was really embar
rassing to me.
"I'm glad I don't live on
campus. I spend enough time
at Stanford to get involved in
student activities, but by living
off campus I get to know out
side areas as well. It surprises
me how few people have cars,
though. Back at GW everyone
had cars and there was no av
ailable parking. Here, with all
the available land that could be
used for parking, very few
people have cars."
About his future, Jacobson
comments, "I find there are
gaps I must fill in between
where undergraduate educa
tion leaves off and graduate
school picks up. That is my first
goal. Then I want to get my de
gree, which will take about
four years. After that, I don't
know. I'm interested in teach
ing, research and business, but
none of these sticks out in my
mind right now. I'm sure I'll
take a special interest in one
some day. In the meantime, I
have plenty of time todecide."
Jacobson believes other stu
dents can do what he has done,
although different attitudes
might make other students feel
uncomfortable. "I saw my
friends winning scholarships
and prizes in high school while
I was at GW, and I thought they
were really missing out. But
lots of people think I really
missed out on the best years of
my social life, too."
Although some people feel
Jacobson missed the best so
cial years of his life, an equal, if
not greater, number believe
what he's doing is great. And
Mark Jacobson is one of these.

"I had hoped to leave all the
attention and recognition be
hind and start over again when
I got to Stanford," said Mark
Jacobson, 19-year-old Ph.D.
candidate in statistics. "But
after the first two or three
weeks, the cat was out of the
bag."
Jacobson's outstanding
math ability influenced him to
skip high school and go di
rectly from ninth j, rac 'e to
George Washington Univer
sity. He had participated in a
summer program for high
school students at GW and de
cided it made sense to con
tinue his education there. He
had taken the SAT and recalls,
"My math score was fine, and
my verbal must have been
okay, too." His parents talked
to the dean of GW, and Jacob
son was granted admission.
"I remember registration
day my first year at GW. I was
14, but I looked 11. Lots of
people questioned my pre
sence, but the woman at the
payments window reacted
more than anyone else. I went
forward, and she sort of smiled
and said hello, and I, too, said
hello. Then she went back to
her work, neglecting me.
When I remained at the win
dow, she finally came back and
asked if she could help me. I
told her I wanted to pay my tui
tion, and she exclaimed,
'You're a student here?' "
Frats 'strange'
Since Jacobson's home is
fairly close to GW he didn't
spend a lot of time on campus
his first year. But by his second
year he was working several
part time jobs arid meeting
people. After that he didn't
spend a lot of time at home,
although he lived there
throughout his undergraduate
years.
"Some fraternities at GW cal
led me, but I wasn't really in
terested in joining. They were
joking material, and the people
in them were pretty strange.
One time a fraternity across the
street from where I worked
tried to drive a jeep up the
steps of the house. It created a
real ruckus, especially since
GW is located in the middle of
Washington, D.C.
"I didn't do any dating at
GW, but I don't feel like I mis
sed anything. If there had been
a girl I wanted to date, I could
have." Although Jacobson was
