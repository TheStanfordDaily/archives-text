Sharon Diane Collins really nails 'em with
her2 1 /2 inch fingernails. They've been grow
ing for a year and a half and Collins, a junior
communication major, says she has no
plans to cut them now. "I can type (on an
electric typewriter) and do most everything
with them/' she said. She uses a ceramic
glaze and fingernail polish to keep them
looking their best. Collins' nails have a un
ique curl to them. The secret to not having
the nails curl is to keep trimming them as
they grow out, she said. She plans to do so
on her other hand. "One woman told me
she thought they were obnoxious," Collins
said. "I didn't say anything because I knew
she was crazy."
