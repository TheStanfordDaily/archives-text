Columbus, Ohio (AP) â€”
Born-again publisher Larry
Flynt says his new personal
commitment to Christianity
soon will be reflected in his
sexually explicit magazines,,
Hustler and Chic..But he says
there will be no change in the
magazines' philosophy.

"Everybody expects pictures
of the crucifix on the cover of
Hustler, with some version of
the scripture printed inside,"
Flynt told the Akron Beacon
Journal in an interview pub
lished Sunday.
"Our philosophy is going to
be the same. We're going to be

doing what we've been doing,
but do it better. Sex is
beautiful and Cod-given. If
they (critics) think it's obscene,
they should complain to the
manufacturer. Evil is in the eye
of the beholder."
Flynt, who says his recent
conversion was brought about
by President jimmy Carter's
sister, evangelist Ruth Carter
Stapleton, said one change in
Hustler will be a redefining of
the continuing cartoon charac
ter "Chester the Molester" as
"Chester the Protector" in
order to show that the pub
lisher does not advocate
molestation.
"I see a lot of reasons why
overt acts against women
should stop," said Flynt, 41. "I
would not condone any type of
behavior that would discrimi
nate against or harm people."
He declined to say what
other changes may be made in
his magazines but indicated
pictures of nude women prob
ably will not be phased out.
In its new issue, Newsweek
magazine said Flynt is consid
ering adding pictures of nude
men to the Hustler section now
devoted to snapshots of nude
women sent in by their hus
bands or boyfriends.
"People who think I'm not
going to make money with
Hustler don't know how far off
they are," Flynt told the
Beacon Journal. "With Hustler
before, we turned a lot of
people off. What we want to do
now is turn everybody on,
rather than turn people off."
