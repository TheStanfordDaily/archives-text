## Nathan Oliveira: strength in art 
### 
There is one word that keeps
coming up in conversations
with Nathan Oliveira's stu
dents and colleagues at Stan
ford when talking aoout him as
a man and as an artist. The
word is "strong."
"I think his work is oheno
menal," says junior art major
Mike Alper, referring to Olivei
ra's well-known paintings and
prints. "His work is strong."
Sophomore Lisa Winick is
also an art major, like Alper
specializing in printmaking.
She says that the effect of
Oliveira's art is "always
something strong."
Lorenz Eitner, as head of the
Art Department at Stanford, is
one of the people responsible
for recruiting Oliveira to the
faculty in 1964. Eitner says,"I
think he's a strong artist and a
good teacher and a sane col
league. That's an unusual
combination. His work has in
tensity. It affects you in various
ways strongly, in an intellectual
or emotional way."
The repeated references to
strength prepare one to meet a
burly, muscular man. And
that's exactly what Nathan
Oliveira is. Not tall but power
fully built, he is the living an
tithesis of the effete artist.
Dressed in casual slacks and
soft shirt over a dark jersey,
and sporting a salt and pepper
mustache, he would look right
at home in the cab of a 12-
wheel rig or at the helm of a
fishing smack. The tan over a
dark complexion does not
suggest a delicate, sedentary
lifestyle. He would resemble
the young Hemingway except
that the he-man arrogance,
mercifully, is not there.
When Oliveira talks about
art in general and his art in par
ticular, he talks of intensity,
energy and drama. He first felt
the urge to become an artist
when he saw a "beautiful little
Rembrandt portrait" at age 17
and "like a magnet, it drew me
to it. It had a presence that the
others didn't have. It appeared
to be alive, to have a charge, an
energy about it."
That experience 32 years ago
set a standard for Oliveira that
he has attempted to live up to
ever since. His success is at
tested to by a 10-page summary

of awards, exhibitions and col
lections around the world that
include his painting, drawings
and prints.
Oliveira's success is at least
partly due to his serious at
titude. "Whatever you put on
the wall," he says, "you should
be convinced about." He is
concerned with man's tragic
condition, the "Black World"
thatappearsin hisdark, drama
tic images. He wants the view
ers of his work to receive a sen
sation. When he finishes a
work and displays it to the
world, his invitation to enjoy it
and be moved is explicit:
"Here it is, it's for you!"
Oliveira attributes his artistic
integrity in part to the financial
security of being a teacher as
well as an artist. He has been
teaching ever since he re
ceived his M.F.A. from the
California College of Arts and
Crafts in Oakland in 1953. As a
result, his wife and three chil
dren have not suffered mate
rially because of his dedication
to art, not something all artists
can say.
But teaching has been a posi
tive experience in another way.
He says of his students, "They
keep me young and alive and
active. They stimulate energy."
All this talk of energy and in
tensity, drama and dedication
sounds formidable, even for
bidding. But Oliveira's office
overlooking the courtyard of
the Cummings Building con
tains evidence of a lively sense
of humor and humanity. In ad
dition to the expected prints,
posters and original works of
art, there is a fascinating collec
tion of personal souvenirs that
are at once touching and
bizarre.
Massed on the top of a clut
tered book case are such items
as an autographed baseball
from service as a Little League
manager; a bogus golf trophy
inscribed "Deep Nate" pre
sented by a friend; a plastic
bubble that "snows" on two
bears on a seesaw when sha
ken; and what looks like a
highly decorated shrunken
head on a stick. This last turns
out to be a miniature mask
from Thailand, the gift of a col
league from Kent State Univer

sity.
Pinned to the wall above are
six color postcards of gourmet
dishes sent by a friend while in
Europe, "just to torture me,"
says Oliveira. And stretched
across five feet of the wall
above all these things is a line
drawing of a very large fish en
titled "80 pounder." It is
signed "Joey," Oliveira's 12-
year-old son, for whose benefit
the Little League managership
was undertaken.
All of these objects repre
sent Nathan Oliveira as surely
as do the intense, brooding
images found in his work. They
describe the "golden mo
ments" of his life between the
periods of struggle as artist and
human being. And while the
Black World dominates his
work, it does not poison his re
lationships with people, which
are universally described as
warm, supportive and gratify
ing to students and peersalike.
Friend and fellow faculty
member Leo Holub, who
works on the floor below
Oliveira's, has known him for
over 20 years. "Nate's a mar
velous person," says Holub.
"He handles life very well. He's
a name in art and he deserves
to be. Everything he gets into is
transferred to the student."
Holub'sfinal tribute sums up
the general opinion of Nathan
Oliveira: "I'm glad he's up
stairs."
