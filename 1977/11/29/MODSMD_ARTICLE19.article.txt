# Utterly convincing 'Requiem Mass'
## 
### 
Last Tuesday, an audience
packed Memorial Church to
join the music department in
celebrating St. Cecilia's Day,
honoring the patron saint of
music. All the performers —
the Stanford Chorus, the Stan
ford orchestra, four vocalists
and Director William Ramsey
— excelled in a performance of
Mozart's final work, the "Re
quiem Mass."
The Stanford Orchestra de
served the evening's "most
improved" award. Whether
through the influence of Wal
ter Ducloux or new personnel,
they have improved tremend
ously over last year. Gone are
the dubious violin passages,
brass bloopers and insensitive
musicianship. They were dis
ciplined, balanced, technically
near perfect, and, best of all —
musically convincing. They
seemed to catch all the subtle
inflections — the slight warm
ing or crescendo — that carry
the emotional message.
But the "Requiem" is primar
ily a vocal work, and there the
high standards continued. The
four soloists — Marie Gibson,
Wendy Hoggatt, Daniel Par
kerson, Robert Bernard —
blended well, with no anomal

ous or overbearing voices. My
personal favorite was Bernard
(a lecturer at Stanford), whose
baritone warmth, alternating
with the trombone, easily con
veyed the majestic warmth of
the Tuba mirum. With the ex
ception of a few rough jumps,
all the soloists were free of any
technical problems, and pre
sented moving emotional per
formances.
The "Requiem" is, however,
first and foremost a choral
work, and here the perfor
mance reached its highest
heights. Director William Ram
sey once again scored a suc
cess with the Stanford Chorus
— a group open by audition to
any student.
Alfred Einstein has written

that Mozart, like Schubert and
Verdi, saw death, not as a terri
ble vision, but as a friend. Ram
sey chose to emphasize this
viewpoint, drawing out the
poignant sweetness, rather
than the power, latent in this
work. Paying careful attention
to thepiano passages, he filled
the work with reassuring faith.
Ramsey brought out the de
tails, but did not indulge in
overly broad crescendos and
exaggerated accents — opting
for a balanced and moderate
style. Only the choice of tem
pos seemed odd; theD/es Irae,
for example, was quite slow.
The chorus responded sensi
tively, with evident under
standing of the Latin text. Im
balances that plagued previous

year's chorus' were gone; the
sound was warm and full. Only
in the most difficult passages
(especially the Agnus Dei) was
the sound muddy, due partially
to the acoustics and partially to
an unfortunate tendency to
rush.
The poignant Lacrymosa was
the climax of the entire even
ing, as it should have been.
(Mozart's death midway
through composition left the
work unbalanced, hence the

early climax.) The Chorus re
ndered this terrifying cies
cendo — rising from a lament
to a frightful plea — utterly
convincingly.
Primary credit for the suc
cessful "Requiem," and for the
enthusiastic audience re
sponse that followed, how
ever, must go to William Ram
sey, who once again exhibited
his mastery of choral direction
and musical interpretation.
