Salisbury, Rhodesia (AP) â€” Rhode
sian forces smashed two black
nationalist bases in Mozambique, kil
led at least 1200 guerrillas and de
stroyed large quantities of war
supplies, the government said yes
terday.
Mozambique accused Rhodesia of
a "slaughter." It placed the deaths at
"more than 80" and said most of the
victims were women and children
with few guerrillas slain.
The devastating ground and air
raids across Rhodesia's eastern bor
der came as white Prime Minister lan
Smith was making plans to meet with
moderate black leaders to discuss
eventual rule by the black majority.
Rhodesia's military command said
ground and air forces launched the
five-day operation Wednesday
against the guerrillas' main base
camp at Chimoio, 54 miles across the
border, and a second camp 132 miles
from the frontier in Mozambique's
northwestern province of Tete.
Fourth operation
One Rhodesian soldier was killed
and eight were wounded, the gov
ernment said. The raids, the fourth
operation into Mozambique offi

daily acknowledged by Rhodesia,
were conducted "in the interests of
self defense," the military com
mand's communique said.
"Large quantities of war material
including weapons, vehicles, am
munition, fuel, buildings and docu
ments were destroyed," it said.
Intelligence sources said both of
the camps were strategic bases for
guerrillas of Robert Mugabe's Zim
babwe African National Union,
largest of the two guerrilla armies
fighting to topple Prime Minister lan

Smith's white minority government.
Officials believe Mugabe has
about 9000 men, more than 3500 in
Rhodesia and the rest in Mozam
bique. If 1200 guerrillas were killed in
the raid, it would mean he has lost
nearly one-fifth of his forces.
Second army
The second guerrilla army, the
Zimbabwe African Peoples' Union
headed by Joshua Nkomo, is esti
mated to have about 3000 men, sev
