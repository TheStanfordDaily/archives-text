Israelis to meet Sadat in Cairo
Jerusalem — Israel formally agreed yesterday to
attend President Anwar Sadat's preliminary peace
conference in Cairo.
The United States will also participate in the
proposed conference, but it is holding off on any
formal announcement of the decision, administra
tion officials said yesterday.
Sources indicated it was the Carter administra
tion's belief that any public announcement of the
U.S. participation would solidify opposition to the
conference among militant Arabs at a time when
there were signs that opposition might wane.
The radical governments of Libya and Iraq sepa
rately called anti-Sadat Arab summits in their capi
tals.
The conflicting flurry of invitations threw the
Mideast into disarray. In Washington a State De
partment spokesman conceded there was little
chance of meeting President Jimmy Carter's goal
of reconvening the Geneva peace conference this
year.
In an address to the Knesset, the Israeli parlia
ment, Prime Minister Menahem Begin said he had
received and accepted Egypt's invitation to send
representatives to Cairo as early as Saturday to
prepare for Geneva. He named two top aides as his
envoys.
High Court eyes garbage case
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yes
terday to decide whether New Jersey can turn
down Pennsylvania garbage, and refused to block
the government's attempt to dismantle AT&T.
Taking action in some 200 cases the justices
voted to review a decision by the New Jersey Sup
reme Court that a state has the right to prohibit the
dumping of out-of-state garbage within its bor
ders.
The justices' eventual ruling, to come sometime
before the end of the court term in June, could
carry great impact for many states sharing New
Jersey's problem of a growing shortage of availa
ble disposal sites for wastes.

The cities of Philadelphia and Glen Cove, Pa.,
sued New Jersey authorities in 1973 after the state
legislature passed a law barring "the entry of any
solid or liquid waste collected in another state."
In another case the Supreme Court turned
down an appeal by the American Telephone and
Telegraph Co. aimed at getting the huge firm out
from under a tederal antitrust suit.
The justices' action means the government can
continue pressing its efforts to dismantle AT&T,
which claimed in its appeal that it could not be
sued for antitrust violations because it is heavily
regulated by the Federal Communications Com
mission and state agencies.
Dock strike swells deficit
Washington — A dock strike made October the
nation's worst trade month on record, as the na
tion bought $3.1 billion more in goods than it sold
abroad, the Commerce Department said yester
day.
With their strike continuing to exact a heavy toll
on international commerce for a ninth week,
50,000 members of the International Longshore
men's Association will decide today whether to
end their selective walkout at 34 Atlantic and Gulf
of Mexico ports.
Dockers have refused to handle cargo shipped
in van-sized containers since Oct. 1.
Goods destined for U.S. stores in time for the
lucrative Christmas buying season won't make it,
and backlogs are expected until the middle of next
year. Virtually all segments of American industry
are affected, and consumers will pay the price in
inconvenience and probably in higher prices for
most imported goods as new pay scales go into
effect for dockworkers.
The trade deficit surpassed the old record of
$2.8 billion recorded last June. At the current rate
the deficit for the year would be $27 billion nearly
three times the $9.2 billion deficit last year.
Arkansas senator dies in sleep
Washington — With the death yesterday of John
McClellan of Arkansas the Senate lost the chair

man of its powerful Appropriations Committee
and the chief sponsor of most of the major anti
crime legislation of recent years.
The 81-year-old senator, who announced a
week ago he would not run next year for a seventh
six-year term, died in his sleep in his apartment in
Little Rock. His body was found by his wife about
6:30 a.m. yesterday.
McClellan was a conservative pillar of the Senate
establishment and was renowned for his investiga
tions of corruption in and out of government.
Local machinists defy union
Sunnyvale — Defying orders from their union's
international leadership, hundreds of machinists
at the Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. plant here
ended a long strike yesterday and returned to their
jobs.
Lockheed spokesman George Mulhern said
about 80 to 90 per cent of some 3200 striking
employes belonging to local 508 were back on the
job after voting to approve the contract rejected by
the international union leaders.
However the 49-day walkout continued for
about 13,000 union members in locals at three
Southern California Lockheed facilities and a
Marietta, Ga., plant.
Of the 16,000 workers at Lockheed's Sunnyvale
plant, 1300 members of the machinists local and
11,500 other employes remained on their jobs dur
ing the strike.
The vote on the three-year package was held
Sunday despite a decision by the International As
sociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers'
union to suspend the local's top officials for pursu
ing separate negotiations.

Israelis to meet Sadat in Cairo
Jerusalem — Israel formally agreed yesterday to
attend President Anwar Sadat's preliminary peace
conference in Cairo.
The United States will also participate in the
proposed conference, but it is holding off on any
formal announcement of the decision, administra
tion officials said yesterday.
Sources indicated it was the Carter administra
tion's belief that any public announcement of the
U.S. participation would solidify opposition to the
conference among militant Arabs at a time when
there were signs that opposition might wane.
The radical governments of Libya and Iraq sepa
rately called anti-Sadat Arab summits in their capi
tals.
The conflicting flurry of invitations threw the
Mideast into disarray. In Washington a State De
partment spokesman conceded there was little
chance of meeting President Jimmy Carter's goal
of reconvening the Geneva peace conference this
year.
In an address to the Knesset, the Israeli parlia
ment, Prime Minister Menahem Begin said he had
received and accepted Egypt's invitation to send
representatives to Cairo as early as Saturday to
prepare for Geneva. He named two top aides as his
envoys.
High Court eyes garbage case
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yes
terday to decide whether New Jersey can turn
down Pennsylvania garbage, and refused to block
the government's attempt to dismantle AT&T.
Taking action in some 200 cases the justices
voted to review a decision by the New Jersey Sup
reme Court that a state has the right to prohibit the
dumping of out-of-state garbage within its bor
ders.
The justices' eventual ruling, to come sometime
before the end of the court term in June, could
carry great impact for many states sharing New
Jersey's problem of a growing shortage of availa
ble disposal sites for wastes.

The cities of Philadelphia and Glen Cove, Pa.,
sued New Jersey authorities in 1973 after the state
legislature passed a law barring "the entry of any
solid or liquid waste collected in another state."
In another case the Supreme Court turned
down an appeal by the American Telephone and
Telegraph Co. aimed at getting the huge firm out
from under a tederal antitrust suit.
The justices' action means the government can
continue pressing its efforts to dismantle AT&T,
which claimed in its appeal that it could not be
sued for antitrust violations because it is heavily
regulated by the Federal Communications Com
mission and state agencies.
Dock strike swells deficit
Washington — A dock strike made October the
nation's worst trade month on record, as the na
tion bought $3.1 billion more in goods than it sold
abroad, the Commerce Department said yester
day.
With their strike continuing to exact a heavy toll
on international commerce for a ninth week,
50,000 members of the International Longshore
men's Association will decide today whether to
end their selective walkout at 34 Atlantic and Gulf
of Mexico ports.
Dockers have refused to handle cargo shipped
in van-sized containers since Oct. 1.
Goods destined for U.S. stores in time for the
lucrative Christmas buying season won't make it,
and backlogs are expected until the middle of next
year. Virtually all segments of American industry
are affected, and consumers will pay the price in
inconvenience and probably in higher prices for
most imported goods as new pay scales go into
effect for dockworkers.
The trade deficit surpassed the old record of
$2.8 billion recorded last June. At the current rate
the deficit for the year would be $27 billion nearly
three times the $9.2 billion deficit last year.
Arkansas senator dies in sleep
Washington — With the death yesterday of John
McClellan of Arkansas the Senate lost the chair

man of its powerful Appropriations Committee
and the chief sponsor of most of the major anti
crime legislation of recent years.
The 81-year-old senator, who announced a
week ago he would not run next year for a seventh
six-year term, died in his sleep in his apartment in
Little Rock. His body was found by his wife about
6:30 a.m. yesterday.
McClellan was a conservative pillar of the Senate
establishment and was renowned for his investiga
tions of corruption in and out of government.
Local machinists defy union
Sunnyvale — Defying orders from their union's
international leadership, hundreds of machinists
at the Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. plant here
ended a long strike yesterday and returned to their
jobs.
Lockheed spokesman George Mulhern said
about 80 to 90 per cent of some 3200 striking
employes belonging to local 508 were back on the
job after voting to approve the contract rejected by
the international union leaders.
However the 49-day walkout continued for
about 13,000 union members in locals at three
Southern California Lockheed facilities and a
Marietta, Ga., plant.
Of the 16,000 workers at Lockheed's Sunnyvale
plant, 1300 members of the machinists local and
11,500 other employes remained on their jobs dur

The vote on the three-year package was held

Israelis to meet Sadat in Cairo
Jerusalem — Israel formally agreed yesterday to
attend President Anwar Sadat's preliminary peace
conference in Cairo.
The United States will also participate in the
proposed conference, but it is holding off on any
formal announcement of the decision, administra
tion officials said yesterday.
Sources indicated it was the Carter administra
tion's belief that any public announcement of the
U.S. participation would solidify opposition to the
conference among militant Arabs at a time when
there were signs that opposition might wane.
The radical governments of Libya and Iraq sepa
rately called anti-Sadat Arab summits in their capi
tals.
The conflicting flurry of invitations threw the
Mideast into disarray. In Washington a State De
partment spokesman conceded there was little
chance of meeting President Jimmy Carter's goal
of reconvening the Geneva peace conference this
year.
In an address to the Knesset, the Israeli parlia
ment, Prime Minister Menahem Begin said he had
received and accepted Egypt's invitation to send
representatives to Cairo as early as Saturday to
prepare for Geneva. He named two top aides as his
envoys.
High Court eyes garbage case
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yes
terday to decide whether New Jersey can turn
down Pennsylvania garbage, and refused to block
the government's attempt to dismantle AT&T.
Taking action in some 200 cases the justices
voted to review a decision by the New Jersey Sup
reme Court that a state has the right to prohibit the
dumping of out-of-state garbage within its bor
ders.
The justices' eventual ruling, to come sometime
before the end of the court term in June, could
carry great impact for many states sharing New
Jersey's problem of a growing shortage of availa
ble disposal sites for wastes.

The cities of Philadelphia and Glen Cove, Pa.,
sued New Jersey authorities in 1973 after the state
legislature passed a law barring "the entry of any
solid or liquid waste collected in another state."
In another case the Supreme Court turned
down an appeal by the American Telephone and
Telegraph Co. aimed at getting the huge firm out
from under a tederal antitrust suit.
The justices' action means the government can
continue pressing its efforts to dismantle AT&T,
which claimed in its appeal that it could not be
sued for antitrust violations because it is heavily
regulated by the Federal Communications Com
mission and state agencies.
Dock strike swells deficit
Washington — A dock strike made October the
nation's worst trade month on record, as the na
tion bought $3.1 billion more in goods than it sold
abroad, the Commerce Department said yester
day.
With their strike continuing to exact a heavy toll
on international commerce for a ninth week,
50,000 members of the International Longshore
men's Association will decide today whether to
end their selective walkout at 34 Atlantic and Gulf
of Mexico ports.
Dockers have refused to handle cargo shipped
in van-sized containers since Oct. 1.
Goods destined for U.S. stores in time for the
lucrative Christmas buying season won't make it,
and backlogs are expected until the middle of next
year. Virtually all segments of American industry
are affected, and consumers will pay the price in
inconvenience and probably in higher prices for
most imported goods as new pay scales go into
effect for dockworkers.
The trade deficit surpassed the old record of
$2.8 billion recorded last June. At the current rate
the deficit for the year would be $27 billion nearly
three times the $9.2 billion deficit last year.
Arkansas senator dies in sleep
Washington — With the death yesterday of John
McClellan of Arkansas the Senate lost the chair

man of its powerful Appropriations Committee
and the chief sponsor of most of the major anti
crime legislation of recent years.
The 81-year-old senator, who announced a
week ago he would not run next year for a seventh
six-year term, died in his sleep in his apartment in
Little Rock. His body was found by his wife about
6:30 a.m. yesterday.
McClellan was a conservative pillar of the Senate
establishment and was renowned for his investiga
tions of corruption in and out of government.
Local machinists defy union
Sunnyvale — Defying orders from their union's
international leadership, hundreds of machinists
at the Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. plant here
ended a long strike yesterday and returned to their
jobs.
Lockheed spokesman George Mulhern said
about 80 to 90 per cent of some 3200 striking
employes belonging to local 508 were back on the
job after voting to approve the contract rejected by
the international union leaders.
However the 49-day walkout continued for
about 13,000 union members in locals at three
Southern California Lockheed facilities and a
Marietta, Ga., plant.
