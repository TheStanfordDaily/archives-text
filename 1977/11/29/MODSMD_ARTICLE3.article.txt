# SCRIP demands stock divestment
## 
### Tim Tranquada 
The Board of Trustees was pre
sented yesterday with a demand that
it decide by Feb. 14 to divest Univer
sity stockholdings in nine corpora
tions as a "first step towards ridding
Stanford of all its South African stoc
kholdings."
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
which made the demand at a press
conference, also said the stocks
should be sold within six months of
the decision to divest.
"The two and one half months be
tween now and the deadline allow a
careful examination of the issues,"
said senior Laura Carlsen, SCRIP
spokesperson, reading from a pre
pared statement. The six month
period should provide "ample time
for the portfolio's managers to pro
ceed in an orderly and nondisruptive
manner."
The nine companies, all of whom
currently have operations in South
Africa, are Bank of America, IBM,
Goodyear, General Electric, Union
Carbide, General Motors, Ford,
Mobil Oil and Del Monte.
The University has recently sold all
of its Del Monte stock, according to
Bob Beyers, Director of News and
Publications.
The University has approximately
672,000 shares in these companies,
with a purchase value of almost $33
million. Stanford's endowment as of
Aug. 31 totaled $442.5 million, with
$125 million invested in companies
that operate in South Africa.
"We have chosen to target nine
corporations because we feel they
will more easily facilitate educating
the public as to the corporate role of
the United States in South Africa,"
Carlsen said.
These nine corporations are also
among the "most blatant offenders"
in South Africa, according to
Carlsen.
Reaction
Asked what action SCRIP would
take if the board decides not to di
vest, Carlsen responded, "We will
have to make that decision (of how to
respond) as an organization at that
time. However, SCRIP strongly be
lieves in backing up its demands with
definite actions."
Carlsen indicated the call for di
vestment is "the next obvious step"
after student failure last year to per
suade trustees to reverse their
abstentions on shareholder resolu

tions calling for non-expansion or
withdrawal.
"At the time of the sit-in last May
(in which 294 people were arrested in
support of SCRIP demands), the de
mand was that Stanford vote yes on
the proxy resolutions, and if those
resolutions failed, that Stanford di
vest," Carlsen explained.
"Those resolutions did in fact fail
. . . and since the primary objective
is to have corporations withdraw
from South Africa, the next obvious
step is to call for divestment."
SCRIP also criticized Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massy's Nov. 16 cost/benefit re
port on divestiture, saying that
— divestment is only a temporary
measure — when these firms with
draw, Stanford "will be free to re
consider investment";
— $1.4 million in divestiture costs
to the University "are not significant
when compared to the institution's
financial resources";
— divestment spread "over a fairly
long period of time of several
months" would mitigate the financial
burden on the University; and
— corporate gifts to the University
depend on the "steady stream" of
professionals and research that Stan
ford provides, not upon its invest
ments policy.
Contacted by the Daily, Massy said
the $1.4 million transactional cost
was a minimum figure, and"the least
consequential of costs."
Larger effect
With the narrowing of investment
alternatives and the possible loss of
corporate gifts, the cost "could easily
be $5 or $10 million a year."
SCRIP'S assertion that divestment
is only a temporary measure "is just
plain wrong," Massy said. "The ef
fect of this boycott would be with us
for many years."
The only alternatives to meet this
cost are "either to substantially in
crease the student body size —
which is not feasible — or a dramatic
reduction in the size of the faculty,"
he said.
Massy expressed doubt that the
Feb. 14 deadline allows enough time
for proper consideration of the is
sue. The demand for divestiture
must be considered by the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility,
and trustees will not even consider
the new formulation, guidelines and
procedures recommended for the
OR until their Dec. 13 meeting, he
said.
Responding to SCRIP'S assertion
that divestment by Stanford "would
resound throughout American busi
ness and investment circles," he
said, "It certainly would resound — it
would be in the news for some
weeks.
"But it would have little effect on
corporate behavior," he continued.
"And in a few weeks (the furor) will

have died down. We would have a
few weeks in the limelight, but
would carry the consequences tor
many years."
Massy reiterated his personal op
position to apartheid and his con
tinued support of the conclusions
reached in the cost/benefit report.

also read the text of a resolution sup
porting the SCRIP demands that will
be presented at the ASSU Senate
meeting tonight.

"The two and one half months be
tween now and the deadline allow a
careful examination of the issues,"
said senior Laura Carlsen, SCRIP
spokesperson, reading from a pre
pared statement. The six month
period should provide "ample time
for the portfolio's managers to pro
ceed in an orderly and nondisruptive
manner."
The nine companies, all of whom
currently have operations in South
Africa, are Bank of America, IBM,
Goodyear, General Electric, Union
Carbide, General Motors, Ford,
Mobil Oil and Del Monte.
The University has recently sold all
of its Del Monte stock, according to
Bob Beyers, Director of News and
Publications.
The University has approximately
672,000 shares in these companies,
with a purchase value of almost $33
million. Stanford's endowment as of
Aug. 31 totaled $442.5 million, with
$125 million invested in companies
that operate in South Africa.
"We have chosen to target nine
corporations because we feel they
will more easily facilitate educating
the public as to the corporate role of
the United States in South Africa,"
Carlsen said.
These nine corporations are also
among the "most blatant offenders"
in South Africa, according to
Carlsen.

Asked what action SCRIP would
take if the board decides not to di
vest, Carlsen responded, "We will
have to make that decision (of how to
respond) as an organization at that
time. However, SCRIP strongly be
lieves in backing up its demands with
definite actions."
Carlsen indicated the call for di
vestment is "the next obvious step"
after student failure last year to per
suade trustees to reverse their
abstentions on shareholder resolu

tions calling for non-expansion or
withdrawal.
"At the time of the sit-in last May
(in which 294 people were arrested in
support of SCRIP demands), the de
mand was that Stanford vote yes on
the proxy resolutions, and if those
resolutions failed, that Stanford di
vest," Carlsen explained.
"Those resolutions did in fact fail
. . . and since the primary objective
is to have corporations withdraw
from South Africa, the next obvious
step is to call for divestment."
SCRIP also criticized Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massy's Nov. 16 cost/benefit re
port on divestiture, saying that
— divestment is only a temporary
measure — when these firms with
draw, Stanford "will be free to re
consider investment";
— $1.4 million in divestiture costs
to the University "are not significant
when compared to the institution's
financial resources";
— divestment spread "over a fairly
long period of time of several
months" would mitigate the financial
burden on the University; and
— corporate gifts to the University
depend on the "steady stream" of
professionals and research that Stan
ford provides, not upon its invest
ments policy.
Contacted by the Daily, Massy said
the $1.4 million transactional cost
was a minimum figure, and"the least
consequential of costs."
Larger effect
With the narrowing of investment
alternatives and the possible loss of
corporate gifts, the cost "could easily
be $5 or $10 million a year."
SCRIP'S assertion that divestment
is only a temporary measure "is just
plain wrong," Massy said. "The ef
fect of this boycott would be with us
for many years."
The only alternatives to meet this
cost are "either to substantially in
crease the student body size —
which is not feasible — or a dramatic
reduction in the size of the faculty,"
he said.
Massy expressed doubt that the
Feb. 14 deadline allows enough time
for proper consideration of the is
sue. The demand for divestiture
must be considered by the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility,
and trustees will not even consider
the new formulation, guidelines and
procedures recommended for the
OR until their Dec. 13 meeting, he
said.
Responding to SCRIP'S assertion
that divestment by Stanford "would
resound throughout American busi
ness and investment circles," he
said, "It certainly would resound — it
would be in the news for some
weeks.
"But it would have little effect on
corporate behavior," he continued.
"And in a few weeks (the furor) will

have died down. We would have a
few weeks in the limelight, but
would carry the consequences tor
many years."
Massy reiterated his personal op
position to apartheid and his con
tinued support of the conclusions
reached in the cost/benefit report.
SCRIP spokesperson Peter Salovey
also read the text of a resolution sup
porting the SCRIP demands that will
be presented at the ASSU Senate
meeting tonight.
The Board of Trustees was pre
sented yesterday with a demand that
it decide by Feb. 14 to divest Univer
sity stockholdings in nine corpora
tions as a "first step towards ridding
Stanford of all its South African stoc
kholdings."

Carbide, General Motors, Ford,
Mobil Oil and Del Monte.
The University has recently sold all
of its Del Monte stock, according to
Bob Beyers, Director of News and
Publications.
The University has approximately
672,000 shares in these companies,
with a purchase value of almost $33
million. Stanford's endowment as of
Aug. 31 totaled $442.5 million, with
$125 million invested in companies
that operate in South Africa.
"We have chosen to target nine
corporations because we feel they
will more easily facilitate educating
the public as to the corporate role of
the United States in South Africa,"
Carlsen said.
These nine corporations are also
among the "most blatant offenders"
in South Africa, according to
Carlsen.
Reaction
Asked what action SCRIP would
take if the board decides not to di
vest, Carlsen responded, "We will
have to make that decision (of how to
respond) as an organization at that
time. However, SCRIP strongly be
lieves in backing up its demands with
definite actions."
Carlsen indicated the call for di
vestment is "the next obvious step"
after student failure last year to per
suade trustees to reverse their
abstentions on shareholder resolu

tions calling for non-expansion or
withdrawal.
"At the time of the sit-in last May
(in which 294 people were arrested in
support of SCRIP demands), the de
mand was that Stanford vote yes on
the proxy resolutions, and if those
resolutions failed, that Stanford di
vest," Carlsen explained.
"Those resolutions did in fact fail
. . . and since the primary objective
is to have corporations withdraw
from South Africa, the next obvious
step is to call for divestment."
SCRIP also criticized Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massy's Nov. 16 cost/benefit re
port on divestiture, saying that
— divestment is only a temporary
measure — when these firms with
draw, Stanford "will be free to re
consider investment";
— $1.4 million in divestiture costs
to the University "are not significant
when compared to the institution's
financial resources";
— divestment spread "over a fairly
long period of time of several
months" would mitigate the financial
burden on the University; and
— corporate gifts to the University
depend on the "steady stream" of
professionals and research that Stan
ford provides, not upon its invest
ments policy.
Contacted by the Daily, Massy said
the $1.4 million transactional cost
was a minimum figure, and"the least
consequential of costs."
Larger effect
With the narrowing of investment
alternatives and the possible loss of
corporate gifts, the cost "could easily
be $5 or $10 million a year."
SCRIP'S assertion that divestment
is only a temporary measure "is just
plain wrong," Massy said. "The ef
fect of this boycott would be with us
for many years."
The only alternatives to meet this
cost are "either to substantially in
crease the student body size —
which is not feasible — or a dramatic
reduction in the size of the faculty,"
he said.
Massy expressed doubt that the
Feb. 14 deadline allows enough time
for proper consideration of the is
sue. The demand for divestiture
must be considered by the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility,
and trustees will not even consider
the new formulation, guidelines and
procedures recommended for the
OR until their Dec. 13 meeting, he
said.
Responding to SCRIP'S assertion
that divestment by Stanford "would
resound throughout American busi
ness and investment circles," he
said, "It certainly would resound — it
would be in the news for some
weeks.
"But it would have little effect on
corporate behavior," he continued.
"And in a few weeks (the furor) will

have died down. We would have a
few weeks in the limelight, but
would carry the consequences tor
many years."
Massy reiterated his personal op
position to apartheid and his con
tinued support of the conclusions
reached in the cost/benefit report.
SCRIP spokesperson Peter Salovey
also read the text of a resolution sup
porting the SCRIP demands that will
be presented at the ASSU Senate
meeting tonight.
The Board of Trustees was pre
sented yesterday with a demand that
it decide by Feb. 14 to divest Univer
sity stockholdings in nine corpora
tions as a "first step towards ridding
Stanford of all its South African stoc
kholdings."
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP),
which made the demand at a press
conference, also said the stocks
should be sold within six months of
the decision to divest.
"The two and one half months be
tween now and the deadline allow a
careful examination of the issues,"
said senior Laura Carlsen, SCRIP
spokesperson, reading from a pre
pared statement. The six month
period should provide "ample time
for the portfolio's managers to pro
ceed in an orderly and nondisruptive
manner."
The nine companies, all of whom
currently have operations in South
Africa, are Bank of America, IBM,
Goodyear, General Electric, Union
Carbide, General Motors, Ford,
Mobil Oil and Del Monte.
