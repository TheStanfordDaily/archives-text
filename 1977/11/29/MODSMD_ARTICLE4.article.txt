# Wilson hopes to move from San Diego to Sacramento
## 
### Ali Webb 
Addressing a group of Palo Alto
Republican clubwomen recently,
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson de
monstrated he is running hard for
the Republican gubernatorial nomi
nation. For the two-term mayor, the
women were just one more whistle
stop on his statewide campaign to
boost his visibility and name recogni
tion.
Wilson hopes to emerge victorious
from a crowded field of primary con
tenders including Attorney General
Evelle Younger, Los Angeles Police
Chief Ed Davis and Assemblyman
Ken Maddy (R-Fresno).
Younger currently leads in
statewide name recognition polls but
Wilson said this doesn't reflect vot
ers' preference or support. He said a
recent Field report showed Younger
losing ground among Republican
voters, ground Wilson is gaining.
Wilson, 44, boasts a crisp, cool
style of campaigning complemented
by a smooth speaking ability. The
blond ex-Marine is not new to the
political arena; before his mayoral
terms, Wilson served in the state as
sembly. He says he can stand on his
record as mayor and state legislator
as sufficient preparation for the gov

ernorship.
Attempting to shake a moderate
Republican image, the candidate has
spoken long and hard in his crusade
for passage of an initiative to outlaw
public employe strikes and compul
sory binding arbitration. "I want to
see a California free from the fear of
the interruption of essential public
services," he said.
He said illegal public strikes cost
the California taxpayer half a million
dollars last year.
The issue of public employe strikes
is seen by many Republicans as a po
tentially divisive issue similar to the
"right to work" issue that virtually
destroyed the Republican Party dur
ing the campaign of William Noland.
"Right to work is just a red
herring," Wilson said. "The oppo
nents will grasp at any straw."
Wilson also said he feels the Briggs
initiative which would compel the fir
ing of homosexual teachers covers
an area that is already included in the
law.
Wilson, who holds a law degree
from the University of California,
blasted Gov. Jerry Brown on the
issue of property tax relief, calling his
program "a ride on inflation." In

other areas of Brown's fiscal policy,
Wilson said, "Jerry Brown has indi
cated that he is fiscal conservative. If
you listen to the rhetoric you would
think that you were listening to a dis
ciple of Ronald Reagan.
"But if you look at the facts not
withstanding the nickel and diming,
sleeping on the mattress, driving the
Plymouth, what is costing us is the
increase in the state budget from
over $10 to almost $15 billion."
Wilson said Brown is attempting to
deceive people with "pleasant
populist symbolic gestures."
Wilson, a 1955 Yale graduate, said
he believes "The discussion of a re
cord is not only a legitimate cam
paign issue but what campaigning is
all about.
"The problem of a state the size of
California is that there is so much
competition for the attention of the
voter that all too often the voter goes
to the poll with inadequate informa
tion."
Speaking on what he sees as the
differences between Davis and him
self, Wilson said "many people who
admire Ed as chief see the job of gov
ernor as being quite different, more
of a managerial responsibility. It is
not within a single field, law en

forcement, but instead deals with
hundreds of issues.
"The other candidates ask the
people to take on faith their ability to
manage. In my case they can check it
with the record."
Wilson did not hesitate to point
out what he saw as the weak points of
his opponents. He said opponent
Maddy has a voting record that is
considerably more liberal than his
"current pronouncements." Maddy,
a vigorous fund-raiser, has suc
ceeded in raising a large amount of
money.
Wilson said he feels Maddy has
succeeded in raising money that he
believes otherwise would have gone
to him. Wilson has faced financial
difficulties in previous campaigns for
public office.
With a frequent smile, Wilson pro
fessed a liking for campaigning, cal
ling it "a flaw in his personality." A
veteran campaigner, Wilson com
mented on what attracted him to
public office. "People get into public
life because in one degree or another
they combine idealism and egotism.
The idealism is in wanting to help
people, the egotism exists in think
ing that you can."

Pete Wilson, mayor of San Diego, is seeking the Republican nomination for
governor. He tola a Palo Alto women's group last week that he thinks the voters
support him, despite his apparent lag in opinion polls.
Addressing a group of Palo Alto
Republican clubwomen recently,
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson de
monstrated he is running hard for
the Republican gubernatorial nomi
nation. For the two-term mayor, the
women were just one more whistle
stop on his statewide campaign to
boost his visibility and name recogni
tion.
Wilson hopes to emerge victorious
from a crowded field of primary con
tenders including Attorney General
Evelle Younger, Los Angeles Police
Chief Ed Davis and Assemblyman
Ken Maddy (R-Fresno).
Younger currently leads in
statewide name recognition polls but
Wilson said this doesn't reflect vot
ers' preference or support. He said a
recent Field report showed Younger
losing ground among Republican
voters, ground Wilson is gaining.
Wilson, 44, boasts a crisp, cool
style of campaigning complemented
by a smooth speaking ability. The
blond ex-Marine is not new to the
political arena; before his mayoral
terms, Wilson served in the state as
sembly. He says he can stand on his
record as mayor and state legislator
as sufficient preparation for the gov

ernorship.
Attempting to shake a moderate
Republican image, the candidate has
spoken long and hard in his crusade
for passage of an initiative to outlaw
public employe strikes and compul
sory binding arbitration. "I want to
see a California free from the fear of
the interruption of essential public
services," he said.
He said illegal public strikes cost
the California taxpayer half a million
dollars last year.
The issue of public employe strikes
is seen by many Republicans as a po
tentially divisive issue similar to the
"right to work" issue that virtually
destroyed the Republican Party dur
ing the campaign of William Noland.
"Right to work is just a red
herring," Wilson said. "The oppo
nents will grasp at any straw."
Wilson also said he feels the Briggs
initiative which would compel the fir
ing of homosexual teachers covers
an area that is already included in the
law.
Wilson, who holds a law degree
from the University of California,
blasted Gov. Jerry Brown on the
issue of property tax relief, calling his
program "a ride on inflation." In

other areas of Brown's fiscal policy,
Wilson said, "Jerry Brown has indi
cated that he is fiscal conservative. If
you listen to the rhetoric you would
think that you were listening to a dis
ciple of Ronald Reagan.
"But if you look at the facts not
withstanding the nickel and diming,
sleeping on the mattress, driving the
Plymouth, what is costing us is the
increase in the state budget from
over $10 to almost $15 billion."
Wilson said Brown is attempting to
deceive people with "pleasant
populist symbolic gestures."
Wilson, a 1955 Yale graduate, said
he believes "The discussion of a re
cord is not only a legitimate cam
paign issue but what campaigning is
all about.
"The problem of a state the size of
California is that there is so much
competition for the attention of the
voter that all too often the voter goes
to the poll with inadequate informa
tion."
Speaking on what he sees as the
differences between Davis and him
self, Wilson said "many people who
admire Ed as chief see the job of gov
ernor as being quite different, more
of a managerial responsibility. It is
not within a single field, law en

forcement, but instead deals with
hundreds of issues.
"The other candidates ask the
people to take on faith their ability to
manage. In my case they can check it
with the record."
Wilson did not hesitate to point
out what he saw as the weak points of
his opponents. He said opponent
Maddy has a voting record that is
considerably more liberal than his
"current pronouncements." Maddy,
a vigorous fund-raiser, has suc
ceeded in raising a large amount of
money.
Wilson said he feels Maddy has
succeeded in raising money that he
believes otherwise would have gone
to him. Wilson has faced financial
difficulties in previous campaigns for
public office.
With a frequent smile, Wilson pro
fessed a liking for campaigning, cal
ling it "a flaw in his personality." A
veteran campaigner, Wilson com
mented on what attracted him to
public office. "People get into public
life because in one degree or another
they combine idealism and egotism.
The idealism is in wanting to help
people, the egotism exists in think
ing that you can."
