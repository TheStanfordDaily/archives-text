# 'A look in the mirror
## For men only 
### 
Mike Shuman

Fellow knights of Stanford, let's
grant each other a five minute truce!
Let's lay down our lances, remove
our heavy armor, put aside our
chivalrous honor and simply accept
each other as male brothers.
Pretend you're standing before a
mirror and take a good look at your
self. Don't flex — there's no need to
impress yourself. Just gaze at your
self as someone you lov:* and would
care to know better. Feel uncomfort
ably naked? Well, you should. It's
not often we men can be so starkly
honest with ourselves.
Have you ever taken much time to
think about what it really means to be
male? We like to think of ourselves as
free and yet upon closer scrutiny, we
can see how our maleness locks us
into rigid behavior patterns that pro
hibit "deviance."
Why must we strain our muscles
into shapeliness, style our hair and
whiskers, buy flashy clothes and
drive fast, "sexy" cars? Why are we
discouraged from hugging or hold
ing our fellow male friends? Why
aren't we respected if we cry? Why
are we expected to initiate
heterosexual relationships? If we
marry, why must we be the "bread
winners?"
From the cradle our "softness" is
obliterated. "Don't be a sissy!" "Big
boys don't cry!" We're given guns,
battleships and toy soldiers to act out
our conquest fantasies. Trucks,
shovels, blocks, tools and trains all
turn us into sprouting atomistic en
trepeneurs. Our ultimate prowess is
achieved in athletics, where we be
come the strongest, fastest and
cleverest .
What's perhaps more revealing is
what we boys don't play-act. We can
neither play house nor dolls. Rein
forced by the position of our
mothers, we learn that women are
destined to be our servants, cleaning
our houses, cooking our meals and
raising our children.
Productive
As we grow old, we men must get
down to business. We must be pro
ductive and give our family a "de
cent" standard of living. We relurn
home from the "office" too preoc
cuppied with our work and too
exhausted to develop our family ties.
As we sink deeper into the tradi
tional instrumental male role, we
lose our desire and ability to feel, to
empathize and to love. We learn to
be strong, rational and assertive
while also learning to suppress their

complements.
Our strength without vulnerability
becomes dogmatic ego defensive
ness incapable of adaptation and
growth. How often do we viciously
reject criticism before really evaluat
ing it?
Our cool rationality without
human fear or anger turns us into
numb unresponsive machines. As
we evaporate our tears behind a
guise of calmness, we talk ourselves
out of what we are really feeling.
Consequently, we lose touch with
ourselves. We have difficulty recog
nizing and treating problems, and
they spiral out of control. Others
close to us are thwarted in their at
tempts to help us with our hidden
problems. We cause their loving ef
forts to fail, frustrating us further.
Our assertiveness without caring,
patience and sensitivity becomes
belligerence, even bellicosity. Too
often, we assert ourselves to "win" or
"lose," not to understand. Our
academic assertiveness degenerates
into desperate grade grubbing ner
dism instead of deeper learning. Our
career assertiveness manifests into
selfish imperialism in which "suc
cess" is reduced to money and fame,
and societal benefit and self-growth
are tossed aside as minor considera
tions. Our sexual assertiveness is felt
by many women as physical and
emotional rape.
It is no accident that we will die
younger than women. As we get
older, it becomes increasingly dif
ficult to ignore our alienation. Be
neath our hard armor lie well-hidden
anxieties, straining to surface. Stress
builds, leading to hypertension and
peptic ulcers. Our physical body re
volts against our emotional neglect.
Our obsession with "its" instead of
people causes us to wither soon after
retirement.
My own socialization has for 21
years prevented me from seeing how
true the above male dysfunctions are
in my own life. I am but one of
thousands of Stanford men, society's
ultimate expression of masculinity.
Handsome, bright, aggressive, mus
cular, articulate — a winner. But a
winner over whom, we might won
der. I suspect that, sooner or later,
we all will be losers as traditional
males.
I look around and see hundreds of
mortified men, paralyzed by their
single-minded imprisonment and
destined to die lonely' never quite
knowing what went wrong. My

grandfather, a New York gangster of
sorts, had a nervous breakdown right
after the depression dissolved his
wealth and ancillary prestige. Like
many, the blow to his narrow male
ego was irreparable. He solved his
problems by hanging himself.
I have no easy answers. My men's
consciousness raising group helps
me; diagnosis is half a step towards
cure. Talking to other men about
men's problems assures us that we
are not alone in our anxieties, imper
fections and insecurities. Maybe we
should also try to doff our armor
more often.
Remind yourself that you're
human by hugging best male friends
or freely admitting mistakes or even
crying. But true men's liberation
probably requires a lifetime of studi
ous devotion to political as well as
personal change, and deals at least as
much with society's oppression of
women. Are we prepared to take on
that challenge?
Well, it's time to suit up again. Pick
up your lances, but try to leave your
helmets behind. As you gallop oft to
your next battle, just think twice
about whether you really prefer cold
metal plating to a warm soul.

ness incapable of adaptation and
growth. How often do we viciously
reject criticism before really evaluat
ing it?
Our cool rationality without
human fear or anger turns us into
numb unresponsive machines. As
we evaporate our tears behind a
guise of calmness, we talk ourselves
out of what we are really feeling.
Consequently, we lose touch with
ourselves. We have difficulty recog
nizing and treating problems, and
they spiral out of control. Others
close to us are thwarted in their at
tempts to help us with our hidden
problems. We cause their loving ef
forts to fail, frustrating us further.
Our assertiveness without caring,
patience and sensitivity becomes
belligerence, even bellicosity. Too
often, we assert ourselves to "win" or
"lose," not to understand. Our
academic assertiveness degenerates
into desperate grade grubbing ner
dism instead of deeper learning. Our
career assertiveness manifests into
selfish imperialism in which "suc
cess" is reduced to money and fame,
and societal benefit and self-growth
are tossed aside as minor considera
tions. Our sexual assertiveness is felt
by many women as physical and
emotional rape.
It is no accident that we will die
younger than women. As we get
older, it becomes increasingly dif
ficult to ignore our alienation. Be
neath our hard armor lie well-hidden
anxieties, straining to surface. Stress
builds, leading to hypertension and
peptic ulcers. Our physical body re
volts against our emotional neglect.
Our obsession with "its" instead of
people causes us to wither soon after
retirement.
My own socialization has for 21
years prevented me from seeing how
true the above male dysfunctions are
in my own life. I am but one of
thousands of Stanford men, society's
ultimate expression of masculinity.
Handsome, bright, aggressive, mus
cular, articulate — a winner. But a
winner over whom, we might won
der. I suspect that, sooner or later,
we all will be losers as traditional
males.
I look around and see hundreds of
mortified men, paralyzed by their
single-minded imprisonment and
destined to die lonely' never quite
knowing what went wrong. My

grandfather, a New York gangster of
sorts, had a nervous breakdown right
after the depression dissolved his
wealth and ancillary prestige. Like
many, the blow to his narrow male
ego was irreparable. He solved his
problems by hanging himself.
I have no easy answers. My men's
consciousness raising group helps
me; diagnosis is half a step towards
cure. Talking to other men about
men's problems assures us that we
are not alone in our anxieties, imper
fections and insecurities. Maybe we
should also try to doff our armor
more often.
Remind yourself that you're
human by hugging best male friends
or freely admitting mistakes or even
crying. But true men's liberation
probably requires a lifetime of studi
ous devotion to political as well as
personal change, and deals at least as
much with society's oppression of
women. Are we prepared to take on
that challenge?
Well, it's time to suit up again. Pick
up your lances, but try to leave your
helmets behind. As you gallop oft to
your next battle, just think twice
about whether you really prefer cold
metal plating to a warm soul.

Fellow knights of Stanford, let's
grant each other a five minute truce!
Let's lay down our lances, remove
our heavy armor, put aside our
chivalrous honor and simply accept
each other as male brothers.
Pretend you're standing before a
mirror and take a good look at your
self. Don't flex — there's no need to
impress yourself. Just gaze at your
self as someone you lov:* and would
care to know better. Feel uncomfort
ably naked? Well, you should. It's
not often we men can be so starkly
honest with ourselves.
Have you ever taken much time to
think about what it really means to be
male? We like to think of ourselves as
free and yet upon closer scrutiny, we
can see how our maleness locks us
into rigid behavior patterns that pro
hibit "deviance."
Why must we strain our muscles
into shapeliness, style our hair and
whiskers, buy flashy clothes and
drive fast, "sexy" cars? Why are we
discouraged from hugging or hold
ing our fellow male friends? Why
aren't we respected if we cry? Why
are we expected to initiate
heterosexual relationships? If we
marry, why must we be the "bread
winners?"
From the cradle our "softness" is
obliterated. "Don't be a sissy!" "Big
boys don't cry!" We're given guns,
battleships and toy soldiers to act out
our conquest fantasies. Trucks,
shovels, blocks, tools and trains all
turn us into sprouting atomistic en
trepeneurs. Our ultimate prowess is
achieved in athletics, where we be
come the strongest, fastest and
cleverest .
What's perhaps more revealing is
what we boys don't play-act. We can
neither play house nor dolls. Rein
forced by the position of our
mothers, we learn that women are
destined to be our servants, cleaning
our houses, cooking our meals and
raising our children.
Productive
As we grow old, we men must get
down to business. We must be pro
ductive and give our family a "de
cent" standard of living. We relurn
home from the "office" too preoc
cuppied with our work and too
exhausted to develop our family ties.
As we sink deeper into the tradi
tional instrumental male role, we
lose our desire and ability to feel, to
empathize and to love. We learn to
be strong, rational and assertive
while also learning to suppress their

complements.

should also try to doff our armor
more often.
Remind yourself that you're
human by hugging best male friends
or freely admitting mistakes or even
crying. But true men's liberation
probably requires a lifetime of studi

personal change, and deals at least as
much with society's oppression of
women. Are we prepared to take on
that challenge?
Well, it's time to suit up again. Pick

about whether you really prefer cold
metal plating to a warm soul.

Fellow knights of Stanford, let's
grant each other a five minute truce!
Let's lay down our lances, remove
our heavy armor, put aside our
chivalrous honor and simply accept
each other as male brothers.
Pretend you're standing before a
mirror and take a good look at your
self. Don't flex — there's no need to
impress yourself. Just gaze at your
self as someone you lov:* and would
care to know better. Feel uncomfort
ably naked? Well, you should. It's
not often we men can be so starkly
honest with ourselves.
Have you ever taken much time to
think about what it really means to be
male? We like to think of ourselves as
free and yet upon closer scrutiny, we
can see how our maleness locks us
into rigid behavior patterns that pro
hibit "deviance."
Why must we strain our muscles
into shapeliness, style our hair and
whiskers, buy flashy clothes and
drive fast, "sexy" cars? Why are we
discouraged from hugging or hold
ing our fellow male friends? Why
aren't we respected if we cry? Why
are we expected to initiate
heterosexual relationships? If we
marry, why must we be the "bread
winners?"
From the cradle our "softness" is
obliterated. "Don't be a sissy!" "Big
boys don't cry!" We're given guns,
battleships and toy soldiers to act out
our conquest fantasies. Trucks,
shovels, blocks, tools and trains all
turn us into sprouting atomistic en
trepeneurs. Our ultimate prowess is
achieved in athletics, where we be
come the strongest, fastest and
cleverest .
What's perhaps more revealing is
what we boys don't play-act. We can
neither play house nor dolls. Rein
forced by the position of our
mothers, we learn that women are
destined to be our servants, cleaning
our houses, cooking our meals and
raising our children.
Productive
As we grow old, we men must get
down to business. We must be pro
ductive and give our family a "de
cent" standard of living. We relurn
home from the "office" too preoc
cuppied with our work and too
exhausted to develop our family ties.
As we sink deeper into the tradi
tional instrumental male role, we
lose our desire and ability to feel, to
empathize and to love. We learn to
be strong, rational and assertive
while also learning to suppress their

complements.
Our strength without vulnerability
becomes dogmatic ego defensive
ness incapable of adaptation and
growth. How often do we viciously
reject criticism before really evaluat
ing it?
Our cool rationality without
human fear or anger turns us into
numb unresponsive machines. As
we evaporate our tears behind a
guise of calmness, we talk ourselves
out of what we are really feeling.
Consequently, we lose touch with
ourselves. We have difficulty recog
nizing and treating problems, and
they spiral out of control. Others
close to us are thwarted in their at
tempts to help us with our hidden
problems. We cause their loving ef
forts to fail, frustrating us further.
Our assertiveness without caring,
patience and sensitivity becomes
belligerence, even bellicosity. Too
often, we assert ourselves to "win" or
"lose," not to understand. Our
academic assertiveness degenerates
into desperate grade grubbing ner
dism instead of deeper learning. Our
career assertiveness manifests into
selfish imperialism in which "suc
cess" is reduced to money and fame,
and societal benefit and self-growth
are tossed aside as minor considera
tions. Our sexual assertiveness is felt
by many women as physical and
emotional rape.
It is no accident that we will die
younger than women. As we get
older, it becomes increasingly dif
ficult to ignore our alienation. Be
neath our hard armor lie well-hidden
anxieties, straining to surface. Stress
builds, leading to hypertension and
peptic ulcers. Our physical body re
volts against our emotional neglect.
Our obsession with "its" instead of
people causes us to wither soon after
retirement.
My own socialization has for 21
years prevented me from seeing how
true the above male dysfunctions are
in my own life. I am but one of
thousands of Stanford men, society's
ultimate expression of masculinity.
Handsome, bright, aggressive, mus
cular, articulate — a winner. But a
winner over whom, we might won
der. I suspect that, sooner or later,
we all will be losers as traditional
males.
I look around and see hundreds of
mortified men, paralyzed by their
single-minded imprisonment and
destined to die lonely' never quite
knowing what went wrong. My

grandfather, a New York gangster of
sorts, had a nervous breakdown right
after the depression dissolved his
wealth and ancillary prestige. Like
many, the blow to his narrow male
ego was irreparable. He solved his
problems by hanging himself.
I have no easy answers. My men's
consciousness raising group helps
me; diagnosis is half a step towards
cure. Talking to other men about
men's problems assures us that we
are not alone in our anxieties, imper
fections and insecurities. Maybe we
should also try to doff our armor
more often.
