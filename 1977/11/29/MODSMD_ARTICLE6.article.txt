# Taking 'pride' in USC
## What students here miss 
### 
Steve Mushkin

Once upon a time, Stanford lost to
USC, 49-0, and the fans who drove
700 times Darrin Nelson's season
yardage didn't even cry? How come?
"Because," some Stanford stu
dents yelled, "we may have lost, but
you still have to go to school at USC."
Really, though, USC students can
take pride in many things which Stan
ford students do not possess.
To begin with, some USC stu
dents, unlike some Stanford stu
dents, have some intelligence. Some
of them read a book once. Some of
them understand long sentences
which include words like "include."
Sinn of them do not salivate at the
soun-l of the end class bell.
USC students have contact with
the real world, unlike isolated, pas
toral Stanford kids. There are work
study opportunities where students
vend programs and popcorn at the
football games and study, too.
What's more, USC students read
many newspapers and are active in
politics, usually during odd
numbered leap years.
Outdated
Stanford persons must attend
school amidst old, outdated Spanish
architecture. USC persons get to go
to class in sparkling, new buildings
that look good from the blimp. They
also get to inhabit dorms which are
tall and shiny and have drinking
fountains with foot pedals.
Additionally, USC's admissions
policy is much superior. Instead of
being selective and worrying about

the Bakke decision, USC follows a
system of majority admissions. Last
year, USC accepted almost all ot the
young movers who wanted to go
there. The only applicants not ac
cepted were dead, had admitted
smoking in high school bathrooms,
or were reptiles.
USC students enjoy the benefits of
a marvelous process known as clon
ing, as yet undeveloped here at Stan
ford. While Stanford fans are messy
and disorganized at football games
and stand up at all the wrong times,
the USC students, profiting from
being clones, raise their arms and
cheer simultaneously when the run
ning back runs by for a touchdown
and also when the white Trojan
horse runs by to tell them that the
running back just ran by for a
touchdown. Sometimes the horse
gets fatigued from so much scoring
and walks.
Right letters
Cloned USC students can also say
"way to go band" simultaneously
and spell out "Southern California"
simultaneously, with all the right let
ters.
USC girls can live in SORORITIES,
but Stanford girls, who may soon see
sororities, will never see
SORORITIES. A SORORITY is a place
where girls experience fun together
and are happy because they are in
"college" ana these are their finest
years.
The girls wear fluffy maroon and
gold dresses, which correspond to

the band uniforms. Whether these
girls ever take off their dresses and
wrap themselves more comfortably
is unknown to boys, since boys are
not allowed past the first floor of the
house.
This is because the girls do not
carry their manners with them on the
second floor and up. Their manners
are supposedly kept in a big closet
near the stairs. On the way down to
dinner or a date, each girl reaches in
the closet, gropes around, linds
hers, and puts them on like a too-big
coat, although which manners are
hers doesn't really matter, because
all the manners look ab6ut the same.
No broccoli
If a girl forgets to put on her man
ners for dinner, theothergirlsdo not
throw broccoli at her, since they are
still wearing their manners. Instead,
the house mother, who is the man
ners handler, tells the delinquent girl
that she must wear jeans to school
the next day and be laughed at a lot.
Just as great as the SORO p ITIFS are
the FRATERNITIES. Stanford only has
fraternities. FRATERNITIES have
pledges, who are not real people and
get to wear ties to school on Mon
days, to signify that they are not rea!
people. Pledges also get to live in tin
house for a half year before becom
ing actives, who are like real people,
only better. If the actives decide dur
ing the half year that they don't like a
certain pledge and that he should
never become real, they boot him
out into the gutter.
He is then a subpledge and ranks
on the ladder of life only above )ello.
The grieved boy must search for a
new peer group and new clothes,
which accounts for the incredible
size of the USC Marching Band.
FRATERNITIES also enjoy panty
raids, where all the underwear from a
SORORITY jumps out of its drawers,
rushes across campus, and leaps
onto the walls of a FRATERNITY, sur
rounding the boys inside and making
them very afraid indeed.
The next morning, the girls
run over to the FRATERNITY and beg
their underwear to leave the poor
boys alone. The panties, moved by
the pleas, give up the siege and are
taken home, where they are mildly
scolded and washed.
Thus, USC has many fine and up
standing qualities and activities
which Stanford should adopt for its
fine and upstanding boys and girls.
The time to start is now.

dents, have some intelligence. Some
of them read a book once. Some of
them understand long sentences
which include words like "include."
Sinn of them do not salivate at the
soun-l of the end class bell.
USC students have contact with
the real world, unlike isolated, pas
toral Stanford kids. There are work
study opportunities where students
vend programs and popcorn at the
football games and study, too.
What's more, USC students read
many newspapers and are active in
politics, usually during odd
numbered leap years.
Outdated
Stanford persons must attend
school amidst old, outdated Spanish
architecture. USC persons get to go
to class in sparkling, new buildings
that look good from the blimp. They
also get to inhabit dorms which are
tall and shiny and have drinking
fountains with foot pedals.
Additionally, USC's admissions
policy is much superior. Instead of
being selective and worrying about

the Bakke decision, USC follows a
system of majority admissions. Last
year, USC accepted almost all ot the
young movers who wanted to go
there. The only applicants not ac
cepted were dead, had admitted
smoking in high school bathrooms,
or were reptiles.
USC students enjoy the benefits of
a marvelous process known as clon
ing, as yet undeveloped here at Stan
ford. While Stanford fans are messy
and disorganized at football games
and stand up at all the wrong times,
the USC students, profiting from
being clones, raise their arms and
cheer simultaneously when the run
ning back runs by for a touchdown
and also when the white Trojan
horse runs by to tell them that the
running back just ran by for a
touchdown. Sometimes the horse
gets fatigued from so much scoring
and walks.
Right letters
Cloned USC students can also say
"way to go band" simultaneously
and spell out "Southern California"
simultaneously, with all the right let
ters.
USC girls can live in SORORITIES,
but Stanford girls, who may soon see
sororities, will never see
SORORITIES. A SORORITY is a place
where girls experience fun together
and are happy because they are in
"college" ana these are their finest
years.
The girls wear fluffy maroon and
gold dresses, which correspond to

the band uniforms. Whether these
girls ever take off their dresses and
wrap themselves more comfortably
is unknown to boys, since boys are
not allowed past the first floor of the
house.
This is because the girls do not
carry their manners with them on the
second floor and up. Their manners
are supposedly kept in a big closet
near the stairs. On the way down to
dinner or a date, each girl reaches in
the closet, gropes around, linds
hers, and puts them on like a too-big
coat, although which manners are
hers doesn't really matter, because
all the manners look ab6ut the same.
No broccoli
If a girl forgets to put on her man
ners for dinner, theothergirlsdo not
throw broccoli at her, since they are
still wearing their manners. Instead,
the house mother, who is the man
ners handler, tells the delinquent girl
that she must wear jeans to school
the next day and be laughed at a lot.
Just as great as the SORO p ITIFS are
the FRATERNITIES. Stanford only has
fraternities. FRATERNITIES have
pledges, who are not real people and
get to wear ties to school on Mon
days, to signify that they are not rea!
people. Pledges also get to live in tin
house for a half year before becom
ing actives, who are like real people,
only better. If the actives decide dur
ing the half year that they don't like a
certain pledge and that he should
never become real, they boot him
out into the gutter.
He is then a subpledge and ranks
on the ladder of life only above )ello.
The grieved boy must search for a
new peer group and new clothes,
which accounts for the incredible
size of the USC Marching Band.
FRATERNITIES also enjoy panty
raids, where all the underwear from a
SORORITY jumps out of its drawers,
rushes across campus, and leaps
onto the walls of a FRATERNITY, sur
rounding the boys inside and making
them very afraid indeed.
The next morning, the girls
run over to the FRATERNITY and beg
their underwear to leave the poor
boys alone. The panties, moved by
the pleas, give up the siege and are
taken home, where they are mildly
scolded and washed.
Thus, USC has many fine and up
standing qualities and activities
which Stanford should adopt for its
fine and upstanding boys and girls.
The time to start is now.

Once upon a time, Stanford lost to
USC, 49-0, and the fans who drove
700 times Darrin Nelson's season

you still have to go to school at USC."

Outdated
Stanford persons must attend
school amidst old, outdated Spanish
architecture. USC persons get to go
to class in sparkling, new buildings
that look good from the blimp. They
also get to inhabit dorms which are
tall and shiny and have drinking
fountains with foot pedals.
Additionally, USC's admissions
policy is much superior. Instead of
being selective and worrying about

the Bakke decision, USC follows a
system of majority admissions. Last
year, USC accepted almost all ot the
young movers who wanted to go
there. The only applicants not ac
cepted were dead, had admitted
smoking in high school bathrooms,
or were reptiles.
USC students enjoy the benefits of
a marvelous process known as clon
ing, as yet undeveloped here at Stan
ford. While Stanford fans are messy
and disorganized at football games
and stand up at all the wrong times,
the USC students, profiting from
being clones, raise their arms and
cheer simultaneously when the run
ning back runs by for a touchdown
and also when the white Trojan
horse runs by to tell them that the
running back just ran by for a
touchdown. Sometimes the horse
gets fatigued from so much scoring
and walks.
Right letters
Cloned USC students can also say
"way to go band" simultaneously
and spell out "Southern California"
simultaneously, with all the right let
ters.
USC girls can live in SORORITIES,
but Stanford girls, who may soon see
sororities, will never see
SORORITIES. A SORORITY is a place
where girls experience fun together
and are happy because they are in
"college" ana these are their finest
years.
The girls wear fluffy maroon and
gold dresses, which correspond to

the band uniforms. Whether these
girls ever take off their dresses and
wrap themselves more comfortably
is unknown to boys, since boys are
not allowed past the first floor of the
house.
This is because the girls do not
carry their manners with them on the
second floor and up. Their manners
are supposedly kept in a big closet
near the stairs. On the way down to
dinner or a date, each girl reaches in
the closet, gropes around, linds
hers, and puts them on like a too-big
coat, although which manners are
hers doesn't really matter, because
all the manners look ab6ut the same.
No broccoli
If a girl forgets to put on her man
ners for dinner, theothergirlsdo not
throw broccoli at her, since they are
still wearing their manners. Instead,
the house mother, who is the man
ners handler, tells the delinquent girl
that she must wear jeans to school
the next day and be laughed at a lot.
Just as great as the SORO p ITIFS are
the FRATERNITIES. Stanford only has
fraternities. FRATERNITIES have
pledges, who are not real people and
get to wear ties to school on Mon
days, to signify that they are not rea!
people. Pledges also get to live in tin
house for a half year before becom
ing actives, who are like real people,
only better. If the actives decide dur
ing the half year that they don't like a
certain pledge and that he should
never become real, they boot him
out into the gutter.
He is then a subpledge and ranks
on the ladder of life only above )ello.
The grieved boy must search for a
new peer group and new clothes,
which accounts for the incredible
size of the USC Marching Band.
FRATERNITIES also enjoy panty
raids, where all the underwear from a
SORORITY jumps out of its drawers,
rushes across campus, and leaps
onto the walls of a FRATERNITY, sur
rounding the boys inside and making
them very afraid indeed.
The next morning, the girls
run over to the FRATERNITY and beg
their underwear to leave the poor
boys alone. The panties, moved by
the pleas, give up the siege and are
taken home, where they are mildly
scolded and washed.
Thus, USC has many fine and up
standing qualities and activities
which Stanford should adopt for its
fine and upstanding boys and girls.
The time to start is now.

Once upon a time, Stanford lost to
USC, 49-0, and the fans who drove
700 times Darrin Nelson's season
yardage didn't even cry? How come?
"Because," some Stanford stu
dents yelled, "we may have lost, but
you still have to go to school at USC."
Really, though, USC students can
take pride in many things which Stan
ford students do not possess.
To begin with, some USC stu
dents, unlike some Stanford stu
dents, have some intelligence. Some
of them read a book once. Some of
them understand long sentences
which include words like "include."
Sinn of them do not salivate at the
soun-l of the end class bell.
USC students have contact with
the real world, unlike isolated, pas
toral Stanford kids. There are work
study opportunities where students
vend programs and popcorn at the
football games and study, too.
What's more, USC students read
many newspapers and are active in
politics, usually during odd
numbered leap years.
