# Campus feminist group
## Taking a closer look at Half the Sky 
### 
Kim Bancroft

Half the Sky is still a new organiza
tion on campus, and the fact that it is
a feminist group implies difficulties
that other organizations don't have.
There is no fixed hierarchy nor offi
cial membership. We rotate
facilitators and note-takers..
We operate by consensus when it
comes to decisions, so that every
woman's teelings about a particular
issue are accounted for. The way that
this interaction of opinions and feel
ings takes place is in small group dis
cussions.
At the meeting two weeks ago, we
broke into four groups of six or eight
to talk more intimately, more per
sonally about who we are, what we
see in feminism and what we see Half
the Sky's role to be. There, less vocal
women had a chance to speak, and

discussion developed better with
fewer participants. Women emerged
teeling more in touch with one
another than with just a nebulous
movement.
The outcome of this session was a
consensus on a format ror future
meetings: lirst, to spend some time
relaying messages and notices about
women's events and calls for help on
task forces in the community; sec
ond, to have a short presentation on
an issue or activity (last week it was
on the abortion issue; this week it
will be a report by women who at
tended the Houston National Wo
men's Conference, and by Bernice
Sandler, acclaimed affirmative action
advocate): third, small group in
teraction; and finally, a regrouping
of all members for a recap of general
consensus
We came from the meeting re
lieved and enthusiastic, with the idea
that Half the Sky is an important re
source tor women's activities and
education. There is so much to be
done-, all women reaching out to
dormitories, collectives, faculty,
graduates, staff and more.
Chairperson Mao recognized the
strength ot women's support
through out civilization when he said
that, "Women hold up halt the sky."
The group began as a coalition of
women's groups in the Stanford
community in spring ot 1977. It was
to serve as a communications net
work and a center for feminist ac
tivities.
With the turn of a new academic
year, much has changed for Half the
Sky. The energy that initiated the first
meetings last spring was displaced
this fall. Also, the more universal

membership that the group origi
nally aimed for (since all women hold
up Half the Sky) has dwindled to a
predominantly white women consti
tuency.
One black women said at a meet
ing two weeks ago that after the
Women's Week workshop on
Feminism in Color, Third World
women are seeking support and sta
bility among themselves before they
can successfully join hands with
white sisters.
One last disappointing factor pre
viously was the lack of direction tor
the group, often leaving negative
feelings among the women, dis
couraging some to return another

time, understandably. Specifically,
one night we tried to tackle both an
analysis of Women's Week and the
philosophy of Half the Sky.
It's a shame to see so much poten
tially positive, constructive energy
be dissipated. Now we have a format
for meetings to work by. We are pre
pared to put our support into issues
that concern the welfare of women,
or any people suffering oppression.
And we have the interaction that
generates mutual support and en
thusiasm. Our energy can work if we
put action into our ideals and share
our work with our sisters.

or any people suffering oppression.
And we have the interaction that
generates mutual support and en
thusiasm. Our energy can work if we
put action into our ideals and share
our work with our sisters.

Half the Sky is still a new organiza
tion on campus, and the fact that it is
a feminist group implies difficulties
that other organizations don't have.
There is no fixed hierarchy nor offi
cial membership. We rotate
facilitators and note-takers..
We operate by consensus when it
comes to decisions, so that every
woman's teelings about a particular
issue are accounted for. The way that
this interaction of opinions and feel
ings takes place is in small group dis
cussions.
At the meeting two weeks ago, we
broke into four groups of six or eight
to talk more intimately, more per
sonally about who we are, what we
see in feminism and what we see Half
the Sky's role to be. There, less vocal
women had a chance to speak, and

discussion developed better with
fewer participants. Women emerged
teeling more in touch with one
another than with just a nebulous
movement.
The outcome of this session was a
consensus on a format ror future
meetings: lirst, to spend some time
relaying messages and notices about
women's events and calls for help on
task forces in the community; sec
ond, to have a short presentation on
an issue or activity (last week it was
on the abortion issue; this week it
will be a report by women who at
tended the Houston National Wo
men's Conference, and by Bernice
Sandler, acclaimed affirmative action
advocate): third, small group in
teraction; and finally, a regrouping
of all members for a recap of general
consensus
We came from the meeting re
lieved and enthusiastic, with the idea
that Half the Sky is an important re
source tor women's activities and
education. There is so much to be
done-, all women reaching out to
dormitories, collectives, faculty,
graduates, staff and more.
Chairperson Mao recognized the
strength ot women's support
through out civilization when he said
that, "Women hold up halt the sky."
The group began as a coalition of
women's groups in the Stanford
community in spring ot 1977. It was
to serve as a communications net
work and a center for feminist ac
tivities.
With the turn of a new academic
year, much has changed for Half the
Sky. The energy that initiated the first
meetings last spring was displaced
this fall. Also, the more universal

membership that the group origi
nally aimed for (since all women hold
up Half the Sky) has dwindled to a
predominantly white women consti
tuency.
One black women said at a meet
ing two weeks ago that after the
Women's Week workshop on
Feminism in Color, Third World
women are seeking support and sta
bility among themselves before they
can successfully join hands with
white sisters.
One last disappointing factor pre
viously was the lack of direction tor
the group, often leaving negative
feelings among the women, dis
couraging some to return another

time, understandably. Specifically,
one night we tried to tackle both an
analysis of Women's Week and the
philosophy of Half the Sky.
It's a shame to see so much poten
tially positive, constructive energy
be dissipated. Now we have a format
for meetings to work by. We are pre
pared to put our support into issues
that concern the welfare of women,
or any people suffering oppression.
And we have the interaction that
generates mutual support and en
thusiasm. Our energy can work if we
put action into our ideals and share
our work with our sisters.
