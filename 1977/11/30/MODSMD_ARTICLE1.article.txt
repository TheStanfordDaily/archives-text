# ASSU Senate supports divestiture in South Africa
## 
### Sara Lessley 
After heated debate, the ASSU Se
nate last night passed a resolution
supporting University divestiture in
South Africa and endorsed today's
SCRIP rally, with 15 yes votes and two
abstentions recorded.
The proposal was a compromise
measure, a "friendly amendment"
submitted by Sen. Peter )oost to the
proposal submitted by five members
of the Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC).
The senate also approved the
ASSU budget, following last year's
senate failure to do so.
Sen. Rick Levy, who originally pre
sented the divestiture proposal,
stressed the importance of passing
some sort of resolution supporting
the SCRIP rally for divestiture today.
However, Joost said that there
wasn't enough time to review the
proposal and make amendments, yet
"it was important to have the whole
senate behind a resolution sup
ported and formed by all."
Joost added that the revised prop
osal sets no time limit for University
divestiture and does not name
specific companies.
Dissenting opinions
Several dissenting opinions
helped form the compromise. Sen.
Doug Bandow submitted a friendly
amendment calling for total divesti
ture in all "racist and oppressive"
countries, including the Soviet Un
ion, Uganda and South Africa. Ban
dow added that "it was no more
palatable that blacks murder
blacks in Uganda than that whites
murder blacks in South Africa." He
added that he thinks it hypocritical to
pull "money out of one regime and
invest it in one which is far worse."
Sen. Tom McCormack also said he
has "problems" with divestiture.
McCormack said he did not think
"divestiture was the best or only
means to effect change in South Af
rica."
McCormack added that he did not
think divestiture was the consensus

of opinion on campus and "couldn't
in good faith" support a statement
that says it is. He added that perhaps
a boycott of corporation products, if
it worked, would be much more suc
cessful.
In addition to endorsing the
SCRIP/BSUrally, the resolution calls
upon the University to totally divest
itself of all stock held in corporations
operating in apartheid South Africa,
calls for further examination of Stan
ford investments in corporations in
volved in other repressive regimes
and calls for the development of a
comprehensive and consistent moral
investment policy.
Other business
Other business conducted in last
night's 4'/j hour meeting included
passage of the ASSU budget, by a
vote of 13 to five.
Lengthy debate followed the
changes proposed by the senate fi
nance committee. The finance com
mittee recommended an increase of
the senate discretionary fund be in
creased $1000 to $2500.
The discretionary fund is used to
give monetary aid to Stanford or
ganizations, according to Sen. Car
lyle Kinnison.
Sen. Rick Levy then proposed that
the discretionary fund allocation be
increased to $4000. He said that it is a
"good precedent for the senate to
supply itself with enough money to
be effective."
Financial Manager Miles White ini
tially spoke against Levy's proposal,
but later changed his mind and sup
ported the $4000 sum.
White said that his concern was
not with the $4000 figure, but that the
senate does not have a "policy on
growth in general funds."
He said he doesn't see a problem
with the extra funds this year, al
though they will have to come out of
the principal of the general fund.
The principal is devised from di
vidend returns of up to $17,000 a year
on the $350,000 investment, and
from all non-fee assessment sup

ported projects which are charged
one per cent of their gross receipts.
Estimates
White added that he and the fi
nance committee will work out esti
mates of growth to determine
whether the budget can sustain in
creases such as this one.
White added there will be a ques
tion of where the senate will obtain
money for its budget if the principal
(dividend income) does disappear'
through divestiture.
Co-president Greg Larson advised
"extreme caution" in approving the
budget. He said that it was a "ques
tionable circumstance," having this
senate approve Its own budget since
last year's failed to do so.

tee (SOC).
The senate also approved the
ASSU budget, following last year's
senate failure to do so.
Sen. Rick Levy, who originally pre
sented the divestiture proposal,
stressed the importance of passing
some sort of resolution supporting
the SCRIP rally for divestiture today.
However, Joost said that there
wasn't enough time to review the
proposal and make amendments, yet
"it was important to have the whole
senate behind a resolution sup
ported and formed by all."
Joost added that the revised prop
osal sets no time limit for University
divestiture and does not name
specific companies.
Dissenting opinions
Several dissenting opinions
helped form the compromise. Sen.
Doug Bandow submitted a friendly
amendment calling for total divesti
ture in all "racist and oppressive"
countries, including the Soviet Un
ion, Uganda and South Africa. Ban
dow added that "it was no more
palatable that blacks murder
blacks in Uganda than that whites
murder blacks in South Africa." He
added that he thinks it hypocritical to
pull "money out of one regime and
invest it in one which is far worse."
Sen. Tom McCormack also said he
has "problems" with divestiture.
McCormack said he did not think
"divestiture was the best or only
means to effect change in South Af
rica."
McCormack added that he did not
think divestiture was the consensus

of opinion on campus and "couldn't
in good faith" support a statement
that says it is. He added that perhaps
a boycott of corporation products, if
it worked, would be much more suc
cessful.
In addition to endorsing the
SCRIP/BSUrally, the resolution calls
upon the University to totally divest
itself of all stock held in corporations
operating in apartheid South Africa,
calls for further examination of Stan
ford investments in corporations in
volved in other repressive regimes
and calls for the development of a
comprehensive and consistent moral
investment policy.
Other business
Other business conducted in last
night's 4'/j hour meeting included
passage of the ASSU budget, by a
vote of 13 to five.
Lengthy debate followed the
changes proposed by the senate fi
nance committee. The finance com
mittee recommended an increase of
the senate discretionary fund be in
creased $1000 to $2500.
The discretionary fund is used to
give monetary aid to Stanford or
ganizations, according to Sen. Car
lyle Kinnison.
Sen. Rick Levy then proposed that
the discretionary fund allocation be
increased to $4000. He said that it is a
"good precedent for the senate to
supply itself with enough money to
be effective."
Financial Manager Miles White ini
tially spoke against Levy's proposal,
but later changed his mind and sup
ported the $4000 sum.
White said that his concern was
not with the $4000 figure, but that the
senate does not have a "policy on
growth in general funds."
He said he doesn't see a problem
with the extra funds this year, al
though they will have to come out of
the principal of the general fund.
The principal is devised from di
vidend returns of up to $17,000 a year
on the $350,000 investment, and
from all non-fee assessment sup

ported projects which are charged
one per cent of their gross receipts.
Estimates
White added that he and the fi
nance committee will work out esti
mates of growth to determine
whether the budget can sustain in
creases such as this one.
White added there will be a ques
tion of where the senate will obtain
money for its budget if the principal
(dividend income) does disappear'
through divestiture.
Co-president Greg Larson advised
"extreme caution" in approving the
budget. He said that it was a "ques
tionable circumstance," having this
senate approve Its own budget since
last year's failed to do so.
