Investment controversy
The investment responsibility con
troversy of last academic year proved
once again that student interest, ef
fectively organized, can place an
issue on the agenda of the University
and require that it be dealt with. The
column by Anne Henkels, et al.
(Daily, Nov. 21) proved once again
that the temptation to make small
changes in the historical record for
partisan advantage is one of the har
dest of all temptations to resist.
just for the record, then, let it be
said that, while the Stanford Com
mittee for Responsible Investment
Policy and its allies were indeed re
sponsible for bringing the matter of
investment responsibility to the
point of action, the ill-advised and
unnecessary sit-in of May 10 did not
advance that action a single step. In
fact, the key decision — the one
which produced the Bracewell
Committee — was made before the
Old Union group decided to await
arrest. That decision, it will be recal
led, was an agreement between the
investments committee of the Board
of Trustees and some SCRIP
negotiators that three trustees and a
like number of SCRIP representa
tives would meet to discuss, among
other things, "the structure and role
of the Commission on Investment
Responsibility."
In spite of that agreement, the
sit-in continued; in spite of the sit-in,
the meeting took place; as a result of
the meeting, the trustees agreed to

review the policies and procedures
in dispute.
The results of that review are now
public. Henkels, et al. are dissatis
fied. They are entitled to be so. How
ever, before others conclude with
them that the events which pro
duced the Bracewell Report justify
action "outside the system," it would
be well to have in mind an accurate
picture of those events.
