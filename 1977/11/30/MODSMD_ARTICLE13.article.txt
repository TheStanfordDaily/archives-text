# Police protect former Nazi
## 
### 
Soltdu, West Germany (AP) â€” Nearly four
months after his escape from a Rome
prison hospital, convicted Nazi war crimi
nal Herbert Kappler lives quietly and mys
teriously in this north German town be
hind a wall of police protection.
The 70-year-old Kappler, a former col
onel in the Nazi SS elite guard, was suffer
ing from intestinal cancer and said to be on
the verge of death when his wife, An
neliese, helped him escape Aug. 15.
A family sou'ce said Kappler has re
gained enough strength to take walks with
a cane accompanied by his wife and police
guards.
The strict security around the Kappler
apartment above a drugstore has angered
some of the townspeople who seldom
catch a glimpse of the man convicted of
killing 335 Italian civilians. He was serving
a life sentence for the deaths, ordered in
reprisal for an attack by Italian partisans in
which 32 German soldiers were killed.
"Kappler enjoys almost as much protec
tion as a cabinet minister," complained a
local bank manager.
The West German government
petitioned Italy several times for Kappler's
release on humanitarian grounds. But Ita
lian authorities, under pressure from
former resistance fighters and Jewish
groups, blocked it.
An Italian military tribunal decided in
November 1976 to release him, but that
decision was overruled a month later by
Italy's supreme court.
Kappler's wife had been lobbying for his

release. When those efforts failed, she
took the matter into her own hands, low
ered him with a rope from a prison hospi
tal window under cover of darkness and
fled back to Germany.
The German government refused to
send Kappler back to Italy because of a
constitutional restriction against extradit
ing German nationals.
That refusal, coupled with Bonn's
hardline response to urban terrorism,
sparked a wave of criticism in several
European countries which implied that the
German democracy was a facade and that
the seeds of Nazism remain in the Ger
mans spirit.
However, the matter was brought up
again Monday at an official dinner in Bonn
given for Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan. During a speech at the dinner,
Dayan said Israelis were saddened by "the
latest anti-Semitic incidents among youth,
the attempts to rewrite history and the
nostalgia for the Hitler era, in which can be
detected an indulgence toward Nazi war
criminals and their deeds."
The parking lot near the Kappler apart
ment has been taken over by police who
station a van there at all times. A coil of
barbed wire runs along the creek behind
the building.
Police refuse to say why they are guard
ing Kappler. But authorities said in August
they were stationing guards to prevent un
identified groupsfrom killing him orspirit
ing him back to Italy.
