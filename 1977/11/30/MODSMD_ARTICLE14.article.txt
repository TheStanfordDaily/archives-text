# Hughes will debate continues
## 
### 
Las Vegas (AP) — The jury which will decide
whether Howard Hughes wrote the Mormon
Will listened yesterday to one side of the lengthy
saga surrounding the three-page document.
The story was told as part of a two-day open
ing statement by Los Angeles attorney Harold
Rhoden, who is trying to have the document
declared genuine.
Rhoden represents former Hughes aide Noah
Dietrich, who is named by the purported will as
the executor of the vast Hughes estate.
Hughes' relatives claim the will is forged and
that the entire story of the document is an elabo
rate fabrication.
Summarizing his beliefs and how he will try to
prove them, Rhoden took the jurors back to the
1960s when Hughes lived in seclusion at the
Desert Inn Hotel.
Rhoden said Hughes' personal aides will tell
conflicting stories about their employer, stories
about his physical appearance, his mannerisms
and his ability to leave the hotel.
Rhoden contends that Hughes was physically
able to, and did leave, the hotel on a number of
occasions, but there are aides who claim that the
recluse industrialist never left his penthouse
suite.
Hughes' activities then, especially during late
December of 1967, are important to Rhoden's
case because of the story by his key witness —
Melvin Dummar.
Dummar, named as a beneficiary in the Mor

mon Will, claims to have picked up an old man
in the desert north of here near the Cottontail
Ranch, a brothel. Dummar said he found the
man face down on the ground near the roadside
and offered assistance.
Dummar said the man identified himself as
Hughes and Dummar claims he took the man to
a Las Vegas hotel and was given some change
from his pocket.
Rhoden characterized Dummar as a "naive,
simple, sometimes silly individual" who is not
very educated.
Dummar said a mysterious courier delivered
the purported will to a service station he oper
ated in Willard, Utah, and that he in turn deli
vered it to Mormon Church headquarters in Salt
Lake City.
Rhoden also claims news coverage of Dum
mar immediately following Hughes' death on
April 5, 1976, will play a big part in the trial.
Rhoden said Dummar told newsmen things
about Hughes which were later brought out
after the autopsy on Hughes' body was per
formed.
Additionally, Rhoden said Dummar told the
story about the old man in the desert to several
friends shortly after the incident occurred, but
Dummar has said he does not remember relat
ing the story.
Rhoden said he will call witnesses who will
testify that Dummar told them about the inci
dent.

Rhoden contends that Hughes was physically
able to, and did leave, the hotel on a number of
occasions, but there are aides who claim that the
recluse industrialist never left his penthouse
suite.
Hughes' activities then, especially during late
December of 1967, are important to Rhoden's
case because of the story by his key witness —
Melvin Dummar.
Dummar, named as a beneficiary in the Mor

mon Will, claims to have picked up an old man
in the desert north of here near the Cottontail
Ranch, a brothel. Dummar said he found the
man face down on the ground near the roadside
and offered assistance.
Dummar said the man identified himself as
Hughes and Dummar claims he took the man to
a Las Vegas hotel and was given some change
from his pocket.
Rhoden characterized Dummar as a "naive,
simple, sometimes silly individual" who is not
very educated.
Dummar said a mysterious courier delivered
the purported will to a service station he oper
ated in Willard, Utah, and that he in turn deli
vered it to Mormon Church headquarters in Salt
Lake City.
Rhoden also claims news coverage of Dum
mar immediately following Hughes' death on
April 5, 1976, will play a big part in the trial.
Rhoden said Dummar told newsmen things
about Hughes which were later brought out
after the autopsy on Hughes' body was per
formed.
Additionally, Rhoden said Dummar told the
story about the old man in the desert to several
friends shortly after the incident occurred, but
Dummar has said he does not remember relat
ing the story.
Rhoden said he will call witnesses who will
testify that Dummar told them about the inci
dent.
Las Vegas (AP) — The jury which will decide
whether Howard Hughes wrote the Mormon
Will listened yesterday to one side of the lengthy
saga surrounding the three-page document.
The story was told as part of a two-day open
ing statement by Los Angeles attorney Harold
Rhoden, who is trying to have the document
declared genuine.
Rhoden represents former Hughes aide Noah
Dietrich, who is named by the purported will as
the executor of the vast Hughes estate.
Hughes' relatives claim the will is forged and
that the entire story of the document is an elabo
rate fabrication.
Summarizing his beliefs and how he will try to
prove them, Rhoden took the jurors back to the
1960s when Hughes lived in seclusion at the
Desert Inn Hotel.
Rhoden said Hughes' personal aides will tell
conflicting stories about their employer, stories
about his physical appearance, his mannerisms
and his ability to leave the hotel.
Rhoden contends that Hughes was physically
able to, and did leave, the hotel on a number of
occasions, but there are aides who claim that the
recluse industrialist never left his penthouse
