# Merely 'liberating close friends' says man charged with dolphin theft
## 
### 
Honolulu (AP) i— Jury selec
tion began yesterday in the trial
of a man charged with stealing
two dolphins from a laboratory
and returning them to the sea.
He and another defendant
claim they were liberating
close friends.
But the state of Hawaii says
the two men committed first
degree theft by taking the
highly intelligent mammals,
named Kea and Puka, which
were being used in research
programs.
The state also says they in ef
fect signed the dolphins' death
warrants by returning them to
an environment in which they
no longer could live.
The way was cleared for the
trial of Kenneth Le Vasseur, 26,
to begin when Circuit Court
Judge Masato Doi on Monday
ordered his case separated
from that of the other defen
dant, Steve Sipman, also 26.
Both men had been rep
resented by John Schweigert, a
lawyer who specializes in en
vironmental causes, but Sip
man got a new lawyer Monday
and was given until February to
prepare his defense.
The defendants, who face a
maximum penalty of five years

in prison and a $5000 fine, have
been free on their own recog
nizance awaiting trial.
Le Vasseur's trial got under
way with prosecutors putting
two questions to a pool of
prospective jurors: "How
many of you watched 'Flip
per'?" a television series about
a porpoise that was popular
several years ago, and "How
many of you have heard the
phrase 'This country is a gov
ernment of laws and not
men'?"
Sipman and Le Vasseur,
former students at the Univer
sity of Hawaii, lived at the dol
phin labs at the university's In
stitute of Marine Biology
where they worked as custo
dians.
Sipman, who had been
studying the psychology of
whales and dolphins, got a
bachelor's degree in psychol
ogy in 1976. Le Vasseur got a
bachelor's degree in liberal
arts in 1976.
On May 29, they carried Kea
and Puka, female Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins, from
their pens, drove them 40 miles
to a remote beach and placed
them in the sea.
"We have no moral orethical

right to maintajn or enslave in
telligent, emotional beings
who very well may be our
equals," Sipman said in exp
laining the act the next day.
But placing Kea, 12, and
Puka, 16, in the hostile ocean
environment after their years
of being hand-fed and cared
for in captivity meant certain
death for both animals, said
Louis Herman, chief scientist
in the dolphin research prog
ram.
They wouldn't know how to
get food, would weaken and
become easy prey for sharks,
Herman said.
"For both of you, I regret
that your trust in humans will

likely soon lead to your deaths,
for that is what my heart and
my long experience with dol
phins tells me," Herman said in
a newspaper tribute to the
animals soon after they were
released.
"We have very strong feel
ings about the dolphins," Sip
man said. He and Le Vasseur
had worked and played daily
with the two animals for sev
eral years, Sipmarj said, "and
we have a strong emotional at
tachment to them. They are
brave, strong and free and they
should remain free."
"We didn't steal them, we
gave them back," Le Vasseur
added.

animals soon after they were
released.
"We have very strong feel
ings about the dolphins," Sip
man said. He and Le Vasseur
had worked and played daily
with the two animals for sev
eral years, Sipmarj said, "and
we have a strong emotional at
tachment to them. They are
brave, strong and free and they
should remain free."
"We didn't steal them, we
gave them back," Le Vasseur
added.
Honolulu (AP) i— Jury selec
tion began yesterday in the trial
of a man charged with stealing
two dolphins from a laboratory
and returning them to the sea.
He and another defendant
claim they were liberating
close friends.
But the state of Hawaii says
the two men committed first
degree theft by taking the
highly intelligent mammals,
named Kea and Puka, which
were being used in research
programs.
The state also says they in ef
fect signed the dolphins' death
warrants by returning them to
an environment in which they
no longer could live.
The way was cleared for the
trial of Kenneth Le Vasseur, 26,
to begin when Circuit Court
Judge Masato Doi on Monday
ordered his case separated
from that of the other defen
dant, Steve Sipman, also 26.
Both men had been rep
resented by John Schweigert, a
lawyer who specializes in en
vironmental causes, but Sip
man got a new lawyer Monday
and was given until February to
prepare his defense.
The defendants, who face a
maximum penalty of five years

in prison and a $5000 fine, have
been free on their own recog
nizance awaiting trial.
Le Vasseur's trial got under
way with prosecutors putting
two questions to a pool of
prospective jurors: "How
many of you watched 'Flip
per'?" a television series about
a porpoise that was popular
several years ago, and "How
many of you have heard the
phrase 'This country is a gov
ernment of laws and not
men'?"
Sipman and Le Vasseur,
former students at the Univer
sity of Hawaii, lived at the dol
phin labs at the university's In
stitute of Marine Biology
where they worked as custo
dians.
Sipman, who had been
studying the psychology of
whales and dolphins, got a
bachelor's degree in psychol
ogy in 1976. Le Vasseur got a
bachelor's degree in liberal
arts in 1976.
On May 29, they carried Kea
and Puka, female Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins, from
their pens, drove them 40 miles
to a remote beach and placed
them in the sea.
"We have no moral orethical

right to maintajn or enslave in
telligent, emotional beings
who very well may be our
equals," Sipman said in exp
laining the act the next day.
But placing Kea, 12, and
Puka, 16, in the hostile ocean
environment after their years
of being hand-fed and cared
for in captivity meant certain
death for both animals, said
Louis Herman, chief scientist
in the dolphin research prog
ram.
They wouldn't know how to
get food, would weaken and
become easy prey for sharks,
Herman said.
"For both of you, I regret
that your trust in humans will

likely soon lead to your deaths,
for that is what my heart and
my long experience with dol
phins tells me," Herman said in
a newspaper tribute to the
animals soon after they were
released.
