# Trident over budget
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Navy
said yesterday its first giant
missile-firing Trident sub
marine is 50 per cent over its
original cost estimate and will
be delayed a year in deploy
ment.
The $400 million cost boost
will bring the 18,700-ton sub
marine's price to $1.2 billion,
plus the cost of its 24 missiles
and nuclear reactor. Its combat
readiness will be delayed until
about January, 1981.
Admirals responsible for the
Trident program, the Penta
gon's biggest, blame the cost
overrun and delay on prob
lems encountered by the con
tractor, Electric Boat Division
of General Dynamics Corp.
Rear Adm. Donald P. Hall,
Trident project officer, and
Rear Adm. Albert Kelln, the
project's coordinator, told
newsmen the problem stem
med from a new construction
method used by the firm and
from difficulties in getting all
the necessary workers and re
sources together to do the job
within the time period pro
jected when the tontract was
signed in 1974.
"This is a complex, very large
ship," said Hall. "We've never
put together a ship of this size
before."
He said he does not know if
worker layoffs had anything to
do with the delay. Reports have
linked layoffs by Electric Boat
to a separate Navy program,
also behind schedule, involv
ing construction of attack
submarines.
The company is asking the
Navy for more than $540 mill
ion over the contract price for
18 attack subs.
Although the first Trident
sub is facing a year's delay, Hall
and Kelln said development of

a new 4600-mile-range missile
to be mounted in Trident subs
is on schedule for deployment
in October, 1979.
The first of these long-range
missiles will be installed in pre
sent submarines now carrying
earlier Poseidon missiles.
The Pentagon now plans to
build at least 13 Trident sub
marines, which are expected to
be the premier U.S. nuclear re
taliatory weapons for 30 years.
According to Hall, the total
program cost now stands at
about $22 billion, with indica
tions it will go higher. This
compares to the $24 billion B1
bomber project which was
cancelled by President jimmy
Carter last summer.
