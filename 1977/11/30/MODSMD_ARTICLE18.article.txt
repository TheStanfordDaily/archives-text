# Water bill gets support
## 
### 
San Diego (AP) — More than
a dozen interest groups have
voiced support for a proposed
state law designed to meet
California's water needs — par
ticularly Southern California —
through the year 2000.
The proposal calls for a $3.5
billion package of northern
California reservoirs and
waterworks to finish the State
Water Project.
A primary feature is the
Peripheral Canal, a 43-mile,
$605 million aqueduct that
would route Sacramento River
water around the east edge of
the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta to pumping stations serv
ing users in the Central Valley
and Southern California.
Among the groups support
ing the proposal are the San
Diego County Water Author
ity, representatives of the San
Diego County Board of Super
visors and the Los Angeles Area
Chamber of Commerce.
Their comments came dur
ing a public hearing here Mon
day before members of the
Joint Senate-Assembly confer
ence committee.
Paul Engstrand, general
counsel to the water authority,
told the hearing that prompt
construction of the canal is

"urgent" to insure the region's
water supply beyond the mid
1980s.
The county could lose up to
85 per cent of its supply from
the Colorado River at that time,
he said when Arizona begins
tapping the River through the
Central Arizona Project. The
Southern California region re
ceives about 95 per cent of its
water needs from the Colorado
River.
While Southern California
representatives applauded the
bill, it has been sharply op
posed in the north and the
delta area.
Agricultural and environ
mental concerns have con
tended that diversion of the
Sacramento River to Southern
California would impair the
river's flushing effect in the De
lta. Opponents say that would
allow salty San Francisco Bay
waters to pollute farmland and
wildlife habitats.
Monday's hearings are part
of an effort to resolve differ
ences between the Assembly
and Senate on the bill, whose
$3.5 billion price tag, according
to estimates, would double
with inflation by the time the
project is completed.
