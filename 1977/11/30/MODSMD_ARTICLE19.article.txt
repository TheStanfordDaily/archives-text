# Instant X-ray developed

Washington (AP) â€”A handheld X-ray machine
which produces an instant image has been de
veloped by a scientist who got the idea while
studying energy sources in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, in announcing the new device
Monday, said it has high potential for
emergency and other field use in medicine, de
ntistry and industry.
Possible applications might include examina
tion of a football player's bone injury on the
field, detection of welding defects or gas leaks
in pipes or as a portable battlefield instrument in
wartime.
The device is called a Lixiscope, for low inten
sity X-ray imaging scope. It was developed by
Dr. Lo I Yin, an X-ray researcher at NASA's God
dard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
It is an outgrowth of Yin's research on a
concept for studying energy sources in space by
converting their X-rays to visible images.
"Any device developed for X-ray astronomy
studies, where there is a scarcity of X-rays,
should have technology of obvious value in
medical fluoroscopy where there are many
X-rays," Yin said.
He said the concept became feasible when

the Army released previously classified details
of an image intensifier which enables soldiers to
see objects in the dark.
In addition to the night vision unit, the porta
ble X-ray machine includes a small radioactive
source and an X-ray phosphor screen. It is pow
ered by a single pen-sized battery.
The squeeze of a trigger unshields the
radioactive source, sending a low dosage of
X-rays into the object being examined, Yin
explained. The X-rays passing through the ob
ject are absorbed by the phosphor screen,
which converts them to visible light.
The night vision unit, which employs fiber
optics, intensifies and channels the visible light
to its viewing screen for image display. Instant
pictures of X-rayed objects can be made quickly
with an attached camera, using a radioactive
exposure about 1000 times weaker than the con
ventional X-ray machine, Yin said.
Several research institutes in the dental and
medical fields have indicated an interest in par
ticipating in a cooperative program to evaluate
the Lixiscope.
NASA has built a prototype model ot the unit.
Officials estimated production units would cost
less than $5000.
