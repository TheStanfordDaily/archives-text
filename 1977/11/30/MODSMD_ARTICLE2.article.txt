Stanford Overseas Studies has
canceled the focus program, "Health
Care Delivery and Public Policy"
scheduled for the summer of 1978 at
the Cliveden campus in England.
"We have tried, unsuccessfully, to
raise the additional funds necessary
to support the Health Care Delivery
Program," said Director of Overseas
Studies Mark Mancall. "A variety of
considerations, none of them having
to do with the actual merits of the
program itself, have prevented our
getting the additional money."
"The outside sources we con
tacted couldn't support it due to pol
icy matters or because the program
didn't fall into an area that they sup
port. We're asking for money for a
very specific program," said Corb
Smith, associate director of Overseas
Studies.
Funds in the amount of $25,000-
$30,000 were needed for the prog
ram's implementation. The 1977-78
Overseas Studies budget of $1.4 mill
ion does not include allocation for
focus programs at the various over
seas campuses, according to Smith.
"If we put in money for this prog
ram, we would have had to cut in

other important areas," Smith said.
The Overseas office chose to wait
until the last minute to announce the
cancellation in hopes it would gain
the additional funding, according to
Smith. Applications were originally
to be due this Friday, Dec. 2.
The Health Care Delivery focus
program was first offered at the
Cliveden campus in the summer of
1975. The program provided an op
portunity for 80 undergraduates to
study a socialized medical care deliv
ery system first-hand, Smith said.
"We hope to be able to run the
program again, and we will look for
funds earlier. We didn't start for the
1978 program until this past summer.
We apparently need more time to lo
cate funds," he said.
Because other academic programs
are planned for the British campus,
the program can not feasibly be of
fered until the summer of 1980.
There will be a regular summer
quarter curriculum at Cliveden this
coming summer, including courses
in history, economics, sociology,
political science, literature and art.
Applications for the regular summer
program are due next March 3.
