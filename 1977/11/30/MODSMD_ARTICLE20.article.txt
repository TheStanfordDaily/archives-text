# Stanford invades Santa Clara
## Schader regains form for cagers 
### David Georgette 
The muscular forward got
the ball at the right corner of
the free throw line, authorita
tively drove across the lane for
a left-handed lay-in and softly
dropped the ball off the glass
for two points.
George Schader was back.
Last season knee injuries
sidelined Schader for the en
tire season. In his return
against Cal Poly-Pomona Friday
night, he played only 13 mi
nutes, collecting two points
and three rebounds. The ef
fects of the layoff were evi
dent.
"The first game he was like a
freshman," said Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso. "He was
still looking for his game
rhythm."
Saturday night against San
Jose State, Schader had his
game rhythm. He got 12 points
and six rebounds in 30 minutes
of play.
The Cards will need a good
performance from Schader to
night if they expect to be in the
game with the Santa Clara
Broncos. It's the home opener
for the Broncos in their
bubble-domed Toso Pavilion.

560 AM.)

The Broncos are 3-0 follow
ing a junket to Hawaii and ac
cording to Dißiaso are of
national-ranking caliber.
"Santa Clara will present us
with our most difficult test in
the early season," said Di-
Biaso. "They have the potential
to be ranked in the top 20."
Last year the Cards defeated
the Broncos in Maples Pavil
ion, 87-84. "They're much im
proved over last year," said Di-

Biaso, "simply because they
have everyone back."
The Broncos' best player is
probably forward Kurt Rambis.
The 6-foot-7, bespectacled
sophomore is averaging 16.3
points and 9.6 rebounds per
game. Santa Clara's backcourt
of senior Eddie joe Chavez
(17.6) and sophomore Londale
Theus (17.3) pace the Broncos'
scoring.
The play of Stanford's guards
has presented a series of con
trasts. Wolfe Perry, in his third
year as a starter, has had his
troubles. He had 11 turnovers

and five points over the
weekend, and made only 16
per cent of his field goal at
tempts.
"It's obvious to Wolfe that
he had subpar performances,"
said Dißiaso. "He just got off to
a bad s»-irt, and he pressed.
The haruei he tried, the worse
it got."
Meanwhile, the other start
ing guard, Paul Giovacchini,
had nine assists Friday and 19
points Saturday. And freshman
Mark Pitchford poured in 28
points Friday and came up with
the game-winner Saturday.

Stanford's two starting for
wards — Jay Carter and Kim
berly Belton — have done the
brunt of the rebounding. Bel
ton, the team's second-leading
scorer, has 19 rebounds.
Saturday Carter and Belton
received rebounding help
from Schader (six) and center
Jeff McHugh (five). "Those
four got the job done," s» id
Dißiaso. "Saturday we had bet
ter balanced rebounding."
Balance — both in scoring
and rebounding — will be
needed if the Cards are to keep
their record untainted.

Cards' 81-80 victory over the Spartans. Schader, who redshirted last season after being sidelined with a
knee injury, scored 12 points and hauled down six rebounds against the Spartans Saturday.
