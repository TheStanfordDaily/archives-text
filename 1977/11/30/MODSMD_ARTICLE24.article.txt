# Women cagers fall to UCSB, 62-67
## Gauchos edge Cards in final seconds 
### Paul Spaeth 
Tricia Green sank a free
throw with 17 seconds remain
ing in the game to break a tie
and give the UC-Santa Barbara
women's basketball team a
62-61 win over inexperienced
Stanford in the season's open
ing game Monday night in
Maples Pavilion.
Green's shot came im
mediately after Bonnie ! ind of
Santa Barbara had tied the
score at 61 and Stanford had

inbounded the ball. The ball
got away from one of the Stan
ford players, and in the ensu
ing scramble for it, Green was
fouled. She hit one of two
shots to put Santa Barbara
ahead, 62-61.
Stanford, however, still had
a chance to come back and at
least tie the game when Re
becca Garcia was fouled bring
ing the ball downcourt. But she
missed the first shot of a bonus
situation and a Gaucho grab

bed the rebound with 10 sec
onds left and ranouttheclock.
"We gave them the game,"
said Stanford coach Dotty
McCrea. "We really won it, but
we gave it to them on turnov
ers. We are inexperienced and
therefore we were rattled."
Inexperience was a critical
factor in Stanford's loss, as the
Cards turned the ball over 34
times and took far too many
forced shots.
From the start it looked as if
Santa Barbara was going to run
away with the game, leading by
as much as 12 throughout most
of the first half.
But Maggie Nelson, one of
Stanford's leading scorer with
20 points, made three consecu
tive field goals in the closing
minutes of the first half to cut
the lead to 31-25 at halftime.
The second half found Stan

ford more confident and pa
tient on offense, aj the Cards
moved the ball around the
Santa Barbara zone defense
and found open shots. Gradu
ally, they narrowed the Santa
Barbara lead and finally tied the
score at 48 on a basket by Kathy
Murphy with nine minutes re
maining. From there it was a
seesaw battle to the end with
each team exchanging turnov
ers and baskets. Stanford's in
experience revealed itself
again, however, late in the
game. After Murphy made two
free throws with one minute
left to put Stanford ahead,
61-59, the Cards were unable to
control the ball and Santa Bar
bara came back and won.
"I think we were the better
team," said Murphy after the
game. "We just weren't men
tally prepared enough. Nerv

ousness was the big thing. We
have six freshmen on the team,
and our inexperience
showed."
The leading scorer for the
game was Santa Barbara's
Marina Schiff who scored 21
points before fouling out late
in the game.
Also in double figures were
Sue McGilpin of Santa Barbara
with 12 and Stanford's Murphy
with 20 and Barbara Boylan
with 11. Murphy was also the
leading rebounder with 19.
