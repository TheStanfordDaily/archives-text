Peace talks envoys picked
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt, Israel, the United
States and the United Nations began select
ing their delegates yesterday for President
Anwar Sadat's preparatory Middle East
peace conference in Cairo.
Syria and the Paiestine Liberation Organi
zation denounced the Cairo meeting and
said they would not attend.
Arab nations opposed to Sadat's concilia
tion with Israel appeared to be splitting over
two proposed anti-Sadat meetings.
The Soviet Union, co-chairman with
America of the Geneva conference for which
the Cairo meeting is to prepare, joined the
hard-line Arabs and refused to go to the
Egyptian capital. Officials in Washington
said Moscow informed the United States it
would not attend.
Israel accepted Sadat's invitation Monday
and named two ranking diplomats to head
its mission. Egypt remains the only Arab
country to be represented, although Jordan
has said it will attend if all other countries
invited are there. Libya and Iraq called for
Arab conferences in their countries to form a
front against Sadat and Israel.
Washington formally accepted Egypt's in
vitation yesterday and officials said a delega
tion led by a still-unnamed diplomatic expert
would be in Cairo when the talks open, pos
sibly this weekend.
judge refuses top FBI post
Washington — U.S. District Judge Frank
Johnson bowed out as the president's
nominee for FBI director yesterday, and At
torney Gen. Griffin Bell said the search for a
replacement will last into the new year.
Still in poor health after surgery last Au

gust, Johnson said, "it will be several more
months before I will regain my strength and
stamina. It will not be fair to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation or to me to keep this
matter pending any longer."
In a statement issued at his office in
Montgomery, Ala., Johnson said he regrets
that "conditions over which I have no con
trol" have forced him to step aside.
At the White House, Press Secretary Jody
Powell called the withdrawal "a loss to the
administration, to the FBI and to the country
— and we regret it very much."
The attorney general said he and President
Jimmy Carter won't rush into a decision
about a new nominee to succeed Clarence
Kelley and become the third director in the
FBl's 53-year history.
Vote ends dockworkers strike
New York — Dockworkers in most ports
along the East and Gulf Coasts went back to
work yesterday night, signaling an end to
their 59-day strike against container ship
ping.
The first men back on the docks included
910 men who were called back at 7 p.m. to
work in the Port of New York.
A total of 50,000 men had refused to un
load containerized ships for the past two
months, stranding ships in port, causing de
lays for all shipping and costing the U.S.
economy untold millions.
Longshoremen from Maine to Texas voted
on the agreement yesterday, leaving work
ers in New Orleans and Philadelphia to ratify
the pact. But on the strength of early returns
— International Longshoremen's Associa
tion President Thomas "Teddy" Gleason
said the voting was two to one for the con

tract — the men began their return to work
yesterday night.
Container shipping, developed over the
past decade, uses preloaded, semitrailer
size containers. The containers are transfer
red by crane between ship, railway car and
truck.
The automation reduced the need for
longshoremen by more than a third in ports
such as New York and became the principal
target of the strike for greater job and in
come protection.
The union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, de
cided to go ahead with the voting yesterday.
The contract balloting will continue today
after completion of contract supplements in
New Orleans and Philadelphia.
Coal workers to negotiate
Washington — Federal mediators took
charge of the coal industry's stalemated con
tract talks yesterday and won swift agree
ment for "concentrated and continuous
negotiations" to try to avert a nationwide
strike threatened for next week.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz
said he received assurances from both sides
in the dispute to resume negotiations "with
the aim of reaching an agreement."
The union's contract with the BCOA,
which represents 130 companies that pro
duce 50 per cent of the nation's coal, expires
at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 6.
Under union procedures, ratification ot a
new contract by the 130,000 active members
would take at least 10 days. Thus a strike is a
virtual certainty unless there is a last-minute
agreement to extend the current pact.

House rejects abortion bill
Washington — The House rejected a com
promise yesterday on government abortion
payments despite warnings from bitter
senators who said they had yielded all they
could in pursuit of an agreement.
Continuing the four-month-old dispute
could affect about 240,000 government
employes whose paychecks are tied to the
abortion question.
An interim funding measure, which was
approved to forestall any payless pay days,
expires at midnight today. But another
House vote is expected today on approval of
a third temporary funding resolution so that
the employes could continue to get paid.
The compromise language would have
permitted abortion payments when a wo
man's life would be endangered by a full
term pregnancy, for treatment of rape and
incest victims and where a woman would
suffer severe and long-lasting physical
health damage if the pregnancy was carried
to term.
Pro-abortion groups quickly criticized the
House action.
Karen Mulhauser, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said the House describing the Senate com
promise as "too liberal" was "an utter dis
grace."
Rabbi Richard Sternberger, chairman of
the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights,
denounced the House action as "uncons
cionable and tragic." The coalition is com
prised ot 25 national religious organizations
that support the option of legal abortion.
Carter plans visit to Warsaw
Washington — President Jimmy Carter will

become the first U.S. president to hold a
wide-open news conference in a Com
munist country when he visits Warsaw late
next month, it was learned yesterday.
Poland will be the first stop on a curtailed
version of Carter's once-postponed world
trip, now set to begin Dec. 29. A formal an
nouncement of the journey is expected later
this week.
When Carter meets the press in Warsaw,
Polish journalists will be invited to join their
western colleagues in questioning the pres
ident. It was not known whether Poland's
state-owned networks will broadcast the
session live. However, the Voice of America
is expected to beam the conference to
Communist countries, including the Soviet
Union.
White House officials declined to confirm
plans for the news conference. However,
they acknowledged that another highlight of
Carter's six-nation trip will be the first visit by
an incumbent president to France's Nor
mandy beachheads where American and
other allied troops landed more than 32
years ago during World War 11. Carter also
will lay a wreath at a U.S. cemetery for
American war dead.
The trip will take Carter to Poland, Iran,
India, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. He
is expected to return to Washington on Jan.
6 or Jan. 7.

Vote ends dockworkers strike
New York — Dockworkers in most ports
along the East and Gulf Coasts went back to
work yesterday night, signaling an end to
their 59-day strike against container ship
ping.
The first men back on the docks included
910 men who were called back at 7 p.m. to
work in the Port of New York.
A total of 50,000 men had refused to un
load containerized ships for the past two
months, stranding ships in port, causing de
lays for all shipping and costing the U.S.
economy untold millions.
Longshoremen from Maine to Texas voted
on the agreement yesterday, leaving work
ers in New Orleans and Philadelphia to ratify
the pact. But on the strength of early returns
— International Longshoremen's Associa
tion President Thomas "Teddy" Gleason
said the voting was two to one for the con

tract — the men began their return to work
yesterday night.
Container shipping, developed over the
past decade, uses preloaded, semitrailer
size containers. The containers are transfer
red by crane between ship, railway car and
truck.
The automation reduced the need for
longshoremen by more than a third in ports
such as New York and became the principal
target of the strike for greater job and in
come protection.
The union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, de
cided to go ahead with the voting yesterday.
The contract balloting will continue today
after completion of contract supplements in
New Orleans and Philadelphia.
Coal workers to negotiate
Washington — Federal mediators took
charge of the coal industry's stalemated con
tract talks yesterday and won swift agree
ment for "concentrated and continuous
negotiations" to try to avert a nationwide
strike threatened for next week.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz
said he received assurances from both sides
in the dispute to resume negotiations "with
the aim of reaching an agreement."
The union's contract with the BCOA,
which represents 130 companies that pro
duce 50 per cent of the nation's coal, expires
at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 6.
Under union procedures, ratification ot a
new contract by the 130,000 active members
would take at least 10 days. Thus a strike is a
virtual certainty unless there is a last-minute
agreement to extend the current pact.

House rejects abortion bill
Washington — The House rejected a com
promise yesterday on government abortion
payments despite warnings from bitter
senators who said they had yielded all they
could in pursuit of an agreement.
Continuing the four-month-old dispute
could affect about 240,000 government
employes whose paychecks are tied to the
abortion question.
An interim funding measure, which was
approved to forestall any payless pay days,
expires at midnight today. But another
House vote is expected today on approval of
a third temporary funding resolution so that
the employes could continue to get paid.
The compromise language would have
permitted abortion payments when a wo
man's life would be endangered by a full
term pregnancy, for treatment of rape and
incest victims and where a woman would
suffer severe and long-lasting physical
health damage if the pregnancy was carried
to term.
Pro-abortion groups quickly criticized the
House action.
Karen Mulhauser, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said the House describing the Senate com
promise as "too liberal" was "an utter dis
grace."
Rabbi Richard Sternberger, chairman of
the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights,
denounced the House action as "uncons
cionable and tragic." The coalition is com
prised ot 25 national religious organizations
that support the option of legal abortion.
Carter plans visit to Warsaw
Washington — President Jimmy Carter will

become the first U.S. president to hold a
wide-open news conference in a Com
munist country when he visits Warsaw late
next month, it was learned yesterday.
Poland will be the first stop on a curtailed
version of Carter's once-postponed world
trip, now set to begin Dec. 29. A formal an
nouncement of the journey is expected later
this week.
When Carter meets the press in Warsaw,
Polish journalists will be invited to join their
western colleagues in questioning the pres
ident. It was not known whether Poland's
state-owned networks will broadcast the
session live. However, the Voice of America
is expected to beam the conference to
Communist countries, including the Soviet
Union.
White House officials declined to confirm
plans for the news conference. However,
they acknowledged that another highlight of
Carter's six-nation trip will be the first visit by
an incumbent president to France's Nor
mandy beachheads where American and
other allied troops landed more than 32
years ago during World War 11. Carter also
will lay a wreath at a U.S. cemetery for
American war dead.
The trip will take Carter to Poland, Iran,
India, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. He
is expected to return to Washington on Jan.
6 or Jan. 7.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with variable high
clouds. Local night and morning low clouds

Peace talks envoys picked
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt, Israel, the United
States and the United Nations began select
ing their delegates yesterday for President
Anwar Sadat's preparatory Middle East
peace conference in Cairo.
Syria and the Paiestine Liberation Organi
zation denounced the Cairo meeting and
said they would not attend.
Arab nations opposed to Sadat's concilia
tion with Israel appeared to be splitting over
two proposed anti-Sadat meetings.
The Soviet Union, co-chairman with
America of the Geneva conference for which
the Cairo meeting is to prepare, joined the
hard-line Arabs and refused to go to the
Egyptian capital. Officials in Washington
said Moscow informed the United States it
would not attend.
Israel accepted Sadat's invitation Monday
and named two ranking diplomats to head
its mission. Egypt remains the only Arab
country to be represented, although Jordan
has said it will attend if all other countries
invited are there. Libya and Iraq called for
Arab conferences in their countries to form a
front against Sadat and Israel.
Washington formally accepted Egypt's in
vitation yesterday and officials said a delega
tion led by a still-unnamed diplomatic expert
would be in Cairo when the talks open, pos
sibly this weekend.
judge refuses top FBI post
Washington — U.S. District Judge Frank
Johnson bowed out as the president's
nominee for FBI director yesterday, and At

months before I will regain my strength and

Bureau of Investigation or to me to keep this
matter pending any longer."
In a statement issued at his office in
Montgomery, Ala., Johnson said he regrets
that "conditions over which I have no con

strike threatened for next week.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz
said he received assurances from both sides
in the dispute to resume negotiations "with
the aim of reaching an agreement."
The union's contract with the BCOA,
which represents 130 companies that pro
duce 50 per cent of the nation's coal, expires
at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 6.
Under union procedures, ratification ot a
new contract by the 130,000 active members
would take at least 10 days. Thus a strike is a
virtual certainty unless there is a last-minute
agreement to extend the current pact.

House rejects abortion bill
Washington — The House rejected a com
promise yesterday on government abortion
payments despite warnings from bitter
senators who said they had yielded all they
could in pursuit of an agreement.
Continuing the four-month-old dispute
could affect about 240,000 government
employes whose paychecks are tied to the
abortion question.
An interim funding measure, which was
approved to forestall any payless pay days,
expires at midnight today. But another
House vote is expected today on approval of
a third temporary funding resolution so that
the employes could continue to get paid.
The compromise language would have
permitted abortion payments when a wo
man's life would be endangered by a full
term pregnancy, for treatment of rape and
incest victims and where a woman would
suffer severe and long-lasting physical
health damage if the pregnancy was carried
to term.
Pro-abortion groups quickly criticized the
House action.
Karen Mulhauser, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said the House describing the Senate com
promise as "too liberal" was "an utter dis
grace."
Rabbi Richard Sternberger, chairman of
the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights,
denounced the House action as "uncons
cionable and tragic." The coalition is com
prised ot 25 national religious organizations
that support the option of legal abortion.
Carter plans visit to Warsaw
Washington — President Jimmy Carter will

become the first U.S. president to hold a
wide-open news conference in a Com
munist country when he visits Warsaw late
next month, it was learned yesterday.
Poland will be the first stop on a curtailed
version of Carter's once-postponed world
trip, now set to begin Dec. 29. A formal an
nouncement of the journey is expected later
this week.
When Carter meets the press in Warsaw,
Polish journalists will be invited to join their
western colleagues in questioning the pres
ident. It was not known whether Poland's
state-owned networks will broadcast the
session live. However, the Voice of America
is expected to beam the conference to
Communist countries, including the Soviet
Union.
White House officials declined to confirm
plans for the news conference. However,
they acknowledged that another highlight of
Carter's six-nation trip will be the first visit by
an incumbent president to France's Nor
mandy beachheads where American and
other allied troops landed more than 32
years ago during World War 11. Carter also
will lay a wreath at a U.S. cemetery for
American war dead.
The trip will take Carter to Poland, Iran,
India, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. He
is expected to return to Washington on Jan.
6 or Jan. 7.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with variable high
clouds. Local night and morning low clouds
or fog. Lows upper 40s to mid-50s. Highs
mid-60s to low 70s. Winds mostly northwes
terly 10 to 20 mph.
Peace talks envoys picked
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt, Israel, the United
States and the United Nations began select
ing their delegates yesterday for President
Anwar Sadat's preparatory Middle East
peace conference in Cairo.
Syria and the Paiestine Liberation Organi
zation denounced the Cairo meeting and
said they would not attend.
Arab nations opposed to Sadat's concilia
tion with Israel appeared to be splitting over
two proposed anti-Sadat meetings.
The Soviet Union, co-chairman with
America of the Geneva conference for which
the Cairo meeting is to prepare, joined the
hard-line Arabs and refused to go to the
Egyptian capital. Officials in Washington
said Moscow informed the United States it
would not attend.
Israel accepted Sadat's invitation Monday
and named two ranking diplomats to head
its mission. Egypt remains the only Arab
country to be represented, although Jordan
has said it will attend if all other countries
invited are there. Libya and Iraq called for
Arab conferences in their countries to form a
front against Sadat and Israel.
Washington formally accepted Egypt's in
vitation yesterday and officials said a delega
tion led by a still-unnamed diplomatic expert
would be in Cairo when the talks open, pos
sibly this weekend.
judge refuses top FBI post
Washington — U.S. District Judge Frank
Johnson bowed out as the president's
nominee for FBI director yesterday, and At
torney Gen. Griffin Bell said the search for a
replacement will last into the new year.
Still in poor health after surgery last Au

gust, Johnson said, "it will be several more
months before I will regain my strength and
stamina. It will not be fair to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation or to me to keep this
matter pending any longer."
In a statement issued at his office in
Montgomery, Ala., Johnson said he regrets
that "conditions over which I have no con
trol" have forced him to step aside.
At the White House, Press Secretary Jody
Powell called the withdrawal "a loss to the
administration, to the FBI and to the country
— and we regret it very much."
The attorney general said he and President
Jimmy Carter won't rush into a decision
about a new nominee to succeed Clarence
Kelley and become the third director in the
FBl's 53-year history.
Vote ends dockworkers strike
New York — Dockworkers in most ports
along the East and Gulf Coasts went back to
work yesterday night, signaling an end to
their 59-day strike against container ship
ping.
The first men back on the docks included
910 men who were called back at 7 p.m. to
work in the Port of New York.
A total of 50,000 men had refused to un
load containerized ships for the past two
months, stranding ships in port, causing de
lays for all shipping and costing the U.S.
economy untold millions.
Longshoremen from Maine to Texas voted
on the agreement yesterday, leaving work
ers in New Orleans and Philadelphia to ratify
the pact. But on the strength of early returns
— International Longshoremen's Associa
tion President Thomas "Teddy" Gleason
said the voting was two to one for the con

tract — the men began their return to work
yesterday night.
Container shipping, developed over the
past decade, uses preloaded, semitrailer
size containers. The containers are transfer
red by crane between ship, railway car and
truck.
The automation reduced the need for
longshoremen by more than a third in ports
such as New York and became the principal
target of the strike for greater job and in
come protection.
The union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, de
cided to go ahead with the voting yesterday.
The contract balloting will continue today
after completion of contract supplements in
New Orleans and Philadelphia.
Coal workers to negotiate

Washington — President Jimmy Carter will

become the first U.S. president to hold a
wide-open news conference in a Com
munist country when he visits Warsaw late
next month, it was learned yesterday.
Poland will be the first stop on a curtailed
version of Carter's once-postponed world
trip, now set to begin Dec. 29. A formal an
nouncement of the journey is expected later
this week.
When Carter meets the press in Warsaw,
Polish journalists will be invited to join their
western colleagues in questioning the pres
ident. It was not known whether Poland's
state-owned networks will broadcast the
session live. However, the Voice of America
is expected to beam the conference to
Communist countries, including the Soviet
Union.
White House officials declined to confirm
plans for the news conference. However,
they acknowledged that another highlight of
Carter's six-nation trip will be the first visit by
an incumbent president to France's Nor
mandy beachheads where American and
other allied troops landed more than 32
years ago during World War 11. Carter also
will lay a wreath at a U.S. cemetery for
American war dead.
The trip will take Carter to Poland, Iran,
India, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. He
is expected to return to Washington on Jan.
6 or Jan. 7.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with variable high
clouds. Local night and morning low clouds
or fog. Lows upper 40s to mid-50s. Highs
mid-60s to low 70s. Winds mostly northwes
terly 10 to 20 mph.
Peace talks envoys picked
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt, Israel, the United
States and the United Nations began select
ing their delegates yesterday for President
Anwar Sadat's preparatory Middle East
peace conference in Cairo.
Syria and the Paiestine Liberation Organi
zation denounced the Cairo meeting and
said they would not attend.
Arab nations opposed to Sadat's concilia
tion with Israel appeared to be splitting over
two proposed anti-Sadat meetings.
The Soviet Union, co-chairman with
America of the Geneva conference for which
the Cairo meeting is to prepare, joined the
hard-line Arabs and refused to go to the
Egyptian capital. Officials in Washington
said Moscow informed the United States it
would not attend.
Israel accepted Sadat's invitation Monday
and named two ranking diplomats to head
its mission. Egypt remains the only Arab
country to be represented, although Jordan
has said it will attend if all other countries
invited are there. Libya and Iraq called for
Arab conferences in their countries to form a
front against Sadat and Israel.
Washington formally accepted Egypt's in
vitation yesterday and officials said a delega
tion led by a still-unnamed diplomatic expert
would be in Cairo when the talks open, pos
sibly this weekend.
judge refuses top FBI post
Washington — U.S. District Judge Frank
Johnson bowed out as the president's
nominee for FBI director yesterday, and At
torney Gen. Griffin Bell said the search for a
replacement will last into the new year.
Still in poor health after surgery last Au

gust, Johnson said, "it will be several more
months before I will regain my strength and
stamina. It will not be fair to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation or to me to keep this
matter pending any longer."
In a statement issued at his office in
Montgomery, Ala., Johnson said he regrets
that "conditions over which I have no con
trol" have forced him to step aside.
At the White House, Press Secretary Jody
Powell called the withdrawal "a loss to the
administration, to the FBI and to the country
— and we regret it very much."
The attorney general said he and President
Jimmy Carter won't rush into a decision
about a new nominee to succeed Clarence
Kelley and become the third director in the
FBl's 53-year history.
Vote ends dockworkers strike
New York — Dockworkers in most ports
along the East and Gulf Coasts went back to
work yesterday night, signaling an end to
their 59-day strike against container ship
ping.
The first men back on the docks included
910 men who were called back at 7 p.m. to
work in the Port of New York.
A total of 50,000 men had refused to un
load containerized ships for the past two
months, stranding ships in port, causing de
lays for all shipping and costing the U.S.
economy untold millions.
Longshoremen from Maine to Texas voted
on the agreement yesterday, leaving work
ers in New Orleans and Philadelphia to ratify
the pact. But on the strength of early returns
— International Longshoremen's Associa
tion President Thomas "Teddy" Gleason
said the voting was two to one for the con

tract — the men began their return to work
yesterday night.
Container shipping, developed over the
past decade, uses preloaded, semitrailer
size containers. The containers are transfer
red by crane between ship, railway car and
truck.
The automation reduced the need for
longshoremen by more than a third in ports
such as New York and became the principal
target of the strike for greater job and in
come protection.
The union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, de
cided to go ahead with the voting yesterday.
The contract balloting will continue today
after completion of contract supplements in
New Orleans and Philadelphia.
Coal workers to negotiate
Washington — Federal mediators took
charge of the coal industry's stalemated con
tract talks yesterday and won swift agree
ment for "concentrated and continuous
negotiations" to try to avert a nationwide
strike threatened for next week.
Chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz
said he received assurances from both sides
in the dispute to resume negotiations "with
the aim of reaching an agreement."
The union's contract with the BCOA,
which represents 130 companies that pro
duce 50 per cent of the nation's coal, expires
at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 6.
Under union procedures, ratification ot a
new contract by the 130,000 active members
would take at least 10 days. Thus a strike is a
virtual certainty unless there is a last-minute
agreement to extend the current pact.

House rejects abortion bill
Washington — The House rejected a com
promise yesterday on government abortion
payments despite warnings from bitter
senators who said they had yielded all they
could in pursuit of an agreement.
Continuing the four-month-old dispute
could affect about 240,000 government
employes whose paychecks are tied to the
abortion question.
An interim funding measure, which was
approved to forestall any payless pay days,
expires at midnight today. But another
House vote is expected today on approval of
a third temporary funding resolution so that
the employes could continue to get paid.
The compromise language would have
permitted abortion payments when a wo
man's life would be endangered by a full
term pregnancy, for treatment of rape and
incest victims and where a woman would
suffer severe and long-lasting physical
health damage if the pregnancy was carried
to term.
Pro-abortion groups quickly criticized the
House action.
Karen Mulhauser, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said the House describing the Senate com
promise as "too liberal" was "an utter dis
grace."
Rabbi Richard Sternberger, chairman of
the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights,
denounced the House action as "uncons
cionable and tragic." The coalition is com
prised ot 25 national religious organizations
that support the option of legal abortion.
