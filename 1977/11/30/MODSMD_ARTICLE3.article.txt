# Gay student protests newspaper editorial
## 
### 
An enraged gay person here tore
up a large number of copies of the
most recent issue of The Real News
last week when it was being distri
buted to the campus.
The unidentified person was upset
over editorials which appeared both
in that paper and in the Oct. 21 issue,
according to Keith Archuleta, busi
ness manager for the Black Media In
stitute which publishes the paper.
The Oct. 21 editorial written by the
paper's editor, Wahid Taha, stated,
"One of the suicidal ideologies that
ha_i reached epioemic proportions in
our society is homosexuality."
Archuleta explained that the edito
rial did not represent the position of
the editorial board of the paper, only
that of the writer. He said this was
later made clear to representatives of
the Gay People's Union (CPU) who
were alarmed by the editorial.
The two treasurers of the CPU
speaking on their own behalf, said
they were disturbed because both
editorials appeared as though they
were sanctioned by the paper's
editorial board since no claim was
made to the contrary.
The CPU was given space in the
most recent (Nov. 22) issue to re
spond to the first editorial. Appear
ing alongside that response was a
second editorial by Taha saying, "I'm
not against the whole person, but
that (homosexual) part of your think
ing I cannot support."
One of the treasurers said that "for
the second time in a row, they have
not made it clear that it was not the
opinion of the paper." He continued
that Taha's second editorial "almost
seems to ridicule" the CPU re
sponse.
Archuleta said the GPU was con
tacted about the incident and that it
felt the student, who is a GPU
member, "was overreacting" and
that it was "not their position that
they wanted to retaliate."
One of the GPU treasurers, how
ever, only said the action was "un
derstandable." He added, "There is a
difference of opinion about the
propriety of the action (at the GPU)."
He said the editorials made it seem as
though there are "two equally re
spective" opinions concerning the
status of homosexuality.
The treasurers said that the GPU
will hold a meeting tomorrow to
formulate an appropriate response
to the editorials in The Real News.

Archuleta said, "We haven't dealt
with that individual (directly). We've
let it ride. . . . We did attempt to
make sure he knew that he shouldn't
do that, that there are other ways of
dealing with the problem."
He said there have not been any
further incidents and he did not ex
pect any in the future.
Archuleta said he will be writing a
response to Taha's editorials in the
next issue of the paper.

stitute which publishes the paper.
The Oct. 21 editorial written by the
paper's editor, Wahid Taha, stated,
"One of the suicidal ideologies that
ha_i reached epioemic proportions in
our society is homosexuality."
Archuleta explained that the edito
rial did not represent the position of
the editorial board of the paper, only
that of the writer. He said this was
later made clear to representatives of
the Gay People's Union (CPU) who
were alarmed by the editorial.
The two treasurers of the CPU
speaking on their own behalf, said
they were disturbed because both
editorials appeared as though they
were sanctioned by the paper's
editorial board since no claim was
made to the contrary.
The CPU was given space in the
most recent (Nov. 22) issue to re
spond to the first editorial. Appear
ing alongside that response was a
second editorial by Taha saying, "I'm
not against the whole person, but
that (homosexual) part of your think
ing I cannot support."
One of the treasurers said that "for
the second time in a row, they have
not made it clear that it was not the
opinion of the paper." He continued
that Taha's second editorial "almost
seems to ridicule" the CPU re
sponse.
Archuleta said the GPU was con
tacted about the incident and that it
felt the student, who is a GPU
member, "was overreacting" and
that it was "not their position that
they wanted to retaliate."
One of the GPU treasurers, how
ever, only said the action was "un
derstandable." He added, "There is a
difference of opinion about the
propriety of the action (at the GPU)."
He said the editorials made it seem as
though there are "two equally re
spective" opinions concerning the
status of homosexuality.
The treasurers said that the GPU
will hold a meeting tomorrow to
formulate an appropriate response
to the editorials in The Real News.

Archuleta said, "We haven't dealt
with that individual (directly). We've
let it ride. . . . We did attempt to
make sure he knew that he shouldn't
do that, that there are other ways of
dealing with the problem."
He said there have not been any
further incidents and he did not ex
pect any in the future.
Archuleta said he will be writing a
response to Taha's editorials in the
next issue of the paper.
An enraged gay person here tore
up a large number of copies of the
most recent issue of The Real News
last week when it was being distri
buted to the campus.
The unidentified person was upset
over editorials which appeared both
in that paper and in the Oct. 21 issue,
according to Keith Archuleta, busi
ness manager for the Black Media In
stitute which publishes the paper.
