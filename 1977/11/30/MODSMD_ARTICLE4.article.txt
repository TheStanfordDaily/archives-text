## Korean CIA dropped plan to infiltrate White House 
### 
Washington (AP) — The South Ko
rean intelligence agency planned to
install a spy network in the White
House and to pay off aides to top
U.S. leaders last year in hopes of
winning United States support for
South Korea, a document released
yesterday alleged.
The plan apparently was dropped
when previous activities by the Ko
rean Central Intelligence Agency in
this country were exposed.
Rep. Donald Fraser (D-Minn.),
who released copies of the report
during a subcommittee hearing yes
terday, said the 1976 plan and an ear
lier KCIA plan, apparently in 1973,
"reveal a calculated attempt by the
KCIA to use clandestine means to
sway American public opinion and
official policy. . . .
"The action taken by the KCIA to
implement the plans must be recog
nized for what it is — outright sub
version," Fraser said. He said that
about $750,000 was earmarked for
the KCIA operations, not including
money that was to be contributed to
congressional campaigns.
The alleged KCIA plan released by
Fraser's House International Rela
tions subcommittee envisioned
$100-a-month payoffs to 14 aides in
the White House, State Department,
Defense Department and intelli
gence agencies.
It envisioned payments of $53,000
in campaign contributions to at least
four congressmen and "special man
ipulation" payments to selected
congressional aides.
The plan also called for efforts to
win over and manipulate reporters in
major U.S. news organizations and
to manipulate university people to
promote support for South Korea.
The elaborate plan to influence
U.S. foreign policy and public opin
ion allegedly was distributed to KCIA
station chiefs in the United States in
early 1976 — shortly before other

similar South Korean efforts were
publicly disclosed.
A subcommittee member, Rep.
William Goodling (R-Pa.), said he be
lieves Korean efforts to carry out the
plan were cut short by the publicity.
That sentiment was echoed by
JJohn Ho Young, who defected as
KCIA station chief in New York City
two months ago. The subcommittee
apparently obtained the alleged plan
from him.
Young told the committee he be
lieved the KCIA drafted the plan be
cause it was afraid of losing U.S. sup

port in the wake of America's leaving
South Vietnam.
The opening paragraphs of the al
leged KCIA plan state its objectives
are to block North Korean attempts
to make contact with U.S. officials, to
strengthen the U.S. security com
mitment to South Korea and to dis
rupt what it called North Korean in
filtration of Korean resident groups
in America.
The plan included an effort to
neutralize an alleged contact bet
ween one unnamed member of
Congress and North Korea.
