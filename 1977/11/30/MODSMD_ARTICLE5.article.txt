# California eyeing Med School billing

### Andrea James 
The California State Senate Busi
ness and Professions Committee has
been asked to "look over the shoul
der" of a state consumer agency's
investigations into the University's
billing procedures, according to
James Cathcart, consultant to the se
nate committee.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, president
of the Union of American Physicians,
wrote on Oct. 28 to all California
senators and assemblymen suggest
ing that the legislature "keep a close
watch on the Bureau of Medical
Quality Assurance investigation of
Stanford."
Weinmann also stated in his letters
that the close watch could "save tax
payers millions of dollars in Medi-Cal
and other monies."
Those letters were referred to the
Business and Professions Commit
tee.
"We're treating this request like
any other request," Cathcart said.
"We're simply looking into the mat
ter and then we will report our find
ings back to the legislators."
The BMQA is investigating claims
made by the doctor's union and by
Dr. Eugene Dong, associate profes
sor of cardiovascular surgery at the
Medical Center. They claim that
Stanford is violating section 2008 of
the California Business Code.
'No charge'
That code states, in part, that med
ical schools and institutions may
make "no charge for professional
services rendered patients."
Stanford defends itself by saying
that the hospital is an owned sub
sidiary of the University and that fa
culty physicians are employed by the
University and not by the hospital.
Weinmann wrote in the letters that
the union "has doubts that the

BMQA will conduct an adequate in
vestigation of these charges."
He told the Daily his suspicions are
founded 011 the facts that the execu
tive director of the bureau, Bob Row
land, was previously employed by
Stanford as business manager for the
Department of Medicine.
He added that two other board
members are Stanford employes:
John Bunker, acting director of
community and preventive
medicine; and Harry Oberhelman,
professor of surgery.
"Eugene Feldman, president of the
division of medical quality of the
BMQA, commented at an August
committee meeting that overbilling
is a 'relatively inconsequential mat
ter,' " Weinmann said.
Others do it
Weinmann also wrote in the letters
that Stanford officials have claimed
they practice these controversial bil
ling procedures "because other
medical schools do it."
He adds that this argument is
"suspiciously similar to the Nixon-
Watergate defense."
According to Weinmann, Univer
sity of California at San Francisco
Medical School denied using the
same billing procedures as Stanford
after seeing photostats of Stanford's
bills.
Meanwhile, the alleged violation
of section 2008 is being investigated
by the BMQA, Rowland told the
Daily.
"There is no reason why the
BMQA would not respond properly
to the Stanford investigation," he
said.
Rowland also told the Daily that
the Department of Health has agreed
to look into the alleged inapprop
riate billing to Medi-Cal.
