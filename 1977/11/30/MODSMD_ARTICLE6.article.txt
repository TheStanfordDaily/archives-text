## SCRIP continues divestment debate 
### Craig Dennis 
The Stanford Committee for a Re
sponsible Investment Policy (SCRIP)
continued its attack on the Universi
ty's cost/benefit report on divest
ment during KZSU's Campus Con
ference last night.
SCRlPspokesperson Laura Carlsen
said, "We have to show strong com
munity support until our voices can
not be ignored.
"It's going to take a lot of commun
ity effort to convince them to divest,"
Carlsen stated. "We're going to have
to show huge amounts of support in
whatever way we can. According to
their policies in the past, they don't
have a strong sense of their role as an
ethical investor."
Stewart Ozer, another SCRIP
spokesperson on the program, con
tinued his organization's criticism of
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy, whose re
commendation accompanied the
University's divestiture report.
"We would like to see some real
evidence whether we have anything
to lose from these corporations," he
said. "Massy does not give any
specifics, he does not talk about any
facts in the matter. He just says cor
porations will be too insulted to con
tribute to Stanford. That argument is
too ridiculous."
Carlsen added, "We don't feel we
should be accountable to these cor
porations foi our investment
policies. It's corporate blackmail if
we're going to assume that in order
to get these gifts we have to invest
the way corporations say we should.
We don't think this is in accordance
with Stanford as a free institution."
SCRIP is not saying there won't be
any costs from divestment, Carlsen

said. "What we are saying is there are
higher concerns than the economic
costs when Stanford puts its money
in corporations."
"The fact that the Massy report
cites only costs and not benefits of
divestment," said Carlsen, "is a good
indication of how they (the trustees)
see their role . . . strongly commit
ted to the maximization of profits."
Ozer attempted to draw a parallel
between divestment and the Univer
sity's Medical School recently refus
ing federal funds when the grants in
terfered with admissions standards.
Ozer said in this instance Stanford
was "embracing a set of principles
rather than expecting a profitable

course of action. We are expecting
the University to take the same kind
of reasoning and apply it to this situa
tion which is at least as strong a case
as Medical School admissions."
SCRIP said five of nine corpora
tions it demanded divestment from
by a Feb. 14 deadline had South
Africa-related proxy resolutions last
year.
Carlsen said, "We need more
dialogue with William Massy," and
noted SCRIP has challenged the
Board of Trustees to a debate on
campus before the Feb. 14 deadline.
She said there had been difficulty in
communicating SCRIP'S positions to
the trustees at past trustee meetings.
