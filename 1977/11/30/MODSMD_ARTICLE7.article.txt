## Making history the hard way 
### 
A dispute that began on April 12,1971 in
the offices of the Daily will end before the
U.S. Supreme Court within the next few
months. On that day six and one-half years
ago, four Palo Alto police officers used a
search warrant to raid the Daily's offices in
an attempt to find photographic evidence
which could be used to prosecute de
monstrators. The police found nothing,
but the Daily and seven of its editors and
photographers sued to protect the Daily's
editorial freedom.
Since then, both a federal district court
and an appeals court have declared the
search unconstitutional, stating that the
search violated the First Amendment's
guarantee of freedom of the press and the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable search and seizure.
Last mpnth, the Supreme Court agreed
to hear the case during the court's current
term.
This saga began when city and county
police ended a demonstration on April 9,
1971 at Stanford Hospital. Some 60 per
sons protesting the firing of a hospital
employe staged a 30-hour sit-in and finally
barricaded themselves in a hospital cor
ridor. Attempts by 175 police officers to
disperse that sit-in ended in a riot. At least
37 demonstrators and policemen were in
jured and 23 demonstrators were ar
rested. Two days later, the Daily published
some photographs of that encounter.
No formal charges had yet been filed, so
the police could not obtain a subpoena to
obtain other photographs which they be
lieved were in the Daily's possession.
However, the county grand jury, before
which a subpoena is returnable, met two
hours after the search.
Also, even though the Daily did publish
newsworthy photographs of incriminating
actions, the Daily had a stated policy to
destroy unpublished photographic evi
dence that might incriminate people. This
policy was necessary so the Daily would
not become the investigative arm of any
prosecuting body.
Thus, three days after the sit-in was en
ded, police obtained a search warrant and
ransacked the Daily's offices. During the
search, police went through files, desks
and even wastebaskets to find evidence.
While doing this, police saw reporters'
notes, some containing confidential in
formation, and even reporters' personal
correspondence.
On Oct. 5, 1972, federal District Court
Judge Robert Peckham ruled in favor of
the Daily and against all defendants, who
were the police officers and police chief,
and the district attorney and his assistant
who was involved in the search.
Dealing first with the Fourth Amend
ment issue, Peckham said "it is the court's
belief that unless the magistrate has be
fore him a sworn affidavit establishing
proper cause to believe that the materials
in question will be destroyed, or that a
subpoena duces tecum is otherwise 'im
practical,' a search of a third party for
materials in his possession is unreasona
ble per se, and therefore violative of the
Fourth Amendment."
Peckham also pointed out that in this
case a newspaper was involved: "the
other aspect of defendants' argument —that
newspapers, reporters and photo
graphers have no greater Fourth Amend

ment protections than other citizens — is
also without merit. The First Amendment
is not superfluous. . . . The threat to the
press' newsgathering ability ... is much
more imposing with a search warrant than
with a subpoena."
Thus, Peckham held that search war
rants issued against newspaper offices
"should be permitted in the rare cir
cumstances where there is a clear showing
that 1) important materials will be de
stroyed or removed from the jurisdiction;
and 2) a restraining order would be futile.
To stop short of this standard would be to
sneer at all the First Amendment has come
to represent in our society."
Then, on Feb. 2, 1977, a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals unanimously upheld Peckham's
decision in the case of The Stanford Daily
v. Zurcher, et al.
No newspaper in American history was
ever searched before the Daily. However,
since the Daily's offices were raided, three
California radio stations and one news
paper have been searched.
When the Supreme Court hears our
case, it might well decide whether every
person who is not suspected of a crime
can be subject to an unannounced police
search of his residence or business.
Indeed, our case has more overtones of
the Fourth Amendment than those of the
First Amendment. The court's decision
might possibly have more outcome on a
homeowner than on a journalist. Law en
forcement officials have realized the
case's implications, as evidenced when 17
states and a national district attorneys'
group filed briefs two weeks ago which
urged the court to rule against the Daily.
Yet if the court decides that news media
not suspected of criminal activity are sub
ject to unannounced police searches,
then every person will again be affected,
since the threat or possibility of a search
will soon lead the news media to termi
nate their investigation and coverage of
certain activities, especially since people
will soon refuse to cooperate with the
press. News media self-censorship is also
foreseeable. No democracy can function
without informed citizens, and so an
event that once was a concern to a few
people may soon have drastic and far
reaching consequences on all Americans.
The Supreme Court has held in recent
years that reporters have no constitutional
right to withhold information from grand
juries, and that the journalist too must be
subject to subpoenas. Yet subpoenas can
be questioned and stopped in court;
search warrants — which give no prior
notice — can not. And once a search has
occurred, the damage is done and can
never be corrected by any judicial declara
tion.
If the court reverses the two lower fed
eral courts, it will leave all decisions con
cerning what — and how — information
may be obtained from journalists to gov
ernment law enforcement agencies. Plac
ing such decisions solely in the hands of
police, prosecutors and judges — who
may well be the object of a newspaper's
investigation — will most certainly have
catastrophic effects on our nation.
It is for these reasons that we hope the
Supreme Court will uphold the decisions
rendered in the Daily's case.

barricaded themselves in a hospital cor
ridor. Attempts by 175 police officers to
disperse that sit-in ended in a riot. At least
37 demonstrators and policemen were in
jured and 23 demonstrators were ar
rested. Two days later, the Daily published
some photographs of that encounter.
No formal charges had yet been filed, so
the police could not obtain a subpoena to
obtain other photographs which they be
lieved were in the Daily's possession.
However, the county grand jury, before
which a subpoena is returnable, met two
hours after the search.
Also, even though the Daily did publish
newsworthy photographs of incriminating
actions, the Daily had a stated policy to
destroy unpublished photographic evi
dence that might incriminate people. This
policy was necessary so the Daily would
not become the investigative arm of any
prosecuting body.
Thus, three days after the sit-in was en
ded, police obtained a search warrant and
ransacked the Daily's offices. During the
search, police went through files, desks
and even wastebaskets to find evidence.
While doing this, police saw reporters'
notes, some containing confidential in
formation, and even reporters' personal
correspondence.
On Oct. 5, 1972, federal District Court
Judge Robert Peckham ruled in favor of
the Daily and against all defendants, who
were the police officers and police chief,
and the district attorney and his assistant
who was involved in the search.
Dealing first with the Fourth Amend
ment issue, Peckham said "it is the court's
belief that unless the magistrate has be
fore him a sworn affidavit establishing
proper cause to believe that the materials
in question will be destroyed, or that a
subpoena duces tecum is otherwise 'im
practical,' a search of a third party for
materials in his possession is unreasona
ble per se, and therefore violative of the
Fourth Amendment."
Peckham also pointed out that in this
case a newspaper was involved: "the
other aspect of defendants' argument —that
newspapers, reporters and photo
graphers have no greater Fourth Amend

ment protections than other citizens — is
also without merit. The First Amendment
is not superfluous. . . . The threat to the
press' newsgathering ability ... is much
more imposing with a search warrant than
with a subpoena."
Thus, Peckham held that search war
rants issued against newspaper offices
"should be permitted in the rare cir
cumstances where there is a clear showing
that 1) important materials will be de
stroyed or removed from the jurisdiction;
and 2) a restraining order would be futile.
To stop short of this standard would be to
sneer at all the First Amendment has come
to represent in our society."
Then, on Feb. 2, 1977, a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals unanimously upheld Peckham's
decision in the case of The Stanford Daily
v. Zurcher, et al.
No newspaper in American history was
ever searched before the Daily. However,
since the Daily's offices were raided, three
California radio stations and one news
paper have been searched.
When the Supreme Court hears our
case, it might well decide whether every
person who is not suspected of a crime
can be subject to an unannounced police
search of his residence or business.
Indeed, our case has more overtones of
the Fourth Amendment than those of the
First Amendment. The court's decision
might possibly have more outcome on a
homeowner than on a journalist. Law en
forcement officials have realized the
case's implications, as evidenced when 17
states and a national district attorneys'
group filed briefs two weeks ago which
urged the court to rule against the Daily.
Yet if the court decides that news media
not suspected of criminal activity are sub
ject to unannounced police searches,
then every person will again be affected,
since the threat or possibility of a search
will soon lead the news media to termi
nate their investigation and coverage of
certain activities, especially since people
will soon refuse to cooperate with the
press. News media self-censorship is also
foreseeable. No democracy can function
without informed citizens, and so an
event that once was a concern to a few
people may soon have drastic and far
reaching consequences on all Americans.
The Supreme Court has held in recent
years that reporters have no constitutional
right to withhold information from grand
juries, and that the journalist too must be
subject to subpoenas. Yet subpoenas can
be questioned and stopped in court;
search warrants — which give no prior
notice — can not. And once a search has
occurred, the damage is done and can
never be corrected by any judicial declara
tion.
If the court reverses the two lower fed
eral courts, it will leave all decisions con
cerning what — and how — information
may be obtained from journalists to gov
ernment law enforcement agencies. Plac
ing such decisions solely in the hands of
police, prosecutors and judges — who
may well be the object of a newspaper's
investigation — will most certainly have
catastrophic effects on our nation.
It is for these reasons that we hope the
Supreme Court will uphold the decisions
rendered in the Daily's case.
A dispute that began on April 12,1971 in
the offices of the Daily will end before the
U.S. Supreme Court within the next few
months. On that day six and one-half years
ago, four Palo Alto police officers used a
search warrant to raid the Daily's offices in
an attempt to find photographic evidence
which could be used to prosecute de
monstrators. The police found nothing,
but the Daily and seven of its editors and
photographers sued to protect the Daily's
editorial freedom.
Since then, both a federal district court
and an appeals court have declared the
search unconstitutional, stating that the
search violated the First Amendment's
guarantee of freedom of the press and the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable search and seizure.
Last mpnth, the Supreme Court agreed
to hear the case during the court's current
term.
This saga began when city and county
police ended a demonstration on April 9,
1971 at Stanford Hospital. Some 60 per

and even wastebaskets to find evidence.
While doing this, police saw reporters'
notes, some containing confidential in
formation, and even reporters' personal
correspondence.
On Oct. 5, 1972, federal District Court
Judge Robert Peckham ruled in favor of
the Daily and against all defendants, who
were the police officers and police chief,
and the district attorney and his assistant
who was involved in the search.
Dealing first with the Fourth Amend
ment issue, Peckham said "it is the court's
belief that unless the magistrate has be
fore him a sworn affidavit establishing
proper cause to believe that the materials
in question will be destroyed, or that a
subpoena duces tecum is otherwise 'im
practical,' a search of a third party for
materials in his possession is unreasona
ble per se, and therefore violative of the
Fourth Amendment."
Peckham also pointed out that in this
case a newspaper was involved: "the
other aspect of defendants' argument —that
newspapers, reporters and photo
graphers have no greater Fourth Amend

ment protections than other citizens — is
also without merit. The First Amendment
is not superfluous. . . . The threat to the
press' newsgathering ability ... is much
more imposing with a search warrant than
with a subpoena."
Thus, Peckham held that search war
rants issued against newspaper offices
"should be permitted in the rare cir
cumstances where there is a clear showing
that 1) important materials will be de
stroyed or removed from the jurisdiction;
and 2) a restraining order would be futile.
To stop short of this standard would be to
sneer at all the First Amendment has come
to represent in our society."
Then, on Feb. 2, 1977, a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals unanimously upheld Peckham's
decision in the case of The Stanford Daily
v. Zurcher, et al.
No newspaper in American history was
ever searched before the Daily. However,
since the Daily's offices were raided, three
California radio stations and one news
paper have been searched.
When the Supreme Court hears our
case, it might well decide whether every
person who is not suspected of a crime
can be subject to an unannounced police
search of his residence or business.
Indeed, our case has more overtones of
the Fourth Amendment than those of the
First Amendment. The court's decision
might possibly have more outcome on a
homeowner than on a journalist. Law en
forcement officials have realized the
case's implications, as evidenced when 17
states and a national district attorneys'
group filed briefs two weeks ago which
urged the court to rule against the Daily.
Yet if the court decides that news media
not suspected of criminal activity are sub
ject to unannounced police searches,
then every person will again be affected,
since the threat or possibility of a search
will soon lead the news media to termi
nate their investigation and coverage of
certain activities, especially since people
will soon refuse to cooperate with the
press. News media self-censorship is also
foreseeable. No democracy can function
without informed citizens, and so an
event that once was a concern to a few
people may soon have drastic and far
reaching consequences on all Americans.
The Supreme Court has held in recent
years that reporters have no constitutional
right to withhold information from grand
juries, and that the journalist too must be
subject to subpoenas. Yet subpoenas can
be questioned and stopped in court;
search warrants — which give no prior
notice — can not. And once a search has
occurred, the damage is done and can
never be corrected by any judicial declara
tion.
If the court reverses the two lower fed
eral courts, it will leave all decisions con
cerning what — and how — information
may be obtained from journalists to gov
ernment law enforcement agencies. Plac
ing such decisions solely in the hands of
police, prosecutors and judges — who
may well be the object of a newspaper's
investigation — will most certainly have
catastrophic effects on our nation.
It is for these reasons that we hope the
Supreme Court will uphold the decisions
rendered in the Daily's case.
A dispute that began on April 12,1971 in
the offices of the Daily will end before the
U.S. Supreme Court within the next few
months. On that day six and one-half years
ago, four Palo Alto police officers used a
search warrant to raid the Daily's offices in
an attempt to find photographic evidence
which could be used to prosecute de
monstrators. The police found nothing,
but the Daily and seven of its editors and
photographers sued to protect the Daily's
editorial freedom.
Since then, both a federal district court
and an appeals court have declared the
search unconstitutional, stating that the
search violated the First Amendment's
guarantee of freedom of the press and the
Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable search and seizure.
Last mpnth, the Supreme Court agreed
to hear the case during the court's current
term.
This saga began when city and county
police ended a demonstration on April 9,
1971 at Stanford Hospital. Some 60 per
sons protesting the firing of a hospital
employe staged a 30-hour sit-in and finally
barricaded themselves in a hospital cor
ridor. Attempts by 175 police officers to
disperse that sit-in ended in a riot. At least
37 demonstrators and policemen were in
jured and 23 demonstrators were ar
rested. Two days later, the Daily published
some photographs of that encounter.
No formal charges had yet been filed, so
the police could not obtain a subpoena to
obtain other photographs which they be
lieved were in the Daily's possession.
However, the county grand jury, before
which a subpoena is returnable, met two
hours after the search.
Also, even though the Daily did publish
newsworthy photographs of incriminating
actions, the Daily had a stated policy to
destroy unpublished photographic evi
dence that might incriminate people. This
policy was necessary so the Daily would
not become the investigative arm of any
prosecuting body.
Thus, three days after the sit-in was en
ded, police obtained a search warrant and
ransacked the Daily's offices. During the
search, police went through files, desks
and even wastebaskets to find evidence.
While doing this, police saw reporters'
notes, some containing confidential in
formation, and even reporters' personal
correspondence.
