# Forum helps to unite women
## 
### 
Cohn, O'Rourke

"American Women on the Move"
was the appropriate theme of the Na
tional Women's Conference held
November 18-22 in Houston. As Stan
ford students who attended this his
torical event, we would like to share
our perspective on the conference.
For the first time in U.S. history a
federal mandate established a forum
for women to discuss and act on their
mutual concerns.
As predicted, there was an awe
some diversity of age, color, class,
background and politics represented
among the 2200 delegates and 20,000
observers that participated. We met
black labor union organizers from
New York City, Catholic nuns from
rural Pennsylvania, and lesbian lob
byists from Alabama.

There were activists, homemakers,
students, right-wingers, profession
als, government officials, authors
and artists all prepared to share their
struggles and victories, and partici
pate in reshaping the status of
women world-wide.
By over-focusing on these differ
ences, national media coverage did
an injustice to the tremendous capa
bility and unflagging commitment of
these women to transcend their divi
sions and establish common action
oriented goals.
Initial responses to the situation at
Houston were indeed filled with
frustration and anger; problems with
lack of time, sleep, inadequate hous
ing and meeting facilities plagued
our attempts to bring our experi
ences from all over the country to a

working basis of mutual concerns.
Both delegates and observers set
tled differences, outlined goals, and
plotted strategies in initial caucus
meetings. The result of our efforts
became apparent as issue after issue
received majority approval on the
convention floor. For example, the
various minority groups coalesced
with an exceptional show of strength
and passed a substitute resolution
which addressed their needs more
specifically.
Besides the official voting ses
sions, observers were able to attend
a wide choice of skills workshops,
film festivals, rallies, lectures, 500
exhibit booths, and non-stop wo
men's cultural performances.
Congress thought it was creating a
forum to suggest guidelines for legis
lation. Some expected a fiasco with
no concrete outcome or lasting sig
nificance. In reality, the conference
had two unpredicted effects on the
women participating.
As women from many
backgrounds, with many priorities,
felt their clout as a political force,
they will no longer be satisfied with
an advisory role in shaping govern
ment policy. This conference was
also a unique opportunity for a
young movement to establish a
firmer sense of identity and direc
tion.

film festivals, rallies, lectures, 500
exhibit booths, and non-stop wo
men's cultural performances.
Congress thought it was creating a
forum to suggest guidelines for legis
lation. Some expected a fiasco with
no concrete outcome or lasting sig
nificance. In reality, the conference
had two unpredicted effects on the
women participating.
As women from many
backgrounds, with many priorities,
felt their clout as a political force,
they will no longer be satisfied with
an advisory role in shaping govern
ment policy. This conference was
also a unique opportunity for a
young movement to establish a
firmer sense of identity and direc
tion.

"American Women on the Move"
was the appropriate theme of the Na
tional Women's Conference held
November 18-22 in Houston. As Stan
ford students who attended this his
torical event, we would like to share
our perspective on the conference.
For the first time in U.S. history a
federal mandate established a forum
for women to discuss and act on their
mutual concerns.
As predicted, there was an awe
some diversity of age, color, class,
background and politics represented
among the 2200 delegates and 20,000
observers that participated. We met
black labor union organizers from
New York City, Catholic nuns from
rural Pennsylvania, and lesbian lob
byists from Alabama.

There were activists, homemakers,
students, right-wingers, profession
als, government officials, authors
and artists all prepared to share their
struggles and victories, and partici
pate in reshaping the status of
women world-wide.
By over-focusing on these differ
ences, national media coverage did
an injustice to the tremendous capa
bility and unflagging commitment of
these women to transcend their divi
sions and establish common action
oriented goals.
Initial responses to the situation at
Houston were indeed filled with
frustration and anger; problems with
lack of time, sleep, inadequate hous
ing and meeting facilities plagued
our attempts to bring our experi
ences from all over the country to a

working basis of mutual concerns.
Both delegates and observers set
tled differences, outlined goals, and
plotted strategies in initial caucus
meetings. The result of our efforts
became apparent as issue after issue
received majority approval on the
convention floor. For example, the
various minority groups coalesced
with an exceptional show of strength
and passed a substitute resolution
which addressed their needs more
specifically.
Besides the official voting ses
sions, observers were able to attend
a wide choice of skills workshops,
film festivals, rallies, lectures, 500
exhibit booths, and non-stop wo
men's cultural performances.
