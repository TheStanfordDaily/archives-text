Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.
