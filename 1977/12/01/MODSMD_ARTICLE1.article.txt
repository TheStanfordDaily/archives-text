Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For

When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I

we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll

The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil

The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as

Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,

— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get

would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable

shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
One faculty member and another student argued
this question in my presence for nearly a half hour.
"I'm teaching something that has informative value,"
the instructor said. "It is something they want and
need to know. That's my job. I don't believe in mold
ing people. I only want to make people understand
my issue."
"But," said the student, "there's an implicit bias
which molds us in a certain direction here. We ought
to be managing with creativity. School must teach
people to think, with continuous interchange. It is a
chance for growth." In response to this, "If you want

to expand your mind, blow up a balloon. Is it my
responsibility to expand your mind?"
The view presented by the professor was one I
heard frequently: the School should provide the
component parts of the standard business cur
riculum. It should be up to the individual student to
decide how to form them into a whole solution to any
given managerial problem.
"We tend to be a little too pragmatic and too con
cerned with the real world and not with intellectual
pursuits," Finance Prof. Bill Sharpe said. "The stu
dents do tend to want formulas and models that will
work rather than building their own solutions. It's so
easy to want a neatly-structured model rather than to
use aptitude to seek solutions."
The multiplicity of approaches to this issue is well
summed-up by Accounting Prof. Tom Hofstedt: "You
see, forevery complaint thatwedon't have enough of
element x someone else will say we have too much. I
know much more about the subjects than the stu
dents do. Some faculty feel other faculty cater too
much to what students think they should know. I
teach three things in my classes — the technical, the
institutional, such as what are the rules and who are
the players, and then the conceptual, learning to
solve problems. I do have a balance."
In this undoubtedly healthy atmosphere of diverse
opinion, there is some degree of hesitance to express
what may be a divergent view. Some obviously regard
the debate as a sensitive one and although not reti-

cent in my presence, they asked to remain anonym
ous. Others froze up altogether when I asked ques
tions regarding ideology or philosophy. And when I
asked other people why this was so, they speculated
that the awe generated by attending the top business
school inhibits open discussion.
"Students here are less critical because they as
sume we know what we're doing. After all, they say,
we're number one. It may be a fluke, but maybe
students collectively and as individuals stop ques
tioning critically," Sharp says. A first year woman
student suggested one other factor which could have
a bearing on the situation. "I'm glad that there's not
too much demand on coming to grips with an ideol
ogy inyour first year," she said. "I'm still mesmerized
with the biz school. You sort of need to be spoon-fed
for a while with what those above you know is impor
tant."

Ideological questions constitute only part of the
areas of concern at the Business School. Stanford
MBAs boast a startling salary average of $22,000, up
$2500 over 1976. Graduating students received an av
erage of 3.8 employment offers this year. They are
clearly in demand. Unfortunately, once they are
placed in the business world, they find the situation
slightly altered: instead of being in great demand,
they become the subjects of great demands. What
would seem to be at worst an enviable annoyance, in
the same category as having too much money, can
actually become a psychological thorn of important
proportions, some students say.
"I never thought coming from the best school in
the country would be a problem," one student from
the Class of '77 told me. "But what happens is there's
an extraordinary pressure to be brighter than
everyone else to have all the answers. That's quite an
expectation to live up to and it creates innumerable
hashes."
"That pressure to be better than anyone else is
really conveyed in the Dean's farewell address when
he in effect says, 'Now that you've been here you all
know better than to do x, y and z.' I swallowed hard
and said, 'Yes, I hope I don't.' Of course I knew I
might do those terrible things. What a pressure to
feel," another recent graduate told me.
"This constant message of 'you're great' coming
from the biz school has a negative effect," yet
another graduate said. "There's pressure never to
make mistakes. 'You know better,' the employer will

imply or say to me. But I'm not
sure though that the biz school
can do anything about that."
Many alums of recent years
attest that the Business School
curriculum only surveys to
pics; practical knowledge is
gained on the job and rarely
comes from successful applica
tion of pieces of information
learned at the School. "In
banking, for instance, training
happens in the bank, not at
school," one student, request
ing anonymity, said. "There is a
good perspective about this,
and a few are ready, but most
are not. I never expected that.
The school just does not teach
the mechanics of learning — it
is a cookbook of recipes to
sample."
Self-satisfied complacency is
a condition of which almost
everyone at the Business
School is wary — at least super
ficially. Some people are wor
: ried that the spirit of passivity
created by the "we're great"
mentality is not completely ab
sent, however. The School has
learned from its mistakes on
i the road to becoming the best
and it now has a system which
seems to work. But a question
very much on the minds of its
> faculty is what it should »;o to
t preserve its superlative status
in the coming years.
"When you're perceived as
being number one, there's a
i bit of inertia," said Finance
: Prof. Sharpe. "You figure any
thing you do may make you

Cf / / /
lose your reputation. I don't know whether there's
even enough momentum or consensus to change.
There's a tendency to just keep doing what you've
been doing. This is what killed Harvard."
Administrators say that the School is never stag
nant, though. They claim their system is moving
alongwhat is planned to be an upwardly mobile path.
"There's been a continued process of improve
ment," Assoc. Dean Robert Jaedicke told me. "Our
opinion is that other schools have good parts and
parts that are not so good. We, on the other hand,
have a balanced excellence. We have great teachers,
we have supreme researchers. We've managed to
reach that certain level of equilibrium but it's been an
upward climb in the past decades. You can never say
we're passive. We're always shooting new blood into
the program. It sounds a bit cliched but it's impor
tant. I suppose that continual upgrading allows us to
improve both our Ph.D. program with more research
and our academic teaching."
One problem certainly not unique to the Stanford
Business School, but which may be aggravated
by the School's high standing, is the severe strain ot
recruiting. Of course the process is a necessary one
— as well as generally successful since most students
wind up with jobs in the field of their choice — but
this rationalization does not make the process any
more pleasant.
The most common complaint is that the demand on
student time made by recruiting, in addition to the
already formidable academic load, leaves almost no
time for the normal activities of lite — eating and
sleeping, for example.
"From November to March one only hears job
seeking information," one student told me. " Get
your resumes in' and Phrase everything right.' It all
ends up to be so important, but in the meantime it
makes everything else very hard to keep up with. And
what's worse is that Carol Marchick, the placement

Carter views Mideast talks
Washington (AP)' — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday that the United States is no longer the "domin
ant intermediary" in the Middle East. But he offered
support to all Arab countries that decide to negotiate
directly with Israel.
So far only Egypt has seized that initiative. That
action was described by Carter at a news conference
as a "historic breakthrough."
"If at some later date it becomes obvious that Jor
dan does not want peace, that Syria does not want
peace, or that Lebanon does not want peace and a
settlement with Israel, then an alternative might have
to be pursued," Carter said.
The obvious inference was that the United States
then might support a separate settlement between
Egypt and Israel, which some Arabs are convinced is
already in the making.
His public support tor the steps taken by Anwar
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin was
tempered with the qualification that their "explorat
ory effort" should be related to an overall Middle East
settlement. And at least indirectly Carter urged Israel
not to lose sight of the "Palestinian question."
As torthe Soviet Union, which turned down Sadat's
invitation, Carter made clear that in his view the Rus
sians cannot — and should not — be excluded from
Middle East negotiations.
Carter: tax reduction next year
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter prom
ised yesterday to push for "substantial tax reduc

tions" as soon as possible next year and said he might
delay sending complicated tax reforms to Congress
for fear that they might tie up the tax cuts.
Although Carter gave no specifics, Treasury Sec
retary Michael Blumenthal has said the administra
tion is considering tax reductions of between $15
billion and $20 billion for business and individuals.
One White House source said the tax-cut total
could go higher than $20 billion but said he would be
surprised if it went over $30 billion. This official said
no decision on the size or timing of the tax reductions
has been made.
He said those decisions were likely to come in the
next two weeks.
The official said Carter's 1978 tax proposal probably
would not include previous plans to eliminate tax
preferences on investment profits, called capital
gains, and to reduce double taxation on corporate
dividends.
Pope to receive Polish leader
Vatican City (AP) — Pope Paul VI will receive Polish
Communist leader Edward Cierek for talks today that
could boost Gierek's image at home and lead to dip
lomatic relations with the most Catholic country in
the Communist world.
During the era of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin,
Communist regimes imprisoned cardinals, tortured
priests and militantly tried to destroy religion among
the people. The "silent church" responded with de
fiance patterned on early Christian martyrs.
Roman Catholics of Eastern Europe today are free
of the more blatant forms of religious persecution,
and the change is most notable in Poland, whose 35
million people are 90 per cent Catholic.
Strangler claims tenth victim
Los Angeles (AP) — The "hillside strangler" has kil
led 10 young women so far, but police don't know
what he looks like or how he chooses his victims, the
head of the strangler task force said yesterday.
The ages of the 10 victims range from 12 to 28. All
but one were found nude. Many were sexually as
saulted.
Henderson said the victims apparently had very
little in common.
"Their only connection was that they were nude,
strangled, left in remote areas and the majority were
sexually molested," he said.
FDA lawyer bows out on ban
Washington (AP) — The new chief counsel of the
Food and Drug Administration has disqualified him
self from working on the FDA's most controversial

case — the proposed saccharin ban — for the next
year to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
Chief counsel Richard Cooper also promised not to
take part in any matters involving three major corpo
rations that have dealings with FDA and which have
been represented by his previous law firm, although
Cooper himself never represented the firms.
The three corporations are Coca Cola Co., the
country's largest producer of saccharin-sweetened
diet soft drinks; Pfizer Inc., the world's eighth largest
drug manufacturer; and Michigan Chemical Corp.,
the company that accidentally contaminated cattle
feed with the potent chemical PBB suspected of indi
rectly causing wide-spread illness among Michigan
farm families.
Cooper's actions were disclosed in a memorandum
written to his boss, HEW general counsel Peter
Libassi, following a reporter's inquiry about the new
FDA lawyer's possible conflicts of interest.
Marine major's widow files suit
Los Angeles (AP) — The widow of a U.S. Marine
Corps major filed a $1 million wrongful death suit
yesterday against the federal government and the
Veterans Administration charging her husband's
terminal cancer resulted from exposure to radiation
during government nuclear testing.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court by Alice
Patricia Broudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., alleges the
lymph cancer was the result of Charles Broudy's ex
posure to radiation during nuclear testing at Yucca
Flats, Nev., in 1957 and somewhere in the Pacific in
1948, while under orders.
Cal coach gets the axe anyway
Berkeley (AP) — University of California Coach
Mike White, whose 1977 team finished 7-4, was fired
yesterday by Athletic Director Dave Maggard who
said he felt the action was "best for the future of Cal
football."
White was told of the decision in an hour-long
meeting with Maggard, and the ousted coach met
later in the day with Cal players.
White, whose 1975 team tied UCLA for the Pacific-8
championship, had one year remaining on his con
tract and Maggard said it would be honored. Maggard
hired White, a former Cal player, as head coach in
1972.

In the basket of business schools, Harvard is no
longer the "big cheese." Stanford is. But while the
Wall Street Journal, Esquire and many other publica
tions will not let us forget it, Business School as
sociates don't take the new medal of honor with such
assurance. Faculty and students alike attest, "It's
damned hard to be so good. We have nowhere to
move but down."
In reality, it is not that simple. The Business School
is doing everything it can to keep the winning
scorecard without becoming pompous and overly
concerned, because problems are there. A careful
unraveling of the silken surface reveals threads of
discontent and uncertainty woven into the fabric of
superlatives.
"We don't like talking about being number one,"
Business School Dean Arjay Miller said. "We have
internal objectives and we aren't doing as well as
we'd like. We're not complacent. We think we can do
better, measured against our own standards. We'll
spend all day in a free-for-all, letting our hair down
and talking not only about our problems, but also
about our opportunities.
"Are we meeting our mission? There's always the
question of how to do it. We are under constant
modification, but we can never be too sure."
Foremost among the concerns of the faculty and
students of the Business School is a philosophical
question — whether the education currently pro
vided encourages creative,

~— — —
original thought. Just as there
are 305 MBAs (master of busi
ness administration candi
dates), so there are 305 diffe
rent opinions as to the proper
way to educate business stu
dents.
Some argue that the School
stresses too strongly the tradi
tional styles of analysis at the
expense of original ap
proaches to problem-solving.
These students feel they
should learn not so much how
to assess as how to devise.
Given a framework of useful
tools applicable to the man
agement world of the '70s and
coming '80s, they feel that bus
iness problems may yield more
easily to completely new solu
tions than attempts to adapt
the older, accepted or
thodoxies to changing situa
tions.
On the other side is a body of
opinion which asserts that the
proper method of business
education encourages the trad
itional, analytical approach,
that every managerial problem
can largely be solved within
this specific framework. The
combination of these two
ideologies creates tension. For
while tnose on the outside af
firm Stanford's superiority,
within, one finds this question.
As a whole students seem satis
fied with the body of know
ledge they receive. Yet, an un
dercurrent of feeling is appa
rent which betrays a concern
that the gloss of superiority

0 — —, — - ,
imposed on the business school is a screen which
hides an atrophying ideology.
When I started to explore this issue I ran into
people on all sides of vVhat I expected to be only a
two-sided coin — a right-wrong, yes-no question.
The philosophical uncertainties I uncovered reveal
the inevitable problem in assuming security and hap
piness in an institution because of an outside rating.
"This is a highly analytical environment," said sec
ond year student Ken McCormick. "They're trying to
give people analytical skills for solving problems.
Immediately there is a problem. Can you solve prob
lems in this way? Or do you solve problems by using
creativity? And then, if you answer in the affirmative,
how do you teach creativity? How do we strive for
new solution? There is a problem here — will we be
planners or will we be thinkers? This school em
phasizes efficiency, but many of the problems we'll
face in society are questions of equity. The next ques
tion then becomes, 'For whom are we solving our
problems?' Are we trying to increase dividends for
shareholders exclusively as leaders, or are we trying
to resolve social conflict?"
McCormick is far from alone in these concerns. "I
wish we would look for more alternatives," a student
who wished to remain unnamed told me. "I don't like
the concept of being given a fruitbasket and picking
which fruit I need to solve which problem."
