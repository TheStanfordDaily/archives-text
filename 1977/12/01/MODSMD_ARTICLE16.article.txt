I should start with an expla
nation. This is not an interview
with Frank Zappa. It is just a
description of an experience I
had which involved Frank
Zappa. Frank Zappa is quoted
and I am quoted, but I defi
nitely did not interview him.

The man is gifted at doing inter
views. As long as he can keep it up,
he uses them to feed his own
legend. During these mental
games of tag, if he can get across to
you that he is art egotistical,
superior, one-of-a-kind, supreme
asshole, he will have done his job.
He will have renewed his public
image and therefore increased or
maintained his popularity. That
helps him sell records.

I did hear and see Frank
Zappa play at Maples Pavilion a
week ago last Saturday night. I
had, in theory, an interview ar
ranged with Frank Zappa after
the show. As I was sitting there
listening to the music, I was
having trouble imagining my
self in a conversation with
Frank Zappa. He played with
out a shirt on but with great
energy and self-possession. I
didn't quite see how we were
going to bridge the gap bet
ween my purely passive ex
perience of Frank Zappa as a
performer and his extremely
active experience of me as a
member of his audience. I fi
gured that would have to take
care of itself.
Frank Zappa currently plays
with five other musicians, each
of whom is as sophisticated in
his own right as the two hour
aural and visual program they
presented. It was fortunate
that the stage did not start to
threaten collapse until the en
core because it would have
a pity to have missed any
part of what was an emphati
cally coherent experiential
whole. In any case, as soon as
the theatrical lights did start to
sway in time with the music,
the performers cut the perfor
mance short and with many
apologies left the stage while
there was still a stage to leave.

The show, as Zappa sees it, is one
extended composition made like a
piece of junk sculpture out of "bits
of the environment, the sound of
your transistor radio burped back at
you, a panorama of American life."

I went down to the backstage
area and asked for Phil Kauf
man. Phil Kaufman is Frank
Zappa's road manager or
someone of that general rank
and he was apparently sup
posed to escort me into Frank
Zappa's presence.
Well, no one quite seemed
to know how to deal with the
situation. The official Special-
Events type looked very con
fused when I presented myself
to him as a bonafide member

of the press with a mission. I
did appear somewhat official
and very earnest, but I was not
dressed all that well and there
were an awful lot of very un
usual not to say problematic
people floating around. Just as
an example, a girl who insists
that she has to, just has to, she
means really has to see Frank
Zappa, but who is obviously
remaining upright only by vir
tue of the road barricade
separating the rabble from the
stage and whose hair is falling
in front of her face but whose
eyes are almost completely
closed anyway — a girl like that
is really not all that easy to deal
with.
But then, I did seem rela
tively orderly, and the official
Special-Events type did seem
to sense that we were in our
respective positions only be
cause we had gone to different
organizational meetings when
we were freshmen, so off he
went to find someone who
knew what was going on or at
least who Phil Kaufman was.

Frank is probably the most creative
person on this planet. He writes
things for instruments that haven't
even been invented yet.
—Captain Beefheart, 1972

He did not come back for
five or 10 minutes and when he
did he informed me that no
such person existed. After a
brief period of indecision, the
extreme courses of action I had
been contemplating suddenly
became unnecessary: to the
corner of the barrier had step
ped a very tall, very big, very
bald black man whom I recog
nized from descriptions of
previous Frank Zappa tours as
Frank Zappa's personal body
guard.
I walked up to him and tried
to explain myself but he just
looked at me very hard from
the sides of both eyes, his face
in profile to me, and asked,
"Who set that interview up for
you?" The man was of such sta
ture that even this relatively
minor utterance gathered the
attention of everyone within 20
feet. I told him everything I
knew — that I was supposed to
come to the back stage area
and ask for Phil Kaufman —
once, twice, three times and
each time he repeated the
question, "Who set the inter
view up for you?"
Apparently being a member
of Frank Zappa's personal en
tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor
rect answer, he paused dramat
ically to survey the onlookers,
who by now were quite large in
number and were very silent,
and said, "Young man, you has
just blown yourself an inter
view, if you could have told me
that Wartoke set that interview

up for you, then you could
have had the interview."
With that he walked away
with infinite condescension. In
his wake, the attentive onlook
ers manifested two distinct
reactions. Some nodded
knowingly to themselves —
they knew all along that I was
just a bullshitter who never
had a chance and was probably
as fucked-up as the girl who
was now rocking quietly back
and forth, to all appearances
sleep; the others appeared
sympathetic, one girl even
going to the extent of saying
"Oh wo www."
I tried to smile bravely at my
supporters to let them know
they should not feel badly on
my account and started to turn
away. I was suddenly inspired
with the thought, however,
that I was embarked on my
own personal epic quest, in the
noble tradition of Jason, Arthur
and Richard the Lion-hearted.
If I just persevered a little
longer, I thought, some right
eous deity was bound to see
me through. The key to the
situation, obviously was find
ing the potentially non
existent Phil Kaufman. I turned
back to the barricade and said
to the offical Special-Events
types — all of whom avoided
my eye, saying in effect, "Why
don't you give us a break and
give up for Christ's sake," —
"Does anyone feel like going
back there and finding Phil
Kaufman for me?"
Predictably, they all chose to
defer to each other in fulfilling
my request. Even worse, the
even more official Maples-
Security-types were coming
ever closer as they shooed
everyone out of the building
who did not "belong there".
At the last possible moment,
a short older sort of show busi
ness type — loud shirt, leather
coat, pseudo-long white hair,
pink-tinted shades and a small
cigar—appeared. "Who's sup
posed to be doing the inter
view?" he asked. "Me," I said,
sticking up my hand like a
bright schoolboy. "OK, you
got a pencil, a pad, I mean are
you ready to do an interview?
Huh?" he asked. I quite obvi
ously did not have any of the
items listed but he took me at
my word anyway when I nod
ded yes. "Follow me," he said.

The LPs deliver the gospel accord
ing to Zappa, a lyricist-composer
who is, perhaps, second only to
the Beatles' John Lennon as the
leading creative talent in pop
music. Zappa's pixilated preach
ments conceal beneath their satiric
surface a frontal assault on every
aspect of conformity and deadness
- from the imitation hippie and au
tomatic hippie hater, to the plastic
Mom and Dad who founder in face
cream and liquor while discourag
ing their kids from thinking or
wanting anything better.

On our way back to the dres
sing room he explained in a
very conciliatory manner that
everyone was a little edgy be
cause the stage had almost fal
len down. We arrived at a door
which had a great number of
people outside it. He pushed
his way through and I fol
lowed. We entered a dressing
room and there sat the Frank
Zappa himself. Also present
were two reporters from a local
radio station and another one
from KSJO, a certain "Lobs
ter," the very tall black man
and finally, Mrs. Zappa, whom
I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.
—Frank Zappa, 1971

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.

He did not come back for
five or 10 minutes and when he
did he informed me that no
such person existed. After a
brief period of indecision, the
extreme courses of action I had
been contemplating suddenly
became unnecessary: to the
corner of the barrier had step
ped a very tall, very big, very
bald black man whom I recog
nized from descriptions of
previous Frank Zappa tours as
Frank Zappa's personal body
guard.
I walked up to him and tried
to explain myself but he just
looked at me very hard from
the sides of both eyes, his face
in profile to me, and asked,
"Who set that interview up for
you?" The man was of such sta
ture that even this relatively
minor utterance gathered the
attention of everyone within 20
feet. I told him everything I
knew — that I was supposed to
come to the back stage area
and ask for Phil Kaufman —
once, twice, three times and
each time he repeated the
question, "Who set the inter
view up for you?"
Apparently being a member
of Frank Zappa's personal en
tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor
rect answer, he paused dramat
ically to survey the onlookers,
who by now were quite large in
number and were very silent,
and said, "Young man, you has
just blown yourself an inter
view, if you could have told me
that Wartoke set that interview

up for you, then you could
have had the interview."
With that he walked away
with infinite condescension. In
his wake, the attentive onlook
ers manifested two distinct
reactions. Some nodded
knowingly to themselves —
they knew all along that I was
just a bullshitter who never
had a chance and was probably
as fucked-up as the girl who
was now rocking quietly back
and forth, to all appearances
sleep; the others appeared
sympathetic, one girl even
going to the extent of saying
"Oh wo www."
I tried to smile bravely at my
supporters to let them know
they should not feel badly on
my account and started to turn
away. I was suddenly inspired
with the thought, however,
that I was embarked on my
own personal epic quest, in the
noble tradition of Jason, Arthur
and Richard the Lion-hearted.
If I just persevered a little
longer, I thought, some right
eous deity was bound to see
me through. The key to the
situation, obviously was find
ing the potentially non
existent Phil Kaufman. I turned
back to the barricade and said
to the offical Special-Events
types — all of whom avoided
my eye, saying in effect, "Why
don't you give us a break and
give up for Christ's sake," —
"Does anyone feel like going
back there and finding Phil
Kaufman for me?"
Predictably, they all chose to
defer to each other in fulfilling
my request. Even worse, the
even more official Maples-
Security-types were coming
ever closer as they shooed
everyone out of the building
who did not "belong there".
At the last possible moment,
a short older sort of show busi
ness type — loud shirt, leather
coat, pseudo-long white hair,
pink-tinted shades and a small
cigar—appeared. "Who's sup
posed to be doing the inter
view?" he asked. "Me," I said,
sticking up my hand like a
bright schoolboy. "OK, you
got a pencil, a pad, I mean are
you ready to do an interview?
Huh?" he asked. I quite obvi
ously did not have any of the
items listed but he took me at
my word anyway when I nod
ded yes. "Follow me," he said.

The LPs deliver the gospel accord
ing to Zappa, a lyricist-composer
who is, perhaps, second only to

music. Zappa's pixilated preach
ments conceal beneath their satiric
surface a frontal assault on every
aspect of conformity and deadness
- from the imitation hippie and au
tomatic hippie hater, to the plastic
Mom and Dad who founder in face
cream and liquor while discourag

On our way back to the dres
sing room he explained in a
very conciliatory manner that
everyone was a little edgy be
cause the stage had almost fal
len down. We arrived at a door
which had a great number of
people outside it. He pushed
his way through and I fol
lowed. We entered a dressing
room and there sat the Frank
Zappa himself. Also present
were two reporters from a local
radio station and another one
from KSJO, a certain "Lobs
ter," the very tall black man
and finally, Mrs. Zappa, whom
I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.
—Frank Zappa, 1971

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.
—STEPrtiflN CROLIUS

I should start with an expla
nation. This is not an interview
with Frank Zappa. It is just a
description of an experience I
had which involved Frank
Zappa. Frank Zappa is quoted
and I am quoted, but I defi
nitely did not interview him.

The man is gifted at doing inter
views. As long as he can keep it up,
he uses them to feed his own
legend. During these mental
games of tag, if he can get across to
you that he is art egotistical,
superior, one-of-a-kind, supreme
asshole, he will have done his job.
He will have renewed his public
image and therefore increased or
maintained his popularity. That
helps him sell records.

I did hear and see Frank
Zappa play at Maples Pavilion a
week ago last Saturday night. I
had, in theory, an interview ar
ranged with Frank Zappa after
the show. As I was sitting there
listening to the music, I was
having trouble imagining my
self in a conversation with
Frank Zappa. He played with
out a shirt on but with great
energy and self-possession. I
didn't quite see how we were
going to bridge the gap bet
ween my purely passive ex
perience of Frank Zappa as a
performer and his extremely
active experience of me as a
member of his audience. I fi
gured that would have to take
care of itself.
Frank Zappa currently plays
with five other musicians, each
of whom is as sophisticated in
his own right as the two hour
aural and visual program they
presented. It was fortunate
that the stage did not start to
threaten collapse until the en
core because it would have
a pity to have missed any
part of what was an emphati
cally coherent experiential
whole. In any case, as soon as
the theatrical lights did start to
sway in time with the music,
the performers cut the perfor
mance short and with many
apologies left the stage while
there was still a stage to leave.

The show, as Zappa sees it, is one
extended composition made like a
piece of junk sculpture out of "bits
of the environment, the sound of
your transistor radio burped back at
you, a panorama of American life."
—Newsweek, 1%8

I went down to the backstage
area and asked for Phil Kauf
man. Phil Kaufman is Frank
Zappa's road manager or
someone of that general rank
and he was apparently sup
posed to escort me into Frank
Zappa's presence.
Well, no one quite seemed
to know how to deal with the
situation. The official Special-
Events type looked very con
fused when I presented myself
to him as a bonafide member

of the press with a mission. I
did appear somewhat official
and very earnest, but I was not
dressed all that well and there
were an awful lot of very un
usual not to say problematic
people floating around. Just as
an example, a girl who insists
that she has to, just has to, she
means really has to see Frank
Zappa, but who is obviously
remaining upright only by vir
tue of the road barricade
separating the rabble from the
stage and whose hair is falling
in front of her face but whose
eyes are almost completely
closed anyway — a girl like that
is really not all that easy to deal
with.
But then, I did seem rela
tively orderly, and the official
Special-Events type did seem
to sense that we were in our
respective positions only be
cause we had gone to different
organizational meetings when
we were freshmen, so off he
went to find someone who
knew what was going on or at
least who Phil Kaufman was.

Frank is probably the most creative
person on this planet. He writes
things for instruments that haven't
even been invented yet.

On our way back to the dres
sing room he explained in a
very conciliatory manner that
everyone was a little edgy be
cause the stage had almost fal
len down. We arrived at a door
which had a great number of
people outside it. He pushed
his way through and I fol
lowed. We entered a dressing
room and there sat the Frank
Zappa himself. Also present
were two reporters from a local
radio station and another one
from KSJO, a certain "Lobs
ter," the very tall black man
and finally, Mrs. Zappa, whom
I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.
—Frank Zappa, 1971

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.
—STEPrtiflN CROLIUS

I should start with an expla
nation. This is not an interview
with Frank Zappa. It is just a
description of an experience I
had which involved Frank
Zappa. Frank Zappa is quoted
and I am quoted, but I defi
nitely did not interview him.

The man is gifted at doing inter
views. As long as he can keep it up,
he uses them to feed his own
legend. During these mental
games of tag, if he can get across to
you that he is art egotistical,
superior, one-of-a-kind, supreme
asshole, he will have done his job.
He will have renewed his public
image and therefore increased or
maintained his popularity. That
helps him sell records.

I did hear and see Frank
Zappa play at Maples Pavilion a
week ago last Saturday night. I
had, in theory, an interview ar
ranged with Frank Zappa after
the show. As I was sitting there
listening to the music, I was
having trouble imagining my
self in a conversation with
Frank Zappa. He played with
out a shirt on but with great
energy and self-possession. I
didn't quite see how we were
going to bridge the gap bet
ween my purely passive ex
perience of Frank Zappa as a
performer and his extremely
active experience of me as a
member of his audience. I fi
gured that would have to take
care of itself.
Frank Zappa currently plays
with five other musicians, each
of whom is as sophisticated in
his own right as the two hour
aural and visual program they
presented. It was fortunate
that the stage did not start to
threaten collapse until the en
core because it would have
a pity to have missed any
part of what was an emphati
cally coherent experiential
whole. In any case, as soon as
the theatrical lights did start to
sway in time with the music,
the performers cut the perfor
mance short and with many
apologies left the stage while
there was still a stage to leave.

The show, as Zappa sees it, is one
extended composition made like a
piece of junk sculpture out of "bits
of the environment, the sound of
your transistor radio burped back at
you, a panorama of American life."
—Newsweek, 1%8

I went down to the backstage
area and asked for Phil Kauf
man. Phil Kaufman is Frank
Zappa's road manager or
someone of that general rank
and he was apparently sup
posed to escort me into Frank
Zappa's presence.
Well, no one quite seemed
to know how to deal with the
situation. The official Special-
Events type looked very con
fused when I presented myself
to him as a bonafide member

of the press with a mission. I
did appear somewhat official
and very earnest, but I was not
dressed all that well and there
were an awful lot of very un
usual not to say problematic
people floating around. Just as
an example, a girl who insists
that she has to, just has to, she
means really has to see Frank
Zappa, but who is obviously
remaining upright only by vir
tue of the road barricade
separating the rabble from the
stage and whose hair is falling
in front of her face but whose
eyes are almost completely
closed anyway — a girl like that
is really not all that easy to deal
with.
But then, I did seem rela
tively orderly, and the official
Special-Events type did seem
to sense that we were in our
respective positions only be
cause we had gone to different
organizational meetings when
we were freshmen, so off he
went to find someone who
knew what was going on or at
least who Phil Kaufman was.

Frank is probably the most creative
person on this planet. He writes
things for instruments that haven't
even been invented yet.
—Captain Beefheart, 1972

He did not come back for
five or 10 minutes and when he
did he informed me that no
such person existed. After a
brief period of indecision, the
extreme courses of action I had
been contemplating suddenly
became unnecessary: to the
corner of the barrier had step
ped a very tall, very big, very
bald black man whom I recog
nized from descriptions of
previous Frank Zappa tours as
Frank Zappa's personal body
guard.
I walked up to him and tried
to explain myself but he just
looked at me very hard from
the sides of both eyes, his face
in profile to me, and asked,
"Who set that interview up for
you?" The man was of such sta
ture that even this relatively
minor utterance gathered the
attention of everyone within 20
feet. I told him everything I
knew — that I was supposed to
come to the back stage area
and ask for Phil Kaufman —
once, twice, three times and
each time he repeated the
question, "Who set the inter
view up for you?"
Apparently being a member
of Frank Zappa's personal en
tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor
rect answer, he paused dramat
ically to survey the onlookers,
who by now were quite large in
number and were very silent,
and said, "Young man, you has
just blown yourself an inter
view, if you could have told me
that Wartoke set that interview

up for you, then you could
have had the interview."
With that he walked away
with infinite condescension. In
his wake, the attentive onlook
ers manifested two distinct
reactions. Some nodded
knowingly to themselves —
they knew all along that I was
just a bullshitter who never
had a chance and was probably
as fucked-up as the girl who
was now rocking quietly back
and forth, to all appearances
sleep; the others appeared
sympathetic, one girl even
going to the extent of saying
"Oh wo www."
I tried to smile bravely at my
supporters to let them know
they should not feel badly on
my account and started to turn
away. I was suddenly inspired
with the thought, however,
that I was embarked on my
own personal epic quest, in the
noble tradition of Jason, Arthur
and Richard the Lion-hearted.
If I just persevered a little
longer, I thought, some right
eous deity was bound to see
me through. The key to the
situation, obviously was find
ing the potentially non
existent Phil Kaufman. I turned
back to the barricade and said
to the offical Special-Events
types — all of whom avoided
my eye, saying in effect, "Why
don't you give us a break and
give up for Christ's sake," —
"Does anyone feel like going
back there and finding Phil
Kaufman for me?"
Predictably, they all chose to
defer to each other in fulfilling
my request. Even worse, the
even more official Maples-
Security-types were coming
ever closer as they shooed
everyone out of the building
who did not "belong there".
At the last possible moment,
a short older sort of show busi
ness type — loud shirt, leather
coat, pseudo-long white hair,
pink-tinted shades and a small
cigar—appeared. "Who's sup
posed to be doing the inter
view?" he asked. "Me," I said,
sticking up my hand like a
bright schoolboy. "OK, you
got a pencil, a pad, I mean are
you ready to do an interview?
Huh?" he asked. I quite obvi
ously did not have any of the
items listed but he took me at
my word anyway when I nod
ded yes. "Follow me," he said.

there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.

I should start with an expla
nation. This is not an interview
with Frank Zappa. It is just a
description of an experience I
had which involved Frank
Zappa. Frank Zappa is quoted
and I am quoted, but I defi
nitely did not interview him.

The man is gifted at doing inter
views. As long as he can keep it up,
he uses them to feed his own
legend. During these mental
games of tag, if he can get across to
you that he is art egotistical,
superior, one-of-a-kind, supreme
asshole, he will have done his job.
He will have renewed his public
image and therefore increased or
maintained his popularity. That
helps him sell records.

I did hear and see Frank
Zappa play at Maples Pavilion a
week ago last Saturday night. I
had, in theory, an interview ar
ranged with Frank Zappa after
the show. As I was sitting there
listening to the music, I was
having trouble imagining my
self in a conversation with
Frank Zappa. He played with
out a shirt on but with great
energy and self-possession. I
didn't quite see how we were
going to bridge the gap bet
ween my purely passive ex
perience of Frank Zappa as a
performer and his extremely
active experience of me as a
member of his audience. I fi
gured that would have to take
care of itself.
Frank Zappa currently plays
with five other musicians, each
of whom is as sophisticated in
his own right as the two hour
aural and visual program they
presented. It was fortunate
that the stage did not start to
threaten collapse until the en
core because it would have
a pity to have missed any
part of what was an emphati
cally coherent experiential
whole. In any case, as soon as
the theatrical lights did start to
sway in time with the music,
the performers cut the perfor
mance short and with many
apologies left the stage while
there was still a stage to leave.

The show, as Zappa sees it, is one
extended composition made like a
piece of junk sculpture out of "bits
of the environment, the sound of
your transistor radio burped back at
you, a panorama of American life."

I went down to the backstage
area and asked for Phil Kauf
man. Phil Kaufman is Frank
Zappa's road manager or
someone of that general rank
and he was apparently sup
posed to escort me into Frank
Zappa's presence.
Well, no one quite seemed
to know how to deal with the
situation. The official Special-
Events type looked very con
fused when I presented myself
to him as a bonafide member

of the press with a mission. I
did appear somewhat official
and very earnest, but I was not
dressed all that well and there
were an awful lot of very un
usual not to say problematic
people floating around. Just as
an example, a girl who insists
that she has to, just has to, she
means really has to see Frank
Zappa, but who is obviously
remaining upright only by vir
tue of the road barricade
separating the rabble from the
stage and whose hair is falling
in front of her face but whose
eyes are almost completely
closed anyway — a girl like that
is really not all that easy to deal
with.
But then, I did seem rela
tively orderly, and the official
Special-Events type did seem
to sense that we were in our
respective positions only be
cause we had gone to different
organizational meetings when
we were freshmen, so off he
went to find someone who
knew what was going on or at
least who Phil Kaufman was.

Frank is probably the most creative
person on this planet. He writes
things for instruments that haven't
even been invented yet.
—Captain Beefheart, 1972

He did not come back for
five or 10 minutes and when he
did he informed me that no
such person existed. After a
brief period of indecision, the
extreme courses of action I had
been contemplating suddenly
became unnecessary: to the
corner of the barrier had step
ped a very tall, very big, very
bald black man whom I recog
nized from descriptions of
previous Frank Zappa tours as
Frank Zappa's personal body
guard.
I walked up to him and tried
to explain myself but he just
looked at me very hard from
the sides of both eyes, his face
in profile to me, and asked,
"Who set that interview up for
you?" The man was of such sta
ture that even this relatively
minor utterance gathered the
attention of everyone within 20
feet. I told him everything I
knew — that I was supposed to
come to the back stage area
and ask for Phil Kaufman —
once, twice, three times and
each time he repeated the
question, "Who set the inter
view up for you?"
Apparently being a member
of Frank Zappa's personal en
tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor
rect answer, he paused dramat
ically to survey the onlookers,
who by now were quite large in
number and were very silent,
and said, "Young man, you has
just blown yourself an inter
view, if you could have told me
that Wartoke set that interview

up for you, then you could
have had the interview."
With that he walked away
with infinite condescension. In
his wake, the attentive onlook
ers manifested two distinct
reactions. Some nodded
knowingly to themselves —
they knew all along that I was
just a bullshitter who never
had a chance and was probably
as fucked-up as the girl who
was now rocking quietly back
and forth, to all appearances
sleep; the others appeared
sympathetic, one girl even
going to the extent of saying
"Oh wo www."
I tried to smile bravely at my
supporters to let them know
they should not feel badly on
my account and started to turn
away. I was suddenly inspired
with the thought, however,
that I was embarked on my
own personal epic quest, in the
noble tradition of Jason, Arthur
and Richard the Lion-hearted.
If I just persevered a little
longer, I thought, some right
eous deity was bound to see
me through. The key to the
situation, obviously was find
ing the potentially non
existent Phil Kaufman. I turned
back to the barricade and said
to the offical Special-Events
types — all of whom avoided
my eye, saying in effect, "Why
don't you give us a break and
give up for Christ's sake," —
"Does anyone feel like going
back there and finding Phil
Kaufman for me?"
Predictably, they all chose to
defer to each other in fulfilling
my request. Even worse, the
even more official Maples-
Security-types were coming
ever closer as they shooed
everyone out of the building
who did not "belong there".
At the last possible moment,
a short older sort of show busi
ness type — loud shirt, leather
coat, pseudo-long white hair,
pink-tinted shades and a small
cigar—appeared. "Who's sup
posed to be doing the inter
view?" he asked. "Me," I said,
sticking up my hand like a
bright schoolboy. "OK, you
got a pencil, a pad, I mean are
you ready to do an interview?
Huh?" he asked. I quite obvi
ously did not have any of the
items listed but he took me at
my word anyway when I nod
ded yes. "Follow me," he said.

The LPs deliver the gospel accord
ing to Zappa, a lyricist-composer
who is, perhaps, second only to
the Beatles' John Lennon as the
leading creative talent in pop
music. Zappa's pixilated preach
ments conceal beneath their satiric
surface a frontal assault on every
aspect of conformity and deadness
- from the imitation hippie and au
tomatic hippie hater, to the plastic
Mom and Dad who founder in face
cream and liquor while discourag
ing their kids from thinking or

On our way back to the dres
sing room he explained in a
very conciliatory manner that
everyone was a little edgy be
cause the stage had almost fal
len down. We arrived at a door
which had a great number of
people outside it. He pushed
his way through and I fol
lowed. We entered a dressing
room and there sat the Frank
Zappa himself. Also present
were two reporters from a local
radio station and another one
from KSJO, a certain "Lobs
ter," the very tall black man
and finally, Mrs. Zappa, whom
I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.
—Frank Zappa, 1971

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,

going to bridge the gap bet
ween my purely passive ex
perience of Frank Zappa as a
performer and his extremely
active experience of me as a
member of his audience. I fi
gured that would have to take
care of itself.
Frank Zappa currently plays
with five other musicians, each
of whom is as sophisticated in
his own right as the two hour
aural and visual program they
presented. It was fortunate
that the stage did not start to
threaten collapse until the en
core because it would have
a pity to have missed any
part of what was an emphati
cally coherent experiential
whole. In any case, as soon as
the theatrical lights did start to
sway in time with the music,
the performers cut the perfor
mance short and with many
apologies left the stage while
there was still a stage to leave.

The show, as Zappa sees it, is one
extended composition made like a
piece of junk sculpture out of "bits
of the environment, the sound of
your transistor radio burped back at
you, a panorama of American life."

I went down to the backstage
area and asked for Phil Kauf
man. Phil Kaufman is Frank
Zappa's road manager or
someone of that general rank
and he was apparently sup
posed to escort me into Frank
Zappa's presence.
Well, no one quite seemed
to know how to deal with the
situation. The official Special-
Events type looked very con
fused when I presented myself
to him as a bonafide member

of the press with a mission. I
did appear somewhat official
and very earnest, but I was not
dressed all that well and there
were an awful lot of very un
usual not to say problematic
people floating around. Just as
an example, a girl who insists
that she has to, just has to, she
means really has to see Frank
Zappa, but who is obviously
remaining upright only by vir
tue of the road barricade
separating the rabble from the
stage and whose hair is falling
in front of her face but whose
eyes are almost completely
closed anyway — a girl like that
is really not all that easy to deal
with.
But then, I did seem rela
tively orderly, and the official
Special-Events type did seem
to sense that we were in our
respective positions only be
cause we had gone to different
organizational meetings when
we were freshmen, so off he
went to find someone who
knew what was going on or at
least who Phil Kaufman was.

Frank is probably the most creative
person on this planet. He writes
things for instruments that haven't
even been invented yet.
—Captain Beefheart, 1972

He did not come back for
five or 10 minutes and when he
did he informed me that no
such person existed. After a
brief period of indecision, the
extreme courses of action I had
been contemplating suddenly
became unnecessary: to the
corner of the barrier had step
ped a very tall, very big, very
bald black man whom I recog
nized from descriptions of
previous Frank Zappa tours as
Frank Zappa's personal body
guard.
I walked up to him and tried
to explain myself but he just
looked at me very hard from
the sides of both eyes, his face
in profile to me, and asked,
"Who set that interview up for
you?" The man was of such sta
ture that even this relatively
minor utterance gathered the
attention of everyone within 20
feet. I told him everything I
knew — that I was supposed to
come to the back stage area
and ask for Phil Kaufman —
once, twice, three times and
each time he repeated the
question, "Who set the inter
view up for you?"
Apparently being a member
of Frank Zappa's personal en
tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor
rect answer, he paused dramat
ically to survey the onlookers,
who by now were quite large in
number and were very silent,
and said, "Young man, you has
just blown yourself an inter
view, if you could have told me
that Wartoke set that interview

up for you, then you could
have had the interview."
With that he walked away
with infinite condescension. In
his wake, the attentive onlook
ers manifested two distinct
reactions. Some nodded
knowingly to themselves —
they knew all along that I was
just a bullshitter who never
had a chance and was probably
as fucked-up as the girl who
was now rocking quietly back
and forth, to all appearances
sleep; the others appeared
sympathetic, one girl even
going to the extent of saying
"Oh wo www."
I tried to smile bravely at my
supporters to let them know
they should not feel badly on
my account and started to turn
away. I was suddenly inspired
with the thought, however,
that I was embarked on my
own personal epic quest, in the
noble tradition of Jason, Arthur
and Richard the Lion-hearted.
If I just persevered a little
longer, I thought, some right
eous deity was bound to see
me through. The key to the
situation, obviously was find
ing the potentially non
existent Phil Kaufman. I turned
back to the barricade and said
to the offical Special-Events
types — all of whom avoided
my eye, saying in effect, "Why
don't you give us a break and
give up for Christ's sake," —
"Does anyone feel like going
back there and finding Phil
Kaufman for me?"
Predictably, they all chose to
defer to each other in fulfilling
my request. Even worse, the
even more official Maples-
Security-types were coming
ever closer as they shooed
everyone out of the building
who did not "belong there".
At the last possible moment,
a short older sort of show busi
ness type — loud shirt, leather
coat, pseudo-long white hair,
pink-tinted shades and a small
cigar—appeared. "Who's sup
posed to be doing the inter
view?" he asked. "Me," I said,
sticking up my hand like a
bright schoolboy. "OK, you
got a pencil, a pad, I mean are
you ready to do an interview?
Huh?" he asked. I quite obvi
ously did not have any of the
items listed but he took me at
my word anyway when I nod
ded yes. "Follow me," he said.

The LPs deliver the gospel accord
ing to Zappa, a lyricist-composer
who is, perhaps, second only to
the Beatles' John Lennon as the
leading creative talent in pop
music. Zappa's pixilated preach
ments conceal beneath their satiric
surface a frontal assault on every
aspect of conformity and deadness
- from the imitation hippie and au
tomatic hippie hater, to the plastic
Mom and Dad who founder in face
cream and liquor while discourag
ing their kids from thinking or
wanting anything better.

On our way back to the dres
sing room he explained in a
very conciliatory manner that
everyone was a little edgy be
cause the stage had almost fal
len down. We arrived at a door
which had a great number of
people outside it. He pushed
his way through and I fol
lowed. We entered a dressing
room and there sat the Frank
Zappa himself. Also present
were two reporters from a local
radio station and another one
from KSJO, a certain "Lobs
ter," the very tall black man
and finally, Mrs. Zappa, whom
I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.
—Frank Zappa, 1971

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.
—STEPrtiflN CROLIUS

I should start with an expla
nation. This is not an interview
with Frank Zappa. It is just a
description of an experience I
had which involved Frank
Zappa. Frank Zappa is quoted
and I am quoted, but I defi
nitely did not interview him.

The man is gifted at doing inter
views. As long as he can keep it up,
he uses them to feed his own
legend. During these mental
games of tag, if he can get across to
you that he is art egotistical,
superior, one-of-a-kind, supreme
asshole, he will have done his job.
He will have renewed his public
image and therefore increased or
maintained his popularity. That
helps him sell records.

I did hear and see Frank
Zappa play at Maples Pavilion a
week ago last Saturday night. I
had, in theory, an interview ar
ranged with Frank Zappa after
the show. As I was sitting there
listening to the music, I was
having trouble imagining my
self in a conversation with
Frank Zappa. He played with
out a shirt on but with great
energy and self-possession. I
didn't quite see how we were
going to bridge the gap bet

tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor
rect answer, he paused dramat
ically to survey the onlookers,
who by now were quite large in
number and were very silent,
and said, "Young man, you has
just blown yourself an inter
view, if you could have told me
that Wartoke set that interview

up for you, then you could
have had the interview."
With that he walked away
with infinite condescension. In
his wake, the attentive onlook
ers manifested two distinct
reactions. Some nodded
knowingly to themselves —
they knew all along that I was
just a bullshitter who never
had a chance and was probably
as fucked-up as the girl who
was now rocking quietly back
and forth, to all appearances
sleep; the others appeared
sympathetic, one girl even
going to the extent of saying
"Oh wo www."
I tried to smile bravely at my
supporters to let them know
they should not feel badly on
my account and started to turn
away. I was suddenly inspired
with the thought, however,
that I was embarked on my
own personal epic quest, in the
noble tradition of Jason, Arthur
and Richard the Lion-hearted.
If I just persevered a little
longer, I thought, some right
eous deity was bound to see
me through. The key to the
situation, obviously was find
ing the potentially non
existent Phil Kaufman. I turned
back to the barricade and said
to the offical Special-Events
types — all of whom avoided
my eye, saying in effect, "Why
don't you give us a break and
give up for Christ's sake," —
"Does anyone feel like going
back there and finding Phil
Kaufman for me?"
Predictably, they all chose to
defer to each other in fulfilling
my request. Even worse, the
even more official Maples-
Security-types were coming
ever closer as they shooed
everyone out of the building
who did not "belong there".
At the last possible moment,
a short older sort of show busi
ness type — loud shirt, leather
coat, pseudo-long white hair,
pink-tinted shades and a small
cigar—appeared. "Who's sup
posed to be doing the inter
view?" he asked. "Me," I said,
sticking up my hand like a
bright schoolboy. "OK, you
got a pencil, a pad, I mean are
you ready to do an interview?
Huh?" he asked. I quite obvi
ously did not have any of the
items listed but he took me at
my word anyway when I nod
ded yes. "Follow me," he said.

On our way back to the dres
sing room he explained in a
very conciliatory manner that
everyone was a little edgy be
cause the stage had almost fal
len down. We arrived at a door
which had a great number of
people outside it. He pushed
his way through and I fol
lowed. We entered a dressing
room and there sat the Frank
Zappa himself. Also present
were two reporters from a local
radio station and another one
from KSJO, a certain "Lobs
ter," the very tall black man
and finally, Mrs. Zappa, whom
I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.
—Frank Zappa, 1971

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.
—STEPrtiflN CROLIUS

I should start with an expla
nation. This is not an interview
with Frank Zappa. It is just a
description of an experience I
had which involved Frank
Zappa. Frank Zappa is quoted
and I am quoted, but I defi
nitely did not interview him.

The man is gifted at doing inter
views. As long as he can keep it up,
he uses them to feed his own
legend. During these mental
games of tag, if he can get across to
you that he is art egotistical,
superior, one-of-a-kind, supreme
asshole, he will have done his job.
He will have renewed his public
image and therefore increased or
maintained his popularity. That
helps him sell records.

I did hear and see Frank
Zappa play at Maples Pavilion a
week ago last Saturday night. I
had, in theory, an interview ar
ranged with Frank Zappa after
the show. As I was sitting there
listening to the music, I was
having trouble imagining my
self in a conversation with
Frank Zappa. He played with
out a shirt on but with great
energy and self-possession. I
didn't quite see how we were
going to bridge the gap bet
ween my purely passive ex
perience of Frank Zappa as a
performer and his extremely
active experience of me as a
member of his audience. I fi
gured that would have to take
care of itself.
Frank Zappa currently plays
with five other musicians, each
of whom is as sophisticated in
his own right as the two hour
aural and visual program they
presented. It was fortunate
that the stage did not start to
threaten collapse until the en
core because it would have
a pity to have missed any
part of what was an emphati
cally coherent experiential
whole. In any case, as soon as
the theatrical lights did start to
sway in time with the music,
the performers cut the perfor
mance short and with many
apologies left the stage while
there was still a stage to leave.

The show, as Zappa sees it, is one
extended composition made like a
piece of junk sculpture out of "bits
of the environment, the sound of
your transistor radio burped back at
you, a panorama of American life."
—Newsweek, 1%8

I went down to the backstage
area and asked for Phil Kauf
man. Phil Kaufman is Frank
Zappa's road manager or
someone of that general rank
and he was apparently sup
posed to escort me into Frank
Zappa's presence.
Well, no one quite seemed
to know how to deal with the
situation. The official Special-
Events type looked very con
fused when I presented myself
to him as a bonafide member

of the press with a mission. I
did appear somewhat official
and very earnest, but I was not
dressed all that well and there
were an awful lot of very un
usual not to say problematic
people floating around. Just as
an example, a girl who insists
that she has to, just has to, she
means really has to see Frank
Zappa, but who is obviously
remaining upright only by vir
tue of the road barricade
separating the rabble from the
stage and whose hair is falling
in front of her face but whose
eyes are almost completely
closed anyway — a girl like that
is really not all that easy to deal
with.
But then, I did seem rela
tively orderly, and the official
Special-Events type did seem
to sense that we were in our
respective positions only be
cause we had gone to different
organizational meetings when
we were freshmen, so off he
went to find someone who
knew what was going on or at
least who Phil Kaufman was.

Frank is probably the most creative
person on this planet. He writes
things for instruments that haven't
even been invented yet.
—Captain Beefheart, 1972

He did not come back for
five or 10 minutes and when he
did he informed me that no
such person existed. After a
brief period of indecision, the
extreme courses of action I had
been contemplating suddenly
became unnecessary: to the
corner of the barrier had step
ped a very tall, very big, very
bald black man whom I recog
nized from descriptions of
previous Frank Zappa tours as
Frank Zappa's personal body
guard.
I walked up to him and tried
to explain myself but he just
looked at me very hard from
the sides of both eyes, his face
in profile to me, and asked,
"Who set that interview up for
you?" The man was of such sta
ture that even this relatively
minor utterance gathered the
attention of everyone within 20
feet. I told him everything I
knew — that I was supposed to
come to the back stage area
and ask for Phil Kaufman —
once, twice, three times and
each time he repeated the
question, "Who set the inter
view up for you?"
Apparently being a member
of Frank Zappa's personal en
tourage had taught the man a
thing or two about playing to
an audience. When I failed for
the third time to give the cor

I recognized from pictures.
Zappa was seated in the center
of the room and was clearly still
on stage, at least in his own
mind. I took a chair next to the
very tall black man and waited.
All three radio types were
asking questions in a very sin
gular manner. It was a dubious
attempt at show business pat
ter mixed with the tone and
general delivery of a top 40s
AM disc jockey. Zappa seemed
a little concerned that the au
dience had been "pissed off"
that he had cut the encore
short. He blamed it on
"schools which insist on hav
ing rock 'n roll shows in sport
ing arenas."
"Well hey," said one of the
local radio types, "that was a
really solid show. I mean I re
ally got into it. No need to
apologize for that.. .Yes sir,
really solid."
"Mr. Zappa," said the other
local radio type, posturing like
a dog who knows he should
not be begging at the dinner
table, "are you coming out
with a new album, Leather?"
"That's right," Frank
Zappa said. "It's called
'Lather.' "
The KSJO type jumped into
the awkward silence with a list
of Frank Zappa shows he had
seen complete with names,
dates and places. He was inter
rupted after about half a mi
nute by the very tall black man
who said, "'There's another
young fellow to see you,
Frank." And then to me,
"Move right up there." As I was
preparing to do so, I caught
Mrs. Zappa's eye. It was an in
advertent action yet a hearten
ing one because she seemed to
understand the impossibility of
my situation. The very tall black
man urged me again to "move
right up there and speak up,"
(making me feel like a bashful
schoolboy being cajoled by his
mother into asking the girl
down the street to go to a
church dance). Frank Zappa
dismissed the radio types with
a nod, and turning to look at
me, said "Next case."

I always felt my parents had a bor
ing life. They spent most of it
watching TV. I wanted to entertain
myself, so I steered myself in the
other direction.

"Well, I don't know," I be
gan. "Do you always com
municate like that?" I watched
him consider for just a split
second before answering, in a
tone which implied that he
thought it a very easy question,
"Yes." He was obviously lying
— there was his wife sitting
there in mute testimony to the
contrary — but I was probably
not in a position to prove that
he was. Not yet despairing
completely, though, I said,
"Well, I don't want to take up
your time."
"Well you haven't taken up
any yet, but the clock's run
ning," he said. He was leaning
toward me and looking me in
the eye with a gaze clearly in
tended to put me away com
pletely, to catch me as I was on
the ropes and to knock me out.
It very nearly did that, together
with the tension in the air —
what was happening was defi
nitely not in the script; I was
not getting into the banter. But
on a sudden inspiration I
looked back up and caught him
right in the eye when be was
not expecting it. Now I don't
expect anybody to believe me.
I'm not even sure of it myself.
But what happened was that he
held my eye for about two long
seconds and looked away.
"That's just the problem," I
said, finally able to explain my
self. "The clock's running and
I'm not into talking against
time."
"Well, that's it then," said
Frank Zappa, standing up.
Everyone in the room relaxed
when they realized I had been
dispensed with. And I can not
say that Frank Zappa did not
relax too, but I had the feeling
he was not quite sure about
something.

Half of America is under 25, yet
there is no real youth representa
tion in government. It's not my job
to organize them. The best I can
get them to do is ask a few ques
tions. If we reach a million, maybe
500 will become active and get out
and influence the opinions of
others. But those 500 qould be
dynamite. I'd be happy to have
that.
—Frank Zappa, 1969

I stood up and took a step
toward the door. Frank Zappa
stuck his hand out and said,
"That's alright, you're the kind
of journalist I like," a line defi
nitely intended to be on the
same level as a dentist addres
sing a tooth he has just pulled
which came out easily instead
of causing him and the patient
a lot of trouble. But then, there
was enough ambiguity in the
quality of the gesture that he
immediately started shaking
hands with the radio types. I
left, uncertain whether I had
won or lost or whether I just
had not played.
