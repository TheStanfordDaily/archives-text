# Too much Lelouch
## 
### 
Claude Lelouch is probably the most
"American" of the successful French
filmmakers; he makes "entertainment"
movies much like a major studio director in
Hollywood does. At their best, Lelouch's
films combine charming characters with
good plots (usually some forms of love story).
Lelouch can hardly be termed an imagina
tive director. His famous long-take "truck"
shots owe a large debt to Hitchcock, as does
his use of the "storyboard" (planning the
movie shot-by-shot before actual filming be
gins) technique. Lelouch also stays within
time-honored forms; "A Man and a Woman"
was a soft focus old-time romantic film; the
recent "Cat and Mouse" was a too frenetic
murder mystery.
"Another Man, Another Chance,"
Lelouch's newest film, is a Western set in
1870 Arizona combined with Lelouch's
metier, a love story.
In the familiar Lelouch manner, "Another
Man" recounts the tale of a man and a woman
from different backgrounds who meet and
fall in love. The man is David Williams (lames
Caan), a widowed veterinarian whose wife
was murdered by bandits. The woman is
Jeanne Leroy (Genevieve Bujold), an immig
rant Frenchwoman who fled France during
the Franco-Prussian war. She is also
widowed. Obviously, since this is a Lelouch
film, these two are destined to meet and fall
in love.
That sounds like the beginning of good,
solid entertainment. But "Another Man"

never lives up to this expectation. The blame
for this goes entirely to director Lelouch,
who also wrote the screenplay.
While "Cat and Mouse" suffered from lack
of cohesion and planning, "Another Man"
suffers from over-direction. Lelouch has ev
erything so planned in this film that he stifles
it. Sydney Pollack made a similar mistake in
"Bobby Deerfield," and while this film isn't
as bad as "Deerfield," it suffers from the
same loss of energy and emotion that both
films so desperately need.
Caan and Bujold's performances are cases
in point. These two should work well to
gether, but the sparks never fly. They manage
some good moments (particularly in a picnic
scene where Bujold attempts to teach Caan
some French), but their performances are
never allowed to break free from Lelouch's
firm directorial hand.
Lelouch has spent more money and time
on this film than any of his previous works.
Technically, it shows, but Lelouch seems to
get so enamored of all his technique, that he
forgets the necessary component for a good
entertainment film: the well-defined, identi
fiable characters to which the audience can
respond. The great "entertainment" direc
tors like Howard Hawks and John Ford always
remembered this. Claude Lelouch is not in
the same class as these two directors, and as
long as he continues to produce "entertain
ments," he can't do any better than to follow
their examples.
