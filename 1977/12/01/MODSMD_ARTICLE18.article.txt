# Singing along with a 'transvestite from Transylvania'
## 
### 
An hour and a half before the
midnight show, a line is form
ing outside San Francisco's
Strand Theater on Market
Street. Young men in sequined
heels and dresses, young
women in pancake makeup,
blue-jeaned teenyboppers
passing cheap wine: they're
waiting for the Saturday night
event.
Theater co-owner Mike
Thomas surveys the scene.
"This is mild compared to last
week," he says. "But this film
always brings out a lively
crowd."
The film is "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show," a musical
comedy about two Ike-age kids
confronted with the decadent
morality of the 70s in the form
of ghoulish transvestites from
outer space. Calling it bizarre is
like calling the Grand Canyon
big. It's very . . . different.
"It's the greatest film I've

ever seen, no doubt about it,"
says 22-year-old mechanic
John Cox. Cox stands at the
head of the line with a prop
rietary air, arms folded, chat
ting with fellow "Rocky Hor
ror" afficionados. "I've seen it
249 times," he boasts. "No
body else comes close to that
number. I know it by heart."
"Rocky Horror" had its ori
gins as a play in June, 1973 at
London's experimental
Theatre Upstairs. Productions
were later put on in Los
Angeles and New Vork, and
filming of the musical began in
October, 1974. The film's been
the Saturday midnight feature
at the Strand since Aug. 13;
prior to that it had a year run at
the nearby Powell Street
Cinema.
Actually, the "Rocky Horror"
habitues are more than cul
tists; they're fanatics.
"This tilm gets me through

the week," intones a green
haired girl. "You should have
seen the stage production,
darling," replies her friend, a
man in a brown plaid dress.
The 40 degree temperature and
brisk wind don't seem to cool
their enthusiasm.
A young man and young
woman wearing matching satin
jackets amble closer to the box
office. "We met at this movie in
July at the Powell Cinema. Isn't
that romantic?"
The crowd is swelling and
growing restive. It's close to
midnight.
The theater doors
swing open and there's a rush
past the ticket-takers for the
best seats. This isn't a typical
trip to your friendly neighbor
hood theater; it's closer to a
pilgrimage to Mecca.
The anticipation grows
through the "Betty Boop" car
toon and the "Little Rascals"
short. By the time "The Rocky
Horror Picture Show" comes
on, the applause and howls of
approval are overwhelming.
When Tim Curry, the film's
star, first appears in drag as the
mad Dr. Frank 'N' Furter and
sneers, "I'm just a sweet trans
vestite from transsssssexual

Transylvania," the audience
sings along en masse.
A pastiche parodying every
Hollywood "B" horror and sci
ence fiction film ever made,
the story is replete with hun
chbacked butler, eerie castle,
Frankenstein creations, a
crazed scientist, death ray
guns, space suits and two in
credulous innocents.
The Horrorites scream, sing,
stamp their feet and feed lines
to augment the action. Audi
ence and screen fuse in ebul
lient camaraderie. When the

Mm ends, the management
gratuitously replays choice
scenes.
By 2 a.m., it's all over. The
audience spills out onto Mar
ket Street and disperses
quickly. The devotees disap
pear until next Saturday, when
they'll be back for their dose of
vicarious decadence. They
know"The Rocky Horror Pic
ture Show" won't be on televi
sion any time soon, and, be
sides, waiting in line at the
Strand is half the fun.
