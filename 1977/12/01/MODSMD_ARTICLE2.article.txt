Reoccupation delayed
The reoccupation of the Old Pavilion by Personnel
Offices has been put back one week until Dec. 12 due
to late delivery of fans needed for heating and ventila
tion, according to lan Anderson of the personnel
department.
During the move, personnel services will not be
available.
Correction
A Daily article yesterday incorrectly stated that a
gay student was responsible for an incident involving
the destruction of a large number of copies of the
latest issue of the Real News, protesting an anti-gay
column in the publication.

The individual involved was not a student here
