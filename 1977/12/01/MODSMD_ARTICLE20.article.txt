# Horrible 'Heroes'
## 
### 
"Heroes," a film directed by
Jeremy Kagan and starring
Henry Winkler and Sally Field,
is a pseudo-realistic attempt to
portray the inner conflicts of a
young Vietnam War veteran
named Jack Dunne. Early in the
story Dunne (Winkler) suc
cessfully escapes from the
mental ward of a New York
V.A. hospital and embarks on
the road across the country to
seek out several of his "war
buddies." Dunne is portrayed
as a very insecure and paranoid
person. Although the war had
been over for a number of
years, the only reality Dunne
could face was that of the war.
He had no link with the present
world and his constant search
for other veteran friends
exhibits his reluctance to grasp
any aspect of the real world.
Winkler fails tremendously
in his first attempt to play any
role other than that of "the
Fonz." The deified image of
the Fonz, characterized by his
unusual mannerisms, vocal
tone and "coolness," lends it
self well to a situation comedy
show like "Happy Days" but
the role of Jack Dunne in
"Heroes" requires a more
serious and versatile perfor
mance.
It is doubtful, however, that
even a more competent actor
could change the overall effect
of "Heroes." One obvious fal
lacy in the film is the portrayal
of all the Vietnam veterans as
either mentally deranged or
socially unfit. Certainly, the
war in Vietnam was a difficult
and traumatic experience for
those involved but such a
generalization is uncalled for

and hardly justifiable.
The movie is supposed to be
a drama but because of events
like the scene in the restaurant
when Carol (Field) is left re
sponsible for the damage
caused by Jack, the movie
tends to take on comic over
tones. This tendency nullifies
several fine performances by
Sally Field such as the sequ
ence when she is telling her
fiance that she can't marry him.
The viewer is unable to identify
emotionally with Carol be
cause up to that point the seri
ousness had been taken out of
the film.
Another factor contributing
to the lack of effectiveness of
"Heroes" is its delay in iden
tifying itself with the viewer.
The main objective of the film
is obscured almost through
out. It is only Jack's bloody and
painful flashback of the war
during the last 10 minutes of
the film that the meaning be
comes concise and clear.
Kagan's use of the film
medium is ineffective, void of
imagination and originality and
lacking in style.
"Heroes" is boring. The dis
continuity and seemingly illog
ical sequence made me con*
tinually ask myself "when is
this movie going to end?" I felt
cheated when it finally did.
During this time, when it is be
coming increasingly difficult to
find a film which can truly be
considered a work of art,
"Heroes" joins the vast
number which can't and serves
only to embarrass the movie
industry and to further flood
the market with worthless
films. -ERIK CLEAGE
