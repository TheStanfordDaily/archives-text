# Ducloux bringing the artist in
## 
### 
I first glimpsed Dr. Walter Ducloux while he was at work
with the Stanford Chamber Orchestra. Guiding the ensemble
with pinpoint accuracy, tremendous energy and painstaking
carefulness of interpretation, he seemed at home amidst the
performing students and the music of Mendelssohn.
Ducloux, the new resident conductor of the Stanford sym
phony, is indeed a musician, conductor, teacher and, in his
own words, "a missionary" to the music department at Stan
ford. He will be conductor of the Stanford Symphony for one
year, after which he will return to the University of Texas at
Austin to assume his position as operatic conductor.
Assuming one of the most prominent positions in Stanford's
music department, Ducloux seems to enjoy his job. A conduc
tor by trade, he is interested in bringing all types of music to
the Stanford community. His fundamental goal is to serve as a
teacher, "bringing forth his experiences" to the students he
teaches and conducts. Indeed, he represents a great deal of
enthusiasm which he willingly shares with the musicians at
Stanford.
Music, to Ducloux, is not a passive experience; rather it is a
direct involvement with creativity. As he says, "In all of us
there is an artist to be found." Watching him with his students,
one readily discovers his desire to share and bring forth a love
of music in each player he conducts. Pointing to an offbeat
woodwind, hushing a boisterous string section, or talking with
a bass player after rehearsal, Ducloux exerts his judgment on
all those who come in contact with him.
One of his central goals is to bring classical music to the
many Stamford students who identify only with pop music. By
increasing exposure (through concerts for instance) to music,
he hopes to create further involvement of Stanford students
and the Stanford community. Terming most AM pop tunes as
"carefully calculated trash," Ducloux advocates bringing the
music of Beethoven and Mozart back. With his optimism,
success may be possible.
In addition to a purely musical existence, Ducloux finds
Stanford to be "an amazing university; a very beautiful cam
pus." Hopefully, with a little openmindedness, many Stanford
redhots may skip a certain Friday night study to hear the new
conductor. It will be well worth their time. Dudjux has
brought together a group of talented students and his con
certs are a welcome addition to Stanford.
