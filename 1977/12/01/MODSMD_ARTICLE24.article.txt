# Triumph in bronze
## 
### 
The Triumph of Humanism
show at the Palace of the Leg
ion of Honor in San Francisco
might better be called the
triumph of the metalsmith.
Nearly 300 objects from the
"minor" arts are on display.
The excellent bronze work
challenges the use of minor as
a pejorative.
The show provides an un
usual look at the private life
and habits of the Renaissance
man. The term Renaissance
almost immediately brings to
mind Michelangelo or
Leonardo when considering
the arts, but there was a classi
cal revival and enrichment of

all arts in that era of self
conscious modernity. Artists
and writers viewed the
medieval period as the dark
ages, and looked to the pre-
Christian civilizations for mod
els.
The humanist scholars, who
developed a school of thought
integrating the philosophy,
science arid aesthetics of the
classical world with Christian
concepts, were influential in
promoting a similar cross
fertilization of pagan and
Christian art. Young artists
began study of the antiques —
the marble and bronze statues
and architectural ruins of the

Greeks and Imperial Romans
— as a foundation fortheir own
compositions. The ancient ca
nons of beauty — order, clarity
and naturalism of the figure —
were approached with a scien
tific knowledge of optics,
perspective and anatomy in
addition to improved artists'
materials.
Renaissance demands for art
work came from private per
sons as well as the church and
state. Humanist collectors,
powerful patrician families and
rich merchant bankers pat
ronized goldsmiths, commis
sioning commemorative
pieces or works of pure fancy
and flattery.
Objects included inkwells,
doorknockers, salt cellars,
clocks, compasses, pendants,
coins and statuettes. Their de
sign reflected both the influx of
classical motifs and the per
sonal taste of the patron.
The true function of
these pieces was as a status
symbol; they reflected the
wealth, education and refined
taste of the owner.
The scientific instruments
were informative as well as
beautiful. Renaissance artists
combined a somewhat
medieval and superstitious im
agination with the scientifically
derived laws of proportion and
perspective to decorate these
objects used in an increasingly

sophisticated technology.
Glassware and carved wood
furniture also reflected imagi
nation wedded with
craftsmanship. Ceramics, ar
mor, manuscripts, lace and
tapestries are also displayed.
A humorous sidelight to this
show was provided by the dis
play of Stan Washburn's etch
ings in conjunction with a
show of 16th century Northern
European prints. Both shows
were located in the basement
galleries.
Washburn is a contemporary
printmaker who uses the
stylized lines and linear
perspective of the Renaissance
etchers for modern versions of
Biblical and mythological tales.
He created a series which gave
the truthful account of how St.
George slew the dragon, and
filled other compositions with
beasts and phantoms that must
have inhabited the attic of
some medieval alchemist.
Along with the fine parody,
these two shows provide the
opportunity to study classics of
the Renaissance printmakers,
most notably Albrecht Durer. It
gave an added dimension to
the Humanism show.
