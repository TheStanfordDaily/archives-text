# Women poets speak through 'Other Voice'
## 
### 
The Other Voice:
Twentieth-Century Women's
Poetry in Translation, by
Joanna Bankier, Carol Cos
man, Doris Earnshaw, Joan
Keefe, Deirdre Lashgari,
Kathleen Weaver.
(Norton 218 pages, $10
cloth, $3.95 paper.)
"The Other Voice" is a
small volume of 20th cen
tury women's poetry in
translation. I say small, be
cause there is so much
poetry by women that a
good sampling would
amount to possibly 10 times
what is presented by these
editors. The majority of the
poems are in English for the
first time, representing 38
countries and 31 languages.
Adrienne Rich has written
an excellent, enlightening
preface, and there are 19
pages of notes and biog
raphies, including a
selected bibliography at the
end. An interesting side
note is that all translations
were made by Bay Area

people, and edited by six
Bay Area women.
Women writing about
women in a feminist way is
obviously not the new
phenomenon that we think
it is. For instance, one of my
particular favorites, "A
Sword," was written by
Karin Boye (Sweden) who
died in 1941:
A sword
flexible, supple and strong
a dancing sword
proudly obeying the stern
laws
the hard rhythms in the
steel.
A Sword
I wanted to be - soul and
body.
I hate
this wretched willow soul of
mine,
patiently enduring, plaited
or twisted
by other hands.
I hate you
my lazy, dreamy soul.
You shall die.

Help me, my hate, sister of
my longing
Help me be
a sword,
a dancing sword of tem
pered steel.
The poems are divided
into five sections, each a
mini-chronicle of experi
ences common to women.
Exploring the roots of a cul
tural past, the poems ad
vance to an ever-widening
scope of vision and change.
Eeva-Liisa Manner (Finland)
says: "Nothing is dead./
Waves roll in the stones,/ a
wind and a tempest blow in
the atoms./ The harness is
loosened, and the move
ment, and the/ strength./
. . . Worlds are prepared."
The common de
nominator fusing these
poets into a comprehensi
ble whole is their separate
strength and self-trust.
Their individualism forges
new bonds of love and
hope while shattering the
barriers of language, cul

ture and politics. Through
poetry, they strive to re
create a vital link between
women and restore the
human element between
the sexes.
There is often an uncon
scious tendency to see
women as being women
first, and human second, as
if it were a generous after
thought.

It is important that
women establish networks
of communication for
themselves — channels in
which they can hear and
speak to each other openly.
This anthology is one clear
channel more, and a beauti
ful example of what women
have always managed to ac
complish, even in isolation.

human element between
the sexes.
There is often an uncon
scious tendency to see
women as being women
first, and human second, as
if it were a generous after
thought.

It is important that
women establish networks
of communication for
themselves — channels in
which they can hear and
speak to each other openly.
This anthology is one clear
channel more, and a beauti
ful example of what women
have always managed to ac
complish, even in isolation.

The Other Voice:
Twentieth-Century Women's
Poetry in Translation, by
Joanna Bankier, Carol Cos
man, Doris Earnshaw, Joan
Keefe, Deirdre Lashgari,
Kathleen Weaver.
(Norton 218 pages, $10
cloth, $3.95 paper.)
"The Other Voice" is a
small volume of 20th cen
tury women's poetry in
translation. I say small, be
cause there is so much
poetry by women that a
good sampling would
amount to possibly 10 times
what is presented by these
editors. The majority of the
poems are in English for the
first time, representing 38
countries and 31 languages.
Adrienne Rich has written
an excellent, enlightening
preface, and there are 19
pages of notes and biog
raphies, including a
selected bibliography at the
end. An interesting side
note is that all translations
were made by Bay Area

people, and edited by six
Bay Area women.
Women writing about
women in a feminist way is
obviously not the new
phenomenon that we think
it is. For instance, one of my
particular favorites, "A
Sword," was written by
Karin Boye (Sweden) who
died in 1941:
A sword
flexible, supple and strong
a dancing sword
proudly obeying the stern
laws
the hard rhythms in the
steel.
A Sword
I wanted to be - soul and
body.
I hate
this wretched willow soul of
mine,
patiently enduring, plaited
or twisted
by other hands.
I hate you
my lazy, dreamy soul.
You shall die.

Help me, my hate, sister of
my longing
Help me be
a sword,
a dancing sword of tem
pered steel.
The poems are divided
into five sections, each a
mini-chronicle of experi
ences common to women.
Exploring the roots of a cul
tural past, the poems ad
vance to an ever-widening
scope of vision and change.
Eeva-Liisa Manner (Finland)
says: "Nothing is dead./
Waves roll in the stones,/ a
wind and a tempest blow in
the atoms./ The harness is
loosened, and the move
ment, and the/ strength./
. . . Worlds are prepared."
The common de
nominator fusing these
poets into a comprehensi
ble whole is their separate
strength and self-trust.
Their individualism forges
new bonds of love and
hope while shattering the
barriers of language, cul

ture and politics. Through
poetry, they strive to re
create a vital link between
women and restore the
human element between
the sexes.
There is often an uncon
scious tendency to see
women as being women
first, and human second, as
if it were a generous after
thought.
