# Flying and dying in 'Solomon'

### 
Song of Solomon, by Toni
Morrison (Knopf, 337 pages,
$8.95.)
"Song of Solomon" begins
and ends with a man taking
flight, literally and figuratively,
from this world. Neither the in
itial nor the final leap into the
air suggests a negative out
come, such as suicide or
death; instead, they are por
trayed as a release. Release
from a tightly-coiled life and
surrender to the unknown give
positive energy to both Mr.
Smith, the insurance agent,
and to 'Milkman' Dead, the
protagonist. Between the two
leaps, Toni Morrison weaves a
fine tale of somber tone, filled
with dying or dead people
slowly acting out their lives.
The epigraph provides the
key to this dense novel:
The fathers may soar
And the children may know
their names.
The black experience in
America, particularly until the
mid-19605, can be charac
terized as a flight — a flight
from slavery, flight from an
alien, superimposed culture,
flight from the South, a flight
from self ("passing"), and,
with respect to many black
men, a flight from domestic life
with its trappings of a new form
of slavery. Where do the men
flee? It doesn't matter that they
die in the novel, for they leave
behind their dead, no-end
lives once they perceive that
flight is possible.
The black women left behind
memorialize the love felt for
their men, both fathers and

lovers. This characteristic of
the black women is constant
throughout the novel, regard
less of whether the woman is
strong, like Pilate, or weak, like
Ruth and Hagar. Thus, the con
tinuity of the spirit of this love
is immortalized in song and in
stories. The song of
Sugarman/Solomon sung by Pi
late at Mr. Smith's leap and the
round-game sung by the chil
dren in Shalimar insures that
the descendants of Solomon,
like Milkman himself, will
know the story of Solomon
long after he has gone.
This is more than a black ex
perience. Morrison deftly in
forms the reader that her novei
is peculiarly American. The
sharp visual symbolism early in
the tale — the red, white and
blue of the red velvet roses fal
len on the white snow when
Rose Dead glimpses the blue
wings of Mr. Smith just prior to
his leap — emphasizes that
these characters and events are
American. The black and the
American experience are suc
cessfully integrated in two in
stances. Mr. Smith works for
North Carolina Mutual Life In
surance Company, the largest
black-owned insurance com
pany in the nation and one of
the earliest "success" stories
for blacks. Macon Dead,
Milkman's father, is a success
ful real estate investor, who
earns his living in the black
ghetto by being a businessman
in the harsh, American style.
These two examples portray
the lack of humanity that can
occur between blacks when

the dominant culture is suc
cessfully copied. A more chil
ling example of blacks mimick
ing white Americans is por
trayed in Milkman's friend
Guitar and the "Seven Days"
group, which kills a white child
or adult for every black mur
dered in the South.
Milkman internally ques
tions the tactics of Guitar and
of his father, but he is unable to
affirmatively proceed on his
own until he travels to the
home of his ancestors. The
period of Milkman's life, from
the Depression to the early
1960s, chronicles an era in the
black experience. This period
witnessed the rise and aspira
tion of blacks into the
mainstream of American
middle-class society. But the
tactic of emphasizing white
ness and ignoring the
strengths in the black culture
dooms those who make the
transition to failure. Thus
Milkman's leap at the end of
the novel represents a rejec
tion of the values he has
learned and heralds a new
black consciousness for the fu
ture.

Song of Solomon, by Toni
Morrison (Knopf, 337 pages,
$8.95.)
"Song of Solomon" begins
and ends with a man taking
flight, literally and figuratively,
from this world. Neither the in
itial nor the final leap into the
air suggests a negative out
come, such as suicide or
death; instead, they are por
trayed as a release. Release
from a tightly-coiled life and
surrender to the unknown give
positive energy to both Mr.
Smith, the insurance agent,
and to 'Milkman' Dead, the
protagonist. Between the two
leaps, Toni Morrison weaves a
fine tale of somber tone, filled
with dying or dead people
slowly acting out their lives.
The epigraph provides the
key to this dense novel:
The fathers may soar
And the children may know
their names.
The black experience in
America, particularly until the
mid-19605, can be charac
terized as a flight — a flight
from slavery, flight from an
alien, superimposed culture,
flight from the South, a flight
from self ("passing"), and,
with respect to many black
men, a flight from domestic life
with its trappings of a new form
of slavery. Where do the men
flee? It doesn't matter that they
die in the novel, for they leave
behind their dead, no-end
lives once they perceive that
flight is possible.
The black women left behind
memorialize the love felt for
their men, both fathers and

lovers. This characteristic of
the black women is constant
throughout the novel, regard
less of whether the woman is
strong, like Pilate, or weak, like
Ruth and Hagar. Thus, the con
tinuity of the spirit of this love
is immortalized in song and in
stories. The song of
Sugarman/Solomon sung by Pi
late at Mr. Smith's leap and the
round-game sung by the chil
dren in Shalimar insures that
the descendants of Solomon,
like Milkman himself, will
know the story of Solomon
long after he has gone.
This is more than a black ex
perience. Morrison deftly in
forms the reader that her novei
is peculiarly American. The
sharp visual symbolism early in
the tale — the red, white and
blue of the red velvet roses fal
len on the white snow when
Rose Dead glimpses the blue
wings of Mr. Smith just prior to
his leap — emphasizes that
these characters and events are
American. The black and the
American experience are suc
cessfully integrated in two in
stances. Mr. Smith works for
North Carolina Mutual Life In
surance Company, the largest
black-owned insurance com
pany in the nation and one of
the earliest "success" stories
for blacks. Macon Dead,
Milkman's father, is a success
ful real estate investor, who
earns his living in the black
ghetto by being a businessman
in the harsh, American style.
These two examples portray
the lack of humanity that can
occur between blacks when

the dominant culture is suc
cessfully copied. A more chil
ling example of blacks mimick
