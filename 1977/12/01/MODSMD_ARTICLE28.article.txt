The Consul's File, by Paul Theroux. (Houghton Mifflin,
209 pages, $8.95.)
The gift of a good storyteller is the ability to create illu
sions. In "The Consul's File," the storyteller exposes the
illusions people live by and, in the process, says something
about the art of storytelling itself.
The anonymous American Consul is sent to the Malay
sian village of Ayer Hitam on a non-mission: to close the
consulate which is no longer needed, due to the departure
of American commercial interests. He has been told that
everything he needs to know is contained in the consulate's
files. Yet an examination of the papers reveals they are
blank and he is forced to create a reason for being there.
This central mystery is the first of 20 stories which concern
the mysteries, or secrets, harbored by the characters.
The characters of the Consul's tales are the inhabitants of
Ayer Hitam and the surrounding area. A self-styled expat
riate, he finds himself in a colony of British exiles who are
prolonging the life of the Empire- in their Club. Even the
American embassy representative who introduces him re
grets the loss of Kiplingesque romance, by which he means
the romance of imperialism, in the Far East. The irony of the
Consul's non-mission is underscored by his reference to
the American withdrawal from Malaysia as a "recessional."
This odd, yet carefully chosen designation echoes Kipling's
poem of that name which foreshadowed the sun setting on
the British' Empire.
In the Club, the interdependency fostered in a society of
exiles is strained by a form of territorial imperative, shrunk
from the Empire's to the individual's dimensions.
Native superstition contributes a mysterious at
mosphere to these stories, as potent as the bat-stink of the
midnight horror tree. Theroux manipulates this use of the
supernatural with unnerving skill, and produces in several
cases a good old-fashioned ghost or detective story. In
many tales, though, the supernatural exposes the futility of
an individual's illusion.
Despite the suspense and exoticism of these stories the
characters remain arid and flat. Partly this is due to the
narrator who is, in Graham Greene's phrase, "a burnt-out
case." Yet compared to Greene's disillusioned heroes, for
whom the fire of internal conflict never really goes out, the
Consul's emotional autonomy is neat and cerebral. In
another post, he tells us, he would have taken a native
mistress but in Ayer Hitam he decides to write in order to
preserve his experience there. A dead soul himself, he
perceives others with a cynicism that preserves them like
formaldehyde. Theroux's point of view does not prevent
him from constructing well-made stories, but they are con
structs that ultimately engage the intellect more than the
imagination.
