Solstice Sound and Shadows
Ralph Towner: ECM Records
During the past several years, Ralph
Towner has emerged as one of the most ver
satile and original musicians in jazz. Actually,
here, the word "jazz" must be used loosely;
like so many other ECM artists, Towner's
music frequently goes beyond what is con
ventionally thought of as jazz.
Towner's music, for one, has the austerity
and directness of purpose one usually as
sociates with the classical genre. Towner av
oids the easy resolution, the flamboyant
climax and repetitiveness which plagues
much of modern jazz.
Although Towner's albums with the excep
tional group Oregon are generally excellent,
his work with the ECM label has been more
personal. The emphasis in Oregon has al
ways been or the group as a whole, while
Towner's other albums have allowed him to
be more individual.
I mentioned above that Towner is a ver
satile artist. This applies not only to his ap
proach to music, but to his technical abilities
as well. On "Solstice Sound and Shadow,"
Towner plays, in addition to his guitar, the
French horn and piano with impressive facil
ity.
Interestingly, Towner's supporting musi
cians are all Europeans. Jan Garbarek plays
quite well on the soprano and tenor
saxophones while Eberhard Weber and Jon
Christensen are rather subdued on bass and
drums respectively.
Garbarek has emerged as one of the most
successful of the European jazz musicians,
and has hopefully helped disprove the ab
surd, yet persistent belief that only Ameri
cans can play jazz. In fact the ECM label,
perhaps the most important record company
in jazz today, is located in Germany and re
cruits its musicians without distinction from
both sides of the Atlantic.
Unlike many Europeans, Garbarek has de

veloped a very individualized style. Although
he cites Coltrane as a major influence, his
own music is more relaxed and, dare I say it,
more melodic than that of Coltrane. He
works quite well with the native American
Towner.
Towner will be playing with John Aber
crombie at the Great American Music Hall in
the near future, while Garbarek is presently
touring with Keith Jarrett.
Guar a be
Cai Tjader: Fantasy Records
Over the years the Bay Area has been the
home of several excellent local musicians
who never received the national attention
they merited. Names such as Vince Guar
daldi, Cal Tjader and Denny Zeitlin come
readily to mind, while another San Francis
can, young Mark Levine is trying at present to
boost himself from iocal to widespread fame.
It seems now that one of these locals, Cal
Tjader, is possibly on the verge of becoming
widely known. His latest album, "Guarabe,"
has the advantage of being accessible and
backed by a major company, Fantasy Re
cords.
One could generalize, without being far
off, that Cal Tjader is the Chick Corea of the
vibraharp; his music has very definite Latin
influences yet remains distinctly a part of the
jazz tradition. The combination of styles is
done, as with Corea, tastefully and with a
mind to popular tastes.
One of the highlights of the album is the
playing of the surprisingly unpublicized
Clare Fischer on acoustic and electric piano.
Tjader allows his supporting musicians
plenty of chances to solo and they use it well.
Another attractive feature of Tjader's play
ing is his use of the generally neglected
marimba. As a whole, his playing is tight and
effective and, hopefully, an indication of
things to come.
