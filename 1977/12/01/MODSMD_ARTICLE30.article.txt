## Queen's 'News' 
### 
Queen
News of the World
Elektra
On this album, Queen — John Deacon, Brian May, Fred
die Mercury, and Roger Taylor — makes a radical departure
from the path towards commercialism and accessibility
which it has followed on its previous five albums. This
album still contains its share of songs in the inimitable
Queen style, "All Dead" is a pretty ballad with a passage of
Queen's typical guitar orchestration. "It's Late" and
"Spread Your Wings" resemble material from the album
that launched Queen to stardom, "Sheer Heart Attack."
And of course there is the hit, "We are the Champions,"
one of Queen's best and catchiest tunes to date.
But nearly half the album is devoted to high energy rock
of a more primitively raw type th~n Queen has ever pro
duced. "Get Down, Make Love" has the chunky beat of
"White Man" from the "A Day at the Races" album, but
none of the creativeness of the lyrics from that song. "Fight
from the Inside" and "Sheer Heart Attack" are primarily
electric guitar/electronics showcases. Finally, there is "We
Will Rock You," a number whose only accompaniment is
hand clapping and a bit of guitar at the end, and which Brian
May said was written to get more audience involvement at
concerts. Perhaps it is powerful in concert, but the studio
version is certainly not powerful enough to successfully
open up the album, a position it occupies nonetheless.
In all, much of "News of the World" lacks both the polish
and complex arrangements of Queen's earlier material
(perhaps this could be expected, considering the short
eight week period taken to record the entire album), but as
a first attempt at a new style, Queen has turned out a
respectable album; an album that will direct some people
away from Queen, and an album that will most certainly win
many people over to Queen's camp.
Seals and Crofts
Seals and Crofts Sing the Songs from 'One on One'
Warner Brothers
Generally, the problem with soundtracks is that they
have perhaps four or five original songs, and then numer
ous variations on those songs. This soundtrack album from
the film, "One on One," is no exception. Along with "The
Love Theme (My Fair Share)," which has received much
airplay, there are four other original vocal numbers and a
number of instrumentals, most of which are variations on
the vocals.
The vocal numbers are excellent, however. Seals and
Crofts' tight harmonies, combined with the immense musi
cal talents of Charles Fox (who wrote the music) and Paul
Williams (who wrote the lyrics) havecreated songs which, if
perhaps a bit trite, describe things we all feel, or would like
to feel (from the happy defiance of "John Wayne" to the
obvious message of "Love Conquers All"). In addition,
these are songs we can listen to without being either bored
to sleep or shocked out of our seats. Though an added
meaning is given to both vocals and instrumentals for those
who have seen the film, this album makes pleasant listening
for anyone. —DAVE PEARLMAN
