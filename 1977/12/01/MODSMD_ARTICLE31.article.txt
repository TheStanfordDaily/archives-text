# Rating Tahoe dinner shows
## 
### 
The snow-covered Sierras
turn pink beneath the sinking
sun. Cradled in these moun
tains, 1000 feet below you, a
midnight blue lake slumbers.
You ride the tram down the
face of Heavenly Valley Ski Re
sort and head for the lodge.
You're ready for a night of fun
at Lake Tahoe, "America's
year-round playground." But
what's there to do after a day of
skiing?
There's cocktail shows, dis
cos, blackjack, slot machines
. . . if you're over 21, that is.
For those who are not seen as
adults by the state of Nevada,
nightlife becomes illegal or ex
tremely limited. But save the
"Star Wars" reruns for Palo
Alto. You still can enjoy one
aspect of casino entertain
ment.
Be a bit extravagant and
check out the dinner shows.
Whether you choose Del
Webb's Sahara or Harrah's, the
South Shore's largest casinos,
you're sure to end up with
good entertainment and good
food.
Del Webb's Sahara
Follow the tuxedoed maitre
d' into a large room that re
sembles a movie theater, ex
cept that many of the chairs
have been replaced with din
ing tables. People of various
ages are in all styles of dress,
from satin evening gowns to
Levi's pantsuits. When the
maitre d' hands you the menu,
you may suffer a mild shock.
But, remember, the show cost
is included in the dinner
prices. Waiters and waitresses
pamper you for two hours,
serving an excellent mutli
course meal. Then, at 8:15, the
lights dim and the featured en
tertainment begins. By 10,
you're back on the gambling
floor or at the lodge, ready for

another day of skiing.
The High Sierra Theatre in
the Sahara may not have the
elegance of the finer Vegas
showrooms, but it is an attrac
tive, comfortable theater, with
modern lighting and high
acoustic quality. It has featured
groups such as Seals and Crofts
and America, a desirable shift
from the "Big Name Nightclub
Entertainers" found in most
Reno or Vegas showrooms.
The closeness of audience to
performers creates an intimacy
not found at most rock con
certs.
Dinners in the High Sierra
Theatre are akin to what you
could find at San Francisco's
most eiegant restaurants.
Teriyaki chicken brochette and
sirloin steak are $15, the most
reasonable items on the menu.
You also could have prime rib
($18.50), filet mignon ($19.50)
or lobster tail ($22). Fresh
salads, fully garnished baked
potatoes and tempting soups
round out the dishes included
in the dinner price. A dessert
menu includes everything

from cheesecake to chocolate
mousse ($1.50 each). The wine
list is extensive, offering im
ports and domestics, ranging
from $4 for a tenth of Cabernet
Sauvignon, to over $20 for a
fifth of some of the imported
brands.
Harrah's
According to the regulars at
the table next to us, the South
Shore Room at Hairah's is the
Tahoe entertainment center.
The shows tend to be more like
nightclub acts and variety
hours than rock concerts.
Though the entertainers' selec
tions of music may not be
found on the local FM rock sta
tion, the shows are lively and
thrilling. Cabaret dancing girls,
amazing costumes and elabo
rate productions are bound to
be entertaining no matter
which songs are sung.
Harrah's dinners are also
super. Included in the price of
one are a choice of soup or
salad, vegetable or potato, ice
cream and a beverage. Not
only are the portions larger
than the Sahara's, but they are
more reasonably priced. The
chicken and broiled chopped
beef steak are each only about
$10. Harrah's minimum charge
is $10, which could be made up
either by ordering a full dinner,
or by ordering ala carte salads,
deserts and drinks. Both the
wine and dessert lists look
exactly like the Sahara's.
Getting seats
It is wise to make dinner
show reservations in advance.
It is possible to get into some
shows without reservations
but this entails waiting in long
cancellation lines and you usu
ally won't be seated until the
show has almost begun.
Both Harrah's and the Sahara
have toll free information/
reservation numbers. Harrah's
is (800) 648-3773 and the Sah
ara's is (800) 648-3322. Ask not
only who will be entertaining
but what the minimum charge
will be per person. Dinner
prices vary according to who is
performing, ranging from $10
to a $25 charge for the likes of
Frank Sinatra.
