pull out a 69-67 victory on Jeff

After the Bronco's Mark
McNamara missed the front
end of a one-and-one situation

of the season following over
time victories in their first two
games. Santa Clara, playing its

first home game dropped to

points, Stanford went to a
press which disrupted the
Broncos. Santa Clara netted
only three more field goals the
remainder of the game.
"Stanford did it on defense
tonight," said Cardinal coach
Dick Dißiaso. "It (the press)
worked out. It was particularly
effective getting the steal on
the first inbounds pass."
"Their press hurt us," said
Bronco's coach Carroll Wil
liams. "Not that we didn't ex
pect it. I don't know why we
lost momentum. We have vet
eran players."
McHugh paced the Stanford

comeback, scoring eight of his
12 points in the final seven mi
nutes. Forward Kimberly Bel
ton had five second half buc
kets and freshman guard Mark
