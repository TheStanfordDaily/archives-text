Johannesburg, South Africa
(AP) â€” Prime Minister John
Vorster won a clear victory last
night in segregated South Atri
ca's election of an all-white Par
liament.
With about half the votes
counted, his conservative
Afrikaner-based National Party
had won 54 of parliament's 165
seats and appeared capable of
gaining more than the 116 seats
it holds in the current Parlia
ment. The Nationalists won 39
of the first 49 decided contests,
picking up four seats held by
opponents, and were unop
posed in 45 districts.
The liberal Progressive Fed
eral Party, trying to supplant
the centrist New Republic Party
as the major opposition, had
eight seats to the NRP's two.
The ultra-rightist Herstigte
Nasionale Party had won no
seats.
Vorster had called the elec
tion 18 months early.
He was seeking support for a
proposed new constitution
that would set up separate par
liaments for the 4.5 million
whites, 2.5 million persons of
mixed race and 750,000 Asians.
There would be no representa
tion for blacks, who make up

70 per cent of the population.
About 2.2 million whites
were registered, and about 60
per cent ventured out in rain
and gales to cast ballots. The
country's 19 million blacks are
barred from voting.
Vo'Ster, who also wanted a
mandate to reject what he cal
led "meddling," by the United
States and other nations in
South Africa's domestic affairs,
was returned by a huge margin
to his own seat.
Justice Minister James
Kruger, criticized at home and
abroad for his handling of the
death of detained black leader
Steve Biko, also was re
elected.
Vorster, like most of the Na
tional party leadership, is an
Afrikaner. The Afrikaners, de
scended from Dutch and
French colonists, are solidly in
the majority among the na
tion's whites and support the
government's apartheid policy
of race separation.
The Nationalists have a firm
grip on most of their seats in
Parliament, and fielded 147 of
the 275 total candidates in this
election. Forty-two Nationalist
candidates were unopposed.
The opposition, whose two
major parties advocate some
power sharing with blacks, has
splintered over how to react to
black discontent, and the
English-speaking whites were
expected to swing away from
their usual support of the op
position and toward the
Nationalists.
The blacks' unrest was mir
rored in their election-day
comments.
"The election means no
thing to me because I am
excluded from voting," said
Joe Sibiya, a welfare officer in
the huge segregated Soweto
township near Johannesburg.
"I just wonder how long these
people think they can go on
perpetrating the myth that I
don't exist."
