# Groups scrutinize advising system
## 
### Jon Hornsby 
"There has been no popular
outcry from students against
the advising system, but we
decided this year that we
needed to focus more on the
problems in departmental ad
vising."
Assoc. English Prof. David
Riggs, chairman of the Faculty
Senate's Subcommittee on Ad
vising, offered this explanation
for his subcommittee's recent
report on advising.
"Though you mostly hear
complaints, there have been
many efforts to improve advis
ing over the last couple of
years," said Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Ale
xander Fetter, also on the sub
committee.
Starting this quarter, stu
dents going to the Academic
Information Center to declare
a major were asked to fill out a
form evaluating their previous
advisers.
In addition, a high level of
student concern prompted the
ASSU to establish a Commis
sion on Advising earlier this
quarter.
According to ASSU Co
president Greg Larson, the
commission will survey under
graduates.
'Senior Survey'
Most student input in the
past has come from the
"Senior Survey," a three-page
questionnaire completed by
graduating seniors. According
to Larson, last year's survey
gave major advisers a 3.15 rat
ing on a low high scale of one
to five.
Freshman advisers received
a 2.21 mark.
Riggs said he was "pleasantly
surprised" by the above
average ranking for major ad
visers, but he pointed out that
the questionnaire was not bro
ken down by department,

opening the possibility that
dissatisfaction is concentrated
in a few departments.
He also said issues of major
and freshman advising are dif
ferent. "With freshman advis
ers, the question is 'Where
does the person come from?'
and 'Is he or she doing a good
job?' With major advisers, it's
Do they even have one?' "
This helped to explain why
Riggs' subcommittee chose to
focus on the latter issue.
Departments such as human
biology, economics and com
munication, which have high
student-faculty ratios, find it
hard to supply all majors with
advisers, said Riggs.
Communication
Communication Depart
ment Chairman Henry Breit
rose said, "Since 1965, our de
partment has seen an extraor
dinary increase in the number
of majors. And a subsequent
increase in faculty has just not
followed."
Breitrose said that there are
now about 130 undergraduate
majors, 100 graduates and 13
faculty.
He said he has been talking
to some of the better advisers
in the Communication De
partment about innovative
methods such as peer advising.
"It is a high priority for me,"
he said. "To some extent, ad
vising is a student's responsi
bility and some students just
aren't taking the initiative to
make appointments, and ask
questions."
Student complaints
Students' main complaints,
according to sophomore
Dorothy Parrish, an assistant to
the ombudsman, are that "ad
visersare uninformed or misin
formed" and that "they don't
give students the full idea of
requirements and options."
In the Psychology Depart

ment students choose their
own adviser, said one major
who viewed her advising ex
perience as "excellent" and
who thought "it usually works
out well."
Another major said he didn't
know who the good advisers
were. He found them accessi
ble, but "hard toget to know."
"It could be nice if there was
a formal process by which you
could get to know teachers
well, without pushing yourself
on them." He also said,
"Though a professor may
know his topic well, he often
doesn't know anything about
applying to grad schools."
Lee Ross, associate psychol
ogy professor, said the de
partment has a standing com
mittee looking into advising. It
is considering preparing a
handout describing what con
stitutes a "strong major" for
purposes of graduate school
application and career orienta
tion.
Peer advisers
The Human Biology Program
has a system of peer advising.
One such adviser, senior
Cheryl Hines, said the peer ad
visers' basic function is to help
students set up their programs
and then turn them over to a
faculty adviser.
Senior Scott Rutherford said
he felt the system worked very
well because the student ad
visers are aware of the current
changes in the department.
In its report, the advising
subcommittee detailed two
weaknesses of peer advising:
students aren't around long
enough to monitor their ad
visees' year-to-year progress
and can't provide useful letters
of recommendation.
The advising subcommittee
urged use ot graduate students
or emeritus faculty as advisers.

Riggs said each department
has evolved its own way of ad
vising over the years. "If you
instituted a major reform,
you'd have to dismantle those
systems, which is not what we
want. You would probably lose
more than you would gain," he
said.
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herarit Katchadourian
termed the effort "a refine
ment," a process of gradual
discussion with various de
partments.
He added, "If we can bring
the level of advising at Stanford
up to that of some of our best
departments, we would be in
good shape."
