# ASSU budget gets boost from projects
## 
### Ali Webb 
Ten ASSU revenue
generating projects were as
sessed a fee for the first time by
the ASSU this year to help
make up a $10,000 budget de
ficit.
"It is a convenient and legal
way to transfer funds from the
projects to the general ASSU
operating accounts," stated
Miles White, ASSU financial
manager.
The fee, one per cent of
gross revenues, was charged
only to ASSU projects which
have a capacity to make a pro
fit. The ASSU Travel Service
was charged the largest fee at
the close of the last fiscal year,
$5627, while the Duplicating
Service was assessed only $18.
The budget deficit was incur
red two years ago when the
University cut ASSU ftindingby
$30,000. The University's con

tribution, $65,000, does not
meet the estimated $90,000 an
nual operating budget of the
ASSU. Investment earnings
cover a portion of the budget,
approximately $17,000, which
leaves a deficit to be covered
by the new fee policy.
Projects such as I egal Coun
seling and the Speakers Bureau
funded through fee as
sessment ore nut sub|ect to this
charge. Projects being charged
include Special Events, Sunday
Flicks, Typesetting, Re
frigerator Service, Lecture
Notes, T-Shirt Service, Course
Guide and Duplicating Service.
No persons connected with
the projects have voiced any
complaints over the service
charge, according to White. All
profits generated by projects
go back into ASSU accounts to
be held in reserve for 'he indi
vidual projects.
