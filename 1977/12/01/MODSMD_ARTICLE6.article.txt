out of the system and replaced
with the strongest possible
constituents.
"We seek a dozen outside
opinions on someone who is
up for rehire," Assoc. Dean
Jaedicke said. "Peers review
them; students review them.
It's an internal process because
someone outside of the school
can't evaluate strength and
weakness of specific teach
ing."
"A poor teacher has a terri
ble time. If you get a weak pro
fessor here, you'll know it.
There are open evaluations
that are published," Prof.
Robert Davis told me.
"Another item which de
serves mention is that we at the
biz school are plugged into a
great University," Jaedicke
said. "We rely on other discip
lines — law, psychology, oper
ations research, sociology,
economics. Ail are fundamen
tal to what we do because
management is concerned
with all of these. All that intel
lectual horsepower from
around the University aug
ments our already strong
school. We can't be a first class
biz school without the strength

and support of the rest of the
University. This connection
enables our students to plug in
with different departments
from throughout Stanford's
community."
The strengths, then, are
manifest. And these strengths
are self-perpetuating in that
they attract the best students.
It would certainly be surpris
ing, though, if, in an institution
as large as the Business School,
there were no undercurrent of
dissatisfaction. The School's
administrators are the first to
admit that they do not try to be
all things to all people. Does
this wipe away the dissatisfac
tion? Of course not. A
rationalization that one place
can never satisfy all unfortu
nately does not allay the
qualms of those students
whose intellectual curiosity
remains unsatisfied. In the
same way, the external percep
tion of the School's superiority
does no assure smooth sailing
within. Coming to terms with
the problems inherent in a bus
iness education is made no
easier by attending the number
one business school in the
country.
