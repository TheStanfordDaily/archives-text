# The 						National Party of South Africa

### 
Many talk about South Af
rica, but few know what they
are talking about. I have dis
cussed South Africa with
people who had definite views
on the political morality of
South Africans, for example,
and yet could not tell me the
name of the reigning political
party in South Africa, or what
that party stood for. The pur
pose of this article is briefly to
examine the current National
Party platform, and to explore
why the Nationalists presently
hold 123 of 171 Parliamentary
seats, and why they expect,
after November3o, to hold 138.
Last election, a Nationalist
catchphrase was "Vote for Sta
bility." Prime Minister Vorster
has called for a new election;
this time the catchphrase is
"Self-determination," de
scribed as "The National Par
ty's foundation which provides
full political rights for everyone
on an ethnic basis." This in
volves a new constitution by
which "Self-determination" is
assured. As the Nationalists
put it,"The Whites already
have this right, and will retain
it. The Black nations are achiev

ing this right by means of inde
pendent states. The time has
come that the Coloureds
(meaning mixed-race) and the
Indians (meaning Asians)
should decide their own af
fairs."
This is called stressing the
positive, deemphasizing the
negative, and ignoring the
facts in between. Translated,
"The Black nations" are
"achieving" the "right" to be
shipped to the nine "home
lands" within South Africa —
"homelands" that several
hundred thousand of the nine
m'llion urban South African
biacks have rarely or never
seen, chosen for them by "the
Whiter" on the basis of aridity
of soil. \s for "the Coloureds"
and"the Indians," the
Nationalists plan to grant them
merely token powers "in all af
fairs exclusive" to their own in
terests, subject to overrule by
"the Whites" if those interests
by some accident should ever
be of interest to anybody.
In short, it is business as
usual, the Afrikaner keeping
the power and the goods, with
the Indians and Coloureds

keeping to themselves, and
"the Blacks" doing what "the
Whites" have already decided
they should do at the earliest
convenient date (currently un
forseeable). The National Party
has rephrased this to sound as
if it were granting equality —
"plural democracy," they call it
— but in fact they are granting
separate-but-unequal status
according to race, subjecting
all "non-Whites" to massive
discrimination and repression.
Separation according to race
is of course the essence — in
fact the definition — of apar
theid. And when it comes to
apartheid, the National Party
retains its hard line. "It is quite
evident that there is no ques
tion of power sharing," their
propaganda states. "Sharing of
power is a Prog-Fed term which
implies decision by all groups
on all essential matters in a
Common Parliament." The Na
tional Party is assuring its vot
ers that in the new constitution
"provision has been made for a
maximum division of power
between the three population
groups." Where "a number of
common areas still remain," a
