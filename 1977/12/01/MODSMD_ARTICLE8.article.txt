council of cabinets, composed
of two "Indians," two "Col
oureds," no "Blacks," and six
"Whites" will settle all dispute
by electing and thriving "under
the leadership of a strong State
President." This, of course,
means Balthazar Johannes
Vorster.
The National Party platform
leaves no doubt that the State
President will indeed be
strong:
—the State President, repie
senting all three groups, can
overcome deadlocks;

The composition of the Elec
toral College can only be
changed by separate agreement
of the three parliaments.
3. What will happen if the Col
oureds and/or the Indians do
not accept the constitutional
proposals?
Discussions will proceed until
they decide to reap the benefits
of this fair dispensation. Be
cause the new dispensation will
not prejudice the interests of
any group, the National Party is
convinced that it will succeed
with the necessary goodwill.
