—voting strength is irrelev
ant in the Council of Cabinets,
simply because novotes will be
cast;
—maximum opportunity for
consensus;
—good government is en
sured as one willful parliament
will not be able to jeopardize
essential legislation, and be
cause the State President could
legislate with the support of
one parliament;
—collective advisory com
mittees from the three division
of the Parliament can iron out
legislation regarding common
problems. If they cannot reach
agreement, the State President
has the final say.
The National Party platform
concedes that these extraordi
nary proposals raise at least
three "pressing questions."
The questions, with Nationalist
answers, are:
1 .Will the State President not be
come a dictator?
Not in the least — he is elected
every five years on a democratic
basis; he is not able to promul
gate any law without the support
of at least one parliament, and he
has no financial powers.
2. What will happen in case the
Coloureds eventually out
number the Whites?

provide a fair and just system
for discussion and co
responsibility in common af
fairs, with the maintenance of
self-determination.
With these ideas in mind, it
may seem absurd that the Na
tional Party is urging South Af
ricans to move "Forward To
gether" by voting National. But
in a sense this motto is tragi
cally accurate. Estimates are
that the National Party will
garner twice its usual English
speaking white vote in the
coming election. Opposition
parties, traditional outlets for
the English-speaking White
vote, are in shambles. The 1974
Vorster campaign slogan, "He
made South Africa safe. Keep it
that way," increasingly appeals
to English-speaking Whites
who cannot outvote the Af
rikaners in any event, and who
live in a country with 750,000
Asians, 2.5 million coloureds,
and 18.6 million blacks. For
similar reasons, opposition
leaders concur with Afrikaners
in rebuffing foreign pressure
to change South Africa's
domestic policies. This is the
unity of a suicide pact, but it is
unity.
