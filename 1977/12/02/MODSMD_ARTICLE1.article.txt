# Students make book on campus
## Gambling on more than grades in residences

The sign reads: "Do you find a
football game to be a little more
interesting when you have a couple
of bucks riding on itf If so, go with
JIMMY THE GEEK ENTERPRISES
(Point spreads offered on both pro
and college games). Nearest branch
located at Check there for
details."
Jimmy the Geek is a Stanford stu
dent. He also oversees a bookmak
ing operation with at least 12
branches in campus residences
which have totaled more than $2000
in bets this football season.
Jimmy claims to be "just making a
little spending money on the side"
and said his bookmaking set up "is
just a hobby."
The format is simple and lucrative
for both Jimmy and his branch
managers. For most games, the
Geek relies on point spreads that
come out of Nevada on Wednesday
morning.
But when they can be easily ad
justed to improve his chances, as is
the case with most Stanford games,
Jimmy will change the point spread
to make his "hobby" more profita
ble.
Jimmy and his fellow bookies
take all bets under the $5 per game
limit any time before the kickoff
and the Geek says he "doesn't ask
for money up front." He also re
serves the right to change the point
spread at any time before kickoff,
although, as his "Rules of the

Game" sheet states, "of course,
any change does not apply to bets
already made."
The most important rule of all is
that Jimmy takes 6-5 odds on all
bets. This means that if you win a $5
bet with r ;ht Geek, he will pay you
$5. If, howevei, you come out on
the wrong end of the point spread,
you must fork out $6 for Jimmy's
"spending money."
The Geek pays his branch mana
gers five per cent by volume of all
bets taken. Jimmy's profit on the 6-5
odds comes from the difference be
tween what he takes in after paying
his winning betters and what he
pays his managers.
The Geek's branches are located
wherever people are interested
enough to manage them. There are
three in Lagunita Court and Toyon,
and Florence Moore and Mirrielees
have one branch each. Three row
houses have branches, as does one
fraternity.
Jimmy said he began his opera
tion his freshman year "on a whim.
I made a few dollars a week," said
the Geek, "but it was hardly any
thing at all."
Last year Jimmy had three
branches besides his own room in
Lagunita. This year he lives off cam
pus and only controls the
branches; he takes no bets himself.
Branch No. 4, which Jimmy said is
"really coming around the last
couple weeks," is located in
Lagunita. Its manager, who opted

for anonymity, indicated his weekly
volume is "up around $100 now,
which is pretty good."
A decision by the manager and
Jimmy to lay odds on the FTLS vs.
Eucalypto (a Lagunita house) in
tramural women's football league
playoff game "sharply increased"
the branch's volume.
The branch lost a small amount
on the game but the advertising ad
vantages of taking the bets were
well worth the small loss, according
to Branch No. 4 manager.
The weekly volume average was
only about $35 before that week but
the following two weeks showed
the volume jumping to $70 and then
to $100, then leveling olf.
The manager said that University
house associates (RAs) have been
"no problem" this year.
He also said most of the betting is
done by the "faithfuls" who return
weekly to place their bets. Three
betters accounted for $90 of the ap
proximately $100 bet on the
Thanksgiving weekend games ac
cording to the manager.
He indicated that he does not
"press for volume" because he
doesn't have the time. He said his
volume could be higher if he tried
to solicit bets from dorm residents.
Branch No. 12 is also located in
Lagunita and is described by its
manager as "one of the less active
branches." Its manager said his
total volume this season has been
between $200 and $300. "I've had

some weeks with no volume and
one with over $60," he said.
He indicated that "a lot of disap
pointing things have happened"
during the season such as Notre
Dame's 24-0 victory over Army.
Notre Dame was favored by 24,
prompting many to bet on under
dog Army. "A lot of people were
pissed at Notre Dame," the man
ager said.
He said his volume dropped after
that game. "Everybody was doing
fine for the first three or four
weeks," he said. "But then several
people lost and really got hurt."
Branch No. 4's manager said his
house associate (RA) had not been a
problem for his operation. On the
contrary, his RA asked him one day
"if he could open up a branch" for
another bookie operating on cam
pus (not Jimmy the Geek).
Jimmy, who was described by
one branch manager as a "sports
nut," did not put a point spread on
the Big Came or the Stanford-USC
game this year. He said his emo
tions about the contests were in
conflict with his business interest.
The Geek said he is considering
putting spreads on NBA games and
the NCAA playoffs this year.
The Geek said he has only made
about a five per cent profit on the
$2000 volume this year. He had
been doing much better at the be
ginning of the season but "the odds
caught up with me," he said.

Asked if he worries about either
the police or the University crack
ing down on the operation, Jimmy
said, "the worst they would do is
tell me to stop. I don't think they'd
expel me or anything."
Branch manager of No. 12 said he
does not worry about it."I don't
feel it is the kind of thing they'd do
anything about," he said.
The manager for Branch No. 4
was not quite as optimistic, how
ever. He said he was "afraid they
might crack down" after the Daily
wrote the story.
He said he never solicited bets
because "we'd open ourselves up
to legal action."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night, "I know no
thing at all," about gambling in the
University residences, but indi
cated that he would "surely be in
terested in knowing more about it.
"If it's something that's unlaw
ful," Lyons said, "its's going to give

numbers of people some discom
fort."
jimmy the Geek Enterprises is not
the only bookmaking operation on
campus.
"Fun Football" is a partnership
working two fraternities and a
Lagunita house. It is a parlay system
wherein betters pick between three
and 10 teams. A correct three-for
three pick pays 5-1 odds while a 10-
for-10 weekend pays 100-1.
One of the partners indicated
that the operation has been very
successful this year. "I've bought a
new stereo receiver," he said. He
estimated that their profit has been
about $500 this season.
"Fun Football" takes the Nevada
odds but refuses to adjust them.
He said the operation is "really
fun and if gives a lot of people a
bigger interest in the games." The
partner the Daily spoke with will be
graduating soon but said fhat his
partner will be around for a while,
as will the operation.

and said his bookmaking set up "is
just a hobby."
The format is simple and lucrative
for both Jimmy and his branch
managers. For most games, the
Geek relies on point spreads that
come out of Nevada on Wednesday
morning.
But when they can be easily ad
justed to improve his chances, as is
the case with most Stanford games,
Jimmy will change the point spread
to make his "hobby" more profita
ble.
Jimmy and his fellow bookies
take all bets under the $5 per game
limit any time before the kickoff
and the Geek says he "doesn't ask
for money up front." He also re
serves the right to change the point
spread at any time before kickoff,
although, as his "Rules of the

Game" sheet states, "of course,
any change does not apply to bets
already made."
The most important rule of all is
that Jimmy takes 6-5 odds on all
bets. This means that if you win a $5
bet with r ;ht Geek, he will pay you
$5. If, howevei, you come out on
the wrong end of the point spread,
you must fork out $6 for Jimmy's
"spending money."
The Geek pays his branch mana
gers five per cent by volume of all
bets taken. Jimmy's profit on the 6-5
odds comes from the difference be
tween what he takes in after paying
his winning betters and what he
pays his managers.
The Geek's branches are located
wherever people are interested
enough to manage them. There are
three in Lagunita Court and Toyon,
and Florence Moore and Mirrielees
have one branch each. Three row
houses have branches, as does one
fraternity.
Jimmy said he began his opera
tion his freshman year "on a whim.
I made a few dollars a week," said
the Geek, "but it was hardly any
thing at all."
Last year Jimmy had three
branches besides his own room in
Lagunita. This year he lives off cam
pus and only controls the
branches; he takes no bets himself.
Branch No. 4, which Jimmy said is
"really coming around the last
couple weeks," is located in
Lagunita. Its manager, who opted

for anonymity, indicated his weekly
volume is "up around $100 now,
which is pretty good."
A decision by the manager and
Jimmy to lay odds on the FTLS vs.
Eucalypto (a Lagunita house) in
tramural women's football league
playoff game "sharply increased"
the branch's volume.
The branch lost a small amount
on the game but the advertising ad
vantages of taking the bets were
well worth the small loss, according
to Branch No. 4 manager.
The weekly volume average was
only about $35 before that week but
the following two weeks showed
the volume jumping to $70 and then
to $100, then leveling olf.
The manager said that University
house associates (RAs) have been
"no problem" this year.
He also said most of the betting is
done by the "faithfuls" who return
weekly to place their bets. Three
betters accounted for $90 of the ap
proximately $100 bet on the
Thanksgiving weekend games ac
cording to the manager.
He indicated that he does not
"press for volume" because he
doesn't have the time. He said his
volume could be higher if he tried
to solicit bets from dorm residents.
Branch No. 12 is also located in
Lagunita and is described by its
manager as "one of the less active
branches." Its manager said his
total volume this season has been
between $200 and $300. "I've had

some weeks with no volume and
one with over $60," he said.
He indicated that "a lot of disap
pointing things have happened"
during the season such as Notre
Dame's 24-0 victory over Army.
Notre Dame was favored by 24,
prompting many to bet on under
dog Army. "A lot of people were
pissed at Notre Dame," the man
ager said.
He said his volume dropped after
that game. "Everybody was doing
fine for the first three or four
weeks," he said. "But then several
people lost and really got hurt."
Branch No. 4's manager said his
house associate (RA) had not been a
problem for his operation. On the
contrary, his RA asked him one day
"if he could open up a branch" for
another bookie operating on cam
pus (not Jimmy the Geek).
Jimmy, who was described by
one branch manager as a "sports
nut," did not put a point spread on
the Big Came or the Stanford-USC
game this year. He said his emo
tions about the contests were in
conflict with his business interest.
The Geek said he is considering
putting spreads on NBA games and
the NCAA playoffs this year.
The Geek said he has only made
about a five per cent profit on the
$2000 volume this year. He had
been doing much better at the be
ginning of the season but "the odds
caught up with me," he said.

Asked if he worries about either
the police or the University crack
ing down on the operation, Jimmy
said, "the worst they would do is
tell me to stop. I don't think they'd
expel me or anything."
Branch manager of No. 12 said he
does not worry about it."I don't
feel it is the kind of thing they'd do
anything about," he said.
The manager for Branch No. 4
was not quite as optimistic, how
ever. He said he was "afraid they
might crack down" after the Daily
wrote the story.
He said he never solicited bets
because "we'd open ourselves up
to legal action."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night, "I know no
thing at all," about gambling in the
University residences, but indi
cated that he would "surely be in
terested in knowing more about it.
"If it's something that's unlaw
ful," Lyons said, "its's going to give

numbers of people some discom
fort."
jimmy the Geek Enterprises is not

"Fun Football" is a partnership
working two fraternities and a
Lagunita house. It is a parlay system
wherein betters pick between three
and 10 teams. A correct three-for
three pick pays 5-1 odds while a 10-
for-10 weekend pays 100-1.
One of the partners indicated
that the operation has been very
successful this year. "I've bought a
new stereo receiver," he said. He
estimated that their profit has been
about $500 this season.
"Fun Football" takes the Nevada
odds but refuses to adjust them.
He said the operation is "really
fun and if gives a lot of people a
bigger interest in the games." The
partner the Daily spoke with will be
graduating soon but said fhat his
partner will be around for a while,
as will the operation.

serves the right to change the point
spread at any time before kickoff,
although, as his "Rules of the

Game" sheet states, "of course,
any change does not apply to bets
already made."
The most important rule of all is
that Jimmy takes 6-5 odds on all
bets. This means that if you win a $5
bet with r ;ht Geek, he will pay you
$5. If, howevei, you come out on
the wrong end of the point spread,
you must fork out $6 for Jimmy's
"spending money."
The Geek pays his branch mana
gers five per cent by volume of all
bets taken. Jimmy's profit on the 6-5
odds comes from the difference be
tween what he takes in after paying
his winning betters and what he
pays his managers.
The Geek's branches are located
wherever people are interested
enough to manage them. There are
three in Lagunita Court and Toyon,
and Florence Moore and Mirrielees
have one branch each. Three row
houses have branches, as does one
fraternity.
Jimmy said he began his opera
tion his freshman year "on a whim.
I made a few dollars a week," said
the Geek, "but it was hardly any
thing at all."
Last year Jimmy had three
branches besides his own room in
Lagunita. This year he lives off cam
pus and only controls the
branches; he takes no bets himself.
Branch No. 4, which Jimmy said is
"really coming around the last
couple weeks," is located in
Lagunita. Its manager, who opted

for anonymity, indicated his weekly
volume is "up around $100 now,
which is pretty good."
A decision by the manager and
Jimmy to lay odds on the FTLS vs.
Eucalypto (a Lagunita house) in
tramural women's football league
playoff game "sharply increased"
the branch's volume.
The branch lost a small amount
on the game but the advertising ad
vantages of taking the bets were
well worth the small loss, according
to Branch No. 4 manager.
The weekly volume average was
only about $35 before that week but
the following two weeks showed
the volume jumping to $70 and then
to $100, then leveling olf.
The manager said that University
house associates (RAs) have been
"no problem" this year.
He also said most of the betting is
done by the "faithfuls" who return
weekly to place their bets. Three
betters accounted for $90 of the ap
proximately $100 bet on the
Thanksgiving weekend games ac
cording to the manager.
He indicated that he does not
"press for volume" because he
doesn't have the time. He said his
volume could be higher if he tried
to solicit bets from dorm residents.
Branch No. 12 is also located in
Lagunita and is described by its
manager as "one of the less active
branches." Its manager said his
total volume this season has been
between $200 and $300. "I've had

some weeks with no volume and
one with over $60," he said.
He indicated that "a lot of disap
pointing things have happened"
during the season such as Notre
Dame's 24-0 victory over Army.
Notre Dame was favored by 24,
prompting many to bet on under
dog Army. "A lot of people were
pissed at Notre Dame," the man
ager said.
He said his volume dropped after
that game. "Everybody was doing
fine for the first three or four
weeks," he said. "But then several
people lost and really got hurt."
Branch No. 4's manager said his
house associate (RA) had not been a
problem for his operation. On the
contrary, his RA asked him one day
"if he could open up a branch" for
another bookie operating on cam
pus (not Jimmy the Geek).
Jimmy, who was described by
one branch manager as a "sports
nut," did not put a point spread on
the Big Came or the Stanford-USC
game this year. He said his emo
tions about the contests were in
conflict with his business interest.
The Geek said he is considering
putting spreads on NBA games and
the NCAA playoffs this year.
The Geek said he has only made
about a five per cent profit on the
$2000 volume this year. He had
been doing much better at the be
ginning of the season but "the odds
caught up with me," he said.

Asked if he worries about either
the police or the University crack
ing down on the operation, Jimmy
said, "the worst they would do is
tell me to stop. I don't think they'd
expel me or anything."
Branch manager of No. 12 said he
does not worry about it."I don't
feel it is the kind of thing they'd do
anything about," he said.
The manager for Branch No. 4
was not quite as optimistic, how
ever. He said he was "afraid they
might crack down" after the Daily
wrote the story.
He said he never solicited bets
because "we'd open ourselves up
to legal action."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night, "I know no
thing at all," about gambling in the
University residences, but indi
cated that he would "surely be in
terested in knowing more about it.
"If it's something that's unlaw
ful," Lyons said, "its's going to give

numbers of people some discom
fort."
jimmy the Geek Enterprises is not
the only bookmaking operation on

"Fun Football" is a partnership
working two fraternities and a
Lagunita house. It is a parlay system
wherein betters pick between three
and 10 teams. A correct three-for
three pick pays 5-1 odds while a 10-
for-10 weekend pays 100-1.
One of the partners indicated
that the operation has been very
successful this year. "I've bought a
new stereo receiver," he said. He
estimated that their profit has been
about $500 this season.
"Fun Football" takes the Nevada
odds but refuses to adjust them.
He said the operation is "really
fun and if gives a lot of people a
bigger interest in the games." The
partner the Daily spoke with will be
graduating soon but said fhat his
partner will be around for a while,

The format is simple and lucrative
for both Jimmy and his branch

bets taken. Jimmy's profit on the 6-5
odds comes from the difference be
tween what he takes in after paying
his winning betters and what he
pays his managers.
The Geek's branches are located
wherever people are interested
enough to manage them. There are
three in Lagunita Court and Toyon,
and Florence Moore and Mirrielees
have one branch each. Three row
houses have branches, as does one
fraternity.
Jimmy said he began his opera
tion his freshman year "on a whim.
I made a few dollars a week," said
the Geek, "but it was hardly any
thing at all."
Last year Jimmy had three
branches besides his own room in
Lagunita. This year he lives off cam
pus and only controls the
branches; he takes no bets himself.
Branch No. 4, which Jimmy said is
"really coming around the last
couple weeks," is located in
Lagunita. Its manager, who opted

for anonymity, indicated his weekly
volume is "up around $100 now,
which is pretty good."
A decision by the manager and
Jimmy to lay odds on the FTLS vs.
Eucalypto (a Lagunita house) in
tramural women's football league
playoff game "sharply increased"
the branch's volume.
The branch lost a small amount
on the game but the advertising ad
vantages of taking the bets were
well worth the small loss, according
to Branch No. 4 manager.
The weekly volume average was
only about $35 before that week but
the following two weeks showed
the volume jumping to $70 and then
to $100, then leveling olf.
The manager said that University
house associates (RAs) have been
"no problem" this year.
He also said most of the betting is
done by the "faithfuls" who return
weekly to place their bets. Three
betters accounted for $90 of the ap
proximately $100 bet on the
Thanksgiving weekend games ac
cording to the manager.
He indicated that he does not
"press for volume" because he
doesn't have the time. He said his
volume could be higher if he tried
to solicit bets from dorm residents.
Branch No. 12 is also located in
Lagunita and is described by its
manager as "one of the less active
branches." Its manager said his
total volume this season has been
between $200 and $300. "I've had

some weeks with no volume and
one with over $60," he said.
He indicated that "a lot of disap
pointing things have happened"
during the season such as Notre
Dame's 24-0 victory over Army.
Notre Dame was favored by 24,
prompting many to bet on under
dog Army. "A lot of people were
pissed at Notre Dame," the man
ager said.
He said his volume dropped after
that game. "Everybody was doing
fine for the first three or four
weeks," he said. "But then several
people lost and really got hurt."
Branch No. 4's manager said his
house associate (RA) had not been a
problem for his operation. On the
contrary, his RA asked him one day
"if he could open up a branch" for
another bookie operating on cam
pus (not Jimmy the Geek).
Jimmy, who was described by
one branch manager as a "sports
nut," did not put a point spread on
the Big Came or the Stanford-USC
game this year. He said his emo
tions about the contests were in
conflict with his business interest.
The Geek said he is considering
putting spreads on NBA games and
the NCAA playoffs this year.
The Geek said he has only made
about a five per cent profit on the
$2000 volume this year. He had
been doing much better at the be
ginning of the season but "the odds
caught up with me," he said.

Asked if he worries about either
the police or the University crack
ing down on the operation, Jimmy
said, "the worst they would do is
tell me to stop. I don't think they'd
expel me or anything."
Branch manager of No. 12 said he
does not worry about it."I don't
feel it is the kind of thing they'd do
anything about," he said.
The manager for Branch No. 4
was not quite as optimistic, how
ever. He said he was "afraid they
might crack down" after the Daily
wrote the story.
He said he never solicited bets
because "we'd open ourselves up
to legal action."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night, "I know no
thing at all," about gambling in the
University residences, but indi
cated that he would "surely be in
terested in knowing more about it.
"If it's something that's unlaw
ful," Lyons said, "its's going to give

numbers of people some discom
fort."
jimmy the Geek Enterprises is not
the only bookmaking operation on
campus.
"Fun Football" is a partnership
working two fraternities and a
Lagunita house. It is a parlay system
wherein betters pick between three
and 10 teams. A correct three-for
three pick pays 5-1 odds while a 10-
for-10 weekend pays 100-1.
One of the partners indicated
that the operation has been very
successful this year. "I've bought a
new stereo receiver," he said. He
estimated that their profit has been
about $500 this season.
"Fun Football" takes the Nevada
odds but refuses to adjust them.
He said the operation is "really
fun and if gives a lot of people a
bigger interest in the games." The
partner the Daily spoke with will be
graduating soon but said fhat his
partner will be around for a while,
as will the operation.
The sign reads: "Do you find a
football game to be a little more
interesting when you have a couple
of bucks riding on itf If so, go with
JIMMY THE GEEK ENTERPRISES
(Point spreads offered on both pro
and college games). Nearest branch
located at Check there for
details."
Jimmy the Geek is a Stanford stu
dent. He also oversees a bookmak
ing operation with at least 12
branches in campus residences
which have totaled more than $2000
in bets this football season.
Jimmy claims to be "just making a
little spending money on the side"
and said his bookmaking set up "is
just a hobby."
The format is simple and lucrative
for both Jimmy and his branch
managers. For most games, the
Geek relies on point spreads that
come out of Nevada on Wednesday
morning.
But when they can be easily ad
justed to improve his chances, as is
the case with most Stanford games,
Jimmy will change the point spread
to make his "hobby" more profita
ble.
Jimmy and his fellow bookies
take all bets under the $5 per game
limit any time before the kickoff
and the Geek says he "doesn't ask
for money up front." He also re
serves the right to change the point
spread at any time before kickoff,
although, as his "Rules of the

Game" sheet states, "of course,
any change does not apply to bets
already made."
The most important rule of all is
that Jimmy takes 6-5 odds on all
bets. This means that if you win a $5
bet with r ;ht Geek, he will pay you
$5. If, howevei, you come out on
the wrong end of the point spread,
you must fork out $6 for Jimmy's
"spending money."
