# St. Peters: a church amid urban bustle
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” Smackdab in the
middle of Manhattan, about the last
place a church would consider locating
these days, historic St. Peter's Lutheran
Church has reared a grand, new
sanctuary amid the urban bustle.
"For the glory of Cod and the good of
the city's people," says the pastor, Rev.
Ralph Peterson.
With a varied, colorful series of wor
ship and celebrations this Sunday, top
ped off with an all-night "soul" session
by 45 jazz musicians, the unusual,
urban-oriented church has its opening
dedication.
Instead of "retreating in fear," as
many inner-city churches across
America have done in the face of flight
and blight, St. Peter's determined to
stay and "extend a blessing to the
people of the city," Peterson says.
This meant, he adds, opening the
church's heart and doors "to artists,
jazz musicians, street people and office
workers, finding ways to be more
human among the skyscrapers."
"The struggle for the survival of New
York City is a struggle for the soul of
America,"he says, adding that St. Pe
ter's seeks to mediate a "source of
strength" in that struggle to "remold
the city so that it is more like the city of
God."
In broadening its reach and work, the
117-year-old congregation took advan
tage of urban pressure for space in one
of the most exceptional church real es

tate deals known in this country.
It sold the site of its old, crumbling
Gothic structure at busy Lexington Av
enue and 54th St. for $9 million in 1971
to the First National City Bank as part of
the bank's new block-size Citicorp
Center, but reserved the right to re
build on the same corner.
This was said to be the first such con
dominium arrangement in the annals of
American churches.
On the old spot, under the wings of
the new towering, 59-story commercial
center, set on stilts above an open
plaza, stands the new St. Peter's, a $7-
million, modernistic, granite cube,
slashed on the sides for light, visually
open to the city skyline.
"A place of meaning in the heart of
our great city," says Peterson. "A new
house for the Lord."
Its multiple, no-steps entrances,
from plaza, street and nearby subway,
lead into a comfortably appointed liv
ing room, adjacent to a 500-seat
sanctuary of movable, terraced pews.
The living room, intended for rest
and relaxation, is a "special gift" to the
city's people, says Peterson. "New Yor
kers need places in which to snooze
and perch and pray, where candles
burn and flowers grow. We need places
for prayer and meditation and reflec
tion."
Indicating the church's widely diver
sified ministry, the new building also
includes a 200-seat theater with produc

tion and dressing rooms, a music recital
room, a children's center, conference
rooms, a baptismal font with flowing
water, a jazz rehearsal room, accousti
cally treated to confine loud sounds.
Sloping ramps are designed to ac
commodate the handicapped.
Like many inner-city churches, St. Pe
ter's was going downhill in 1966 when
Peterson first came there, its congrega
tion shrunk from 1000 to about 300, but
its expanded, innovative program
turned the trend around.
Its regular congregation now is back
up to 500, with various marginal "con
gregations" of artists, dialogue groups
and others. It also hosts humerous lec
tures by noted scholars, theologians
and others.
A part of the Luthern Church in
America, with its "catholic heritage, or
thodox confession and pentecostal
freedom," Peterson says St. Peter's
both upholds and transcends that tradi
tion in ways "strange to the eye and
ear" and in which "no question is out of
bounds."
"We love this city and have great faith
in its future," he says, adding that the
city is part of Cod's "redeemed crea
tion, a holy place to be loved and celeb
rated.
"Welcoming what might be strange,
we celebrate the transformed mean
ings of our time and their promise of
the kingdom to come."
