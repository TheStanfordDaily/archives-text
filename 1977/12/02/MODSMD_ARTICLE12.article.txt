# Foreign student enrollment drops from previous years

Foreign student enrollment
here has dropped slightly this
year following major gains in
1975 and 1976, according to Lee
Zeigler, director of the Bechtel
International Center.
There are 1418 matriculated
foreign students this year,
down 20 from last year.
Zeigler said a new rule insti
tuted in autumn 1975 requiring
post-doctoral scholars to regis
ter, caused an inflated count
not truly representative of ac
tual increase in number of stu
dents.
He felt that this year's slight
drop was not significant and
noted that although figures
fluctuate from year to year,
"over the past 10-year period,
foreign enrollment has grown
faster than general Stanford
enrollment."
He said the University does
not recruit foreign students. It

also does not have quotas on
foreign enrollment like most
state universities.
It is left up to individual de
partments to decide on admis
sions using their own criteria,
he said.
Statistics obtained from a
Fact Sheet on Foreign Enroll
ment compiled by Bechtel
show that foreign students ac
count for 40 per cent of post
doctoral students, about 20 per
cent of graduate students and
less than three per cent of un
dergraduates. Roughly 78 per
cent of matriculated foreign
students are graduate stu
dents. Zeigler said he thought
that these figures were proba
bly not different from compar
able universities.
The University has students
from 87 foreign countries.
There are 492 from Asia, 404
from the Americas, 354 from
Europe, 269 from the Mid-East

and North Africa, 71 from Af
rica and 33 from the Pacific Ba
sin. Four are stateless.
Breakdown by department
shows the School of Engineer
ing to have the highest foreign
enrollment: 639, 28 per cent of
the school. There are 378 in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, 127 in the Graduate
School of Business, 121 in edu
cation, 53 in the earth sciences,
16 in medicine and six in law
The rest have not declared
majors or are in graduate spe
cial or interdepartmental prog
rams.
Of the matriculated graduate
students, about 34 per cent get
major support from the Uni
versity.
Men outnumber women
students by more than four to
one. Slightly more than one
third of the foreign students
are married.
