## Preliminary report of task force calls for single, year-long Western culture course requirement 
### 
Following is a preliminary report to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) from the Task Force on the
Western Culture Requiren ent. CUS authorized circulation of
the preliminary report to the Senate, where a preliminary
discussion is scheduled Thursday, Dec. 1.
The Task Force's final report, CUS response, and policy
recommendations will be considered by the Senate during
winter quarter. Report texts and individual opinions concern
ing the proposed requirement will be published by Campus
Report as they become available.
I. Reasons for requiring the study of Western culture
In its resolution of Dec. 2, 1976, the Academic Senate did
not formally articulate its reasons for the curricular require
ment it asked C-US to propose nor did it espouse the reasons
offered by CORRLES or the Humanities Circle. The Task
Force, working with what we take to be the key terms of the
Senate's resolution—"Western culture" and "historical dimen
sion"—have agreed that at least two reasons for the study of
Western culture are of sufficient importance to warrant the
requirement.
A. Our understanding of ourselves as individuals and of
our society depends in part on a knowledge of the past events
and the inherited ideas, values, and institutions which have
helped shape the kinds of people we are and the kind of
society we live in. We see such an understanding as good in
itself and also necessary to the criticism of the failures of
Western culture as well as to the appreciation of its accom
plishments.
B. A knowledge of some aspects of the past which have
not so obviously influenced the present can expand our
conception of the possible, both in the living of our own lives
and in approaching the problems of society. There are alter
natives to the contemporary and the immediately applicable,
and the notion that only the latter have value is a kind of
temporal and intellectual provincialism.
11. Factors that have led the Task Force to the course it
recommends
During the last 10 months we have had approximately 40
relatively formal meetings as a Task Force and with other
groups and individuals, and each of us has had innumerable
informal conversations about our task with concerned per
sons. We have reached a consensus, not without struggle,
about the best way—in the limited amount of time we can
realistically expect students to devote to the requirement— to
realize its purpose in practice.
A. We agree that all Stanford undergraduates should parti
cipate in an intellectually active engagement with and discus
sion of some important works of Western culture—govern
mental and societal institutions, writings of philosophers,
theologians, scientists, historians, poets, playwrights, and
novelists; pictures, statues, and musical compositions; build
ings and machines that they should become aware of the
temporal relationship of the works to each other, and that
they should understand some of the political, social, and
economic contexts of the works.
B. Implicit in this approach are two facts which must be
faced squarely.
1. Western culture is obviously a set of related and
overlapping cultures—Jewish, Christian; northern Euro
pean, Mediterranean, Slavic, Arabic; high, middle, low;
technologically simple, technologically complex, to men
tion only a few—and no course of the limited scope we
are proposing could do full justice to all of them.
2. Although works should be studied in some of their
intellectual, political, social, and economic contexts,
limited time would make it impossible in most instances
to acquire the historian's sense of the work as a part of an
entire society. Nevertheless, we think that the study of
some great works, though not a course in history, would
create a sense of both the continuities and discontinuities
with the past that would be a sound, if limited, starting
point for an understanding of the individual self and
society and an awareness of the diverse approaches to
experience developed in Western culture.
C. Because the sweep of Western culture could yield any
number of lists of important and intrinsically interesting
works of the kind described, we were faced early on with the
choice between, on the one hand, a course in which all
students studied many of the same works and, on the other
hand, a set of courses, based on different works, from which
the student selected one course. While recognizing the value
of choice for the students, we decided that it was outweighed
by the advantages of a shared intellectual experience—an
experience that could bring a new vitality to the intellectual
life of students and faculty, would enable the faculty to
assume students' knowledge of certain works and build on
that knowledge in subsequent courses, and would encourage
the faculty, in working together to prepare to teach the
works, to think in ways that transcended the boundaries
between disciplines.
D. We further decided that only small classes taught by
regular members of the faculty or their near equivalents
would make possible, if not guarantee, the students' intellec
tually active engagement with and discussion of the works.
Lectures could supplement the small classes, but the small
classes would be at the heart of the course.
[ Educational research has shown that, for the improve
ment of understanding, critical reflection, and reasoning,
discussion classes are far superior to lectures. Since these are
the qualities which we hope will characterize the students'

encounter with the works, our choice of teaching mode is not
arbitrary but necessarily linked to the objectives of the
courses.
[One can teach "facts" about Western culture in lectures,
but a discussion class is better suited to teach a student how
to think about texts, ideas, and problems. These conclusions
are based upon discussions in N.L. Gage and D.C. Berliner,
Educational Psychology (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1975).
This book summarizes relevant research. See especially units
22, 23, and 24.]
E. Our decision in favor of the common list of works
taught in small classes has entailed our acceptance of the fact
that most of the teachers in the course would not be specia
lists in all the material they teach. But we think that an
intelligent, educated nonspecialist, with conscientious prepa-"~
ration, can' help other intelligent people achieve a serious
understanding of a work and some of its contexts. We also
see no major obstacle to nonspecialists being helped by their
colleagues with specialized knowledge to improve their un
derstanding and teaching of the works.
111. The recommended course
For the reasons outlined in 11, we strongly recommend a
course with the following components as the way in which to
satisfy the requirement.
A. All students will study the same works and be ex
amined on them in the same examinations. Limited variations
in the works and examinations may be permitted to accom
modate the special interests of the teachers.
B. The list of works studied will have varying degrees of
intensity and superficiality: it may, for example, emphasize
periods of unusually interesting intellectual and political acti
vity, such as sth-century B.C. Greece, 17th-century Europe,
and 19th- and 20th-century Europe and America.
C. The list of works studied and the syllabuses of the
course will be determined collectively by the actual teachers
in the course. [In an appendix (available on request from the
academic secretary) we have attached sample lists and general
outlines of syllabuses for the three quarters of the course.
Reflecting the interests of the persons who developed them,
they differ somewhat in character and format.
[But whatever their differences, they made it possible for
us to see if our proposal made intellectual and educational
sense, and to let you make that judgment. They, or others
like them, might also serve as guides to the faculty teaching
the course. But they are merely samples and in no way
prescriptive.]
D. Students will study the works and their contexts for
one year in three five-unit classes and be examined on them
at the end of each quarter. Insofar as possible, examinations
in the second and third quarters will encourage students to
relate material studied earlier in the course to that studied

later. Students should be strongly encouraged to satisfy the
requirement in their freshman year.
E. Students will write at least 10 to 12 pages per quarter,
distributed as the teachers see fit.
F. Regular members of the faculty will teach as many of
the classes as possible, preferably at least one third, so that
each student will have the opportunity to study with a
regular member of the faculty for at least one quarter.
G. Emeriti professors and postdoctoral instructors, the
latter appointed for fixed terms (for example, for three years,
with the possibility of renewal for a further three years), will
teach the remaining classes.
H. Twenty students in each class is an absolute maximum.
Every reduction of class-size from 20 in the direction of 12
to 1 5 improves the quality of the student's active engagement
with the worlds and the discussion of them with others. Such
reductions should be made whenever financially possible.
[Studies have shown that the discussion mode becomes inef
fective when class size goes beyond 20 students. Similarly,
any reduction in class size below 20 consistently yields great
er participation of students. The very quality of the course
depends upon instruction in small classes.
[There is, of course, no way to ensure in advance the
quality of discussion classes. Age and experience do not
correlate consistently with student ratings of teachers. It is
clear, however, that teaching in small classes can be im
proved, and we believe that a desirable adjunct to the course
would be a program for improvement of the teaching skills of
all teachers in the course. See Gage and Berliner, Educational
Psychology. ].
I. Each class will meet for two two-hour periods each
week. A lecture on Monday of each week will supplement the
knowledge of contexts gained from secondary texts, help fill
gaps between emphasized periods, and clarify particularly
difficult works. An hour on Friday of each week will be kept
open for optional lectures on special subjects: for example,
on the ways in which works discussed in the classes might be
approached from different disciplinary perspectives.
J. The course will be administered by a committee on the
Western culture requirement appointed by the dean of hu
manities and sciences in consultation with other relevant
deans. The committee, always subject to the approval of the
dean, will be responsible for recruiting members of the facul
ty to teach in the course, hiring instructors, and monitoring
the quality of the course. The committee will ensure that all
teachers in the course are evaluated by the University's mech
anisms for evaluation of teachers.
K. The course will be tested in a pilot program for two
years before it is required of all students. In the first year of
the pilot program, 100 to 200 students will be invited to
volunteer to take the course; in the second year 400-500 will
be invited. While the pilot program cannot test the impact of

a requirement per se on the students' perception o'f the
course, it can test the internal soundness of the course and
the responses of students to it.
IV. Conditions for the success of the recommended course
We think the success of the course depends on two
conditions being met:
A. Because the course cannot be funded entirely by a
reallocation of existing resources within the budget Of Hu
manities and Sciences, money not currently in that budget
must be used to fund part of it. While department! might
reasonably be asked to allocate some of their teaching re
sources to the course, some, if not full, compensation mutt
be made to the departments, especially to small departments
that have already been stretched to what thay perceive to b«
their lirTytt by BAP and BEP.
B. A sufficient number of faculty must be intareitad in
teaching this kind of transdiscipllnary course to ansura its
quality and its standing in tha University. Wa think that soma
members of the faculty might be anticad by the prospect of
summer fellowships (for which foundation money might ba
raised) to prepare themselves for teeching the course; some
like teaLners of the Reneissence who could reeducete them
selves in the ancient classics, both to teach in the first and
second quarters of the course and to improve their other
teaching of the Renaissance-would almost certainly ba de
lighted with the opportunity. But we do not have the re
sources to make a survey of the opinion of the faculty about
the course and the conditions under which they would teach
it; we would therefore like both tha permission and the aid of
C-US to prepare and conduct such a survey as soon as
possible. \
V. Impact of distribution requirements \
Adopting this course to satisfy the Western culture re
quirement may warrant a reconsideration by C-US of the
distribution requirements, especially in the case of students
in the School of Engineering. We have heard arguments from
several students, especially engineers, that this course should
satisfy the humanities distribution requirement.
We are in tentative agreement that, except possibly for
engineers, it should not do so because the course is transdisci
plinary in character and because, in our view, the primary
function of the distribution requirements is to introduce
students to the methods of the major disciplines as ways of
approaching experience. But we are passing on these views
informally because C-US has not charged us with reconsidera
tion of the distribution requirement. [In a similar vein, if
C-US does reconsider the distribution requirement, we would
commend to you two problems that we have not been able to
solve in relation to the Western culture requirement.
[From many quarters students and faculty have pressed
upon us two facts of which we have been aware from the
beginning: a requirement in Western culture is ethnocentric
in character, and virtually any way of satisfying it does not
pay sufficient attention to technology.
[We have discussed and will continue to discuss the possi
blity of requiring anywhere from one to three satellite cours
es, orbiting around the core, which would treat, for example,
the history of the relationship between technology and so
ciety, the history of the drama, and the like, with the course
or courses to satisfy distribution requirements in either the
humanities or the social sciences depending on their discipli
nary approach.
[But we have not been able to reach agreement on this
issue because some of our members argue that such a require
ment would result more appropriately from a change in the
distribution requirements than from an addition to the West
ern culture requirement. We would be grateful if C-US took
up this problem in any reconsideration of the distribution
requiiements or if it instructed us to consider the problem as
part of our charge.)
VI. Alternatives to the recommended course
We have discussed at some length two alternatives to the
recommended course:
A. Students choose from among a multiplicity of courses,
offered by individual members of the faculty oi by depart
ments, approved by a supervisory committee only if they
meet certain criteria: for example, treat three of four peri
ods—ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern; deal with
themes like man's relationship to self, society, nature; con
sider religious conceptions; draw works from more than one
national tradition; involve teachers from more than one de
partment or discipline; discuss some specified authors.
B. Students choose from among History 1, 2, 3; Humani
ties 61, 62, 63; and a small version of the recommended
course.
We consider both the alternatives viable but not nearly so
desirable educationally as the recommended course. One mo
tive of those who favor such alternatives seems to be eco
nomic. But we think any course or courses worthy ot satis
fying the requirement would have to be staffed in a way
vrfiich is more expensive than the model so prevalent in the
University of lectures supplemented by TA-taught sections.
History 1, 2, 3, in which the sections are led by instruc
tors paid $2,000 per quarter, apparently possesses the re
quired quality. But extending that model to all courses satis
fying the requirement would require hiring many instructors
at $2,000 per quarter. We do not see that the differences in
cost between such an approach and our recommended course
would be so substantial as to warrant preference of the
alternatives for financial reasons
