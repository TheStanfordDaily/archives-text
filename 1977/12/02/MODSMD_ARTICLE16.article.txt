# Third World student and Western culture

Following is a position paper, "The Third World Student
and the Western Culture Requirement" by Francis G Wong,
student member of the advisory panel and student assistant
to the Ombudsman.
From the very beginning, the revival of the Western Cul
ture requirement has been looked upon with apprehension
within the Third World community on campus. A popularly
held viewpoint has been that the return of such a require
ment to Stanford is exemplary of the current trend within
the University toward greater insensitivity to the concern of
minority students. Indeed, this attempt to reintroduce more
traditional academic concerns (what some have called "eth
nocentric") into the curriculum at a time when increasingly
severe cutbacks threaten the survival of ethnic studies arouses
the imagination.
On the other hand there are those in the community who
can see validity in the claims of the proponents of the
requirement. To be sure we are all participants in a society
based on a set of traditions rooted in the development of
Western civilization; the study of these traditions is a pre
requisite to the understanding of societal dynamics. However,
a major concern is that the historical neglect that traditional
academics has accorded the experience of nonwhites in West
ern society will manifest itself in the presentation of the
courses.
Such a situation would cause these courses to become
irrelevant to the experience of Third World students and so
further the alienation that exists for these students at Stan
ford. It must be remembered that one of the motivating
factors for campus unrest within the Third World community
during the late 1960s and early 1970s was such a failure to
speak to the experience of people of color.
How then can this situation be averted? In the first place
the set of assumptions at the basis of the requirement's
rationale must be extended to include this one: while we may
all be participants in Western civilization, the historical rela
tionships between racial groupings in American society has
defined differing experiences and so, differing perspectives.
In other words'people of color relate to the values of the
vtfute majority differently than the members of that major
ity. This view, one might add, is consistent with* the analysis
forwarded by Paul Seaver in suggesting that ideas be viewed
in their social context. With this in mind, proposals for

adjustments within the scheme being proposed by the Task
Force can be made.
At this time the Western Culture Task Force is proposing
a plan that calls for small classes led by regular faculty or by
postdoctoral preceptors hired to teach the courses. In order
to make the courses relevant to the Third World student,
instructors who can bring to the classroom (structural
changes in the administration of the requirement might be
necessary) an analysis originating from a Third World pers
pective must be hired. In this way the presentation of the
material would be sensitive to the experience of Third World
people.
Of course it must be noted that this perspective is not one
born out of the personal experience of someone who happens
to be nonwhite, but one that is the product of the study of
how nonwhites relate to the white majority and within their
own communities—an understanding of the collective experi
ence of Third World people in this country. Indeed, such an
instructor would have to have more than a cursory exposure
to ethnic studies.
Goals should be set for the hiring of personnel with such
qualifications and progress toward these goals monitored by
minority participation in hiring procedures. Without such
goals and safeguards, the University will fail to satisfy the
need for the hiring of such individuals, as evidenced by its
poor track record with regard faculty affirmative action.
All things considered, the adjustments in the Western
Culture requirement proposed here are consonant with the
view expressed in the Stanford amicus brief in the Bakke
case, that:
"The differences in experience that arise out of growing
up black, or chicano, or Puerto Rican, or Native American
(or Asian-American), enable students who are members of
these groups to introduce into the University community
important perceptions and understandings. An education
al process enriched in this way is not only of great
importance to students: it broadens the perspectives of
teachers and thus tends to extend the reach of the curri
culum and the range of the scholarly interests of the
faculty."
By bringing instructors who have in their intellectual
pursuits abstracted from the minority experience an analysis
of society, these ambitions can be furthered to a greater
degree.

need for the hiring of such individuals, as evidenced by its
poor track record with regard faculty affirmative action.
All things considered, the adjustments in the Western
Culture requirement proposed here are consonant with the
view expressed in the Stanford amicus brief in the Bakke
case, that:
"The differences in experience that arise out of growing
up black, or chicano, or Puerto Rican, or Native American
(or Asian-American), enable students who are members of
these groups to introduce into the University community
important perceptions and understandings. An education
al process enriched in this way is not only of great
importance to students: it broadens the perspectives of
teachers and thus tends to extend the reach of the curri
culum and the range of the scholarly interests of the
faculty."
By bringing instructors who have in their intellectual
pursuits abstracted from the minority experience an analysis
of society, these ambitions can be furthered to a greater
degree.

Following is a position paper, "The Third World Student
and the Western Culture Requirement" by Francis G Wong,
student member of the advisory panel and student assistant
to the Ombudsman.
From the very beginning, the revival of the Western Cul
ture requirement has been looked upon with apprehension
within the Third World community on campus. A popularly
held viewpoint has been that the return of such a require
ment to Stanford is exemplary of the current trend within
the University toward greater insensitivity to the concern of
minority students. Indeed, this attempt to reintroduce more
traditional academic concerns (what some have called "eth
nocentric") into the curriculum at a time when increasingly
severe cutbacks threaten the survival of ethnic studies arouses
the imagination.
On the other hand there are those in the community who
can see validity in the claims of the proponents of the
requirement. To be sure we are all participants in a society
based on a set of traditions rooted in the development of
Western civilization; the study of these traditions is a pre
requisite to the understanding of societal dynamics. However,
a major concern is that the historical neglect that traditional
academics has accorded the experience of nonwhites in West
ern society will manifest itself in the presentation of the
courses.
Such a situation would cause these courses to become
irrelevant to the experience of Third World students and so
further the alienation that exists for these students at Stan
ford. It must be remembered that one of the motivating
factors for campus unrest within the Third World community
during the late 1960s and early 1970s was such a failure to
speak to the experience of people of color.
How then can this situation be averted? In the first place
the set of assumptions at the basis of the requirement's
rationale must be extended to include this one: while we may
all be participants in Western civilization, the historical rela
tionships between racial groupings in American society has
defined differing experiences and so, differing perspectives.
In other words'people of color relate to the values of the
vtfute majority differently than the members of that major
ity. This view, one might add, is consistent with* the analysis
forwarded by Paul Seaver in suggesting that ideas be viewed
in their social context. With this in mind, proposals for

adjustments within the scheme being proposed by the Task
Force can be made.
At this time the Western Culture Task Force is proposing
a plan that calls for small classes led by regular faculty or by
postdoctoral preceptors hired to teach the courses. In order
to make the courses relevant to the Third World student,
instructors who can bring to the classroom (structural
changes in the administration of the requirement might be
necessary) an analysis originating from a Third World pers
pective must be hired. In this way the presentation of the
material would be sensitive to the experience of Third World
people.
Of course it must be noted that this perspective is not one
born out of the personal experience of someone who happens
to be nonwhite, but one that is the product of the study of
how nonwhites relate to the white majority and within their
own communities—an understanding of the collective experi
ence of Third World people in this country. Indeed, such an
instructor would have to have more than a cursory exposure
to ethnic studies.
Goals should be set for the hiring of personnel with such
qualifications and progress toward these goals monitored by
minority participation in hiring procedures. Without such
goals and safeguards, the University will fail to satisfy the
need for the hiring of such individuals, as evidenced by its
poor track record with regard faculty affirmative action.
