# Survivors tell of plane crash ordeal

Aspen, Colo. (AP) — Seventeen
year-old Charles Randolph spoke from
his hospital bed Wednesday of trudg
ing down a Colorado mountain in
waist-deep snow with frost-bitten feet
to get help for five otner survivors of a
plane crash.
While crash investigators examined
the wreckage of a twin-engine plane
pancaked high on the side of a Col
orado mountain, Randolph talked of
the moment of impact and the fight of
the six survivors to live through two
nights of blowing snow and below-zero
temperatures.
There were seven Oklahoma City re
sidents on the plane when it crashed
Sunday night at the 11,600-foot level of
Haystack Mountain. One was dead
when Randolph set out early Monday to
walk 15 miles through waist-deep snow
for help. He was the least injured of the
survivors.
"I just kept trying to walk downhill,"
said Randolph, his feet still purple with
frostbite as he talked at Aspen Valley
Medical Center.
A hospital spokesman said doctors
did not know whether they could save
his feet.
The six survivors and the body of C.
Cameron, 49, head of an Oklahoma

City insurance firm, were airlifted to
Aspen before dark. Three of the most
seriously injured survivors later were
flown to Denver.
The tragedy came at the end of a
Thanksgiving ski vacation.
Aboard the plane when it took off
from Aspen were Cameron, his wife Jo
Carole, 41; their son Bill, 18, and
daughter Lynda, 17; Randolph and
another school friend of the young
Camerons, 16-year-old Karen Mills, and
the pilot of the plane, Terry Deplois, 30.
In serious but stable condition at
Lutheran Hospital in Denver on Wed
nesday were Mrs. Cameron, Bill Came
ron, and Deplois.
The other three survivors were in fair
condition.
Randolph had no food and little to
drink when he set off from the crash
site. He had on thermal underwear and
ski clothes as he stumbled through the
drifts above the timberline.
Late Monday, he said, he found a
hunters' blind, wrapped himself in a
sheet of plastic for warmth, and went to
sleep beneath a pine tree — a sleep
interrupted by hallucinations of people
in automobiles nearby.
When he awoke Tuesday morning,
his feet were frozen.

"They felt like clubs," Randolph said.
He hobbled on, discovered a drainage
ditch, then a fence, which he followed.
Randolph was standing in the middle
of an open snowfield, waving his hands
above his head, when he was spotted
by a rescue helicopter at midafternoon
Tuesday.
"I never really did give up hope, al
though I did get discouraged at times,"
he said.
Things were little better back at the
crash site, Mills said.
"We talked about a hospital, warm
beds and food for two days," she said
from her hospital bed. In fact, she ad
ded, no one had any appetite, and the
Fritos and sweet rolls they had went
untouched.
She kept her spirits up the first day by
taking care of Mrs. Cameron and De
plois, Miles said. The second day was
worse.
"They were in a lot of pain. We
thought Charlie Randolph was dead
and wasn't coming back," she said.
"Yes, we gave up hope."
She broke into tears when asked
what she thought as she heard the re
scue helicopter approaching.
"I've . . . I've never been so happy,"
she said.
