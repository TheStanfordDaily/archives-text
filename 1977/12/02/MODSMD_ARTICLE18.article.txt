# Brown starts search for mental health director

### 
Sacramento (AP) — The
Brown administration started
its search for new top state
health officials Wednesday and
said the first priority was a new
mental health director.
Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of
staff, Gray Davis, said Brown
hopes to be presented a list of
candidates for the mental
health job in a month to six
weeks because that field is
"where the need is most pres
sing."
Davis and other administra
tion officials met with panels
representing doctors, hospi
tals, local health programs and

patients who will search for di
rectors for five new health de
partments.
They will replace the
22,000-employe state Health
Department next July.
The department, formed by
a 1971 merger, has been
plagued by scandals in prepaid
health plans and state hospi
tals, exploding costs in Medi-
Cal, and complaints of overall
mismanagement.
Davis said a bill signed by
Brown in September, breaking
up the department, would
create "a smaller and more
manageable system" for each

program.
"We think the present
Health Department exceeds
anyone's possible control," he
told reporters after the meet
ing.
He said the search would be
nationwide and undoubtedly
will bring some new faces into
state government, but he
wouldn't rule out the possibil
ity that some present state
health officials would get top
jobs.
Asked whether the panels'
recommendations would be
followed, Davis said only
Brown had the authority to

make appointments. But he
and several panel directors
said later there was an under
standing that the governor
would choose from among
those recommended.
Davis also said Sen. Arlen
Gregorio (D-San Mateo),
sponsor of the breakup bill,
had agreed to carry another bill
letting Brown appoint the new
directors next April so they
could be confirmed by the
state Senate before their de
partments are established.
The head of the panel look
ing for a mental health direc
tor, Peter Dußois of the

California Mental Health As
sociation, said he would urge
more money for local mental
health programs and better
coordination between state
and local efforts.
"Until recently we have had
difficulty getting adequate and
appropriate response from the
state," he said. "Recently the
governor has evidenced mar
kedly more interest."
