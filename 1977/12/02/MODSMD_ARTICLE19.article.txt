# Talk back TV: a reality in Ohio
## 
### 
Columbus, Ohio (AP) —
When the Henry Eckhart family
didn't like the rock show they
were watching on television
recently, they pushed a button
attached to a computer in their
living room. So many other
viewers did the same that the
emcee signed the program off
the air.
Starting Thursday, cable
television subscribers all over
Columbus will be able to talk
back to their TV sets — voting
shows off the air, answering
quiz questions, bidding in auc
tions, and even second
guessing coaches in sporting
events.
N The Eckharts were among
200 families who tested the
computer device called QUBE,
which was designed by Warner
Communications Corp.,
whose largest cable outlet is
the 100,000-home Columbus
market.
For a $19.95 installation fee
and $10.95 a month, subscrib
ers can get cable service plus
the black computer box at
tached to an 18-button con
sole. The buttons let viewers
choose channels and make re
sponses to the shows.
Officials will not discuss
subscriber numbers, but be
fore the advent of QUBE,
Warner Cable claimed 26,500
subscribers.
Claudine Eckhart recalled
the night she, her husband and

their children were watching
one of the 30 cable channels
that had "a rock show on, play
ing records.
"They asked the audience
whether they should continue
the show or cut it off," she
said. "We didn't like it and
voted 'no.' The emcee said,
'The majority rules. Thank you
and good night.' And the show
signed off. Our vote counted."
Susie Russell, who took part
in the test with her husband
said they especially enjoyed
the quiz shows and would
"compete to see who got the
most questions right."
"One night he would have
the console, the next night I
would get it. One night, he was
out .ind I took a sports quiz,"
she said.
Russell said she also took
part in an auction, "but I only
bid once before I chickened
out."
"They would show an article
and ask how many people
would bid $5 for it. Then the
bidding agent went up until
there was only one person
left," she said.
Like other cable systems,
QUBE's 30 channels include
some that offer nothing but
stock market listings, con
sumer information or prog
rams for pre-school children.

Columbus, Ohio (AP) —
When the Henry Eckhart family
didn't like the rock show they
were watching on television
recently, they pushed a button
attached to a computer in their
living room. So many other
viewers did the same that the
emcee signed the program off
the air.
Starting Thursday, cable
television subscribers all over
Columbus will be able to talk
back to their TV sets — voting
shows off the air, answering
quiz questions, bidding in auc
tions, and even second
guessing coaches in sporting
events.
N The Eckharts were among
200 families who tested the
computer device called QUBE,
which was designed by Warner
Communications Corp.,
whose largest cable outlet is
the 100,000-home Columbus
market.
For a $19.95 installation fee
and $10.95 a month, subscrib
ers can get cable service plus
the black computer box at
tached to an 18-button con
sole. The buttons let viewers
choose channels and make re
sponses to the shows.
Officials will not discuss
subscriber numbers, but be
fore the advent of QUBE,
Warner Cable claimed 26,500
subscribers.
