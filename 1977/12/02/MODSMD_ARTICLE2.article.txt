# Strides forward in 10 years since Barnard transplant
## 
### Andrea James 
Ten years ago tomorrow, Dr.
Christiaan Barnard performed the
first successful human heart trans
plant but patient Louis Washkansky
lived a bare two weeks past the
surgery.
Cardiovascular surgical
techniques have improved greatly
since December 1967. One major ad
vance came in August 1973 when
heart surgeons here began flying
disembodied live hearts to the Medi
cal Center from various points in the
West. The hearts are surgically in
serted into waiting patients at the
center.
Of six recipients of the disem
bodied organs, four remain alive.
University surgeons travel as far as
the Las Vegas area, about 600 miles,
to obtain hearts and kidneys for
transplant.
Flying the organs around the reg
ion was made possible by a coopera
tive arrangement with the Regional
Organ Procurement Agency for
Southern California. The agency also
provides organs for kidney and liver
transplant programs in California,
Nevada and Colorado.
Transplant pioneer Dr. Norman
Shumway, head of cardiovascular
surgery here, was also among the
first to use the hypothermic heart
transportation method, according to
Assoc. Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong, a
former transplant team member.
The technique requires that the
metabolic demand of the organ be
reduced by immersion in cold saline
solution.
"All tissues require oxygen to
live," Dong explained. "The demand
of oxygen is proportional to the
temperature of the organ. The colder
the organ, the less oxygen is re
quired."
Another way to keep hearts alive
after being removed from bodies is

by perfusion â€” mechanically supply
ing oxygen to them.
"Blood can be mechanically
pumped into the arteries of the
heart, but this technique isn't as safe
as hypothermia," Dong said. "The
blood vessels of the heart are too
easily damaged when perfusion is
used."
Perfusion is commonly used to
keep disembodied kidneys alive, but
Dong said the kidney can withstand
some damage and still support life
which a heart must perform perfectly
immediately after a patient receives
it.
"A kidney recipient can be without
the fully operational kidney for about
two or three days," Dong said. "The
heart has to start functioning right
after the patient receives it. Also,
with a kidney, if something goes
wrong, several days can elapse be
fore the person's life is in danger."
The heart beats until the moment it
is removed from the body. During
transport, the organ appears dead.
"But it is alive," Dong said. "It has
to be, because it resumes function
after it is sewn back into a human
body." Nonetheless, the donors are
legally dead because of brain inactiv
ity.
"This shakes the preconceived no
tions of life and death, because the
heart and other organs are still alive
and functional," Dong said. "Usually
the donors are accident victims who
have suffered a trauma to the head,
or stroke victims."
Some heart donors are homicide
victims, he said. In these cases, legal
problems can arise over declarations
of death.
"We can't transport a homicide
victim until a coroner has declared
the person legally dead," Dong said.
Transporting organs rather than
entire bodies often relieves the pres
sure from donor families. "Some

times families are more comfortable
if a specific organ is transported
rather than the whole body," said
Lois Christopherson, chief social
worker in the Department of
Surgery.
Dong added that transporting or
gans rather than bodies is also less
costly.
The older the donor, the more
careful doctors are about his or her
physical condition.
"The heart is less apt to have a
chronic disease in a younger per
son," Dong said. "Males over 35 and
females over 40 have more chance of
having heart disease."
Dond said complete transplants
are not the only way to correct
blood-pumping deficiencies.
"If a valve is not functioning prop
erly, it is much easier to replace the
valve than the entire heart," Dong
said. "If the coronary arteries are
damaged, we do a bypass operation,
in which a vein is removed from a
different area of the body and con
nected to the heart in such a way that
the blocked heart artery is bypas
sed."
Dong added that the blocked ar
tery is usually left in place.
University surgeons performed
their 128 th heart transplant in late
August. Fifty-one recipients are still
alive. The longest survivor received
his new heart in January 1970.
The University has been involved
in heart transplant research since
1966 and has received grants from
the National Institutes of Health to
research human heart transplants
since 1970.
The heart transplant team here,
Drs. Shumway, Philip Oyer and Ed
ward Stinson, usually perform two
transplants per month, Dong said.
A heart transplant requires four to
six surgeons, he added.
