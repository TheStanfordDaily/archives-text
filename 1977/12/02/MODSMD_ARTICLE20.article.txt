# Husband-wife team keeps Human Bio in motion
## 
### Jean Kimmel 
The husband and wife team of Merton
and Audrey Bernfield show that work and
marriage do go together. Merton, active in
clinical pediatrics and postdoctoral train
ing is Human Biology program director.
Audrey is a psychologist and the director
of advising for the program.
"I like working with my wife," Merton
said.
"It's fun working with Mert. He writes
me memos," Audrey said.
Audrey first came to the program last
year when Donald Kennedy, former
Human Bio program director, now direc
tor of the Food and Drug Administration,
asked her to develop a student advising
program.
"I was a trail blazer," she said. The stu
dent advising program is uniqueto Human
Bio. "It was quite a challenge. I was scared
it wouldn't work."
Success
Her advising program, which offers peer
advising on a one-to-one basis and in
groups, however, was so successful that
before Kennedy left, he formalized her re
sponsibility as a part-time staff position.
Although it is only a part-time job, Au
drey said she spends three fourths of her
time working in Human Bio.
"Human Bio is my first priority. At first I
was afraid of being institutionalized into a
staff member. When I feel what I'm doing
is not exciting, I'll quit," she said.
"Audrey is full of confidence and
enthusiasm," said Tibby Simon, Human
Bio administrative assistant.
"She's a special person," Merton said.
"Her enthusiasm for the program and the
people of Human Bio drew me into the
program," he added.
Audrey's job means meeting continu
ally with students.
Service-minded
"I like working with people who come
to me by free choice. I thrive in an atmos
phere of service and continual feedback,"
she said.
"She's great," said one student.
With a masters degree in counseling
psychology from the University of Califor
nia at Santa Clara, she is an expert at her
job.

"I like to think of myself as a facilitator, I
don't tell people what to do. I help them
find their own uniqueness," she said.
Her most recent endeavor is to get
Honor students together with faculty
members.
"She's an excellent resource person.
She puts people together where their
needs coincide," Merton said.
Researcher
Merton, known for his research in
molecular and developmental biology,
was appo'nted Human Biology program
director in June.
He is responsible for coordinating and
developing the infant program.
The goal of the Human Bio program is to
combine the study of the biological and
social sciences and prepare students to
make policy decisions that involve both
fields.
Most Human Bio faculty members be
long to other departments and teach only
certain courses within the program. This
gives the program its interdisciplinary
quality but at the same time, "one of the
biggest struggles the program encounters
is faculty identification," Merton said. Be
cause the program is not a hard-fast de
partment, its teaching staff is varied and
changing.
"I don't claim to have all the answers.
We're all growing and learning together,"
Merton said. "I like to feel we're giving
professors the opportunity to teach here."
New experience
Merton had given special lectures on
human development when Kennedy was
program director.
"It's hard for him to go from running
labs with post docs to teaching basic biol
ogy to undergrads," Audrey said.
This has been Merton's first orientation
to undergrads. "I like seeing the excite
ment in the students when things click â€”
the wows," he said.
"When Kennedy left, everyone thought
the program would fall apart, but Dr.
Bernfield has done a great job organizing
everything with the rest of the staff,"
commented one of the core teaching as
sistants.
Merton will be program director for
three years. "This first year is a learning

year, the second is for implementation
and the third to evolve," Merton said.
He added that he plans to structure the
program and make it more rigorous so that
it doesn't change too drastically from year
to year,
"Human biology is not a discipline,
therefore we must define what we want to
include and still remain flexible," he said.
"Other plans are to renovate the
facilities that are conducive to informal
meeting between students and faculty."
He said he believes in student contact. "I
learn from students," he said.
Dedication
Merton still lectures in the program's
natural sciences area. "I put a lot of time
into my lectures."
In a class lecture on protein synthesis,
he related how his wife was having their
first child at the same time he was an intern
involved with genetic decoding under Dr.
Marshall Nirenberg, 1968 Nobel Prize re
cipient.
"I had to call the lab from the hospital
during her delivery to see what was hap
pening there," he said.
"You can tell he wants so much for us to
learn," claimed one student.
"I can tell Dr. Bernfield is enthusiastic
about teaching but sometimes his lectures
are hard to understand," another student
added. Merton said he can bean "uptight"
instructor.
Crowing together
Audrey and Merton both attend most
Human Bio core lectures and many times
sit together. Both commented on how
much they learn by attending lectures.
Both commented on the importance of
education as teaching a thinking process.
They are equally enthusiastic about the
Human Bio program and those involved
with the program.
"Human Bio students are creative," Au
drey said.
"Human Bio students put out," Merton
added. "I like to think of the program as a
small college in a big university where
people can feel at home."
For both the Human Bio program and
the Bernfields, "this has been a fantastic
growth year," Audrey said.
