# The

## PA theater you're missing 
### 
The Bureau of Western
Mythology is a Palo Alto-based
experimental theater com
pany. Its recent efforts include
an English language premiere
of a Dutch play called
"Moratorium," an original
translation of Euripides' "The
Bacchae," an Appalachian
American musical entitled
"The Dark of the Moon" and
several absurdist one-acts.
Also an original production
from within the cast called
"Men's Dance," a mixed
media presentation of Lewis
Carroll's "Alice in Wonder
land" and "Through the Look
ing Glass," an original adap
tion of "A Child's Christmas in
Wales," and a fractured fairy
tale answering to the name,
"Beauty and the Beanstalk."
Wednesday its version
of "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" opened in the cultural
center in the Palo Alto au
ditorium.
All of this will come as a sur
prise to nearly everyone at
Stanford. Even though half of
The Bureau's experimenters
went to school here the
organization has almost no
campus following.
That is disappointing, notes
"Midsummer" director
Richard Carp. "We have been
amazed at how few Stanford
people seem to go off campus
to look for any kind of enter

tainment. Our audience has
been almost entirely from Palo
Alto, but I'm not sure but what
younger people might not like
what we do better."
Needless to say, "what we
do" is the operative phrase in
the above sentence. Besides
the tendency to perform in
other than theatrical spaces,
Carp speaks of "a lot of exper
imenting with the relationship
between the performers and
their audience. A lot of
theater provides a very remote
experience — you sit here and
you lay back and look at some
thing way up there in a pretty
little box in a frame—and we're
interested in getting away from
that.
"Midsummer," for example,
will be staged very much as a
festival. Imagine what the
Globe theater was like, with
vendors selling everything in
the aisles, with little kids run
ning around, with people mak
ing love in the back corner.
We've tried to recreate that for
our production."
It seems a good idea, and
Carp does not think it will
prove distracting, since "Mid
summer" is an energetic
play. "It has a high court, and
lovers running away to an en
chanted forest, and mischievi
ous fairies. It has mistaken
identities, fights between lov
ers, a happy ending, and an

anything-but-refined (and any
thing but tragical) production
within the play of 'The Tragedy
of Pyrimus and Thisbee.' All
this, plus a subtext reeking of
western pornographic fan
tasies."
Carp seems to know what's
he's doing, and Palo Alto
seems to agree. "A Midsum
mer Night's Dream" looks to
be an excellent example of the
Bureau's work. So never mind
if you've never heard of it —
that's probably your fault.
