# Partying with Gershwin, Porter
## 
### 
"A Marvelous Party" is the
lighthearted, lightheaded song
and dance which, along with
Marlene Dietrich and bathtub
gin, gave the '20s their loudest
roar. It's Barry Koron's tribute
to the witty melodies of
George (Koron) and Ira Ger
shwin, Cole Porter (James
Sodeman), Oscar Hammers
tein II and Jerome Kern. It also
honors through imitation
Broadway greats like Ethel
Merman (Julie Knox), Al Jolson
(Skip Covington) and Helen
Morgan (Carolyn Zaremba).
Most of the show pours like
champagne, bubbly good fun
without much thought about
substance. The plot and
dialogue are banal, but who
really cares? This show is

nusic, and the score runs like a
Hall of Eame of the '20s New
York stage.
At this harmonious cocktail
party, we hear (among dozens
of other songs) Morgan's tor
chy "Can't Help Lovin' Dat
Man" and "Love for Sale,"
Ruby Keeler's (Cindy Pingree)
squeal "Let's Step Out;" Jol
son's "Swanee" and "Liza (Till
the Clouds Roll By);" and Por
ter's silky "You Do Something
to Me."
Knox's Merman is the heart
of this show, from her perfectly
"cool" "I Get A Kick Out of
You" to the booming "I Got
Rhythm," backed by the tap
dancing cast.
Impersonations aside, David
Bryant ()ack) has the clearest

voice in the production and
Koron's "Rhapsody in Blue" on
a white baby grand is a glitter
ing piece of showmanship.
Though the staging is a little
ragged (partially because of the
limited stage space), the actors
cut some fancy dance steps
and keep this one and one-half
hour show running at a brisk if
occasionally jerky pace.
"A Marvelous Party," in the
Savoy Tivoli's backroom (with
bar and cabaret seating), is a
quick evening of fun for those
who get a kick out of bootleg
gers, flappers, Gershwin and
Porter.
