# Dine in the calm of Morocco without the desert

### 
Caravansary
310 Sutter St.
San Francisco
Feeling a need for some post
big game activity some of us
went into the city Monday
night to dinner and then ACT.
A friend who knows these
things, and who has lived near
San Francisco for a long time
advised us to go to the
Caravansary, and we thought
we would pass on the advice.
The Caravansary has several
locations in San Francisco but
we went to the one downtown

yellow table cloths, the fan that
wafts surrogate desert breeze
through the room, and the fact
that they give you two napkins:
a linen one for your lap, and a
paper one on which to place
your soiled silverware.
It brings a Monday evening
we were seated right away, and
one of the discreet waiters
dashed off with our drink or
ders. Some of us had a wiskey
sour, while others of had Dry
Sack.
The sour, though well mixed
on the strong side, turned out

'With us was a mysterious man with an
armload of liquor bottles. One of them was
Dry Sack, which was alright with us/

because it is only a few blocks
from the Geary Street Theater.
We parked outside the door in
a tow-away zone, that conve
niently stops being a tow-away
zone at 6 p.m., and went in.
It turns out that the Caravan
sary restaurant is on the sec
ond floor of the Caravansary
shop, an eclectic emporium
selling everything from satin
unicorns to stainless steel
pasta makers, so we took the
elevator. With us in the
elevator was a mysterious man
with an armload of liquor bot
tles. One of them was Dry
Sack, which was alright with
us.
The dining room is high
ceilinged with arches at one
end that suggest the middle
east. The room is well lit — you
can read the menu — but not
so well lit as to take the adven
ture out of searching for the
umbrella that you have
knocked behind the side
board.
We especially admired the

to be a mistake. It could not be
swallowed at the same time as
the mezza (a variety of mid
eastern hors d'oeuvres), that
come with the price of the din
ner. There are four of these
and their names are humus,
babu ganoush, and tabuleh,
and then pickled vegetables,
that have no other name.
They were all tasty, ranging
from a delicate white bean dip
sort of thing through the pick
les which were quite spicy. We

brief interlude of salad. This
consisted of romaine lettuce
with a vinaigrette dressing in
which dill figured importantly.
The salad was completed with a
liberal sprinkling of goat
cheese and a bit of red cabbage
for color.
Some of us said that mid
eastern salad should taste of o
live oil, and that this salad did
not. Some of us were just as
happy without the olive-oil
taste.
Finally we got down to seri
ous ordering. From dinners
that included chicken baked in
pomegranate sauce (6.95),
shish kebab (7.50), sirloin
(7.95), and quiche (4.95), we
chose lamb shank in yogurt
sauce (6.95), roast duck a la
Chef Setrak (7.50) and bone
less fresh trout (7.95).
Of these the trout was the
most attractive, appearing
among green peppers, to
matoes and onions, however it
was the least successful of the
dishes. Apparently somewhere
between the stream and the
table the trout spends some
time in the freezer; this gives it
a slightly dry taste.
The lamb and duck on the
other hand were superb. The
shank of lamb really did come
from a lamb, not from some
monster sheep, and it was still

'The lamb and the duck on the other hand

sheep, and it was still pink and tender, not
grey, the way lamb so often is.'

liked the one made of avocado
and another made of parsley
best.
After the mezza there was a

pink and tender, not grey, the
way lamb so often is. The sauce
was somewhat sour but en
hanced rather than overpo

wered the meat.
The sauce on the duck
served the task of removing
any greasy flavor from that
bird, while at the same time
adding a certain sweetness.
With our meal we had a Grey
Riesling wine ($5), which,
though a bit fruity, was served
in chilled glasses.
We would up this eating with
baklava, chocolate mousse,
and coffee. The mousse was so
sweet that our teeth hurt but
the baclava was surprisingly
light, and had a flaky crust. The
coffee was strong and good.
Then, feeling replete, we set
off for ACT. We should like to
be able to tell you all about that
too, but it was Ibsen, and after
that meal all we really could
have taken in was a musical
comedy.

Cafe Maroc
420 Ramona
Palo Alto
Ever dream of sitting like a
sheik on blue velvet cushions
under an orange and purple
tent, while being served de
lectable dishes of spicy Moroc
can foods? If so, a trip to Cafe
Maroc will treat you to a sensu
ally satisfying gourmet meal,
served in the traditional
Moroccan manner (where cus
tom dictates that all food be
eaten with one's hands).
A complete five course din
ner is $10.25, and begins with
Harira (lentil soup). This is de
licious: tastefully but not over
poweringly spiced with cumin,
coriander, saffron, ginger and
lemons and olives. Wedges of
heavy bread compliment this
pleasing version of a classic
soup.

Tangy tomato and eggplant
salad comes next. It is soothing
to the palate after the hot spicy
soup, if a bit difficult to eat with
unpracticed fingers.
Pastilla, which follows the
salad, is a definite winner. The
round, flaky, baklava-like crust
is filled with chicken which,
like the outer crust, has been
spinkled with powdered sugar.
Perhaps strange to some, the
delicate sweetness of the sugar
and chicken blended together
is sumptuous.
For the main entree, one has
a choice of five different lamb
dishes, and one each of beef,
chicken, rabbit, and turkey.
The delicate chicken is stuffed
with lots of chopped parsley,
garnished with olives, and
moderately flavored through
out with lemon.
You won't go wrong with

one of the lamb dishes. We
tried the lamb with honey; it
was tender and easily removed
from the bone. The honey
glaze was mouthwatering, and
even if you can't finish all of the
rich meat, you'll certainly want
to eat the honey soaked al
monds that cover it and lick the
sweet sauce off your fingers.
After the meal, waiters wash
your hands, sprinkle orange
scented water on you, and
bring cinnamon topped
orange slices.
Dining at Cafe Maroc is an
experience in contrasts and
compliments between the hot
and cold and the sweet and
spicy. Though it may seem a bit
expensive the good and un
usual food, congenial atmos
phere make the price well
worth paying.
