# Lapuyade imports French luxury

La Bourgogne
330 Mason Street
San Francisco
Dining at La Bourgogne is a
privilege and a delight because
the food is exquisitely pre
pared. Considered San Fran
cisco's ne plus ultre French re
staurant by boulevardier Herb
Caen, the restaurant has
perhaps the most demanding
clientele in the West.
What its clients get for their
money is discreet service and
distinguished food. No tacky
chords echo past diners from a
piano in an adjacent bar nor are
patrons prodingly force fed to
make way for a second seating.
Owner Jean Lapuyade has pro
duced a gourmet palace that
will have French majors won
dering why their teachers
urgad them to consult Petit
Larousse instead of Larousse
Castronomique.

It is hard to consider some
one in white tie and tails a wai
ter, but ours was Marcus, who
peerlessly guided us through
the menu written in French
without the common conces
sion to Americans, English
translations. He patiently de
scribed in English one of the
three dishes whose ingre
dients are flown in from Fr
ance, "Les Cailles Roti Pomme
Pailles."
As an aperitif my companion
and I shared a chablis Grand
Cru "Les Clos" ($l5) which lent
itself to our first course, Bar
quette of Baby Shrimp Joinville
($4.25), and Quenelles de Sole
Nantua ($4.50). My Quenelles
were the lightest fingers of sole
mousse covered in a lobster
sherry sauce that demanded
being mopped up with a long,
narrow slice of baguette,
French, not sourdough. A fork
full of the Barquette of Shrimp

proved to be equally savora
ble.
Before finishing the first
course an outstanding
Puligny-Montrachet ($24) was
brought to the table. This
proved to be the evening's
oenophile highnote, which to
my taste outshown the half
bottle of 1966 Chateau Mag
delaine Saint Emillion, ler
grand cru classe, which ac
companied my companion's
Medallions de Boeuf
Beaugency ($12.50) — tour
nados wrapped in bacon and
covered with Bearnaise sauce.
Accompanying my friend's
entree were lightly dressed
mushrooms while I parried
with Homard a la Nage
($17.50), a whole fresh lobster
plucked from the saltwater
aquarium in the foyer, boiled,
brought steaming to the table
and opened with finesse by
Marcus, who poured a creamy

sauce with, I believe, a dash of
lemon over it.
Artichaut Monaco ($2.75), an
artichoke heart filled with
pureed spinach, tomatoe and
cheese accompanied my lobs
ter non pareil. My only regret
was having to neglect the
Puligny-Montrachet and the
Saint Emillion to culminate our
dinner with tea and souffle
Harlequin ($7), a Grand Mar
nier and chocolate combination
souffle or, more accurately,
two separate combination
souffles covered on one side
with a light Grand Marnier
sauce and on the other
side,with a chocolate sauce.
My partner volunteered that
if she were to order the souffle
of her choice at La Bourgogne
in the future, it would be the
Grand Marnier. Both must be
ordered at the beginning of the
meal.
