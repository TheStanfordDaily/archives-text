Bourbon Street
Old Mill
2540 California St.
Mountain View
New Orleans, the city of
Mardi Gras and Dixieland Jazz,
is also the city of elegant re
staurants and Creole cuisine.
Steeped in the traditions of a
rich French heritage, New Or
leans is famous for its dark,
opulent soups, garlic baked
fish, and praline pastries.
Bourbon Street restaurant,
recently opened in the Old Mill
shopping complex, captures
much of the colorful and
flavorful essence of this old
time Southern city.
Initially, a handsome decor
and an extensive menu are
Bourbon Street's most obvious

assets. Wrought iron parti
tions, overhead fans, and pot
ted palms are pleasant remin
ders of the lazy charm and re
freshing hospitality of the
Louisiana plantation.
The dinner selection is
equally pleasing and offers a
range of eighteen entrees in
cluding such "local favorites"
as shrimp creole, seafood
gumbo, and deep-fried oys
ters. Appetizers are also avail
able; feeling adventuresome
we ordered the Oysters Two-
Two-Two ($3.95) and were
served two Oysters Rockefel
ler, two Oysters Brennan, and
two Oysters on Half-shell.
Our curiosity did not go un
rewarded. All three variations
are delicious testimonies to the
haute cuisine of New Orleans'
chefs (and Bourbon Street's
too).
For our main course we
selected the Barbecue Jumbo
Shrimp ($8.95) and the Tour

nedos Maurice ($9.95). Each
entree comes with sourdough
bread and butter and a choice
of Creole chowder or salad.
The chowder is a potpourri
of clam, shrimp, and seafood
chunks melded together in a
delicious and different blend
of paprika and herb season
ings. The salad, a combination
of iceberg lettuce, cherry to
matoes, and alfalfa sprouds, is
far less extraordinary.
The main courses arrived
after a considerable delay but
are nonetheless highly re
commended. The shrimp,
marinated and then broiled in a
spicy barbecue sauce, is served
with "Dirty Rice" and fresh
zucchini.
The Tournedos Maurice
consists of tender medallions
of beef, jumbo round shrimp,
and broccoli with hollandaise
sauce. Honey-glazed carrots
also accompany this meal,
i-resh vegetables, and careful

seasoning accent both dishes.
Undaunted by quantity and
with blatant disregard for any
reasonable diet, we ordered
the mint mousse ($1.95) and
Commander's Sundae for de
ssert. A whipped and airy con
coction of sweet chocolate and
mint flavorings, the mousse is a
perfect complement to any en
tree.
The Commander's Sundae,
named after a similar dish
served at the famous old
Command Hotel in New Or
leas, is a rich and gooey blend
of vanilla ice cream, caramel
syrup, and a crunchy praline
topping.
Far from inexpensive, Bour
bon Street offers an intimate
dining experience for that spe
cial occasion or that special
someone. Cood New Orleans
food and comfortable south
ern style make this restaurant
worth remembering.

i-resh vegetables, and careful

seasoning accent both dishes.
Undaunted by quantity and
with blatant disregard for any
reasonable diet, we ordered
the mint mousse ($1.95) and
Commander's Sundae for de
ssert. A whipped and airy con
coction of sweet chocolate and
mint flavorings, the mousse is a
perfect complement to any en
tree.
The Commander's Sundae,
named after a similar dish
served at the famous old
Command Hotel in New Or
leas, is a rich and gooey blend
of vanilla ice cream, caramel
syrup, and a crunchy praline
topping.
Far from inexpensive, Bour
bon Street offers an intimate
dining experience for that spe
cial occasion or that special
someone. Cood New Orleans
food and comfortable south
ern style make this restaurant
worth remembering.

Bourbon Street
Bourbon Street
Old Mill
2540 California St.
Mountain View
New Orleans, the city of
Mardi Gras and Dixieland Jazz,
is also the city of elegant re
staurants and Creole cuisine.
Steeped in the traditions of a
rich French heritage, New Or
leans is famous for its dark,
opulent soups, garlic baked
fish, and praline pastries.
Bourbon Street restaurant,
recently opened in the Old Mill
shopping complex, captures
much of the colorful and
flavorful essence of this old
time Southern city.
Initially, a handsome decor
and an extensive menu are
Bourbon Street's most obvious

assets. Wrought iron parti
tions, overhead fans, and pot
ted palms are pleasant remin
ders of the lazy charm and re
freshing hospitality of the
Louisiana plantation.
The dinner selection is
equally pleasing and offers a
range of eighteen entrees in
cluding such "local favorites"
as shrimp creole, seafood
gumbo, and deep-fried oys
ters. Appetizers are also avail
able; feeling adventuresome
we ordered the Oysters Two-
Two-Two ($3.95) and were
served two Oysters Rockefel
ler, two Oysters Brennan, and
two Oysters on Half-shell.
Our curiosity did not go un
rewarded. All three variations
are delicious testimonies to the
haute cuisine of New Orleans'
chefs (and Bourbon Street's
too).
For our main course we
selected the Barbecue Jumbo
Shrimp ($8.95) and the Tour

nedos Maurice ($9.95). Each
entree comes with sourdough
bread and butter and a choice
of Creole chowder or salad.
The chowder is a potpourri
of clam, shrimp, and seafood
chunks melded together in a
delicious and different blend
of paprika and herb season
ings. The salad, a combination
of iceberg lettuce, cherry to
matoes, and alfalfa sprouds, is
far less extraordinary.
The main courses arrived
after a considerable delay but
are nonetheless highly re
commended. The shrimp,
marinated and then broiled in a
spicy barbecue sauce, is served
with "Dirty Rice" and fresh
zucchini.
The Tournedos Maurice
consists of tender medallions
of beef, jumbo round shrimp,
and broccoli with hollandaise
sauce. Honey-glazed carrots
also accompany this meal,
i-resh vegetables, and careful

seasoning accent both dishes.
