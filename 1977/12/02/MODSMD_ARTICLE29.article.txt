## SCRIP demands divestment of nine stocks of U.S. firms in South Africa by Feb. 14 
### 
x Following is a Nov. 28 statement from the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible Investment Policy (SCRIP).
We are asking today that Stanford's Board of Trustees
divest the University's endowment fund of its holdings in
Union Carbide, Goodyear, General Motors, IBM, Ford, Gen
eral Electric, Del Monte, Mobil Oil, and the Bank of America.
All nine of these firms are currently doing business in
South Africa, lending material support to that country's
apartheid practices. We are setting Feb. 14th, the day of the
trustee's monthly meeting, as a deadline for a decision to
divest. We will expect the sale of these stocks within six
months of the trustee decision, ample time for the portfolio's
managers to proceed in an orderly and nondisruptive manner.
The two and one-half months between now and the
deadline allow a careful examination of the issues. We hope
that the administration and trustees do their homework. We
have done ours.
A decision to divest the nine companies will be the first
step toward ridding Stanford of all its South Africa holdings.
By its very nature as one of the country's most prestigious
universities, Stanford wields a great deal of influence: witness
the divestment report prepared by Vice-President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massy, which was seen on the
financial pages of newspapers across the country. With such
power comes responsibility. Present investment policy at
Stanford does nothing but encourage the status quo in South
Africa. The consequences of inaction mock Stanford's re
sponsibility as a member of a larger society.
There is no need here to go into the repugnant facts of
daily life for nonwhite South Africans. Instead we will briefly
mention the significance of the companies listed earlier.
Bank of America
Bank of America, with direct loans of 188 million dollars
to South African interests, has nearly 10% of all U.S. bank
loans to South Africa. One quarter of its loans have been
made direct'y to the South African government. These loans
are used to finance huge development projects and to boost
defense spending. This financing has helped to bail out the
South African economy when it has been unstable, most
recently after the Sovueto uprising of June 1976.
IBM
IBM controls between one-third and one-half of the
computer market in South Africa. IBM computers are used
by the Departments of Defense, Prisons, the Atomic Energy
Board, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
which oversees military research. IBM computers in the
Department of the Interior contain the information for the
"Book of Life," a registry which helps to control the
movements of all Colouted and Asian people.
Goodyear
Goodyear is one of the top three rubber producers in
South Africa. Three of its major customers are the mining
industry, the state-owned South African Railways (responsi

ble fot South Africa's public truck transport system), and the
government. In 1975, Goodyear completed construction of a
$10 million conveyor-belt plant near Port Elizabeth, bringing
its total investment in South Africa to over $25 million.
Goodyear has been unresponsive to requests for information
about its operations and relations with the South African
government. ,
General Electric
General Electric provides important high-technology elec
trical equipment to South African private industry. This is
used, for instance, to fully automate steel and iron factories
so they can operate around the clock. G.E. also supplies 80%
of South African diesel locomotives, which are essential to
industry and also to South Africa's security. General Electric
has actively sought to sell nuclear reactors and atomic energy
technology to South Africa.
Union Carbide
Union Carbide produces 20% of South African chrome. In
1976, Union Carbide opened a new $50 million ferrochrome
plant in partnership with an Afrikaner mining firm. This
plant is on the border of a Bantustan.
Union Carbide is also involved in vanadium mining and
smelting, producing an alloy never before produced outside
of the United States. The Financial Gazette, a South African
magazine, reported that this process "should earn considera
ble foreign exchange" for South Africa.
General Motors and Ford
General Motors and Ford control nearly a third of the
automobile market in South Africa. Both have had extensive
dealings with the South African government. Ford has ad
mittedly sold several million dollars in motor vehicles to the
South African police, military and other government agencies
during the last 10 years. Many G.M. vehicles are used by the
South African police for general activities, including transpor
tation of prisoners to jail.
Mobil Oil
All but one of the oil refineries in South Africa are owned
and operated by foreign oil companies. Mobil is one of these
and alone controls 20% of the petroleum products market.
Mobil has helped the South African government to build up
large strategic oil reserves to blunt the effect of future
economic sanctions.
/ Mobil has refused to release information about its dealings
with the South African government. In doing so they claim
the Official Secrets Act constrains them because "oil supplies
are the very lifeblood of the army, navy, and airforce" and
are therefore "of the utmost strategic importance to the
state." There is evidence that Mobil is aiding in the sale of oil
to Rhodesia in violation of UN resolution 253 and Executive
Order 11419.
Del Monte
Del Monte owns and operates South Africa Preserving
Company, one of the four largest fruit and vegetable canning
operations in South Africa. Since agriculture accounts for a
large share of South African exports, Del Monte's invest
ments are helping South Africa obtain crucial foreign ex
change.

Del Monte profits from the meager wages it has to pay its
black migrant workers. These wages, according to the Depart
ment of Statistics, are typically $14.70 per month compared
to $78 and $111 earned by blacks in the mining and
manufacturing industries. Del Monte also operates in Nam
ibia, in violation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 283
and American government policy.
By divesting itself of these companies, Stanford can most
effectively tell the corporate world that it supports principles
of basic human decency above all others and that it will not
be involved in their systematic violation.
Opponents of divestment have maintained that Stanford
can do similarly thrbugh its stands on shareholder proxy
issues. Unfortunately, proxies have failed to implement pro
gressive change in corporate policy, as most shareowners
automatically cast their votes with management. The poten
tial of the proxy vote is only the power to be ineffective.
A second criticism of divestment is that it is too expen
sive. We disagree. The Massy report cites three types of
divestment costs: brokerage fees incurred in the sale of stock,
a decline in corporate gifts to the University, and the
narrowing of investment options for the endowment fund
managers. Several points can be made in rebuttal.
To begin with, divestment is only a temporary measureâ€”

when these firms stop doing business in South Africa, as
Polaroid recently did, Stanford will once again be free to
reconsider investment. Secondly, the money costs to Stan
ford are not significant when compared to the institution's
financial resources. The University recently completed a
$306 million capital fund drive, the largest of its kind in U.S.
history. Current endowment is nearly one half-billion dollars.
The brokerage costs of selling these shares represents less
than a day's operating budget for Stanford and are roughly
equal to the normal costs of a year's stock transactions.
Third, corporations make gifts to Stanford because it
supplies them with a steady stream of managers, engineers,
and research work, not because of its investment policies.
Furthermore, to allow company Santas to dictate Stanford
policy is to submit to corporate blackmail, a notion contrary
to the most elementary concepts of educational freedom.
Finally, we note that Massy ignores the tremendous
human costs of apartheid and gives no mention to the
benefits of divestment.
Through divestment, Stanford can exercise its social
responsibility as a large institutional investor in pressuring
U.S. firms to end their support of apartheid and hasten the
emergence of majority rule in South Africa. Stanford must
act and act now.
