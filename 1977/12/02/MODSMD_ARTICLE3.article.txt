# Vorster views his victory as popular endorsement

Johannesburg (AP) — Prime Minis
ter John Vorster yesterday hailed his
record election victory as a resound
ing endorsement of apartheid and a
rejection of U.S. "meddling" in
South African affairs. The leader of
the new liberal opposition warned of
a "hardening of race attitudes."
"I'm deeply thankful, very very
deeply thankful, that this has hap
pened," said Vorster, whose cam
paign consisted largely of defiant at
tacks on the United States for back
ing the U.N. arms embargo against
South Africa and criticizing Pretoria's
policies of race segregation.
"I think the electorate has spoken
louder than any man could ever have
spoken in any circumstances," he
said.
Vorster confirmed his plan to re
write South Africa's constitution to
give the 2.7 million "coloreds" (per
sons of mixed race) and 750,000
Asians their own parliaments.
But he made clear the government
had no intention of giving political
rights to the country's 19 million
blacks, who are officially listed as
citizens of their own tribal "home
lands," not of South Africa.
"The government will not give in
to the insistence that urban blacks be

included in the 'new deal' envisaged
for the coloreds and Asians," Vorster
said in an interview with the
magazine Huisgenoot.
The final tally in Wednesday's elec
tion gave the ruling National Party
64.8 per cent of the popular vote and
134 of the 165 seats in Parliament —
more than the "Nats" have ever won
in the nearly 30 years they have
dominated South African politics.
The party took 116 seats in the last
election in 1974.
Second place, and the status of of
ficial opposition, passed from the
centrist New Republic Party (NRP) to
the liberal Progressive Federal Party
(PFP).
The PFP, which advocates sharing
power with the country's 19 million
blacks, won 17 seats and 16.7 per
cent of the vote. The NRP dropped
from 23 to 10 seats and got 11.8 per
cent of the ballots.
The conservative South African
Party won three seats, while the ul
trarightist and openly racist Re
formed National Party failed to bring
in any of its 56 candidates.
Progressive Federal Party leader
Colin Eglin, 52, predicted "more au
thoritarianism and a hardening of
race attitudes" with the Nationals'

landslide victory. He pledged that his
party will present a viable alternative
to the government's apartheid pol
icy.
Forty two of the Nationals' seats
were uncontested. In all, 64.7 per
cent ot South Atrica's 1,644,093 regis
tered voters, all whites, cast ballots.
Vorster called the election 18
months ahead of schedule, asking
whites to reject foreign "meddling"
in South African affairs and to give
the green light to his separate
parliament plan.
The elections came on the heels of
an international outcry against South
Africa's white minority government
set off by the mysterious death in
prison of black activist Steve Biko
and the subsequent government
crackdown against major black lead
ers and organizations.
The anger culminated in a United
Nations arms embargo against South
Africa. But the outrage and the em
bargo evidently served only to rally
South Africa's 4.5 million defiant
whites behind Vorster.
Less than 60 per cent of the voters
registered in many of the contested
constituencies turned out, appa
rently reflecting apathy as well as
out-of-date rolls.
