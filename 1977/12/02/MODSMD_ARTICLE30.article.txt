Black Students Union Statement
The Stanford University Black Students Union, a repre
sentative body of this University's black community, strongly
endorses the continued protests here that are seeking to put
an end to Stanford's complicity in supporting the illegal,
racist regime in Azania (so-called South Africa). Specifically,
we join with many others in the Stanford community in
calling for this University's divestment from companies that
profit from apartheid.
It is said by some that U.S. corporations play a progres
sive role in South Africa. Though it may be true that a few
U.S. corporations pay their black workers more than the
median wage, etc., the evidence clearly indicates that as a
group, the labor practices of U.S. corporations are essentially
the same as those of local F :uth African capitalists.
Moreover, U.S. corporations tend to be concentrated in
those areas in which the South African economy is moving
(e.g., in computer manufacturing and sales), and their pre
sense both lends moral support to South Africa's reactionary
government and increases the probability that the U.S. will
enventually become directly involved militarily in the region.
Stanford University owns securities in 59 U.S. companies
active in South Africa.
This complicity is a direct insult to the Stanford black
community. As a Third World community, we find it extre
mely repugnant to be associated with an institution that has a
hand in continued oppression of the colored peoples of the
world.
Stanford is showing approval for a political-economic
system that encourages the separate and unequal develop
ment of whites and blacks We denounce racism wherever it

exists—in Africa, throughout the Black Disapora, and at
Stanford.
We understand the manifestations of racism; we under
stand the frustrations of little or no economic or political
power; we understand laboring for mere subsistence.
We as black Americans have long understood racism in the
U.S., and we as black Stanford students understand racism
here. Our long and continued struggle to establish and
strengthen black studies programs, the Black Activities Cen
ter, and the Committee on Black Performing Arts, as well as
to seek to increase the percentage of black faculty, staff and
students to at least resemble the percentage of blacks in the
U.S., are struggles that we know well and force us to
empathize with oppressed colored peoples of the world.

South Africa serve to bolster the repressive apparatuses of the
South African state, and that this University has an obliga

This complicity is a direct insult to the Stanford black
community. As a Third World community, we find it extre
mely repugnant to be associated with an institution that has a
hand in continued oppression of the colored peoples of the
world.
Stanford is showing approval for a political-economic
system that encourages the separate and unequal develop
ment of whites and blacks We denounce racism wherever it

exists—in Africa, throughout the Black Disapora, and at
Stanford.
We understand the manifestations of racism; we under
stand the frustrations of little or no economic or political
power; we understand laboring for mere subsistence.
We as black Americans have long understood racism in the
U.S., and we as black Stanford students understand racism
here. Our long and continued struggle to establish and
strengthen black studies programs, the Black Activities Cen
ter, and the Committee on Black Performing Arts, as well as
to seek to increase the percentage of black faculty, staff and
students to at least resemble the percentage of blacks in the
U.S., are struggles that we know well and force us to
empathize with oppressed colored peoples of the world.

Statement from the ASSU Council of Presidents
Recognizing that U.S. corporate and financial interests in
South Africa serve to bolster the repressive apparatuses of the
South African state, and that this University has an obliga
tion to pursue morally defensible policies in the investment
and management of its endowment, the ASSU Council of
Presidents endorses the Stanford Committee for a Respon
sible Investment Policy's call for divestment.

Black Students Union Statement
The Stanford University Black Students Union, a repre
sentative body of this University's black community, strongly
endorses the continued protests here that are seeking to put
an end to Stanford's complicity in supporting the illegal,
racist regime in Azania (so-called South Africa). Specifically,
we join with many others in the Stanford community in
calling for this University's divestment from companies that
profit from apartheid.
It is said by some that U.S. corporations play a progres
sive role in South Africa. Though it may be true that a few
U.S. corporations pay their black workers more than the
median wage, etc., the evidence clearly indicates that as a
group, the labor practices of U.S. corporations are essentially
the same as those of local F :uth African capitalists.
Moreover, U.S. corporations tend to be concentrated in
those areas in which the South African economy is moving
(e.g., in computer manufacturing and sales), and their pre
sense both lends moral support to South Africa's reactionary
government and increases the probability that the U.S. will
enventually become directly involved militarily in the region.
Stanford University owns securities in 59 U.S. companies
active in South Africa.
This complicity is a direct insult to the Stanford black
community. As a Third World community, we find it extre
mely repugnant to be associated with an institution that has a
