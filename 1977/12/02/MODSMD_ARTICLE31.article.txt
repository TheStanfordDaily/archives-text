Cafe Meursault
651 University Ave.
Palo Alto
Situated in what was once a
Laundromat, and never really
having ameliorated its decor,
Cafe Meursault does not pro
vide what one would envision
to be traditional French dining,
at least as far as atmosphere
goes. The restaurant is very
plain looking, both inside and
out, and it is obvious that the
owner's prime concern is
neither ambience nor aesthe
tics.
The food, however, left very
little to be desired, and ranked
among the better French meals
I've had. The menu, featuring a
variety of crepes, eggs en
cocette, cheese and meat
boards, and daily specials, is
neither cheap nor expensive,
and you can generally expect
to pay between four and five
dollars for dinner, wine
excluded.
The Crepe Viande ($3.50),
which consists of turkey,
dofino cheese and mushrooms
covered with a light cream and
port sauce (as are all their cre
pes), was very good, and there
are several different types of
crepes from which to choose.
From their daily specials, the
Chicken Theodora, which is of
fered frequently, was excel
lent. Very much like a cas
serole, it is made of chicken,

almonds, pineapples, green
peppers, and onions, cooked
in a soy sauce and corn starch
base, and covered with dofino
and feta cheese.
Eggs en Cocette, primarily
consisting of eggs whipped in a
bowl, baked with dofino and
cheddar cheese, and then co
vered with a sauce deloute
(made of port, butter, flour,
milk and parmesan cheese),
can be ordered either plain or
with mushrooms, ham, on
ions, or zucchini. The average
price is $3.50.
A dinner salad ($.90), is
served only with meals, and
containing bits of feta cheese,
and served with a vinegar, herb
and spice dressing, is called
their "pseudo-greek salad."
There is usually only one
choice for dessert, a chocolate
burnt-orange cheesecake.
Made with a graham cracker
crust, and baked on the pre
mises, the cheesecake was not
quite cheesy enough, but was
nevertheless good.
Claiming to be "basically a
wine establishment" which of
fers food, Cafe Meursault does
not have a printed wine list, but
rather, certain wines which are
recommended, depending, of
course, on your dish.
Their selection is rather ex
tensive, with, according to
owner and "chef de cuisine"
Robert D. Cheney, an average

of one hundred different var
ieties of French, Italian, Ger
man, and California wines at
any given time. *
A "three dimensional" wine
list is available, meaning that if
you so desire, you may pick
your wine fronrt their display.
Their Chenin Blanc de Vouv
ray, a medium priced French
wine ($4.50), is a very enjoyable
medium-dry wine that com
plements almost any meal.
Open Monday-Friday from
11:30 to 2 p.m. for lunch, and
5:38 (an idiosyncrasy of the
owner) to 9:30 Monday-
Saturday for dinner, Cafe
Meursault will provide a culi
narily excellent meal, though
both the service and the at
mosphere could be improved
upon.
Located on 651 Emerson
(Two blocks south of Emer
son's intersection with Univer
sity), accepting credit cards
and reservations for parties of
six or more, Cafe Meursault
claims to be neither a ". . . fast
food stand nor a showcase for
the talents of an interior de
corator (unless you consider
those who designed World
War I French artillery bunkers
as decorators). Our goal as a
restaurant is the satiation of
syour palate, not your pul
chritudinous sensibility." In
that respect, they do succeed.

Cafe Meursault
651 University Ave.
Palo Alto
Situated in what was once a
Laundromat, and never really
having ameliorated its decor,
Cafe Meursault does not pro
vide what one would envision
to be traditional French dining,
at least as far as atmosphere
goes. The restaurant is very
plain looking, both inside and
out, and it is obvious that the
owner's prime concern is
neither ambience nor aesthe
tics.
The food, however, left very
little to be desired, and ranked
among the better French meals
I've had. The menu, featuring a
variety of crepes, eggs en
cocette, cheese and meat
boards, and daily specials, is
neither cheap nor expensive,
and you can generally expect
to pay between four and five
dollars for dinner, wine
excluded.
The Crepe Viande ($3.50),
which consists of turkey,
dofino cheese and mushrooms
covered with a light cream and
port sauce (as are all their cre
pes), was very good, and there
are several different types of
crepes from which to choose.
From their daily specials, the
Chicken Theodora, which is of
fered frequently, was excel
lent. Very much like a cas
serole, it is made of chicken,

almonds, pineapples, green
peppers, and onions, cooked
in a soy sauce and corn starch
base, and covered with dofino
and feta cheese.
Eggs en Cocette, primarily
consisting of eggs whipped in a
bowl, baked with dofino and
cheddar cheese, and then co
vered with a sauce deloute
(made of port, butter, flour,
milk and parmesan cheese),
can be ordered either plain or
with mushrooms, ham, on
ions, or zucchini. The average
price is $3.50.
A dinner salad ($.90), is
served only with meals, and
containing bits of feta cheese,
and served with a vinegar, herb
and spice dressing, is called
their "pseudo-greek salad."
There is usually only one
choice for dessert, a chocolate
burnt-orange cheesecake.
Made with a graham cracker
crust, and baked on the pre
mises, the cheesecake was not
quite cheesy enough, but was
nevertheless good.
Claiming to be "basically a
wine establishment" which of
fers food, Cafe Meursault does
not have a printed wine list, but
rather, certain wines which are
recommended, depending, of
course, on your dish.
Their selection is rather ex
tensive, with, according to
owner and "chef de cuisine"
Robert D. Cheney, an average

of one hundred different var
ieties of French, Italian, Ger
man, and California wines at
any given time. *
A "three dimensional" wine
list is available, meaning that if
you so desire, you may pick
your wine fronrt their display.
Their Chenin Blanc de Vouv
ray, a medium priced French
wine ($4.50), is a very enjoyable
medium-dry wine that com
plements almost any meal.
Open Monday-Friday from
11:30 to 2 p.m. for lunch, and
5:38 (an idiosyncrasy of the
owner) to 9:30 Monday-
Saturday for dinner, Cafe
Meursault will provide a culi
narily excellent meal, though
both the service and the at
mosphere could be improved
upon.
Located on 651 Emerson
(Two blocks south of Emer
son's intersection with Univer
sity), accepting credit cards
and reservations for parties of
six or more, Cafe Meursault
claims to be neither a ". . . fast
food stand nor a showcase for
the talents of an interior de
corator (unless you consider
those who designed World

as decorators). Our goal as a
