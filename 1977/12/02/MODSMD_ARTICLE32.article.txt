# Female Person Show: a new beginning
## 
### 
Director Amy Klatzkin can
tell you what the "Female Per
son's Show" is not.
It isn't "a stomping feminist
play . . . and it doesn't spit on
men . . . it's unlike a lot of
shows here because it piles
comedy on top of serious, sen
sitive drama. . .
But it works â€” very well,
Klatzkin says, because it does
provide a fair perspective on
women today.
"The play presents ways
women are taught to think
about themselves . . . how
they're expected to be in the
real world. The focus is on
education, an exaggerated
focus, but a focus the images of
women, the ideals set up for
them.
"It doesn't answer ques
tions, it poses them."
Klatzkin cited the play's un
usual construction: a series of
comic, satiric, dramatic and
revue skits "working off each
other, drawing from each
other."
The "Female Person's
Show" is Klatzkin's "transla
tion" of Marcy Kahan's origi
nal, first produced at Oxford

last year.
"It's very different from the
first one. The characters are
very different . . . but every
American stereotype has its
English counterpart. I sent my
version to the author and she
liked it very much."
Klatzkin acted in the Oxford
production and is quick to
point out that even in "an au
dicnre which was HO per cent
male ... at least . . . the ihow
was understood and ap
preciated. It was very thril
ling."
The Stanford version, an
American premiere, is spon
sored by the Drama Depart
ment as an undergraduate spe
cial project. Klatzkin is "ex
cited about working with
women and with under
graduates here. . we've got a
lot to work with compared to
Oxford, where we were on a
very low budget. We have here
all the amenities of a drama
department behind us. . . .I'm
not sure which is better."
"The Female Person's Show"
runs Dec. 7-10, 8 p.m. (extra 9
p.m. show on Dec. 9) in the
Little Theater.
