After celebrating his 46th
birthday Wednesday, Stanford
football coach Bill Walsh
Thursday celebrated his selec
tion as the Pacific-8 Coach of
the Year.
Walsh, in his first year as a
head coach after 16 years as an
assistant coach in the col
legiate and professional ranks,
directed the Cardinals to an 8-3
record (5-2 in the Pac-8) and an
invitation to the Dec. 31 Sun
Bowl in El Paso, Texas.
Stanford's season mark was
its best since the Cards went
8-3 during the 1971 regular sea
son before upsetting Michigan
in the Rose Bowl.
Stanford was also 6-0 at
home this season, the Cards'
first perfect mark at Stanford
Stadium since the 1940
team went 5-0 at home under
Clark Shaughnessy.
The silver-haired Walsh,
who coached at Stanford dur
ing the early 1960s under John
Ralston, returned to the Farm
with a reputation as one of the
game's outstanding offensive
minds. Upon arriving at Stan
ford he immediately made
Card quarterback Cuy Benja
min the object of his ministra
tions. Benjamin, too, is now
reaping the honors of a great
season.
Yesterday Benjamin was
named the Pacific-8 Co-Player
of the Year along with
Washington quarterback War

ren Moon and was also
selected the United Press In
ternational All-America quar
terback. In addition, Benjamin
was picked to head the All-
Pacific-8 and All-Coast offen
sive units.
joining Benjamin on the
first-team all-conference of
fensive squad were teammates
Darrin Nelson, James Lofton
and Gordon King.
Stanford linebacker Cordy
Ceresino was the only Card
named to the defensive first
unit. Offensive guard Mark Hill
was named to the second-team
unit while punter Brad Fox re
ceived honorable mention.
Nelson and Ken Easley, a
safety at UCLA, were the first
freshmen to be named to the
all-conference first team since
freshmen were declared eligi
ble for varsity football competi
tion in 1972. Nelson also re
ceived All-America honorable
mention from the Associated
Press.
Lofton, who earlier was
named to the AP second-team,
received honorable mention
notice yesterday from UPI.
King, one of the three unanim
ous selections on the Pac-8
team, was named to the UPI
second team.
Benjamin, Lofton and King
also were picked to the first
team All-Coast team while Nel
son and Ceresino made the
second team.
