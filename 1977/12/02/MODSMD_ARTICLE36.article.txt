# Stanford's 'Cardiac Cagers'
## McHugh tips hoop scales

Santa Clara — For Dick Dißiaso's cagers there
are no easy victories. There are just victories.
After Stanford's pair of one-point overtime
triumphs last weekend against Cal Poly-Pomona
and San Jose State, the Cardinals packed their
bags and took their nerve-trying brand of bas
ketball to Santa Clara Wednesday night for an
ulcer-producing performance before a sell-out
crowd in Toso Pavilion.
The Cards did not wait until overtime to down
the Broncos, however. Stanford put the Broncos
away early when Jeff McHugh hit a follow shot as
time expired to give Stanford a 69-67 victory over
the Broncos.
Santa Clara center Mark MacNamara went to
the foul line with 42 seconds left and the score
tied at 67. But the6-foot-10 freshman missed first
on a one-on-one bonus situation and McHugh
came down with the rebound.
Stanford ran the clock down to six seconds
before junior Paul Ciovacchini took a 15-foot
jumper which bounced off the back of the iron.
"Jay Carter tipped the ball out," McHugh said.
"My man had me boxed out but it was a long
rebound. It was a matter of being at the right
place at the right time.
"My first reaction was that time had run out. I
wasn't really aware that it was good but every
body started jumping on me and I figured. . . ."
McHugh said, his voice trailing off and avoiding
the obvious joy he and his teammates felt after
the game.
Santa Clara held a seven-point advantage at
halftime and scored three unanswered buckets
at the beginning of the second half to jump to a
45-32 advantage. The Cards cut the Bronco mar
gin back to seven but playmaker Eddie Joe
Chavez, the game's high scorer with 18 points,
directed Santa Clara to a 62-50 lead with just
under seven minutes to play.
"We set a goal during one timeout to get
within five with four minutes to go," said Di-

Biaso.
The pressing Stanford squad did more than
meet its goal, the opportunistic Cards cut the
Bronco advantage to 64-61 with 4:42 remaining.
Then freshman marvel Mark Pitchford hit an
18-foot baseline jumper to pull Stanford within
one.
Santa Clara padded its lead with three quick
points but Pitchford hit another long-range artil
lery shot and McHugh drew Stanford even with
an eight-footer.
Santa Clara coach Carroll Williams had the
Broncos go to a passing game offense to run
down the clock. A bad pass, however, turned
the ball over to the Cards with 1:19 remaining.
Stanford was playing for the last shot but
sophomore Kimberly Belton saw an opening to
the basket after taking a Carter pass and drove
for the inside shot. But McNamara cut off Bel
ton's lane to the bucket and Stanford's big for
ward plowed over the Santa Clara center and
received a charging foul.
MacNamara missed on his trip to the line and
Stanford went on to win one of its patented
nerve-wracking victories.
Dißiaso characterized the Stanford team as a
group of "inexperienced veterans" after the
game. But several of the Cards said they felt
experience was the determining factor in mak
ing Stanford 3-0 going into next Thursday's con
test with No. 5-ranked University of San Fran
cisco.
• "It was all a matter of experience," Pitchford
said.
McHugh echoed Pitchford's statement: "It
was a matter of our experience. We've all been
through this before. But in previous years it
seemed we were always coming up on the other
end of the score."
For Stanford it has been nice to be on the high
side of a series of close scores in the early sea
son. But a season of similar games will leave
three Stanford coaches and numerous Cardinal
fans seeking post-season treatment for ulcers.
