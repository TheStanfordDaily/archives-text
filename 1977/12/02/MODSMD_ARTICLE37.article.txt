# Biz II battles Theta Delts in 'A' final
## IM grid championships set 
### Marcia Hadeler 
Now that all of the bowl bids
have been announced and the
post season games set, it's time
to get down to some serious
business — the IM Football Fi
nals.
There are two semi-final
games today: on field 1, Law 111
will take on Off the Wall Gang,
while the Donnerheas match
up against BRA on field 2. The
winners will meet Sunday to

battle for the "B" champion
ship.
Law 111 is a "ball-control
team." It takes its time moving
down the field with short pas
ses of five to 10 yards. Like
most other IM teams, it doesn't
run with the ball much.
It has a strong defense and
competent rushers, and
earned its No. 1 seed with a 5-0
record in regular season play.
Composed of baseball

players and ex-baseball
players, Off the Wall Gang
plays an aggressive game of
football. The
team finished its regular sea
son 4-1.
The Donnerheas are a small
team, but quick. Offensively,
their small blockers should be
at a disadvantage, but their
quick, well-executed patterns
enable them to put together
point-making drives. Their de
fensive unit is strong. They
have only given up one
touchdown, a safety and a punt
return for a touchdown in eight
games to date.
Burbank Ringers Associa
tion, listed as BRA, claims
speed is its strategy. It does not
have any fancy plays drawn up
or complicated patterns to run.
They settle for the standards.
BRA throws middle distance
passes yet is not afraid to run
with the ball. Offensively, it
has sturdy linemen who block
well. BRA finished 4-0 during
the regular season.
Sunday will be the final Big
Day. The 'A' league champion
ship game will start things off at
12:30 p.m. on field 2. At 1:30
p.m. the 'B's will rally for a
champion, at 2:30 p.m. the
coed teams will mingle and at
3:30 p.m. the women will

tackle one another for their
championship.
Biz 11, self-described as pre
big business men anxious to
exploit the little man, are ag
gressive. They are not afraid to
knock a few heads. It has a
good offense-defense balance,
with passing as its main threat.
The Theta Delts have experi
ence. They are offensively
strong with four former Stan
ford jVs playing at the four skill
positions, two rugby players as
blocking backs and 6-foot-5
center.
When the final coed teams
match up it will be the No.
1-seeded Leftovers against No.
2 BRA.
BRA wins most games with
its never-ending speed. Some
of the players on this coed
team are also on the No.
3-seeded 'B' team. They have
skilled women who contribute
on both offense and defense.
BRA runs standard patterns
and is a high scoring team, with
a regular season record of 5-0.
The Leftovers play an
ing brand of rugby football."
With seven rugby players on
the team most of their plays are
rugby style. They use rugby
passes, sweeping one way and
lateralling back.
Finally, at 3:30 p.m. FTLS

takes ori Eucalypto's Tight
Ends.
FTLS has a "no strategy, no
pattern" team. When it plays,
everyone is a prospective re
ceiver and blocker. It has
strong rushing ability and intel
ligent linebackers. It runs short
pass attacks with a tew runs. It
never practices.
The Tight Ends, as Eucalypto
prefers to be called, is an ag
gressive team. They depend on
their strength and speed to win
their games.
The tootball hierarchy at the
IM Office, whose prognosticat
ing proficiency has been
exemplified by the fact that
their top four 'A' seeds made it
to the 'A' semifinals, the top
three 'B' seeds made it to their
semifinals and the top two
seeds in the coed and women's
divisions are still alive in their
respective finals matches, have
offered the following point
spreads on the upcoming
games:
'A' finals
Theta Delts by 2 over Biz II
'B' Semis
Law 111 by 8 over Off the Wall Gang
Donnerheas by 1 over BRA
Coed finals
Leftovers by 6 over BRA
Women's finals
FTLS by 3 over Eucalypto

Ends.
FTLS has a "no strategy, no
pattern" team. When it plays,
everyone is a prospective re
ceiver and blocker. It has
strong rushing ability and intel
ligent linebackers. It runs short
pass attacks with a tew runs. It
never practices.
The Tight Ends, as Eucalypto
prefers to be called, is an ag
gressive team. They depend on
their strength and speed to win
their games.
The tootball hierarchy at the
IM Office, whose prognosticat
ing proficiency has been
exemplified by the fact that
their top four 'A' seeds made it
to the 'A' semifinals, the top
three 'B' seeds made it to their
semifinals and the top two
seeds in the coed and women's
divisions are still alive in their
respective finals matches, have
offered the following point
spreads on the upcoming
games:
'A' finals
Theta Delts by 2 over Biz II
'B' Semis
Law 111 by 8 over Off the Wall Gang
Donnerheas by 1 over BRA
Coed finals
Leftovers by 6 over BRA
Women's finals
FTLS by 3 over Eucalypto
Now that all of the bowl bids
have been announced and the
post season games set, it's time
to get down to some serious
business — the IM Football Fi
nals.
There are two semi-final
games today: on field 1, Law 111
will take on Off the Wall Gang,
while the Donnerheas match
up against BRA on field 2. The
winners will meet Sunday to

battle for the "B" champion
ship.
Law 111 is a "ball-control
team." It takes its time moving
down the field with short pas
ses of five to 10 yards. Like
most other IM teams, it doesn't
run with the ball much.
It has a strong defense and
competent rushers, and
earned its No. 1 seed with a 5-0
record in regular season play.
Composed of baseball

players and ex-baseball
players, Off the Wall Gang
plays an aggressive game of
football. The
team finished its regular sea
son 4-1.
The Donnerheas are a small
team, but quick. Offensively,
their small blockers should be
at a disadvantage, but their
quick, well-executed patterns
enable them to put together
point-making drives. Their de
fensive unit is strong. They
have only given up one
touchdown, a safety and a punt
return for a touchdown in eight
games to date.
Burbank Ringers Associa
tion, listed as BRA, claims
speed is its strategy. It does not
have any fancy plays drawn up
or complicated patterns to run.
They settle for the standards.
BRA throws middle distance
passes yet is not afraid to run
with the ball. Offensively, it
has sturdy linemen who block
well. BRA finished 4-0 during
the regular season.
Sunday will be the final Big
Day. The 'A' league champion
ship game will start things off at
12:30 p.m. on field 2. At 1:30
p.m. the 'B's will rally for a
champion, at 2:30 p.m. the
coed teams will mingle and at
3:30 p.m. the women will

tackle one another for their
championship.
Biz 11, self-described as pre
big business men anxious to
exploit the little man, are ag
gressive. They are not afraid to
knock a few heads. It has a
good offense-defense balance,
with passing as its main threat.
The Theta Delts have experi
ence. They are offensively
strong with four former Stan
ford jVs playing at the four skill
positions, two rugby players as
blocking backs and 6-foot-5
center.
When the final coed teams
match up it will be the No.
1-seeded Leftovers against No.
2 BRA.
BRA wins most games with
its never-ending speed. Some
of the players on this coed
team are also on the No.
3-seeded 'B' team. They have
skilled women who contribute
on both offense and defense.
BRA runs standard patterns
and is a high scoring team, with
a regular season record of 5-0.
The Leftovers play an
ing brand of rugby football."
With seven rugby players on
the team most of their plays are
rugby style. They use rugby
passes, sweeping one way and
lateralling back.

big business men anxious to
exploit the little man, are ag
gressive. They are not afraid to
knock a few heads. It has a
good offense-defense balance,
with passing as its main threat.
The Theta Delts have experi
ence. They are offensively
strong with four former Stan
ford jVs playing at the four skill
positions, two rugby players as
blocking backs and 6-foot-5
center.
When the final coed teams
match up it will be the No.
1-seeded Leftovers against No.
2 BRA.
BRA wins most games with
its never-ending speed. Some
of the players on this coed
team are also on the No.
3-seeded 'B' team. They have
skilled women who contribute
on both offense and defense.
BRA runs standard patterns
and is a high scoring team, with
a regular season record of 5-0.
The Leftovers play an
ing brand of rugby football."
With seven rugby players on
the team most of their plays are
rugby style. They use rugby
passes, sweeping one way and
lateralling back.
Finally, at 3:30 p.m. FTLS

takes ori Eucalypto's Tight
Ends.
FTLS has a "no strategy, no
pattern" team. When it plays,
everyone is a prospective re
ceiver and blocker. It has
strong rushing ability and intel
ligent linebackers. It runs short
pass attacks with a tew runs. It
never practices.
The Tight Ends, as Eucalypto
prefers to be called, is an ag
gressive team. They depend on
their strength and speed to win
their games.
The tootball hierarchy at the
IM Office, whose prognosticat
ing proficiency has been
exemplified by the fact that
their top four 'A' seeds made it
to the 'A' semifinals, the top
three 'B' seeds made it to their
semifinals and the top two
seeds in the coed and women's
divisions are still alive in their
respective finals matches, have
offered the following point
spreads on the upcoming
games:
'A' finals
Theta Delts by 2 over Biz II
'B' Semis
Law 111 by 8 over Off the Wall Gang
Donnerheas by 1 over BRA
Coed finals
