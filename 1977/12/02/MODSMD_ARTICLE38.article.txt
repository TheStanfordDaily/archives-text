# Poloists review 20-3 fall season
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
"This year has been the most
enjoyable season in water polo
I've ever had," Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "This is
the best group of guys, as far as
coachability, that I've ever
coached. The cooperation was
super. I really couldn't ask for
any more."
The Cardinal poloists
finished the season with a 20-3
record, the Pac-8 champion
ship and third place in the
NCAA tournament.
Impressive, but the team,
ranked No. 1 before entering
the NCAAs, was not entirely
satisfied. Though they were
disappointed, the team has ac
cepted the loss of the champ
ionship. Said senior Rick
johannsen, "Those things just
happen."
Recalling his last four years,
johannsen said, "It's like any
thing in life. There have been
good times and bad times, dis
appointing times and exhilarat
ing times. It's making it
through the bad times that
makes the good times that
much better."
For Stanford this year, there
have been mostly good times.
There was the second Irvine
game, won by the Cards in
overtime by one goal. There
was the NorCal Invitational
Tournament, which Stanford
won by defeating Cal in the fi
nals. There were the wins over
USC and UCLA, in which the
Cardinal defense completely
shut off the Trojan and Bruin
offenses.
There were many outstand
ing individual performances
this year, as well. Perfor
mances like junior Tom
Angelo's game-tying goal with
14 seconds left to prevent a loss

to Long Beach. Performances
like freshman goalie John Gan
sel's 17 saves in just three quar
tersofthe first game with USC.
There were junior Robby Ar
nold's five goals against the
same Trojan team a week later.
There were Arnold's 54 goals
tor the season and Angelo's 55.
There were junior Doug
Burke's assists, Johannsen's
passes and senior Marty Davis'
defense.
But more importantly, as De
ttamanti readily admitted,
there was teamwork. There
were seven guys in the pool,
playing together as a unit and
doing the jobs that needed to
be done.
"Everyone sacrificed," said
Davis, "and we all played as a
team." The Cardinal captain
looked back upon his own col
lege career with a smile.
"I wouldn't trade these last
four years for anything," he re
flected. "I've-really enjoyed
it."
Johannsen said he looks
back with some sadness, but
no regrets.
"I'll really miss the people,"
he said. "I've been playing with
them for a long time and
there's been a real camaraderie
and friendship that's important
to me.
"I was disappointed that we
didn't win the NCAAs," he
continued, "but we played as
hard as we could. That's what
matters."
"I'm really pleased with the
season," Dettamanti con
cluded. "We were 20-3, which
is good, for the first year after a
coaching change. It just wasn't
our night to win (against Irvine
at the NCAAs). It wasn't in the
cards."
So to speak.
