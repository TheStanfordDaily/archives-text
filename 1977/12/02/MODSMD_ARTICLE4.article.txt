Taiwan detente, and the problem of facing reality re
main the major issues in the controversy over U.S. rec
ognition of China, two Asia scholars who debated the
topic Wednesday said.
UC-Berkeley Prof. Robert Scalapino argued that U.S.
abandonment of the Taiwan mutual defense treaty
"would raise questions about American credibility" in
the minds of both allies and opponents. Such a move
would "create the view among our allies that we are
inconsistent and untrustworthy," he said.
Law Prof. Victor Li in turn pressed the need for bring
ing America's Asia policy "in line with reality."
"Neither our friends nor our enemies continue to
recognize Taiwan as all of China," he said.
Li said the solution to the Taiwan problem lies in
flexibility. "This is not a time.for precision. If we try and
define exactly who belongs to what we are sure to find
difficulties," he said.
"We must tolerate ambiguity. China has tolerated
ambiguity in her relations with Japan for the past 20 years
quite nicely."
Li advocated a settlement based on an official recogni
tion of the Peking government combined with de facto
recognition of Taipei's control over the island. This pol
icy, he said, would not legally require a repudiation of
the mutual defense treaty.
Debate moderator, History Prof. Mark Mancall won
dered aloud whether "Taiwan isn't an excuse for the
U.S. to avoid facing the fundamental issue, which is the
contradiction between the two chief aims of our foreign
policy: detente with the Soviet Union and improvement
in our relations with China.
"The Taiwan issue is so crucial in our minds that we
can't see that our relations with China really hang on the
issue of detente with the Russians."

The panel agreed that the dilemma of the U.S.-
Soviet-Chinese triangle continues to be the major issue
in American relations with Peking. Scalapino said all
indications are that the Chinese are more concerned
about possible U.S. concessions in the SALT II talks than
about Taiwan.
Scalapino pointed to three possible courses for
American policy: a reduction in U.S. involvement in
Asia, a "united front" with China against the Soviet Un
ion, and a stand geared toward maintaining Soviet-
Chinese parity and moving slowly on the Taiwan issue.
Advocates of the first course believe current commit
ment levels are not justified by American economic and
political interests in Asia, he said.
The "united front" option emphasizes rap'd normali
zation of relations with China as a counter to increasing
Soviet strength. Scalapino said this direction might crip
ple U.S.-Soviet negotiations.
"We could not make any agreements with the Soviets
if they perceived that we were moving into alignment
against them," he said.
Scalapino agreed with the third alternative, emphasiz
ing the need for a firm stand on foreign commitments as
well as the virtue of an equilibrium between the Soviet
Union and China.
"Both wars in Asia have been due to communist mis
calculations of our willingness to meet our commit
ments â€” and this was our fault," he said. "We should
not give the wrong impression; if a situation arose, the
weight of American opinion could change in tavor ot
aggressive support for Taiwan."
Li took the opposite view, asserting a long-run Ameri
can interest in ending the mutual defense treaty. "We
don't really want to send troops to detend it,"he said.
"It is time for us to see that Taiwan is not our ally China
from the Second World War."
