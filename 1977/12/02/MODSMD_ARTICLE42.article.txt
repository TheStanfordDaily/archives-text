Anti-Sadat conference to commence
Tripoli, Libya — Hardline Arab leaders assembled here
yesterday for a Libyan-sponsored "summit of resis
tance" to break the momentum of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's bold new peace overtures to Israel.
"No negotiations, no settlement, no recognition,"
read fresh signs along the palm-lined streets of this sea
side capital, reflecting the intransigence of Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy. Other banners said: "Welcome,
heroes of steadfastness, to the land of steadfastness."
About 1000 demonstrators shouting "It is we who are
tight" massed outside the People's Palace, the elegant
white stucco headquarters of King Idris, deposed by
Khadafy in 1969.
A formal opening session of the two-day anti-Sadat
conference was scheduled to begin inside the palace last
night but was postponed until today. The Arab leaders
met privately among themselves into the night.

Polish Communist chief meets Pope
Vatican City — Pope Paul VI and Edward Gierek, the
lirst Polish Communist Party chief to visit a pope,
pledged themselves yesterday to church-state coopera
tion in heavily Roman Catholic Poland and a common
pursuit of world peace.
"We are certain that we can assure you today that the
church is ready to offer to the Polish society a positive
contribution," the pope said in a formal speech during
I lis HO-minute meeting with Gierek.
Gierek responded "in the spirit of traditional Polish
tolerance, we are promoting a state in which there is no
conflict between church and state. What we want is to
work together for the realization of common national
objectives."
At a news conference after the meeting, Gierek
acknowledged that "controversies exist" between the
government and the Polish Catholic hierarchy, but he
characterized these differences as the kind that can be
found within any family.
There was no announcement of progress toward dip
lomatic ties between the Vatican and Poland, whose
population of 34 million is 90 per cent Catholic but
whose official doctrine is Marxist atheism.

HEW urges new sterilization rules
Washington — The Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, which pays for sterilization operations for
100,000 poor persons each year, proposed new regula
tions yesterday to ensure that no one is forced to un
dergo the procedure.
The changes also are designed to guarantee that a
patient fully understands "the irreversible consequ
ences" of sterilization, HEW Secretary Joseph A.
Califano )r. said.
The proposed rules would extend the minimum
three-day waiting period between the time a poor per
son signs a voluntary consent form and the time of the
surgery to a minimum of 30 days.
They also would forbid or sharply limit federal funding
of hysterectomies performed solely to sterilize a wo
man.
Officials support national oil pipeline
Washington — Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus gave
tentative approval yesterday for construction of the na
tion's first west-to-east oil pipeline designed to carry
Alaska crude oil from California to Texas.
The 1026-mile pipeline from Whitter Narrows, Calif.,
to Midland, Texas, would be built and operated by Stan
dard Oil Co. of Ohio. It would carry 500,000 barrels of oil
daily.
From Midland, Texas, the oil could be sent via existing
pipelines to refineries in the Midwest, East and along the
Gulf Coast, Interior Department officials said.
They also are supporting construction of a Northern
border" pipeline to carry Alaska crude across the north
ern tier of the United States.
The Alaska oil pipeline within Alaska is expected to
carry 1.2 million barrels of oil daily when it becomes fully
operational.
The proposed pipeline would utilize abandoned
natural gas pipelines for nearly three-fourths of its
length, Interior officials said.
Dept. of Energy issues winter guide
Washington — The Department of Energy yesterday
spelled out tactics to cope with any winter shortages of
natural gas, oil, coal, propane, or hydroelectric power,
including possible allocation of fuels and mandatory
thermostat settings.
David Bardin, head of the department's Economic
Regulatory Administration and chairman of a special task
force, issued a two-volume "Energy Emergency Planning
Guide." He said it is not a fixed plan of action, but rather
a set of guidelines.
The guide points out, for example, that the imposition
of mandatory thermostat settings in non-residential
buildings would be so hard to enforce and have such
uncertain fuel-saving beneiits that it probably would not
be applied except in an extreme fuel shortage.

ing inland night and morning. Lows mid-40s to low 50s. A
