# Panel views sorority issues

Possible conflicts between stan
dards set by the University and by
national sororities were the chief to
pics of debate at a panel discussion
held here last night.
Residential Education Director
Norm Robinson said, "There are a
tren endous number of people who
are unenthusiastic about the return
of sororities because they fear the
circumstances that led to the ban of
sororities may be likely to reoccur."
If a sorority were allowed on cam
pus, said Robinson, "it would have to
be an organization in which the con
trol were totally in the hands of the
Stanford students and where the
students agreed to abide by the Uni
versity's policies and procedures."
Allowing letters of recommenda
tion from alumnae was one of the
strongly debated issues.
Robinson said the University
would not allow letters of recom
mendation because "absence of a
letter might hurt a person's chances
of being included."
One alumna claimed the Univer
sity had a "double standard" be
cause letters of recommendation are
used in University admissions, but
would not be allowed for sororities.
Robinson defended the University

by saying, "We will not allow people
outside the University to influence
who can belong to organizations
here."
While several women at the meet
ing pointed out that letters of re
commendation are relatively unim
portant in the selection process,
Robinson claimed that the issue is
"close to the No. 1 concern" ot the
University.
Robinson also emphasized that
sororities "could not impose regula
tions if they are not in agreement
with the existing University regula
tions."
Mary Kay Baker, National Panhel

leric Council area adviser for college
chapters, said the problem of con
flicting rules and regulations "gets
magnified out of proportion."
However, if the rules conflict with
the law, such as allowing minors to
drink alcohol in the house, "we ex
pect them (sororities) to follow the
law," Baker said.
After hearing views for and against
sororities, Baker commented, "My
advice would be to let the University
resolve its problem and let the girls
form their small groups in housing,
then the step will come for the girls
to decide if they want to petition tor
national sororities."
