# Courses proposed for Western Civ.

### Peter Brett 
A three-quarter sequence ot five
unit courses, covering Western cul
ture from ancient Greece to the mod
ern age, may be required of all stu
dents if a Faculty Senate task force
recommendation is adopted.
The recommendation calls tor a
two-year pilot program in which the

number of students invited to enroll
in the sequence will increase trom
between 100 and 200 in the first year
to between 400 and 500 in the second
year.
At the end of the period, courses
will be evaluated before a final deci
sion on requiring the program is
reached.
The purpose of both the prelimi
nary report and recommendation
was to air faculty opinions on a West
ern Culture requirement. The task
force will consider those opinions
when it formulates its final proposal
this spring.
Several senate members objected
to the recommendation on the
grounds that students already over
burdened with required courses,
premeds and engineering students
in particular, would find an addi
tional 15-unit requirement difficult to
fulfill.
Other objections focused on al
leged ethnocentricity of the prop
osed courses because course syllabi
submitted leave out non-Western
cultures. Critics of the recommenda
tion also claimed authors whose
booksare included in thecoursesare
overwhelmingly white males.
