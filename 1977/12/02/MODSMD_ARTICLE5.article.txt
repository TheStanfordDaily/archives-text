# Editorial
## Trashing expression 
### 
Last week, a gay person enraged over anti
gay editorial columns in the Real News tore up
copies of that newspaper. A few weeks be
fore, persons demonstrating in Berkeley
against the Bakke decision burned copies of
the Daily Californian which contained a pro-
Bakke editorial. Similar destruction or theft of
student newspapers has occurred on cam
puses in southern California and Hawaii in the
last year.
All of these actions evidence a dangerous
belief — if you don't like something in a
newspaper, particularly a viewpoint which dif
fers from yours, then simply destroy the
newspaper. Such thinking could well lead to
assaults on persons who "dare" to utter opin
ions not accepted unanimously.
Furthermore, virtually all publications on
the Stanford campus — including even the
ASSU Course Guide and the Student Direc-

Tory — are now distributed by being left unat
tended in public places. Thus, all campus pub
lications are subject to these unannounced
destructive attacks.
We think the Stanford community at least
would have toleration for minority or unpopu
lar opinions. Yet recent actions seem to show
that some feel it is better to stop others from
expressing their opinions rather than, or in
addition to, working towards expressing your
opinion. And such actions can most easily be
directed toward publications which wholly
devote themselves to minority concerns or
extreme political thought, such as the Real
News, Against the Grain or La Onda.
We think people should realize the seri
ousness of destroying or interfering with the
content and distribution of publications, and
we hope that such obstruction of freedom of
expression will never recur here.
