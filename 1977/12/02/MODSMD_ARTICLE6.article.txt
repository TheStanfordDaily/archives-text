# Constant progress
## A
						healthy goal for society

What are the goals of our society?
It we start addressing this question
we are prone to attack from those
who claim that society should not
have any goals, that it is just a collec
tion of individuals, each lookingafter
his own good, or his family's.
I find it difficult to take sides on
this question. I tend to take a middle
road, namely that society should
guarantee everyone the possibility to
pursue his happiness, but should not
try to enforce any specific social or
der, or equality.
All this is broad and fuzzy
generalities. The trouble is, the legis
lative bodies of the world's nations
(Congress, for example), are com
prised of legislators who feel they
must earn their living; and what is
worse, they control budgets and
think they must appropriate money
for projects and programs.
The legislators tend to think they
are the leaders of society, and must
steer it somewhere. There exist un
contestable rules of sociology and
economics (Parkinson's and Mur
phy's, for example), which state that
government and bureaucracy will
never get smaller; on the contrary,
they will keep growing. The best we
can hope for is to slow their growth.
Influence priorities
Given this, the practical question
we should deal with is: how should
the money be spent? We cannot pre
vent the "leaders of society" from
compiling a list of goals and spend
ing money thinking it will help
achieve them. What we may hope to
do is influence priorities among
these goals.
I think society should have one
goal: constant progress. This means
a steady rise of everybody's standard
of living; constant improvement in
education; eradication of illiteracy
and hunger; steady improvement in
the quality, availability and price of
heal'h services.
How can these noble aims be
reached? The answer is science and
technology. To bring the argument
ad absurdum, if we halted today all
expenditures on research and de
velopment in science and technol
ogy, and instead poured all the
money into social and welfare prog

rams, it is quite evident that pretty
soon society would start moving
backward. The more grand the prog
ram, the less efficient it is; the larger
the bureaucracy, the more corrupt it
is.
On the other hand, stopping all
funding for social and welfare prog
rams and channeling everything into
science and technology will not stop
society's progress. The standard of
living will keep rising; technological
advances will help individual ser
vices. The bad effect, of course, wili
be the widening of the gap between
rich and poor, between the
privileged and the underprivileged.
Moral obligation
I am not recommending taking
either of these two alternatives. I do
believe that society has a moral obli
gation to support the weak; to cor
rect the effects of past discrimina
tion; to advance the under
privileged. But I think first emphasis
should be given to science, to
technology, to industry (No, not to
big business. Cartels are as corrupt,
if not more, than big government).
It is our technological know-how,
our machines, our instruments, our
information systems, which give us
the power to solve problems; the
power to light up and heat our
homes. They enable the Social Sec
urity Administrator in Washington to
call up the regional office in San
Francisco and ask why wasn't the
check for Mr. Smith processed yet.
They enable medical units to reach a
person severely wounded in a traffic
accident within five minutes and save
his life, a feat which was unthinkable
10 years ago.
I do not think conservation is a
noble ideal in itself. When society is
in a period of shortage, as it is now,
conservation is of course mandatory.
But making it a divine ideal is wrong;
it is simply a temporary necessity. A
real and better ideal for society is, for
example, to strive towards limitless
supplies of energy; perhaps from the
sun, perhaps from nuclear fission, or
hydrogen fusion. If we ever ap
proach this stage, shortage of raw
materials will be largely solved, since
much of the problem is the energy
spent in extracting and purifying the

substances.
Constant progress in science and
technology is healthy for society. In a
static, bureaucratic organization,
young people move very slowly.
Usually they must wait until the per
sons occupying the higher echelons
die or retire; or else they create new
departments for themselves within
the organization, thereby continuing
to inflate it. In a technological, scien
tific society, one which undergoes
constant changes, it is only the
young people who are able to learn
the new skills which are always
needed. They will move very quickly
into top positions. The society will be
healthy, dynamic and mobile.
Of course, we should not forget
that technology carries its problems.
Pollution, noise, individual stress
and tension, to namea few. But these
problems can be dealt with.
There are no black and white alter
natives; but it is essential that hu
manity shall keep moving forward;
that there will be no decay. Other
wise, the middle ages may return.
