# Blood-tarnished coin
## Help ban the Krugerrand 
### 
Clenn Jordan

On this Saturday, Dec. 3, de
monstrations against the sale of the
South African Krugerrand (a 1-oz.
gold coin) are taking place in
Chicago, New York City, Atlanta and
Oakland. Three Stanford organiza
tions — the Black Student Union, the
local chapter of the NAACP, and the
ASSU Council of Presidents — are
joining with the new African Libera
tion Support Committee and others
to hold the Oakland rally.
Why protest the sale of the Kruger
rand? What is the reality behind this
fiasco that masquerades as the inno
cent sale of the "world's most popu
lar coin" and as "the perfect gift for
the college graduate?"
The Krugerrand almost literally

drips with blood; it is a cruel irony of
sorts that such a beautiful coin is the
product of the most vicious exploita
tion.
A typical black South African gold
miner works from 62 70 hours per
week — frequently spending more
hours underground than is legally
sanctioned even by the South African
regime. A typical black miner earns
about 52 cents per hour — even less
than his counterpart in the manufac
turing sector. The ultimate result of
this cruel repression is death for
more than a few; three miners die
per shift in South Africa.
Tarnished
One reason to oppose the sale of
the Krugerrand is, then, a moral one:
the gold of the coin is ultimately tar
nished by blood. Anyone with even
the least of humanitarian motivations
should be able to protest the Kruger
rand on these grounds.
For those of us who are interested
in seeing an end to racial and class
oppression in South Africa and in se
eing the emergence of a genuinely
independent, non-racist, non
exploitative society, there is further
reason to take a stand against the
Krugerrand. The reason is implicit in
the following.
South Africa has some real
economic problems. For example, in
1976, the Republic faced an 11.5 per
cent inflation rate, a devaluated
Rand, a staggering black jobless rate
of 25 per cent, an estimated $1.7 bill
ion balance-of-payments deficit, and
a severe decrease in the influx of
foreign capital (Business Week, Nov.
8 and 15, 1976). A recent issue of
often-less-than-politically-astute
Time notes that South Africa is cur
rently in its worse recession in 40

years (due to "black unrest," down
ward turns in the price of gold, a
massive increase in military expendi
tures, and a number of other fac
tors).
The sale of the Krugerrand is, at
least in part, an effort to rectify some
of the problems the South African
government and corporate structure
face.
Production
Though the production of gold in
South Africa has gone down in recent
times (e.g., from 32,000,000 ounces
in 1970 to 25,000,000 ounces in 1974),
production of the 1-oz. Krugerrands
has markedly increased: 242,000
were produced in 1970, 535,873 in
1971, 510,125 in 1972, 843,000 in 1973
and 3,180,075 in 1974. Currently, 20
per cent of all the gold produced in
South Africa goes into Krugerrand
coinage.
If one adds to this the fact that
one-third of all South African imports
are paid for by the export of gold, the
picture becomes very clear. The size
(1 oz.) and cost (about $170) of the
Krugerrand allow the South African
state to reach a heretofore untapped
market for the sale of gold: the ordi
nary citizen.
A half-page ad in the Nov. 29 issue
of the San Francisco Chronicle fea
tured a brunette male and his blonde
spouse. The caption read: "I make
$JOO a week. Why should I buy a gold
coin?"
Vou shouldn't.

against the sale of the Krugerrand.

monstration, stop by the ASSU
Council of Presidents' office.

sorts that such a beautiful coin is the
product of the most vicious exploita
tion.
A typical black South African gold
miner works from 62 70 hours per
week — frequently spending more
hours underground than is legally
sanctioned even by the South African
regime. A typical black miner earns
about 52 cents per hour — even less
than his counterpart in the manufac
turing sector. The ultimate result of
this cruel repression is death for
more than a few; three miners die
per shift in South Africa.
Tarnished
One reason to oppose the sale of
the Krugerrand is, then, a moral one:
the gold of the coin is ultimately tar
nished by blood. Anyone with even
the least of humanitarian motivations
should be able to protest the Kruger
rand on these grounds.
For those of us who are interested
in seeing an end to racial and class
oppression in South Africa and in se
eing the emergence of a genuinely
independent, non-racist, non
exploitative society, there is further
reason to take a stand against the
Krugerrand. The reason is implicit in
the following.
South Africa has some real
economic problems. For example, in
1976, the Republic faced an 11.5 per
cent inflation rate, a devaluated
Rand, a staggering black jobless rate
of 25 per cent, an estimated $1.7 bill
ion balance-of-payments deficit, and
a severe decrease in the influx of
foreign capital (Business Week, Nov.
8 and 15, 1976). A recent issue of
often-less-than-politically-astute
Time notes that South Africa is cur
rently in its worse recession in 40

years (due to "black unrest," down
ward turns in the price of gold, a
massive increase in military expendi
tures, and a number of other fac
tors).
The sale of the Krugerrand is, at
least in part, an effort to rectify some
of the problems the South African
government and corporate structure
face.
Production
Though the production of gold in
South Africa has gone down in recent
times (e.g., from 32,000,000 ounces
in 1970 to 25,000,000 ounces in 1974),
production of the 1-oz. Krugerrands
has markedly increased: 242,000
were produced in 1970, 535,873 in
1971, 510,125 in 1972, 843,000 in 1973
and 3,180,075 in 1974. Currently, 20
per cent of all the gold produced in
South Africa goes into Krugerrand
coinage.
If one adds to this the fact that
one-third of all South African imports
are paid for by the export of gold, the
picture becomes very clear. The size
(1 oz.) and cost (about $170) of the
Krugerrand allow the South African
state to reach a heretofore untapped
market for the sale of gold: the ordi
nary citizen.
