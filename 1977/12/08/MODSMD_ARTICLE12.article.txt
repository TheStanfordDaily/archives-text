# Pac-8 preseason favorite surprises no one: UCLA

Thousands of dribbles this
season after UCLA's Brad Hol
land launches his first jump
shot from 30 feet, Oregon's
Mike Drummond first dives
into the Mac Court stands after
a loose ball or Washington
State coach George Raveling
first glares at an official, the
UCLA Bruins will probably
emerge again as basket
ball champions of the Pacific-8.

Most coaches and prognos
ticators rate the Bruins the
favorites to take the confer
ence, something they have
done every year since 1966.
And with Gene Bartow gone to
the less-pressurized environ
ment of the University of
Alabama-Birmingham, the
Bruins have former John
Wooden pupil Gary Cunnin
gham now at the coaching
reins.

Cunningham will try to find
the right chemistry to blend
the talents and egos of the
Bruins' superior personnel.
Frontliner David Greenwood
heads into his junior season as
the club's top player, having
averaged more than 16 points
and nine rebounds a game last
season to earn AII-Pac-8 first
team honors. Roy Hamilton, a
junior who also was AII-Pac-8 last
season, will work in the
backcourt with RayTownsend,
the only senior on this season's
team.
Second guessing
The greatest challenge to the
Bruins would appear to be
coming from Oregon. Or
Washington. Or USC. Or . . .
Really, picking the teams
which will finish second and
third this season is more dif
ficult than tabbing the winner.
In the Bruins' backyard, or
rather their trash bin, the USC
Trojans have made some
dramatic recruiting gains.
Coach Bob Boyd, who has had
only two conference wins on
the hardwood in the last two
seasons, signed six recruits
during the Pff-season.
"I think we recruited better
than anyone in the Pac-8 this
year," said Boyd. "We have the
potential to be much improved
over last season."
Two of the newcomers are
junior college transfers
Steve and Darryl Smith. Steve
was an All-State guard with a
24.6 average for Santa Ana Col
lege last season while
frontcourter Darryl averaged
17.4 and 13.2 rebounds a game
for Western Texas College.
Across the Bay, coach Dick
Edwards has eight players re
turning, led by the human
fireplug, Gene Ransom. The
5-foot-9 junior was AII-Pac-8
last season with a 14.2 scoring
average. Also back is the
team's leading rebounder,
junior center Tom Schneider
john, who grabbed more than
eight rebounds a game.
North of the Siskiyou Pass,
most of the big names of recent
years have finally graduated.
But coming in to fill the gaps

are some players with impres
sive statistics. The Husky him
self, Washington coach Marv
Harshman, has a pair of centers
who should present some
problems to broadcasters.
Freshman Ule Sledz, a 7-0,
220-pound center from
Celsenkirchen, West Ger
many, and 7-2, 260-pound
freshman Petur Gudmundsson
from Reykjavik, Iceland,
should share time in the pivot.
Three starters
Harshman has three starters
back from last season. Senior
forward Kim Stewart returns
with his 13.4 scoring average
and in the other corner
sophomore Stan Walker car
ries an 8.7 average. Guard Mike
Neill rounds out the trio.
On the other side of the Cas
cades in Pullman, Raveling has
6-11, 230-pound sophomore
Stuart House and 7-2, 275-
pound senior James
Donaldson. Reported to have
made amazing gains in his agil
ity, Donaldson, who has a
career scoring average of only
3.4, is expected to make sig
nificant contributions to the
Cougar cause this season.
Raveling also has seven
other players returning, in
cluding sophomore Don Col
lins, the team's fourth-leading
scorer last season. "I don't

think there are too many for
wards in the Pacific-8 better
than Don Collins," said Ravel
ing.
"Depthwise, this is probably
the best team I've had," said
Raveling, "but also one of the
youngest. This is probably the
hardest working team I've had
since I've been here."
Oregon coach Dick Harter
has nearly all the key players
back from last year's second
place finisher. Drummond,
who epitomizes Duck basket
ball, has backcourt partners
Rob Closs and John Murray re
turning. Up front, Kelvin Small
and Danny Mack will suit up
again for the Kamikaze Kids.
In Corvallis, Oregon State
coach Ralph Miller will be
sending out a team that has two
starters backr Forward Rickey
Lee is in his final season, and is
one of only two seniors on the
team. Lee averaged 8.9 points
per game last season. Sopho
more center Steve Johnson is
the club's top returning scorer
with a 13.5 average.
All four Northwest schools
will be participating in the Far
West Classic in Portland over
the Christmas break. The sur
vivor of that confrontation will
probably enter the Pac-8 sea
son in January as the prime
threat to UCLA.

returns to Pullman this season to anchor the Cougar front line.
