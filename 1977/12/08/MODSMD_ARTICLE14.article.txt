# Cager eyes dream performance
## Giovacchini has perfect game plan 
### Emilie Deutsch 
Paul Giovacchini, starting
guard on the Cardinal basket
ball team, doesn't feel he's had
a great college game yet. The
6-foot-1 junior has a pretty
tough standard in mind for that
perfect game, though.
"Firstwe'd have to win," said
Giovacchini. "Second, we'd
play very good defense, hold
ing the other team to about 55
or 60 points. Third, it would be
a total team effort."
Giovacchini, who's also

been dubbed Gino among a
variety of other names, is cer
tain that Stanford has the po
tential necessary to pull off that
hypothetical game.
"We have all the ingredients
to be good," he said. "We have
a good inside game and that is
essential to winning in the type
of top-flight competition we're
up against.
"We have the quickness and
the strength defensively to re
bound well, and we have the
depth. We're deep enough to

put in new players, if some
one's injured or has fouled
out, without any difficulty."
Rejects ivy walls
Giovacchini came to Stan
ford from Salt Lake City, Utah.
Graduating as valedictorian of
his high school class, Gino
turned down Harvard ("Why go
to an Ivy League school that
doesn't give athletic scholar
ships when you can go to a
Pac-8 one that does?"),
Washington and the University
of San Francisco to accept a
place on the varsity roster at
Stanford as a freshman.
His academic desires coin
cided with his athletic ones al
though he admitted that
"academics took a backseat to
sports in high school." The
economics major has a rather
non-committal attitude about
his studies at Stanford and how
they are affected by the ti me he
devotes to basketball.
"Basketball takes five hours
a day during the season," said
Giovacchini. "I'm not saying
I'd use that time for studying,
but that's five hours everyone
else has."
But nobody else has Gino's
starting position on the team.
Three of Stanford's first four
games have been decided by
one point, the fourth one by
two points. Are the close wins
and losses an advantageous or
detrimental way to start a sea
son when one belongs to a
conference that plays "quality
basketball"?
"Well, it'sgoodforyourcon
fidence," said Giovacchini,
"butyou can get overconfident
because you win though
you're not playing that well."
The curly-haired back
courtman said he feels that
Stanford is its own toughest
opponent. "We beat ourselves
against Santa Barbara. We beat
ourselves in turnovers. We did

more to contribute to that loss
than they did."
JVs a boost?
Would havinga juniorvarsity
basketball program contribute
more to Stanford's basketball
fortunes? Giovacchini said he
doesn't feel that would neces
sarily be a positive factor.
"J.V. teams help the prog
ram but they're not that advan
tageous when you compare
the cost to the benefit," he
said.
Giovacchini said it's also a re
flection on Stanford's program
that only one walk-on was ac
cepted this year into the varsity
lineup.
"It's good that we finally
have enough players on scho
larship that we don't have to
take walk-ons. This is the first
year that we haven't needed
more team members just for
practice purposes."
80 winks
As far as getting ready for a
game, Giovacchini likes to
sleep right before the contest
because ""that minute to rest
really clears my head. It helps
me mentally."
The pre-game adrenalin
doesn't really flow for the
soft-spoken guard until the
team comes out onto the floor
the second time. "I'm ready to
go when we come back out.
There's a real burst of energy
that's released when you get
announced and when the
crowd's making a lot of noise it
really helps. Crowds are one of
those little things that add to a
game."
Emotional control is another
little thing that's important. "If
you're going to perform your
best you have to be in control
of yourself first. To generate
team emotion though, it helps
to show your own."
Psyched for Dons
Giovacchini should be up
emotionally for tonight's

game. He attributed the ex
citement generated about USF
to the "natural rivalry between
Bay Area teams. It's important
to win this one."
But Giovacchini doesn't be
lieve in "spouting off at the
mouth. If you beat somebody,
you go and beat them you
don't talk about it."
And to win tonight Giovac
chini, and his teammates, may
have to have that ultimate
game. If he gets sufficient as
sists and steals, and shoots a
good percentage from the
floor ("points aren't that im
portant to me"), he will be
halfway to his goal.
"And oh yes, it would have
to be against a good team,"
Giovacchini added, thinking
about his dream game.
And, in that respect, to
night's game unquestionably
qualifies for Gino's ideal con
test.

As far as getting ready for a
game, Giovacchini likes to
sleep right before the contest
because ""that minute to rest
really clears my head. It helps

The pre-game adrenalin
doesn't really flow for the
soft-spoken guard until the
team comes out onto the floor
the second time. "I'm ready to
go when we come back out.
There's a real burst of energy
that's released when you get
announced and when the
crowd's making a lot of noise it

you're going to perform your

of yourself first. To generate
team emotion though, it helps
to show your own."
Psyched for Dons
Giovacchini should be up
emotionally for tonight's

to the "natural rivalry between
Bay Area teams. It's important
to win this one."
But Giovacchini doesn't be
lieve in "spouting off at the
mouth. If you beat somebody,
you go and beat them you
don't talk about it."
And to win tonight Giovac
chini, and his teammates, may
have to have that ultimate
game. If he gets sufficient as
sists and steals, and shoots a
good percentage from the
floor ("points aren't that im
portant to me"), he will be
halfway to his goal.
"And oh yes, it would have
to be against a good team,"
Giovacchini added, thinking
about his dream game.
And, in that respect, to
night's game unquestionably
qualifies for Gino's ideal con
test.

Paul Giovacchini, starting
guard on the Cardinal basket
ball team, doesn't feel he's had
a great college game yet. The
6-foot-1 junior has a pretty
tough standard in mind for that
perfect game, though.
"Firstwe'd have to win," said
Giovacchini. "Second, we'd
play very good defense, hold
ing the other team to about 55
or 60 points. Third, it would be
a total team effort."
Giovacchini, who's also

been dubbed Gino among a
variety of other names, is cer
tain that Stanford has the po
tential necessary to pull off that
hypothetical game.
"We have all the ingredients
to be good," he said. "We have
a good inside game and that is
essential to winning in the type
of top-flight competition we're
up against.
"We have the quickness and
the strength defensively to re
bound well, and we have the
depth. We're deep enough to

put in new players, if some
one's injured or has fouled
out, without any difficulty."
Rejects ivy walls
Giovacchini came to Stan
ford from Salt Lake City, Utah.
Graduating as valedictorian of
his high school class, Gino
turned down Harvard ("Why go
to an Ivy League school that
doesn't give athletic scholar
ships when you can go to a
Pac-8 one that does?"),
Washington and the University
of San Francisco to accept a
place on the varsity roster at
Stanford as a freshman.
His academic desires coin
cided with his athletic ones al
though he admitted that
"academics took a backseat to
sports in high school." The
economics major has a rather
non-committal attitude about
his studies at Stanford and how
they are affected by the ti me he
devotes to basketball.
"Basketball takes five hours
a day during the season," said
Giovacchini. "I'm not saying
I'd use that time for studying,
but that's five hours everyone
else has."
But nobody else has Gino's
starting position on the team.
Three of Stanford's first four
games have been decided by
one point, the fourth one by
two points. Are the close wins
and losses an advantageous or
detrimental way to start a sea
son when one belongs to a
conference that plays "quality
basketball"?
"Well, it'sgoodforyourcon
fidence," said Giovacchini,
"butyou can get overconfident
because you win though
you're not playing that well."
The curly-haired back
courtman said he feels that
Stanford is its own toughest
opponent. "We beat ourselves
against Santa Barbara. We beat
ourselves in turnovers. We did

more to contribute to that loss
than they did."
JVs a boost?
Would havinga juniorvarsity
basketball program contribute
more to Stanford's basketball
fortunes? Giovacchini said he
doesn't feel that would neces
sarily be a positive factor.
"J.V. teams help the prog
ram but they're not that advan
tageous when you compare
the cost to the benefit," he
said.
Giovacchini said it's also a re
flection on Stanford's program
that only one walk-on was ac
cepted this year into the varsity
lineup.
"It's good that we finally
have enough players on scho
larship that we don't have to
take walk-ons. This is the first
year that we haven't needed
more team members just for
practice purposes."

sports in high school." The
economics major has a rather
non-committal attitude about
his studies at Stanford and how
they are affected by the ti me he
devotes to basketball.
"Basketball takes five hours
a day during the season," said
Giovacchini. "I'm not saying
I'd use that time for studying,
but that's five hours everyone
else has."
But nobody else has Gino's
starting position on the team.
Three of Stanford's first four
games have been decided by
one point, the fourth one by
two points. Are the close wins
and losses an advantageous or
detrimental way to start a sea
son when one belongs to a
conference that plays "quality
basketball"?
"Well, it'sgoodforyourcon
fidence," said Giovacchini,
"butyou can get overconfident
because you win though
you're not playing that well."
The curly-haired back
courtman said he feels that
Stanford is its own toughest
opponent. "We beat ourselves
against Santa Barbara. We beat
ourselves in turnovers. We did

more to contribute to that loss
than they did."
JVs a boost?
Would havinga juniorvarsity
basketball program contribute
more to Stanford's basketball
fortunes? Giovacchini said he
doesn't feel that would neces
sarily be a positive factor.
"J.V. teams help the prog
ram but they're not that advan
tageous when you compare
the cost to the benefit," he
said.
Giovacchini said it's also a re
flection on Stanford's program
that only one walk-on was ac
cepted this year into the varsity
lineup.
"It's good that we finally
have enough players on scho
larship that we don't have to
take walk-ons. This is the first
year that we haven't needed
more team members just for
practice purposes."
80 winks
As far as getting ready for a
game, Giovacchini likes to
sleep right before the contest
because ""that minute to rest
really clears my head. It helps
me mentally."
The pre-game adrenalin
doesn't really flow for the
soft-spoken guard until the
team comes out onto the floor
the second time. "I'm ready to
go when we come back out.
There's a real burst of energy
that's released when you get
announced and when the
crowd's making a lot of noise it
really helps. Crowds are one of
those little things that add to a
game."
Emotional control is another
little thing that's important. "If
you're going to perform your
best you have to be in control
of yourself first. To generate
team emotion though, it helps
to show your own."
Psyched for Dons
Giovacchini should be up
emotionally for tonight's

game. He attributed the ex
citement generated about USF
to the "natural rivalry between
Bay Area teams. It's important
to win this one."
But Giovacchini doesn't be
lieve in "spouting off at the
mouth. If you beat somebody,
you go and beat them you
don't talk about it."
And to win tonight Giovac
chini, and his teammates, may
have to have that ultimate
game. If he gets sufficient as
sists and steals, and shoots a
good percentage from the
floor ("points aren't that im
portant to me"), he will be
halfway to his goal.
"And oh yes, it would have
to be against a good team,"
Giovacchini added, thinking
about his dream game.
And, in that respect, to
night's game unquestionably
qualifies for Gino's ideal con
test.

Paul Giovacchini, starting
guard on the Cardinal basket
ball team, doesn't feel he's had
a great college game yet. The
6-foot-1 junior has a pretty
tough standard in mind for that
perfect game, though.
"Firstwe'd have to win," said
Giovacchini. "Second, we'd
play very good defense, hold
ing the other team to about 55
or 60 points. Third, it would be
a total team effort."
Giovacchini, who's also

been dubbed Gino among a
variety of other names, is cer
tain that Stanford has the po
tential necessary to pull off that
hypothetical game.
"We have all the ingredients
to be good," he said. "We have
a good inside game and that is
essential to winning in the type
of top-flight competition we're
up against.
"We have the quickness and
the strength defensively to re
bound well, and we have the
depth. We're deep enough to

put in new players, if some
one's injured or has fouled
out, without any difficulty."
Rejects ivy walls
Giovacchini came to Stan
ford from Salt Lake City, Utah.
Graduating as valedictorian of
his high school class, Gino
turned down Harvard ("Why go
to an Ivy League school that
doesn't give athletic scholar
ships when you can go to a
Pac-8 one that does?"),
Washington and the University
of San Francisco to accept a
place on the varsity roster at
Stanford as a freshman.
