# Women dribble through toughest schedule ever
## 
### Chris Haft 
This will be a challenging
season for the Stanford wo
men's basketball team. Not
only are the Cardinals begin
ning the year with injuries to
two key players but they are
also saddled with inexperience
(seven of the 14 players are
freshmen). In addition, the
rigorous 28-game schedule is
the toughest that Stanford's
women have ever faced.
Yet the outlook remains
promising, and there is every
indication that much excite
ment will be generated when
coach Dotty McCrea's cagers
take the court.
Expect a fast-paced offensive
attack from Stanford this year.
"We just want to get the ball up
the floor as quickly as possi
ble," said McCrea. "We hope
to run a lot, and against a man
to-man defense we'll probably
play passing game."
On defense, the Cards will
usually employ a man-to-man
alignment, as McCrea said she
feels that is the most effective
defensive mode. However,
Stanford may turn to a zone
when they meet extraordinar
ily talented opponents or wish
to change the game's tempo.
Aches and pains
The Cards are severely ham
pered by injuries to starters
Stephanie Galef, a junior for
ward, and Betsy Lough, a
sophomore forward-guard.
"They are experienced players,
and we'll really miss them,"
McCrea said.
These setbacks give the re
maining players, particularly
the freshmen, an added bur
den. McCrea said, "Without

Betsy and Stephanie, we're
putting in freshmen who have
never played college ball.
Some of these girls have never
been really coached in high
school, so it's a big transition
for them."
Stanford is led by 6-foot-1
senior center Maggie Nelson
and 5-10 frosh forward-center
Kathy Murphy. Each scored 20
points in the season-opening
62-61 loss to U.C.-Santa Bar
bara.
Others expected to contri
bute are freshmen guards Beth
Boylan and Rebecca Garcia,
sophomore forward Barbara
Boylan and frosh center Ann
Cooper.
Rounding out the squad are
guards Lauri De'Armond,
Nancy Lovvold and Francis
O'Meara, forwards Peggy
Bruggman and Renee Steiner
and center Patti McKinney.
Grants
The women's basketball
program granted its first scho
larships last year. This season,
both Murphy and Beth Boylan
are on scholarship.
"Next year I hope to get a
few more scholarship players,"
McCrea said. "You can't com
pete without them (scholar
ships) now."
With the addition of Mur
phy, McCrea is optimistic
about the future. "I really feel
Kathy is the beginning of buil
ding our program because
she's going to be an outstand
ing player. If we get players like
her, we'll eventually have more
good players coming here."
But first McCrea must deal
with the present specifically,
Stanford's difficult schedule.

Among the formidable foes are
UCLA, Cal State-Fullerton and
Cal Poly-Pomona.
"In our league, San Jose
State and California will be
good," McCrea added. "We
have a very good chance of
winning our league and qual
ifying for the regionals, if we
stay healthy."
One of McCrea's favorite
basketball tactics as a player
was to smile at the person
guarding her after scoring a
basket. McCrea hasn't yet told
her players about this habit,
however. "They don't usually
smile too much," she said. But,
if Stanford starts winning regu
larly, look for an improvement
in the Cards' dispositions.

With the addition of Mur

Kathy is the beginning of buil
ding our program because
she's going to be an outstand

good players coming here."
But first McCrea must deal
with the present specifically,
Stanford's difficult schedule.

Among the formidable foes are
UCLA, Cal State-Fullerton and
Cal Poly-Pomona.
"In our league, San Jose
State and California will be
good," McCrea added. "We
have a very good chance of

One of McCrea's favorite

Stanford's Kathy Murphy (44), Ann Cooper (31) and Beth Boylan (11) watch a UC-Santa Barbara player tip the
ball in Stanford's opening season one-point loss to the Gauchos.
This will be a challenging
season for the Stanford wo
men's basketball team. Not
only are the Cardinals begin
ning the year with injuries to
two key players but they are
also saddled with inexperience
(seven of the 14 players are
freshmen). In addition, the
rigorous 28-game schedule is
the toughest that Stanford's
women have ever faced.
Yet the outlook remains
promising, and there is every
indication that much excite
ment will be generated when
coach Dotty McCrea's cagers
take the court.
Expect a fast-paced offensive
attack from Stanford this year.
"We just want to get the ball up
the floor as quickly as possi
ble," said McCrea. "We hope
to run a lot, and against a man
to-man defense we'll probably
play passing game."
On defense, the Cards will
usually employ a man-to-man
alignment, as McCrea said she
feels that is the most effective
defensive mode. However,
Stanford may turn to a zone
when they meet extraordinar
ily talented opponents or wish
to change the game's tempo.
Aches and pains
The Cards are severely ham
pered by injuries to starters
Stephanie Galef, a junior for
ward, and Betsy Lough, a
sophomore forward-guard.
"They are experienced players,
and we'll really miss them,"
McCrea said.
These setbacks give the re
maining players, particularly
the freshmen, an added bur
den. McCrea said, "Without

Betsy and Stephanie, we're
putting in freshmen who have
never played college ball.
Some of these girls have never
been really coached in high
school, so it's a big transition
for them."
Stanford is led by 6-foot-1
senior center Maggie Nelson
and 5-10 frosh forward-center
Kathy Murphy. Each scored 20
points in the season-opening
62-61 loss to U.C.-Santa Bar
bara.
Others expected to contri
bute are freshmen guards Beth
Boylan and Rebecca Garcia,
sophomore forward Barbara
Boylan and frosh center Ann
Cooper.
Rounding out the squad are
guards Lauri De'Armond,
Nancy Lovvold and Francis
O'Meara, forwards Peggy
Bruggman and Renee Steiner
and center Patti McKinney.
