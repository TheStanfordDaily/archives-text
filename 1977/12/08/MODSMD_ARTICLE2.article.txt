# Cardiac Cardinals battle Dons
## Without Cartwright, USF still an awesome lineup 
### Bruce Anderson 
The University of San Fran
cisco Dons feel they've had a
bad game if they haven't won
by 20 points.
Stanford's cagers, however,
consider it a sleeper when they
win by two.
Such are the contrasting
looks USF (2-1) and Stanford
(3-1) present tonight as the
Cards host the Dons in Maples
Pavilion.
"We're going to play USF no
different than our other four
games this season," Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso said Tues
day. "We'll do nothing spe
cial."
And if the game tonight goes
like Stanford's first four games,
don't leave at halftime no mat
ter what the score. Stanford
won its first three games by a
total of four points including
a pair of one-point overtime
victories then dropped a
one-point decision to UC-
Santa Barbara in its last outing.
Coach Bob Gaillard's Dons,
on the other hand, won their
first two games handily, then
were upended Saturday by
Arizona State. The loss not
withstanding, USF is ranked
No. 8 by the Associated Press
and No. 9 by United Press In
ternational.
"USF presents what all good

teams present," Dißiaso said,
"an awesome front line and a
backcourt that will score if you
jam the inside."
USF's "awesome front line"
would be even more herculean
if not for the absence of
7-foot-2 All-America center Bill
Cartwright who is missing the
early season with a broken left
arm.
James Hardy, normally a
standout forward, has moved
to the post until Cartwright re
turns to the lineup. The 6-8
junior, all-conference last sea
son at forward, has averaged
18.6 points a game while pul
ling down 11.6 rebounds a
game. Joining Hardy on the
front line are forwards Winford
Boynes and Doug Jemison.
A 6-7 junior, Boynes is
averaging 15.7 points a game,
while Jemison has spelled
Hardy on the boards grabbing
nine rebounds a contest.
Faster Dons
The loss of Cartwright has
left USF not quite as dominant
on the boards but much
quicker, according to USF as
sistant coach Dan Belluomini.
"They're just as awesome a
rebounding team as Santa
Clara, but quicker," said Di-
Biaso. Stanford, which man
aged to outrebound Santa

Clara and edge the Broncos by
two points, will have center Jeff
McHugh and forwards Kim
berly Belton and Jay Carter on
the front line.
Belton and Carter lead the
Cards in rebounding with 8.8
and 7.5 caroms a game, respec
tively. Belton, a 6-7 sophomore
from the Bronx, also leads the
team in scoring with 16.3
points per game while shoot
ing more than 60 per cent from
the floor.
Main matchup
Belluomini said he believes
the key to shutting down Stan
ford may be shutting down Bel
ton.
"If he gets his 20 points and
15rebounds, it could be a long
night. We need to control
Kimberly."
He added that the matchup
between Belton and Jemison
could be a crucial indicator of
the direction of the game.
"Both are very physical
players. It may be a very in
teresting matchup."
Versatile attack
Should Stanford try to clog
the middle to take away USF's
inside game, the Dons'
backcourt has the ability to
pick up any offensive slack.
Veteran Chubby Cox paces the
Dons' scoring with a 19.6 aver
age. He shares the ball
handling duties with Rod Wil
liams and Sam Williams. And
the former has an uncannily
accurate shot.
"He doesn't count them if
they hit the rim and go in," Di-
Biaso said. Indeed, Williams
has hit 16 of 22 shots from the
field for a .727 shooting aver
age while sinking 14 of 15 from
the foul line, a .933 clip.
Stanford's backcourt, how

ever, has not yet found the
range this season. Two-year
starter Wolfe Perry will see the
opening tip off from the bench
for the first time since the mid
dle of his freshman year. Perry
has hit only 31.3 per cent from
the field and freshman Mark
Pitchford will start in his place
as Dißiaso searches for consis
tency in the backcourt.
Pitchford, averaging 13.3
points a game, came off the
bench to play a vital role in
Stanford's three early season
victories. Junior Paul Giovac
chini, bothered by a hamstring

pull earlier in the week, is ex
pected to start at the play mak
ing guard slot. Giovacchini
leads the Cards in assists with
17.
Heavenly help
The Cards will need a divine
assist if they are to stay in the
game with USF tonight.
And what if it comes down to
one point in the last minute?
"We'd like to get the game
down to where it's decided in
the last minute," Dißiaso said.
From the Stanford rooting
section comes a responsive,
"Amen."
