# Pitchford moves to starting role
## 
### George Anders 
After coming off the bench
in Stanford's first three basket
ball games to spark the Cards
to victory, freshman guard
Mark Pitchford may be leaving
that bench behind.
Tonight, Pitchford will debut
in the starting lineup against
powerhouse University of San
Francisco.
"We've been preparing re
ally well, and that makes things
a little easier," Pitchford said.
"The fact that USF has been
beaten helps us too."
Pitchford should know
about beating teams. His two
baskets against San Jose State
in the last minute of play
helped the Cards eke out an
81-80 overtime victory in that
game, and he contributed two
more crucial field goals in the
closing minutes of the Cards'
victory over Sarita Clara.
First weekend honored
For his performances against
San Jose State on Nov. 26 and
against Cal Poly-Pomona the
night before, when he topped
all scorers with 28 points, Pitch
ford was named Northern
California Player of the Week.
Asked if he feels any pres
sure coming off the bench into
games like those, Pitchford
said, "There's no reason for me
to be nervous.
"You can't play so cautiously
as to avoid mistakes," he ad
ded, "because then you'll
make mistakes. If you do make
a mistake, you can't dwell on it.
It's tough."
Pitchford's progress this sea
son has been "a pleasant sur
prise," Card coach Dick Di-
Biaso said. "We knew he was
an outstanding shooter, but we
didn't know if he could make
the conversion from a 6-foot-4
high school forward to a
6-foot-4 college guard."
"Ball-handling and passing
were my two weakest areas,"
Pitchford said, "and probably
still are. I've got to work on
that."
Knows his hardwood
Offsetting these problems,
thougfp, Pitchford has what Di-
Biaso termed "remarkable
court awareness a sense of
where you're supposed to be.
He understands offensive and
defensive concepts, and learns
quickly."
Pitchford learned a lot of his
basketball playing in high
school for St. John's in
Washington, D.C. The coach

there, Joe Gallagher, "is a
legend in the D.C. area," Di-
Biaso said.
Pitchford said his high
school coach gave him a
thorough grounding in bas
ketball fundamentals, so that
even against more talented
players, "I'm a step ahead of
them, fundamentals-wise."
In the Cards' first game of
the season, against Cal Poly-
Pomona, Pitchford scored 24 of
his 28 points in the second half,
when he was 11 of 13 from the
field. "You might say I'm a
streak shooter," he said, "but
tjiat was a particularly long
streak."
In Stanford's most recent
game, against Santa Barbara,
Pitchford logged only 11 mi

nutes of playing time, and
scored just two points.
"Santa Barbara had a point
guard who was super quick,"
he said, "so it made more
sense to play Daryle Morgan,
who's pretty quick, too, in
stead of me."
Pitchford can expect tough
opposition tonight, with USF
heavily favored. But according
to Di√üiaso, "Players live to be
put into pressure situations."
And Pitchford indicated he's
willing to face pressure in the
classroom as well. Having been
a salutatorian in high school,
Pitchford said he finds Stan
ford to be "a challenge. But I
was well prepared, and I'm a
hard-working student. I can
accept the challenge."
