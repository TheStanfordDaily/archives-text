From the time LSU and Stan
ford arrived in El Paso a week
ago to the opening kickoff of
the Sun Bowl Saturday,
everyone spoke in superlatives
about the potent offenses of
both teams and laughed away
their supposedly leaky de
fenses.
Pregame speculation had the
two offenses scorching the ar
tificial surface at the Sun Bowl,
racing back and forth down the
field on blistering drives. Fans
worried that the scoreboard
would short-circuit tallying all
the points that were sure to be
scored.
But a surprising Stanford de
tense blanked the Bayou Ben
gals in the second half to key
the Cardinals to a 24-14 upset
which gave the Cardinals a 9-3
mark in their first season under
head coach Bill Walsh.
After trailing 14-10 at inter
mission, the Cards scored
twice on second-half aerials by
All-America quarterback Guy

Benjamin. Stanford's oppor
tunistic defense sealed the vic
tory, stopping two LSU drives
deep in Stanford territory with
interceptions.
"This is the best defensive
game we played all season,"
Walsh said in the jubilant Stan
ford locker room. "As far as
execution by our defense, de
sign by our coaches and the de
fense's willingness to pay the
price to stop somebody, I don't
think our defense could have
played a better game."
Cardinal middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, named the
game's outstanding lineman by
sportswriters, sparked the
Stanford defense by making 18
solo tackles and assisting on
four others.
"Everybody's got this thing
that we can't play defense,"
Ceresino said "We |ust put out
a great defensive effort."
Ceresino played hurt
throughout the regular season
but came into the Sun Bowl
healthy after resting since the
Big Game, six weeks before the
LSU contest. Walsh said having
Ceresino healthy made all the
difference on defense.
"When I'm 100 per cent I feel
I can play football," Ceresino
said. "That's the way I was

today — 100 per cent. When
you're healthy you can jump
over people, dive and go reck
less."
For Stanford's defense,
stopping LSU meant stopping
tailback Charles Alexander, a
junior All-American who
finished the regular season as
the nation's No. 2 rusher with
1686 yards and 17 touchdowns.
In the first half Stanford had
little luck against the 6-foot-1,
214-pound ground machine.
Alexander rushed for 123 yards
before halftime, set up LSU's
first touchdown with a 53-yard
dash down the left sideline and
scored the Bengals' second
touchdown with a 7-yard burst
over left end.
Stanford remained within
striking distance in the first
half. Twice in the first quarter
Benjamin tried to hook up with
flanker James Lofton on long
bombs, but overthrew the
speedy wide receiver both
times.
On the third play of the sec
ond quarter Lofton ran a post
pattern up the middle of the
field and Benjamin arched
another long pass which found
its way into Lofton's out
stretched hands at the 5-yard

line. Lofton fell into the end
zone with Stanford's first
score.
The 6-foot-3 senior threw the
ball down, then he and split
end Bill Kellar moved around
the ball in some sort of ritual
dance.
Lofton explained after the
game that one day in practice
he dropped a pass and Kellar
came over and put a hex on the
ball so it wouldn't be dropped
again. The balls were no longer
dropped and the ritual re
mained for touchdowns.

Stanford scored later in the
quarter on a 36-yard boot by
freshman Ken Naber. The
Cards grabbed a 17-14 advan
tage on their first possession in
the second half.
Benjamin, who had an excel
lent day, setting Sun Bowl re
cords with 23 completions (on
36 passes) and 269 yards in the
air, connected on four passes
to drive Stanford to the LSU
2-yard line where the Cards
faced fourth-and-1.
The 6-foot-4 quarterback
then found Lofton slanting ac
ross the end zone. It was Lof

ton's 14th TD reception of the
season. It was the same play
Stanford used to beat Tulane
early in the season.
"Their defense didn't make
an adjustment when I went in
motion," Lofton said. "As soon
as that happened, I knew it
would be there."
Early in the fourth quarter
the Bengals moved the ball to
the Stanford 19. Ensminger
then fired a pass to his favorite
receiver, split end Carlos Car
son. But cornerback John
Pigott stepped in front of Car
son and pirated Ensminger's

throw.
Stanford, on the other hand,
had no turnovers during the
game but had its own costly
miscues. The Cards had three
consecutive drives halted in
the second half by 15-yard
penalties.
"The penalties nullified our
offense in the second half,"
Walsh said. "It was the first
time this season we've had
problems with penalties."
After an exchange of punts in
the fourth quarter, Stanford
regained possession of the ball
with 4:22 left. Benjamin started

the Cards moving on the
ground to eat up the remaining
time. Five straight runs put the
ball into LSU territory.
From the LSU 36 Benjamin
sent Kellar over the middle on a
slant pattern. Kellar was co
vered well, so Benjamin flicked
a short pass to running back
Darrin Nelson in the left flat.
Nelson evaded one defender,
flirted with the sideline, then
dashed into the end zone with
the final score.
"Bill Kellar ran a slant across
the middle that attracted
everybody," Benjamin said,
"and Darrin ran a little flat pat
tern underneath that attracted
nobody."
"We overplayed our hand at
the end and Nelson's
touchdown put the game out
of reach," LSU coach Charlie
McClendon said. "Stanford
does a great job dropping the
ball off to backs and they gave
Benjamin great protection.
"We invited problems with
some of our errors." But
McClendon added, "I can't be
happier with Alexander's ef
forts."
Alexander set a Sun Bowl re
cord, gaining 197 yards on 31
carries, and was named the
game's most valuable player.
But for all Alexander's indi
vidual heroics, it was the ability
of the pune4«y Stanford de
fense to keep him out of the
end zone in the second half
that left the El Paso sun shining
on the Cards long after it had
set on the Bengals.

came in the fourth Quarter on a 36 yard pass from Guy Benjamin. It
was Benjamin's third TD pass of the day, leading Stanford to its 24-14
win over LSU.
