From the time LSU and Stan
ford arrived in El Paso a week
ago to the opening kickoff of
the Sun Bowl Saturday,
everyone spoke in superlatives
about the potent offenses of
both teams and laughed away
their supposedly leaky de
fenses.
Pregame speculation had the
two offenses scorching the ar
tificial surface at the Sun Bowl,
racing back and forth down the
field on blistering drives. Fans
worried that the scoreboard
would short-circuit tallying all
the points that were sure to be
scored.
But a surprising Stanford de
tense blanked the Bayou Ben
gals in the second half to key
the Cardinals to a 24-14 upset
which gave the Cardinals a 9-3
mark in their first season under
head coach Bill Walsh.
After trailing 14-10 at inter
mission, the Cards scored
twice on second-half aerials by
All-America quarterback Guy

Benjamin. Stanford's oppor
tunistic defense sealed the vic
tory, stopping two LSU drives
deep in Stanford territory with
interceptions.
"This is the best defensive
game we played all season,"
Walsh said in the jubilant Stan
ford locker room. "As far as
execution by our defense, de
sign by our coaches and the de
fense's willingness to pay the
price to stop somebody, I don't
think our defense could have
played a better game."
Cardinal middle linebacker
Gordy Ceresino, named the
game's outstanding lineman by
sportswriters, sparked the
Stanford defense by making 18
solo tackles and assisting on
four others.
"Everybody's got this thing
that we can't play defense,"
Ceresino said "We |ust put out
a great defensive effort."
Ceresino played hurt
throughout the regular season
but came into the Sun Bowl
healthy after resting since the
Big Game, six weeks before the
LSU contest. Walsh said having
Ceresino healthy made all the
difference on defense.
"When I'm 100 per cent I feel
I can play football," Ceresino
said. "That's the way I was

today — 100 per cent. When
you're healthy you can jump
over people, dive and go reck
less."
For Stanford's defense,
stopping LSU meant stopping
tailback Charles Alexander, a
junior All-American who
finished the regular season as
the nation's No. 2 rusher with
1686 yards and 17 touchdowns.
In the first half Stanford had
little luck against the 6-foot-1,
214-pound ground machine.
Alexander rushed for 123 yards
before halftime, set up LSU's
first touchdown with a 53-yard
dash down the left sideline and
scored the Bengals' second
touchdown with a 7-yard burst
over left end.
Stanford remained within
striking distance in the first
half. Twice in the first quarter
Benjamin tried to hook up with
flanker James Lofton on long
bombs, but overthrew the
speedy wide receiver both
times.
On the third play of the sec
ond quarter Lofton ran a post
pattern up the middle of the
field and Benjamin arched
another long pass which found
its way into Lofton's out
stretched hands at the 5-yard
