# Solutions for the registration problem
## 
### 
Javier Valencia

As registration once again rolls
around, I find myself disgruntled
with the fact that I will have little or
no chance of getting into any of
those classes which have limited en
rollment.
Let me start off by saying that I am
not out to chastize those whose last
names start with the first letters of
the alphabet; in fact, some of my
best friends have names that start
with A's, B's, and C's. All I am at
tempting to do is expose an unjust
situation which has somehow man
aged to elude both Stanford adminis
trators and the student body alike.
I am certain that most people are
familiar with how oui present regist
ration system is formulated, but for
those lacking knowledge of its or
ganization, I will attempt an explana
tion.
First, those students whose pa
rents or husbands have given them
last names starting with the letters
A-D register first for autumn quarter,
with everyone else following al
phabetically. During winter quarter,
the A-D group is last to register and
the E-JUD group gets first crack at
classes. Spring quarter sees the
E-JUD's falling down behind the A-D
group, and the JUE-PlM's moving
into the number one slot.
Now, what are the people in the
PIN-ZZZ group doing all this time?
Well, we're trying to talk our more
fortunate friends into signing our
names on class lists so that the"V"
will look like a "C." While some may
be quick to point out that we get our

long-awaited top ranking when
summer quarter comes along, I for
one would gladly change places with
an A or B or even an N!
Having unmasked this blatantly
unfair practice, I have a couple of
solutions to rectify this discriminat
ory situation without the aid of the
courts. The first would simply divide
the alphabet into three blocks (s v
A-CIL, GIM-MIL and MIM-Z/.Z) in
stead of the present four. This may
mean registration would have to run
an extra hour each day, but I believe
it's worth the sacrifice. As for regist
ration for summer quarter, I would
instigate a first-come-first-servt> re
gistration.
Realizing that things are almost
never done the easy way, I submit
plan two. This scheme would require
everyone to take part in the housing
draw. It would not affect the housing
selection process, but it would allow
everyone an opportunity to choose a
number at random. Those who draw
extremely high numbers will still get
stuck in the trailers, but this number
will also entitle them to preferential
treatment when it comes time to re
gister.
The individual drawing number
one will be so ecstatic about getting
into 558 Mayfield, he/she won't
worry about classes. What happens
to the poor souls who draw in the
2500'5? I'd suggest they write a letter
to the Daily.

long-awaited top ranking when
summer quarter comes along, I for
one would gladly change places with
an A or B or even an N!
Having unmasked this blatantly
unfair practice, I have a couple of
solutions to rectify this discriminat
ory situation without the aid of the
courts. The first would simply divide
the alphabet into three blocks (s v
A-CIL, GIM-MIL and MIM-Z/.Z) in
stead of the present four. This may
mean registration would have to run
an extra hour each day, but I believe
it's worth the sacrifice. As for regist
ration for summer quarter, I would
instigate a first-come-first-servt> re
gistration.
Realizing that things are almost
never done the easy way, I submit
plan two. This scheme would require
everyone to take part in the housing
draw. It would not affect the housing
selection process, but it would allow
everyone an opportunity to choose a
number at random. Those who draw
extremely high numbers will still get
stuck in the trailers, but this number
will also entitle them to preferential
treatment when it comes time to re
gister.
The individual drawing number
one will be so ecstatic about getting
into 558 Mayfield, he/she won't
worry about classes. What happens
to the poor souls who draw in the
2500'5? I'd suggest they write a letter
to the Daily.

As registration once again rolls
around, I find myself disgruntled
with the fact that I will have little or
no chance of getting into any of
those classes which have limited en
rollment.
Let me start off by saying that I am
not out to chastize those whose last
names start with the first letters of
the alphabet; in fact, some of my
best friends have names that start
with A's, B's, and C's. All I am at
tempting to do is expose an unjust
situation which has somehow man
aged to elude both Stanford adminis
trators and the student body alike.
I am certain that most people are
familiar with how oui present regist
ration system is formulated, but for
those lacking knowledge of its or
ganization, I will attempt an explana
tion.
First, those students whose pa
rents or husbands have given them
last names starting with the letters
A-D register first for autumn quarter,
with everyone else following al
phabetically. During winter quarter,
the A-D group is last to register and
the E-JUD group gets first crack at
classes. Spring quarter sees the
E-JUD's falling down behind the A-D
group, and the JUE-PlM's moving
into the number one slot.
Now, what are the people in the
PIN-ZZZ group doing all this time?
Well, we're trying to talk our more
fortunate friends into signing our
names on class lists so that the"V"
will look like a "C." While some may
be quick to point out that we get our

long-awaited top ranking when
summer quarter comes along, I for
one would gladly change places with
an A or B or even an N!
