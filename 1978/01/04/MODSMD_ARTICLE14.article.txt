Some $13.8 million of the of
fering will eventually be used
to pay back bonds issued in
1975 in the first Stanford-CEFA
borrowing.
Those bonds were issued at
7.2 per cent interest, and were
originally scheduled to mature
in 2000, but will be called ear
lier. The University will rebor
row the money at about 5.5 per
cent interest, saving an esti
mated $1 million to $2 million
dollars, according to Rodney
Adams, director of finance.
Adams said the 5.5 per cent
rate is "very low, in fact the
lowest for long-term municipal
bonds in a decade." He said
the University would issue the
new bonds and use the princi
pal to purchase U.S. Treasury
securities, scheduled to ma
ture on Jan. 1, 1985, the first
date the University can legally
call the original bonds.
The old bonds will be paid
off when the treasury notes
mature. The treasury securities
will pay the University 5.5 per
cent, thereby reducing the cost
of the extra bonds to zero,
Adams said.
The remaining new bonds
will help pay for general im
provements on campus plus
the History Corner renovation,
and the proposed new Compu
ter Center. In addition, short
term bonds will pay for con
struction of the Green Library
addition until pledges of gifts

are received.
The University's current
CEFA issues carry a AAA rating,
the highest available.
The administration's request
for bonding authority was
coupled with a request for ap
proval of Bank of America as
adviser to the University on the
offering. Also requested was
approval of a resolution stating
Stanford approved of Bank of
America as a bidder on the
bond offering despite its posi
tion as adviser.
The board approved all three
requests.
Adams explained that Bank
of America is a "very significant
underwriter" in California, and
allowing it to bid on the offer
ing would likely reduce the
University's cost in the issue.
Adams said this is because
interest rates will generally be
lower if the bonds are sold in
California where they are
exempt from both state and
federal income taxes. If the
bonds are sold elsewhere, they
may be subject to tax, meaning
the interest rates would have to
be higher to make the offering
attractive to potential buyers.
Adams said there was no
conflict of interests involved
and said there are no regula
tions preventing a Bank of
America bid. He said the action
was just to clarify the Univer
sity position on the issue.

Some $13.8 million of the of
fering will eventually be used
to pay back bonds issued in
1975 in the first Stanford-CEFA
borrowing.
Those bonds were issued at
7.2 per cent interest, and were
originally scheduled to mature
in 2000, but will be called ear
lier. The University will rebor
row the money at about 5.5 per
cent interest, saving an esti
mated $1 million to $2 million
dollars, according to Rodney
Adams, director of finance.
Adams said the 5.5 per cent
rate is "very low, in fact the
lowest for long-term municipal
bonds in a decade." He said
the University would issue the
new bonds and use the princi
pal to purchase U.S. Treasury
securities, scheduled to ma
ture on Jan. 1, 1985, the first
date the University can legally
call the original bonds.
The old bonds will be paid
off when the treasury notes
mature. The treasury securities
will pay the University 5.5 per
cent, thereby reducing the cost
of the extra bonds to zero,
Adams said.
The remaining new bonds
will help pay for general im
provements on campus plus
the History Corner renovation,
and the proposed new Compu
ter Center. In addition, short
term bonds will pay for con
struction of the Green Library
addition until pledges of gifts

are received.
The University's current
CEFA issues carry a AAA rating,
the highest available.
The administration's request
for bonding authority was
coupled with a request for ap
proval of Bank of America as
adviser to the University on the
offering. Also requested was
approval of a resolution stating
Stanford approved of Bank of
America as a bidder on the
bond offering despite its posi
tion as adviser.
The board approved all three
requests.
Adams explained that Bank
of America is a "very significant
underwriter" in California, and
allowing it to bid on the offer
ing would likely reduce the
University's cost in the issue.
Adams said this is because
interest rates will generally be
lower if the bonds are sold in
California where they are
exempt from both state and
federal income taxes. If the
bonds are sold elsewhere, they
may be subject to tax, meaning
the interest rates would have to
be higher to make the offering
attractive to potential buyers.
Adams said there was no
conflict of interests involved
and said there are no regula
tions preventing a Bank of
America bid. He said the action
was just to clarify the Univer
sity position on the issue.
The Board ot Trustees au
thorized administrators here to
borrow over $28 million for
facilities improvements and re
financing of older bonds at its
December meeting.
The borrowing will be ac
complished by offering tax
exempt bonds through the
California Educational
Facilities Authority (CEFA) early
this year.

the History Corner renovation,
and the proposed new Compu
ter Center. In addition, short
term bonds will pay for con
struction of the Green Library
addition until pledges of gifts

are received.
The University's current
CEFA issues carry a AAA rating,
the highest available.
The administration's request
for bonding authority was
coupled with a request for ap
proval of Bank of America as
adviser to the University on the
offering. Also requested was
approval of a resolution stating
Stanford approved of Bank of
America as a bidder on the
bond offering despite its posi
tion as adviser.
The board approved all three
requests.
Adams explained that Bank
of America is a "very significant
underwriter" in California, and
allowing it to bid on the offer
ing would likely reduce the
University's cost in the issue.
Adams said this is because
interest rates will generally be
lower if the bonds are sold in
California where they are
exempt from both state and
federal income taxes. If the
bonds are sold elsewhere, they
may be subject to tax, meaning
the interest rates would have to
be higher to make the offering
attractive to potential buyers.
Adams said there was no
conflict of interests involved
and said there are no regula
tions preventing a Bank of
America bid. He said the action
was just to clarify the Univer
sity position on the issue.
