El Pasj, Texas — Six weeks of
rest, a more basic approach
and a whole lot of gang tackling
— these three ingredients
combined Saturday on the arti
ficial turf of the Sun Bowl as the
Stanford defense contained
Louisiana State's break-away
rushing threat in keying the
Cards' 24-14 win over the Ti
gers.
"I was in agreement with a
lot of people it'd be a high scor
ing game," said Stanford mid
dle linebacker Gordy Cere
sino. "We bent in a lot of spots,
but the guys never gave up."
A big reason the Card de
fense broke only twice was
Ceresino, who finished with 18
tackles and four assists and was
voted winner of the Chuck
Hughes Memorial Award as the
game's most valuable lineman.
Ceresino credited the six
week lay-off since the Cal game
for the improved health of his
injured knees which had ham
pered his mobility during the
season.
"Did that mean everything!"
said Ceresino, the Italian Stall
ion who had been uncere
moniously referred to as the
Guinea Pig at one El Paso lunc
heon. "People had started ask
ing, 'What happened to Cere
sino?' "
Another factor contributing
to Ceresino's seeming om
nipresence on the field was the
Stanford defensive alignment.
"By the design of the defense,"
said strong safety Ralph Phil

lips, "in the 4-3 defense the
middle linebacker is supposed
to make most of the tackles."
Tough blocker
The LSU player who most
often turned out to be blocking
on Ceresino was fullback Kelly
Simmons. "He's one helluva of
a blocker," said Ceresino. "On
the sweeps, Simmons was the
first man out, and in our de
fense, I'm supposed to make
the tackle."
Even after Ceresino man
aged to get by Simmons' block,
though, stopping tailback
Charles Alexander, the
second-leading rusher in the
country this season, was not
easy. "Charles Alexander was
the biggest threat today," said
Ceresino. "He's their whole of
fense."
Ceresino and Phillips both
said that the defensive play cal
ling by the coaches accounted
in large measure for the Cardi
nals' defensive improvement.
"We have a lot of pretty com
plicated defenses," said Phil
lips. "From the beginning of
the year, the coaching has
changed a little. I guess you
could say we did less gambl
ing."
Key blitzes
But in taking less chances on
defense, the Cards did not quit
blitzing altogether. "Our
coaches called one of the best
games of the year," said Cere
sino. For instance, at the be
ginning of the fourth quarter
on a second-and-eight situa
tion from the Stanford 15

yardline, Ceresino knifed in to
nail Tiger quarterback Steve
Ensminger on a rollout for a
4-yard loss. Faced with a pas
sing situation on third down,
Ensminger's toss was inter
cepted by cornerback John
Pigott.
Then later in the period, on a
third-and-eight situation, from
the Tigers' 45, LSU's other
quarterback David Woodley

was sacked on another blitz by
Ceresino. The next time LSU
got its hands on the ball they
trailed by 10. "We expected a
roll-out," said Ceresino. "We
ran a backside blitz hoping to
get there before they threw the
ball."
And on Saturday, when
Ceresino got to the ball, the
play was over.

changed a little. I guess you
could say we did less gambl
ing."
Key blitzes
But in taking less chances on
defense, the Cards did not quit
blitzing altogether. "Our
coaches called one of the best
games of the year," said Cere
sino. For instance, at the be
ginning of the fourth quarter
on a second-and-eight situa
tion from the Stanford 15

yardline, Ceresino knifed in to
nail Tiger quarterback Steve
Ensminger on a rollout for a
4-yard loss. Faced with a pas
sing situation on third down,
Ensminger's toss was inter
cepted by cornerback John
Pigott.
Then later in the period, on a
third-and-eight situation, from
the Tigers' 45, LSU's other
quarterback David Woodley

was sacked on another blitz by
Ceresino. The next time LSU
got its hands on the ball they
trailed by 10. "We expected a
roll-out," said Ceresino. "We
ran a backside blitz hoping to
get there before they threw the
ball."
And on Saturday, when
Ceresino got to the ball, the
play was over.
El Pasj, Texas — Six weeks of
rest, a more basic approach
and a whole lot of gang tackling
— these three ingredients
combined Saturday on the arti
ficial turf of the Sun Bowl as the
Stanford defense contained
Louisiana State's break-away
rushing threat in keying the
Cards' 24-14 win over the Ti
gers.
"I was in agreement with a
lot of people it'd be a high scor
ing game," said Stanford mid
dle linebacker Gordy Cere
sino. "We bent in a lot of spots,
but the guys never gave up."
A big reason the Card de
fense broke only twice was
Ceresino, who finished with 18
tackles and four assists and was
voted winner of the Chuck
Hughes Memorial Award as the
game's most valuable lineman.
Ceresino credited the six
week lay-off since the Cal game
for the improved health of his
injured knees which had ham
pered his mobility during the
season.
"Did that mean everything!"
said Ceresino, the Italian Stall
ion who had been uncere
moniously referred to as the
Guinea Pig at one El Paso lunc
heon. "People had started ask
ing, 'What happened to Cere
sino?' "
Another factor contributing
to Ceresino's seeming om
nipresence on the field was the
Stanford defensive alignment.
"By the design of the defense,"
said strong safety Ralph Phil

lips, "in the 4-3 defense the
middle linebacker is supposed
to make most of the tackles."
Tough blocker
The LSU player who most
often turned out to be blocking
on Ceresino was fullback Kelly
Simmons. "He's one helluva of
a blocker," said Ceresino. "On
the sweeps, Simmons was the
first man out, and in our de
fense, I'm supposed to make
the tackle."
Even after Ceresino man
aged to get by Simmons' block,
though, stopping tailback
Charles Alexander, the
second-leading rusher in the
country this season, was not
easy. "Charles Alexander was
the biggest threat today," said
Ceresino. "He's their whole of
fense."
Ceresino and Phillips both
said that the defensive play cal
ling by the coaches accounted
in large measure for the Cardi
nals' defensive improvement.
"We have a lot of pretty com
plicated defenses," said Phil
lips. "From the beginning of
the year, the coaching has
changed a little. I guess you
could say we did less gambl
ing."
