# Sun Bowl setting different for fans
## 
### George Anders 
El Paso, Texas — For the 12th
time this season, Guy Benja
min has connected with James
Lofton on a touchdown pass.
But for the first time since
September, you aren't im
mediately flooded with the
sound of the Band playing "Al
right Now," the sight of the
Dollies dancing, and the aura
of a clapping, frenzied student
section.
This is the Sun Bowl, and
what follows Stanford's first TD
would touch the heart of even
the most callous LSJUMB ha
ter.
Drum major )im Jett, one of a
few incomparables who made
the trip to El Paso, holds a tiny
tape recorder up to a
megaphone. You are only a
few rows away, but have trou
ble detecting the strains of
"CarryOn, My Wayward Son."
Yell leaders are subbing for
the absent Dollies, as if you
could ever mistake three

empty-handed males in foot
ball pants for pomponed, un
iformed Dollies.
And while you join a few fans
who are on their feet, clapping,
most of those in the west side
stands are either Louisiana
State rooters, or too old to do
more than applaud politely
after a touchdown.
In fact, even before kickoff
the Sun Bowl was proceeding
far differently from a typical
Stanford game. Scalpers out
side the stadium were offering
$10 tickets at face value.
You already have a ticket,
and are used to seeing $4.25
Big Came tickets being hawked
for $30, but breezily tell a
scalper you have seen tickets
going for $9.
The scalper instantly
matches your offer. As you
walk away, he shouts: "Wait!
I'll sell you two tickets for $8
each."

As the game gets underway,
Card rooters shriek "Co, Dar
rin, go" when running back
Darrin Nelson squirts for seven
yards on a pass reception. But
more often, the fans around
you follow the CBS cameras,
hoping that they will make na
tional TV when the cameraman
pans the stands.
One woman leaps on top of
her husband's shoulders when
the camera turns toward her,
waving frantically at anyone
who will notice.
But a brief glance at Jett's
costume tells you there is no
way he will be on television.
The drum major is decked
out in a furry, pointed hat, long
underwear, a heavily padded
jockstrap, a foot-long pink tail,
and goggles made from two
rings of a six-pak holder.
Fven more out of place is one
Stanford student who lights up
a joint as the third quarter be
gins. "What's that funny
cigarette," a Texan behind you
drawls. "It sure don't smell like
tobacco."
As Stanford scores two
second-half touchdowns to
produce a 24-14 victory, the
makeshift "Band," begins to
get on track.
The few bandsmen present
manage to borrow instruments
from the stodgy high school
band playing at the game. And
right after the final Card TD,
you once more experience the
sound of the Incomparables
playing "Alright Now."
With only five or six players,
the music is pretty faint, and

some of the notes aren't com
ing out right at all, but you
don't really care.
It doesn't much matter
either that the yell-leaders and
a few women who have joined
them aren't quite keeping
time.
The crowd is too busy rejoic
ing the impending Stanford
victory. Some shout out the
number of seconds left.
Others raise one finger, declar
ing "We're No. 1!"
Less optimistic fans wonder
"Do you think this is going to
put us in the top 10?" And
nearly all find something to
snicker about in LSU's assort
ment of banners, all designed
before the game, and all now
so inappropriate.

Less optimistic fans wonder
"Do you think this is going to

El Paso, Texas — For the 12th
time this season, Guy Benja
min has connected with James
Lofton on a touchdown pass.
But for the first time since
September, you aren't im
mediately flooded with the
sound of the Band playing "Al
right Now," the sight of the
Dollies dancing, and the aura
of a clapping, frenzied student
section.
This is the Sun Bowl, and
what follows Stanford's first TD
would touch the heart of even
the most callous LSJUMB ha
ter.
Drum major )im Jett, one of a
few incomparables who made
the trip to El Paso, holds a tiny
tape recorder up to a
megaphone. You are only a
few rows away, but have trou
ble detecting the strains of
"CarryOn, My Wayward Son."
Yell leaders are subbing for
the absent Dollies, as if you
could ever mistake three

empty-handed males in foot
ball pants for pomponed, un
iformed Dollies.
And while you join a few fans
who are on their feet, clapping,
most of those in the west side
stands are either Louisiana
State rooters, or too old to do
more than applaud politely
after a touchdown.
In fact, even before kickoff
the Sun Bowl was proceeding
far differently from a typical
Stanford game. Scalpers out
side the stadium were offering
$10 tickets at face value.
You already have a ticket,
and are used to seeing $4.25
Big Came tickets being hawked
for $30, but breezily tell a
scalper you have seen tickets
going for $9.
The scalper instantly
matches your offer. As you
walk away, he shouts: "Wait!
I'll sell you two tickets for $8
each."

As the game gets underway,
Card rooters shriek "Co, Dar
rin, go" when running back
Darrin Nelson squirts for seven
yards on a pass reception. But
more often, the fans around
you follow the CBS cameras,
hoping that they will make na
tional TV when the cameraman
pans the stands.
One woman leaps on top of
her husband's shoulders when
the camera turns toward her,
waving frantically at anyone
who will notice.
But a brief glance at Jett's
costume tells you there is no
way he will be on television.
The drum major is decked
out in a furry, pointed hat, long
underwear, a heavily padded
jockstrap, a foot-long pink tail,
and goggles made from two
rings of a six-pak holder.
Fven more out of place is one
Stanford student who lights up
a joint as the third quarter be
gins. "What's that funny
cigarette," a Texan behind you
drawls. "It sure don't smell like
tobacco."
As Stanford scores two
second-half touchdowns to
produce a 24-14 victory, the
makeshift "Band," begins to
get on track.
The few bandsmen present
manage to borrow instruments
from the stodgy high school
band playing at the game. And
right after the final Card TD,
you once more experience the
sound of the Incomparables
playing "Alright Now."
With only five or six players,
the music is pretty faint, and

some of the notes aren't com
ing out right at all, but you
don't really care.
It doesn't much matter
either that the yell-leaders and
a few women who have joined
them aren't quite keeping
time.
The crowd is too busy rejoic
ing the impending Stanford
victory. Some shout out the
number of seconds left.
Others raise one finger, declar
ing "We're No. 1!"
Less optimistic fans wonder
