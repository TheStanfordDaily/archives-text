A law reducing university authority
in admitting medical students has
been repealed and Stanford may
now be eligible to receive a $410,000
grant which was denied after the
University refused to comply with
the law.
According to Larry Horton, a Uni
versity government relations official,
the 1976 Health Manpower Act re
quired medical schools to waive their
own admission standards and au
tomatically accept American stu
dents formerly enrolled in foreign
schools.
Those students were assigned to
American schools by the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare.
Federal grants were refused to
medical schools which denied the
students acceptance. Therefore,
when the University refused to ac
cept the assigned students, the
$410,000 grant was denied.
The bill repealing the Health Man
power Act was passed by the House
of Representatives Dec. 7. The repe
aling act was unanimously approved
and President )immy Carter con
sequently signed it into law.
Under the new law, medical
c hools are asked to assure that they
will seek to increase their third-year
enrollment by five per cent, but are
not required to obtain that increase
from any particular source.
The schools may apply their own
admission standards in achieving
that increased enrollment, said Hor
ton.
Also, students are eligible for fed
erally insured loans regardless of
their school's eligibility for per stu
dent support, a provision nonexis
tent in the old law.
In a statement praising Congress
tor its action, President Richard
Lyman and the presidents of Yale,
Harvard, lohns Hopkins and Duke
Universities, said restoration of
academic freedom in university ad
missions was a "reaffirmation of the
basic values that have made Ameri
can universities strong and indepen
dent."
The presidents added that they
were "pleased that the Congress has
been so sensitive to the principle of
academic freedom and has acted so
decisively in reaffirming our au
tonomy in the university admissions
process."
Other schools which lost funds
because they refused to comply with
the now-repealed law and which are
expected to reapply for the funds in
clude the five University of California
medical schools, Yale, Duke, lohns
Hopkins, Case Western Reserve,
Baylor, Northwestern, the University
of Chicago and University of Illinois
Medical Center.
Harvard, St. Louis University and
Indiana University had previously
objected to the law but reportedly
decided to comply in order to re
ceive the funds.
