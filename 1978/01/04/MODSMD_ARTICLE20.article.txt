# Down 13th ranked Providence in semifinals
## Cagers take 2nd in Rainbow Classic 
### David Georgette 
No. 2 isn't bad when No. 1 is
North Carolina, last season's
NCAA basketball runner-up to
Marquette. And before being
blitzed 92-61 by North Carolina
in the championship game of
the Rainbow Tournament in
Hawaii last Friday evening,
coach Dick Dißiaso's Stanford
cagers had put together a solid
holiday performance, running
off a string of five wins that
gave them an 8-2 record, Stan
ford's best start since 1963-64.
The Cards reached the tour
nament finals against the Tar
Heels with a win over host
Hawaii (72-68) and a 76-61 upset
of Providence in the semifi
nals. But Stanford's five-game
winning streak ended as the
Tar Heels ran off to a 17-0 lead
and at one point led 27-2 on the
way to their second Rainbow
championship in two tries.
Stanford did make it close
for awhile, though, closing to
36-30 just before half. "We
played defense during that
period," Dißiaso said. "We fi
nally got untracked and
played, but the comeback took
a lot out of us."
Tom Zaliagiris paced the Tar
Heels with 17 points. Phil Ford,
the tournament's Most Out
standing Player, had 13 points
and All-Tournament selection
Mike O'Koren had 14 points.
In the victory over then 13th
ranked Providence, the Cards
were led by All-Tournament
forward Kimberly Belton. The
sophomore scored 20 points
and freshman guard Mark

Pitchford added 17 as Stanford
jumped out to a 10-0 lead and
handed Providence its first de
feat of the season.
"It was our best game of the
year," said Dißiaso, "because
we executed offensively and
defensively the entire game."
In Stanford's win over
Hawaii, Card center Jeff
McHugh had 14 points and
Pitchford contributed 12. The
Cards established a 42-30
halftime advantage which was
extended to 58-43 in the sec
ond half. But the Cards needed
good free throwing down the
stretch to stave off a Rainbow
rally led by Cliff Sanchez, who
finished with 15 points.
But in picking up two wins in
the Islands, the Cards also sus
tained two injuries. Jay Carter,
the first of two starters to be
hurt, suffered a jammed right
thumb against Hawaii and mis
sed the Providence game.
Then against the Friars, guard
Paul Giovacchini pulled a leg
muscle and missed the champ
ionship game. Giovacchini is
doubtful for this weekend's
engagements in Oregon
against the Beavers and the
Ducks.
The sickbay report did have
an optimistic outlook for
senior forward George
Schader though. "George
showed improvement in
Hawaii," said Dißiaso. "We'll
know a lot more this week.
Now we'll be able to watch all
week to see how much im
proved he is."

Jemison in Stanford's 99-78 loss to the Dons. The Cards fared well
over the holidays, taking 2nd place in the Rainbow Classic in Hawaii
and winning three out of four games at home. Stanford's record now
stands at 8-3 with the Pac-8 season beginning this weekend.

five games before losing to North Carolina in the championship game of the Rainbow Classic.
