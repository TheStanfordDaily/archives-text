USF 99, Stanford 78 •
Dec. 8 at Stanford — "I think (James)
Hardy has played a lot of great basket
ball games, and this is just one of
them," said University of San Francisco
coach Bob Gaillard after his moody star
Hardy had scored 22 points and
gathered eight rebounds as the Dons
blasted Stanford, 99-78.
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso decided
that the Cards would play with the Dons
this season, instead of trying to control
the tempo of the game as they had in
earlier meetings. But the Dons raced to
a 47-32 halltime margin, ending the.
Cards' hopes for an upset of the
nationally-ranked Dons.
Hardy's fine performance in the pivot
for injured center Bill Cartwright was
matched by that of forwards Winford
Boynes (24 points and six rebounds)
and Doug lemison (eight points and 12
rebounds). Forward Kimberly Belton
topped Stanford with 21 points.

points, forward Jay Carter had nine re
bounds and guard Paul Ciovacchini had

Ryan added 14 as the Cards downed the
eventual champion of the Far West

ningham had 22 to lead the Rams, who
closed to 58-52 with nine minutes left
before Wolfe Perry hit a pair of jumpers
to spark an 8-0 Stanford run to secure
the victory.

Stanford 76, Rhode Island 74
Dec. 22 at Stanford — The Cards im
proved their record to 6-2 in their last
home game of 1977 with a 76-74 win
over another Rams squad, this one
from Rhode Island. The Cards led 41-29
at half, but Rhode Island knotted the
score at 70 and 72 before a basket by
Daryle Morgan gave the Cards the lead
for good.
Jim Williamson led all scorers with 22
for Rhode Island. Perry and Carter each
had 19 for Stanford.
"In the Colorado St.and Rhode Is
land games, in both halves for specific
periods of time we looked very good
offensively and defensively," said Di-
Biaso. "It seemed we were maturing as
a team."
Dißiaso called the results from the
Christmas slate "very good from the
won-loss standpoint and the confi
dence we gained in ourselves."
