Carter talks with Saudi king
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — President jimmy
Carter came to this oil-rich desert kingdom
yesterday hopeful that Saudi Arabia's con
servative leaders may be edging toward a
compromise on the thorny issue of Palesti
nian statehood, a major block to Mideast
peace.
Carter met for more than an hour with
King Khaled at a guest palace soon after he
arrived from New Delhi on the fourth stop of
his marathon international tour.
White House press secretary Jody Powell
said the talks dealt primarily with the Middle
East.
A senior U.S. official aboard Air Force One
en route here from New Delhi said, "It
would appearthey (the Saudis) may be in the
process of moving toward our approach on
the Palestinian issue."
On the eve of his international tour, Car
ter told network correspondents he favors
creation of a Palestinian homeland on the
Israeli-occupied West Bank of the )ordan
River and the Gaza Strip linked to one of the
neighboring nations, rather than a new in
dependent "radical" state.
Israel has offered self-rule — with a con
tinued Israeli military presence — for the 1.1
million Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, with
whom Carter meets today in the Upper Nile
cityof Aswan, said he was "disappointed" by
Carter's rejection of his call for an indepen
dent Palestinian state and by Carter's de
scription of the Israeli negotiating position
as "a step forward."
In an interview with The Associated Press
at Aswan yesterday, Egyptian Foreign Minis
ter Mohammed Kamel appealed to the Un
ited States to supply fresh momentum to the
stalemated Egyptian-Israeli dialogue. Rut
Kamel declined to say what he specifically
would like Carter to do.
Chileans clash before vote
Santiago, Chile — Crowds of youths
clashed yesterday as tempers flared bet
ween supporters and opponents of Presi
dent Augusto Pinochet on the eve of a na
tional plebescite on his conduct of the gov
ernment.
Groups shouting "si" or "no" to a vote of
support for Pinochet marched through the
streets until they came up against each other
in the Plaza de Armas in front of the Roman
Catholic cathedral.
Members of the carabineros, Chile's na
tional police, moved in beside the "si"
group and quickly broke up the encounter.
Witnesses said they had seen no detentions,
but one demonstrator was reported
wounded in the head by a blow from a
policeman.
With clashes, demonstrations and state
ments mounting, the controversial plebis
cite has reopened Chile to the political activ
ity that the military outlawed when it over
threw the late Salvador Allende on Sept. 11,
1973.
In another development, the military gov
ernment said the air force and navy will join
the army and national police in running the
plebiscite, despite a reported split within
Chile's ruling junta.
Exxon deaths investigated
Benicia — State investigators yesterday
said witnesses reported a safety device de
signed to block poisonous gas from entering
an Exxon oil refinery unit had been removed
just hours before three men were found
choked by deadly fumes.
Michael Schneider, deputy chief of
California's Occupational Safety and Flealth
Administration, said the information was re
vealed yesterday by unidentified Exxon
employees who worked in units near the
scene of Monday's accident. That accident
claimed three lives and sent several persons
to area hospitals.
Exxon spokesman D.I. Bolding said the

company's own investigation was continu
ing and Exxon wasn't prepared either to con
firm or deny the information.
Company officials said earlier that carbon
monoxide, the invisible, odorless gas which
often gives no hint of its deadly presence,
was mixed in the air inside the 100-foot-tall
silo-shaped silo where the fatal mishap oc
curred.
FBI studies mental hospitals
Los Angeles — The FBI has launched an
investigation into complaints of inadequate
conditions and treatment at two California
mental hospitals, the U.S. Department of
Justice confirmed yesterday.
While the probe is concentrating on Met
ropolitan and Fairview state hospitals, "the
investigations are really looking at the state
hospital system as a whole to determine
whether it is providing patients minimally
adequate care," said Arthur Peabody, an at
torney in the Office ot Special Litigation in
the Civil Rights division.
Peabody, in a telephone interview from
Washington, D.C., characterized the inves
tigation as "preliminary" and said such
studies are carried out "routinely." But he
said that the justice Department, which re
ceives many complaints of alleged civil
rights violations, "investigates those that
appear on their face to be of some mag
nitude."
The allegations under scrutiny are not of a
criminal nature, said Peabody. Rather, the
question is whether patients held involun
tarily in mental hospitals are being denied
their constitutional rights to receive
adequate treatment, as defined by such
cases as the landmark Wyatt v. Stickney case
in Alabama.
State Department ot Health officials con
firmed that the investigation was under way
but said it is of little significance.
Breakfast food prices rise
Increases in the prices of breakfast foods
— eggs, frozen orange juice and sugar —
contributed to higher grocery bills at the
state of 1978, according to The Associated
Press marketbasket survey.
But the monthly analysis also indicated
that coffee drinkers got a break as the retail
price of the beverage held or declined.
The survey showed that prices of 14 com
monly purchased food and non-food items
rose an average of 2.3 percent in December.
That brought the year's increase to 11.7 per
cent. The average overall increase a year ear
lier was 3.5 per cent.
The figures are based on an AP survey that
began March 1,1973. The news service drew

up a random list of 15 commonly purchased
grocery items and checked the price at one
supermarket in each of 13 cities.
Lockheed strikers return
Los Angeles — The first strike against Loc
kheed Aircraft Corp. in 15 years ended yes
terday with 14,000 machinists in five states
trickling back to work following the New
Year's holiday.
The long and bitter strike involving dis
putes among union leaders as well as with
the company ended with the midnight shift.
The bulk of workers also appeared for their 7
a.m. shifts.
About 9000 Southern California strikers
were the last to approve the three-year con
tract. They voted approval 3471 to 1412 on
Monday, and the contract took effect yes
terday.
Five thousand International Aerospace
Machinists in Georgia, Mississippi, South
Carolina and West Virginia returned to work
yesterday also, although they had voted
Dec. 29 to accept a similar pact.
The first to settle were 5000 strikers at Loc
kheed's Missiles and Space Division in Sun

nyvale. They disagreed with the interna
tional union's negotiating policy when talks
stalled late in November, made their own
settlement and returned to work.
Banking gripes encouraged
Washington — Banking regulators have
started encouraging customers to complain
when they think lenders have misled or dis
criminated against them.
The Federal Reserve and the comptroller
of the currency are including a complaint
form and a list of consumer rights in
brochures they will send to the banks they
regulate. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. has already sent similar pamphlets to
its state-chartered banks.
The banks are not required to post these
pamphlets but most have cooperated in
posting other consumer lending brochures,
banking regulators said.
Today's weather
Rain today, with occasional rain tonight
and tomorrow. Lows in the upper 40s to low
50s. Highs mid and upper 50s. Chance of rain
90 per cent today and 80 per cent tonight.
