when he begins a two-year leave from the

liaison scientists who visit laboratories, uni
versities and individual scientists to learn
about developments and ideas in the United
Kingdom and Western Europe as well as
some Eastern bloc and non-European coun
tries.

Correction
An article in the Dead Week issue of the
Daily concerning a microfiche book catalog
ing system being instituted at Meyer Library
incorrectly stated that 18,000 volumes in
Meyer's collection were "uncataloged."
In fact, before implementation of the new
system, the books were cataloged by author

only in a card catalog at Meyer and in Stan
ford Libraries' on-line BALLOTS computer
system.
The volumes in question were those
added to the library's collection after print
ing of the catalog books in June 1974. The
printed catalogs have not been replaced by
the microfiche.
In fall 1978, a new cumulative catalog list
ing all Meyer Library holdings will be issued
in a format yet to be determined, according
to Meyer Librarian Elizabeth Salzer.
