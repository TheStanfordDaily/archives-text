# Experts smile over recent rain

Water, water everywhere, but not quite enough to
drink . . . yet.
Despite heavy rainfalls this week, the National
Weather Service at the San Francisco International
Airport reports that the two-year drought which has
left California reservoirs drastically below normal
water levels is not over. But forecasters are optimistic
for increased precipitation this year.
"We haven't uncrossed our fingers yet," said Bill
Sapp, Weather Service Specialist, "but it looks like
things are shaping up for a normal rainfall this
winter."
Since July 1,1977, the airport has received about 6.3
inches of rain compared to only about two inches one
year before. Normal rainfall for the six-month period
is 8.25 inches, Sapp said.
Sapp said forecaster optimism is due to significant
changes in the upper air pressure systems over
California.
For the past two years, Sapp said, an intense high
pressure system has been stationary over northern
California. The system blocked Pacific storms which
commonly hit the coast every few days during the
winter, diverting them to the north, mostly into

Canada.
But Sapp said the high seems to have dissipated,
and storms from the Gulf of Alaska have been moving
in normally.
Sapp said there is generally very little rain during
the summer months, but a wet winter is needed to
break the dry spell.
The Bay Area normally receives about 20Vi inches
of rain. To achieve the normal level this year, the Bay
Area must receive about one inch of rain per week
through |une.
Some areas, like Marin County, north of San Fran
cisco are ahead of the normal rainfall level, Sapp said.
He said recent rains have "helped out considera
bly," but area reservoirs, which should be about 75
percent of capacity at this time of year, are only about
33 per cent full.
Sapp said, however, the gradual improvement pre
sently being experienced, is better than overwhelm
ing rainfall.
"It's better to take it slow," Sapp said. "Massive
rainfall causes flooding problems."
Sapp said rain, heavy at times, is forecast for the Bay
Area through today. "The rain definitely helps," Sapp
said, "but we've got a long, long way to go."


Despite increased precipitation in the Bay Area, forecas
ters say there is a long way to go before the water
situation returns to normal. But Lake Lagunita could be
