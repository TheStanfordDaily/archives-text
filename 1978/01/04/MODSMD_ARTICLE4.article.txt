# Stanford to appeal $8.4 million tax bill
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
The University released an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) audit report
yesterday which claims the Univer
sity owes $0.4 million in federal taxes
on "unrelated" business income
from 1972 to 1975.
The University will appeal the IRS
ruling by contending that most of the
income in question is not taxable
currently under law.
There are four areas from which
the University derives income that
have come into question: land de
velopment activity, security loans,
radio and TV coverage of sports
events and the Stanford golf course.
The IRS report says income from
land owned by the University has
only an "indirect or incidental" rela
tionship to the purposes of the Uni
versity and thus should be taxed.
Claim disputed
Michael Fludnall, staff counsel for
business and finance disputes this
claim. He contends that by law, in
come from the leasing of land by
nonprofit organizations is exempt
regardless of the relevance of that
practice to their purposes.
Fludnall said the same argument
applies to interest derived from the
lending of securities as well. This is a
relatively new practice, whereby an
institution can loan its actual hold
ings in stocks and bonds to broker
age houses and earn interest on
those loans.
It is often necessary for brokerage
houses to borrow such holdings to
meet certain federal regulations.
Fludnall added that the U.S. Treas
ury Department has condoned these
types of loans from institutions be
cause they facilitate the meeting of
federal regulations by brokerage
firms.
Golf course income
The University has already suc
cessfully argued in court that income
from its golf course should be
exempt. A Santa Clara Superior
Court judge overturned the county
tax assessor's ruling that the land is
not exempt because it is used by per

sons who are not faculty, staff or stu
dents.
The county is appealing the deci
sion, but Hudnall does not expect it
to change. He said that if the
Superior Court ruling is upheld the
IRS will probably respect the court's
decision.
The question of tax exemptions for
radio and TV income from sports
events is currently being decided at
the request of some other schools,
according to Hudnall.
He said further action on this ques
tion will probably await the outcome
of that ruling.
Hudnall said the many other non
profit institutions engage in the prac
tices under challenge.
'Catch 22'
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, said the Uni
versity will be caught in a "Catch 22"
if the IRS will not allow it to lease its
lands. The land was given to the Uni
versity on the condition that it not be
sold.
So, if the IRS prevails the Univer
sity will neither be able to lease nor
sell the land, resulting in a substan
tial loss of income. The Stanford
Shopping Center, Industrial Park,
and other developed areas provide
about $2.5 million in income to the
University annually.
Hudnall called such a decision by
the IRS "highly unlikely"and he feels
the University will probably prevail in
the other areas as well.
Rodney Adams, director of fi
nance, said it is likely the IRS will
decide to allow security loans subject
to certain regulations agreed on by
the IRS and the Treasury Depart
ment.
The IRS report says the University
currently owes approximately $6.9
million in taxes on land development
activity, $1 million on security loan
income, $450,000 on radio and TV re
venue from sports events, and
$125,000 on income from the golf
course.
The University has until jan. 19 to
complete its appeal or ask for an ex
tention to do so.

according to Hudnall.
He said further action on this ques
tion will probably await the outcome
of that ruling.
Hudnall said the many other non
profit institutions engage in the prac
tices under challenge.
'Catch 22'
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, said the Uni
versity will be caught in a "Catch 22"
if the IRS will not allow it to lease its
lands. The land was given to the Uni
versity on the condition that it not be
sold.
So, if the IRS prevails the Univer
sity will neither be able to lease nor
sell the land, resulting in a substan
tial loss of income. The Stanford
Shopping Center, Industrial Park,
and other developed areas provide
about $2.5 million in income to the
University annually.
Hudnall called such a decision by
the IRS "highly unlikely"and he feels
the University will probably prevail in
the other areas as well.
Rodney Adams, director of fi
nance, said it is likely the IRS will
decide to allow security loans subject
to certain regulations agreed on by
the IRS and the Treasury Depart
ment.
The IRS report says the University
currently owes approximately $6.9
million in taxes on land development
activity, $1 million on security loan
income, $450,000 on radio and TV re
venue from sports events, and
$125,000 on income from the golf
course.
The University has until jan. 19 to
complete its appeal or ask for an ex
tention to do so.
The University released an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) audit report
yesterday which claims the Univer
sity owes $0.4 million in federal taxes
on "unrelated" business income
from 1972 to 1975.
The University will appeal the IRS
ruling by contending that most of the
income in question is not taxable
currently under law.
There are four areas from which
the University derives income that
have come into question: land de
velopment activity, security loans,
radio and TV coverage of sports
events and the Stanford golf course.
The IRS report says income from
land owned by the University has
only an "indirect or incidental" rela
tionship to the purposes of the Uni
versity and thus should be taxed.
Claim disputed
Michael Fludnall, staff counsel for
business and finance disputes this
claim. He contends that by law, in
come from the leasing of land by
nonprofit organizations is exempt
regardless of the relevance of that
practice to their purposes.
Fludnall said the same argument
applies to interest derived from the
lending of securities as well. This is a
relatively new practice, whereby an
institution can loan its actual hold
ings in stocks and bonds to broker
age houses and earn interest on
those loans.
It is often necessary for brokerage
houses to borrow such holdings to
meet certain federal regulations.
Fludnall added that the U.S. Treas
ury Department has condoned these
types of loans from institutions be
cause they facilitate the meeting of
federal regulations by brokerage
firms.
Golf course income
The University has already suc
cessfully argued in court that income
from its golf course should be
exempt. A Santa Clara Superior
Court judge overturned the county
tax assessor's ruling that the land is
not exempt because it is used by per

sons who are not faculty, staff or stu
dents.
The county is appealing the deci
sion, but Hudnall does not expect it
to change. He said that if the
Superior Court ruling is upheld the
IRS will probably respect the court's
decision.
The question of tax exemptions for
radio and TV income from sports
events is currently being decided at
the request of some other schools,
according to Hudnall.
