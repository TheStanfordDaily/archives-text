Tuition, room and board costs will total
$7299 next year. The Board of Trustees ap
proved the recommended rate hikes at its
meeting held during finals week last quarter.
The vote was taken after a plea by ASSU
Copresident Greg Larson for the trustees to
consider student concern over rising costs in
taking their action.
The board approved a 9.3 per cent tuition
hike, raising the rate charged most students to
$5130 per three-quarter year. This year the rate
is $4695.
For students in most University residences,
the cost will increase about 10.1 per cent to
$2169, up from this year's $1970 assessment.
Tuition for the Medical School doctoral
program will go to $5388 from $4932, an in
crease of 9.24 per cent. Law school tuition will
rise to $5280 from $4864, an 8.55 per cent in

crease.
Rent for apartments in Escondido Village will
rise 9.1 per cent, and will vary depending upon
the number ot bedrooms in the apartment.
The approved hikes are estimated to be
about 3.3 per cent larger than the rate of infla
tion.
"Composite costs rise faster than inflation,"
said Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budgetand planning.
Salaries, a major component of the budget,
have been rising faster than inflation, and,
coupled with costs of improvements, this
necessitated an increase above the rate of in
flation.
Bacchetti said the increase would not place
much more pressure on personal income than
the present tuition level, because the rate is
close to the rise in personal income.
"Higher education is not asking for any

larger fraction of people's income," Bacchetti
said.
"We think it better to provide the quality it
costs money to provide . . . rather than hold
down costs and lose quality," Bacchetti said.
Larson, in his statement to the trustees (to be
printed in full as an advertisement in the Daily
Friday), said the quality of the institution does
not lessen the financial burden on student
families.
He said he is concerned about the effect of
tuition hikes on the composition of the stu
dent body and a lack of parity between in
creases in costs and wage hikes for students
jobs.
Larson charged that the personal expense
allowance has risen only an average of 4.1 per
cent per year since 1969-70 and therefore does
not "adequately represent" the costs of an
education here. The allowance for books and

personal items is $700 this year and is esti
mated to be $701 next year.
But Financial Aids Director Robert Huff said
he felt the $700 figure was "reasonable." In
addition, he said the allowance is set by vari
ous state and federal financial aid agencies,
not by the University.
University Housing Director Edward Scoles
said two per cent of the room and board in
crease will go to make up a $179,000 deficit in
the housing budget this year.
The deficit was caused by unanticipated in
creases in University expenses for accounting,
auditing, police, personnel and other ser
vices; increased personnel expenditures as a
result of restoring staff positions previously
terminated; and underestimation of residen
tial education expenses.
Larson charged that it is unfair to place the
entire burden of a deficit on one year's budget.
