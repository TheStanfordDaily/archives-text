# A 						tough question
## What are society's goals? 
###

"What are the goals of society?"
Any sane individual would blanch
with dread as he/she conjures up im
ages of a society trying to unite itself
long enough to answer this question.
After all, what are goals? What is
society? Is it just the United States, or
are we counting the rest of the
world? If the latter, how are we to
reconcile the ideological differences
of a planet crammed with diverse
social-political systems? Does the
question have any meaning for us at
this point in human development?
This column is partly a reply to
Moshe Aelion's column (Daily, Dec.
2); it is also a critique of the attitudes
within society that lead us to answer
this question with foregone conclu
sions.
Spectrum
Those members of society who
bother to wonder about goals can
generally be placed on a spectrum.
One end is dominated by the attitude
that "progress" is good, that we are
rational creatures who have been as
cending an intellectual and cultural
ladder to higher levels of civilization.
This is a uniquely Western view of
life; we must forever aspire to higher
things, seek to maximize happiness
for as many as possible, and espouse
the dignity of the individual and soc
iety.
A superficial glance suggests that
the other extreme is pessimistic and
self-defeating. Various segments of
this worldview are touted by reac
tionaries, back-to-nature freaks,
mystics and plain old cranks (or so
we believe). They suggest that the
human race is basically evil, savage,
irrational. Science is dehumanizing.
Progress is destructive, unhealthy,
wasteful. The human race is not as
cending a ladder, but rather, we are
descending into the gloomy abyss of
a dark age.
Between these two extremes lies a
spectrum within which most of us are
probably to be found, although it's a
good bet that many of us are closer to
the rationalist viewpoint. Of course
this scheme is a simplification. But
then, everything is. Even in physics,

the "exact science," approximations
and simplifying assumptions are the
rule rather than the exception.
Extreme viewpoint
Is there any justification for our be
lief of man as a rational being, prog
ress as a blessing and science as both
a panacea and a civilizing force? This
extreme viewpoint is a tenet of
Western thought so basic to our way
of thinking that we have come to be
lieve that there is no other way of
thinking. "The goal is progress" im
plies "the tool is science" and all this
is obvious because it is common
sense.
It does make sense. Doesn't it? In
deed, there are few so atavistic in
their thinking as to believe that
something is wrong with raising the
standard of living, eradicating illiter
acy and hunger and so forth. And
although more and more people are
disenchanted with science, alienated
by exponential growth, and forced
into empty-headed submission by
future shock and technocracy, it is
obvious to those of us who are
reasonable, who understand even a
little of what science is about, and
who see the correlation between sci
ence, technology and societal im
provement, that science is good, that
progress is necessary.

The environment is not so intricate
that we won't ever understand and
come to control it absolutely. The
human mind is not so puzzling that
we will never understand why
people are disenchanted, apathetic
and restless. Behavioral modification
and genetic manipulation
techniques will readjust us all to soc
iety. The world is not so poor, and
the human mind not so lacking in
cleverness that we will never develop
unlimited energy resources and sub
stitutes for other non-renewables.
We are not so immersed in the
lethargy that dampens the human
spirit that we will never rise above
the fog, gain absolute mastery of self
and surround, and continue our
reach heavenward seeking. . .what?
More energy? More worlds to
conquer? More room for shopping
plazas and factories? More wealth?
More comfort? More people prog
rammed to fit society, rather than
vice versa, in an obscene imitation of
the industrial assembly line? More
emptiness, more chasing after gilded
values and sterile goals?
Classical philosophers called it
hubris. "Suicide" is an equally apt
descriptor.

mystics and plain old cranks (or so
we believe). They suggest that the
human race is basically evil, savage,

Progress is destructive, unhealthy,
wasteful. The human race is not as

Between these two extremes lies a

Extreme viewpoint
Is there any justification for our be

ress as a blessing and science as both
a panacea and a civilizing force? This
extreme viewpoint is a tenet of
Western thought so basic to our way
of thinking that we have come to be
lieve that there is no other way of
thinking. "The goal is progress" im
plies "the tool is science" and all this
is obvious because it is common
sense.
It does make sense. Doesn't it? In
deed, there are few so atavistic in
their thinking as to believe that
something is wrong with raising the
standard of living, eradicating illiter
acy and hunger and so forth. And
although more and more people are
disenchanted with science, alienated
by exponential growth, and forced
into empty-headed submission by
future shock and technocracy, it is
obvious to those of us who are
reasonable, who understand even a
little of what science is about, and
who see the correlation between sci
ence, technology and societal im
provement, that science is good, that
progress is necessary.

The environment is not so intricate
that we won't ever understand and
come to control it absolutely. The
human mind is not so puzzling that
we will never understand why
people are disenchanted, apathetic
and restless. Behavioral modification
and genetic manipulation
techniques will readjust us all to soc
iety. The world is not so poor, and
the human mind not so lacking in
cleverness that we will never develop
unlimited energy resources and sub
stitutes for other non-renewables.
We are not so immersed in the
lethargy that dampens the human
spirit that we will never rise above
the fog, gain absolute mastery of self
and surround, and continue our
reach heavenward seeking. . .what?
More energy? More worlds to
conquer? More room for shopping
plazas and factories? More wealth?
More comfort? More people prog
rammed to fit society, rather than
vice versa, in an obscene imitation of
the industrial assembly line? More
emptiness, more chasing after gilded
values and sterile goals?
Classical philosophers called it
hubris. "Suicide" is an equally apt

"What are the goals of society?"
Any sane individual would blanch
with dread as he/she conjures up im
ages of a society trying to unite itself
long enough to answer this question.
After all, what are goals? What is
society? Is it just the United States, or
are we counting the rest of the
world? If the latter, how are we to
reconcile the ideological differences
of a planet crammed with diverse
social-political systems? Does the
question have any meaning for us at
this point in human development?
This column is partly a reply to
Moshe Aelion's column (Daily, Dec.
2); it is also a critique of the attitudes
within society that lead us to answer
this question with foregone conclu
sions.
Spectrum
Those members of society who
bother to wonder about goals can
generally be placed on a spectrum.
One end is dominated by the attitude
that "progress" is good, that we are
rational creatures who have been as
cending an intellectual and cultural
ladder to higher levels of civilization.
This is a uniquely Western view of
life; we must forever aspire to higher
things, seek to maximize happiness
for as many as possible, and espouse
the dignity of the individual and soc
iety.
A superficial glance suggests that
the other extreme is pessimistic and
self-defeating. Various segments of
this worldview are touted by reac
tionaries, back-to-nature freaks,
mystics and plain old cranks (or so
we believe). They suggest that the
human race is basically evil, savage,
irrational. Science is dehumanizing.
