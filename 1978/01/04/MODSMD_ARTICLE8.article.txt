Christmas articles
This letter is in regard to a col
umn by Doug Dahle and Barry Abram
son (Daily, Nov. 28) on the New Ways
Holidays and how to celebrate
Christmas as if people, not things,
mattered. On page four of the same
issue was an article by Kathy Andrews
about the New Ways Holidays Events
and Exhibits program held at Tresid
der on that day and the following
day.
Ironically, on page five was an arti-

cle entitled, "The most desired gifts
this season." This article described
such extravagances as perfume
priced at $175 an ounce, a $285
cashmere robe, $600 handbags, and
his and her windmills priced at
$16,000 a piece.
I would have liked to have seen the
Daily show a little more support for
the effort put forth by the Energy
Conservation Center and others
concerned with creating a new
awareness of energy and Christmas

by waiting to print that article in
some other issue.
I just hope that my parents are not
too disappointed by the plant I got
them in lieu of hisand herwindmills!

Something nice
Once in a while it is nice to say
something nice about some people. I
would like to utter only the best
words of praise and thanks to the
Stanford Police Dept. for their total
cooperation and efficient coordina
tion of the South Peninsula commun
ity's Chanukah motorcade on De
cember 4. Being in charge of the
planning of the motorcade, I can tes
tify both to the meritorious perfor
mance of the Stanford Police Dept.
and to the total appreciation of them
by the South Peninsula Jewish com
munity.

Fountain finances
One of the bon-bons for the soul
which I thoroughly enjoyed while at
Stanford was the splashing water in
the White Memorial Plaza fountain.
Thus, when I recently saw it was not
flowing I sent a letter to the Univer
sity, with a restricted $100 contribu
tion for payment toward the power
and water necessary to run the foun
tain.
I noted that the water and power
consumed by that recycling founta'..
could not begin to compare with the
water and power used to maintain
the infinitely more consumptive
power and water used at the Stanford
golf course, which is still kept beauti
fully green. If we are to choose a
token symbol for our commitment to
water or power conservation, let it be
the golf course driving range or some
other thing which contributes less to
Stanford's beauty.
My contribution was returned
without explaining why the Univer
sity would not accept it forthat use. If
the Daily or someone else can per
suade the University to turn the
fountain back on, my $100 remains
available as a beginning contribution
to its expense.

Legs that vote
Glenn Jordan (Daily, Dec. 2) de
scribes the South African Krugerrand
as a coin dripping with blood, pro
duced by cruelly-exploited African
miners. Perhaps Jordan could exp
lain why the Marxist-Leninist Repub
lic of Mozambique should continue
to send large numbers of labor mig
rants to the South African mines
every year.
South African recruiting offices in
Mozambique are mobbed by applic
ants. More labor migrants come from
Lesotho, Botswana, and even further
afieid. South Africa itself supplies
only about 15 per cent of the labor
employed on the South African
mines. These mine workers come to
South Africa voluntarily.
Africans do not emigrate from
South Africa, as oppressed Jews once
emigrated from Central and Eastern
Europe. Africans, to use Lenin's
phrase, vote with their legs to come
into South Africa. More than a mill
ion Africans from abroad now live
within the borders of the Republic
They have come to South Africa be
cause they know that the liberal
leftist orthodoxy of the American
campus world is as truthful regarding
white Rhodesians and white South

Africans as the propaganda put out
by the late and unlamented Dr.
Goebbels concerning the Jews.

An open letter to
Dr. Halsted Holman
In her article (Daily, Nov. 28),
Andrea James cites Dr. Halsted Hol
man, Director of the Stanford Ar
thritis Center, to the effect that the
Center is trying to find an inexpen
sive way for arthritis sufferers to cope
with the disease.
I would like to point out that this
inexpensive way already exists. It has
been repeatedly demonstrated for
years that arthritis can be amelior
ated in 50 per cent of cases by large
doses of potassium, calcium and
magnesium (ina2:l ration), vitamins
A, 82, 86, 812, pantothenic acid, C, E,
and protein. These nutrients feed
cells involved in keeping bones,
joints, and muscles healthy. They are
recommended in cases of arthritis by
Dr. Roger Williams, the discoverer of
pantothenic acid and one of the
world's preeminent biochemists,
and by numerous other nutritional
authorities.
Unlike such common treatments
as cortisone, which provides rel'ef
for arthritis symptoms but which
also, when used alone, produces a
hormonal imbalance and a variety of
side effects, these essential foods are
utterly harmless. They are nonpa
tentable, hence inexpensive.
Hopefully Dr. Holman and col
leagues will not neglect a treatment
for arthritis which is at once devoid
of side effects, inexpensive, and
most promising on the basis of past
performance.

Mideast reality
In his column (Daily, Dec. 8) con
demning the visit of Egypt's Presi
dent Sadat to Israel, Yousuf Al-Bader
accused Sadat and Israel's Prime
Minister Begin of "refusing to accept
reality." I suggest that Al-Bader reas
sess the situation. Sadat and Begin
are fully cognizant of the impact

which peace would have on the
economic, physical, and mental
well-being of their countries' citi
zens.
It is the leaders of nations and or
ganizations, such as the Palestine
Liberation Organization, who vow to
destroy the State of Israel, who have
lost all touch with reality. Their con
demnation of Sadat and Begin at De
cember's summit meeting in Tripoli
has only served to prolong the seem
ingly endless haranguing which has
brought the Mideast four wars in the
last 30 years.
Israeli and Egyptian leaders know
that the first step toward peace must
be the disavowal of violence as a sol
ution to the conflict. Arafat, Hafez
Assad, and other Arab leaders must
follow or else proclaim yet another
war as their goal.

Art vandalism
The Daily (Dec. 2) has come out
against trashing of campus news
papers as an insult to freedom of ex
pression. Fair question to the editors
is what is your view of the trashing of
art?
A few days before the editorial on
trashing the Daily published a letter
in which the writer complained
about the campus security personnel
discontinuing his trashing of a
sculpture on campus. No comment
from the Daily. Last spring this paper
published letters coyly threatening
trashing of a proposed sculpture on
campus. No comment from the
Daily. In fact, a letter written to the
Daily last spring protesting against
published threats of vandalism was
not even printed.
Just where do you stand on the
vandalism of art on campus and the
use of your paper to encourage it? Is
not the artist entitled to respect for
his or her point of view expressed in
art? Why are you so silent when the
trashing is not of your form of ex
pression? Vandalism will not destroy
the printed word, but it can demean
and destroy an irreplaceable work of
art.
