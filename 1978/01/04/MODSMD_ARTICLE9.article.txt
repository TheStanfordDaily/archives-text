## Reminiscing on hipness

Dan Gillham

I was in the bathroom shaving this
morning when my girlfriend asked
me a question that started this line of
thought. It went like thisi, "Hey Dan,
you know what the name of this
space heater is? A Blow Master."
Now at 12 or 13 I may have laughed,
but would have wondered why it was
funny. Now, at 24, it got a chuckle ( or
what passed for a chuckle that early
in the morning). The point being,
some guy in the late '40s or early '50s
called this piece of industrial post
deco a Blow Master in all innocence.
Hipness is knowing something
someone else doesn't.
This led me to reminisce on the
history and quality of my hipness.
The pinnacle of my hipness in high
school was when my friend Freddie
and I put an opium pipe in the Think
er's hand at the Palace of the Legion
of Honor. This little bit of art guerrilla
theater made Herb Caen. Tres hip.
Prior to this were some shaky
times. A year or two ear lier I listened
to an argument over who had the
better version of "Mary, Mary"; the
Monkees or Paul Butterfield. This
question was a prime example of the
acid test of hipness. The correct ans
wer on that issue was critical to the
furtherance of your hipness quotient.
Rock connoisseur
By my senior year in high school it
was absolutely necessary to be a rock
connoisseur. The key question in
this category was, "Who is the fastest
guitar player"? The musicians names
flew fast and furious; Alvin Lee (who
is no longer hip in the least), Hen
drix, Clapton, etc. Then came the ul
timate putdown (and rise in my rock
stature): "Well, you know, speed
isn't everything; dynamics is impor
tant too, man ... (a pause in the rap
works real well here) I'm into Gar
cia."
Then came my freshman year in
college. New friends and different
standards of esoteric knowledge
were now in order. Garcia was still
acceptable, but a bit plebian. "I
mean, he's really one of the PEOPLE
but I think there is more IMPOR
TANT music going on . . . I'm into
Cage and Stockhausen."
Not only was your musical taste
important, but this was my first in
troduction to literary hipness as well.
Steinbeck was not hip. Hemingway
was edgy. Faulkner was passable as
he was an alcoholic and a bit seedy.
Brautigan and Burroughs were really
up there. The best was being able to
recite the first couple of lines of
Ginsberg's "Howl." That was pretty
hip. And let us not forget Charlie
Reich's Greening of America.
Humanistic psychology was big. Br
inging up Rollo May and self
actualization in a conversation was
impressive. "Oh yes, I'm self
actualized. I think I'm up to step 5."
As my liberal arts education,

which is no longer hip, progressed,
obscure knowledge was de rigueur.
Wittgenstein and Heidegger quotes
flourished on bathroom walls.
Graphic representations of the
time-space continuum decorated
almost every dorm wall on campus.
Then came the big turn around in my
senior year. It was hip not to be hip.
"Well, you know man, I'm just into
what I'm into. I don't care what you
think." A lot of Cab Calloway and
lango Reinhart albums were sold that
year.
After graduating, things really
changed. The people I had known in
college were discarding their work
shirts and jeans. Turquoise and
leather storks rose across the coun-

try. John Muir's VW repair manual
went to the back of a lot of closets.
Ah yes! Fond memories of standing
around various parking lots looking
at the back end of a volksie van, rub
bing my chin, saying, "Looks like you
blew another valve on number
three." And the inevitable reply,
"Yeah, man, its always number
three. .
And now, a few years later, I sit in
my living room rubbing another coat
of mink oil into my ratty, old Frye
boots. It's a bit cold outside, so I get
up to put on my LL Bean chamois
shirt. I think I'll listen to the Ramones
for a while. Real loud.
