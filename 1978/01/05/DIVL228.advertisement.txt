TO (ERUSALEM AND BACK: ISRAEL IN AMERICAN AND ISRAELI LITERA
TURE — Mondays starting lanuary 9, Room 61C, Prof. Irving Saposnick of
Haifa University. The course is a way of exploring a dual vision of
Israel as reflected in Jewish-American and Israeli literature. Using the
writings of Bellow, Roth, and Malamud as representative lewish-
American writers, and Amos Oz, A.B. Yehoshua, Yehuda Amichai, Yael
Dayan, and Amos Kollek as Israeli observers, we will attempt to unravel
the complex notion of lewish identity as expressed by these writers and
attempt to fathom the often-perplexing question of what it means to be a
lew today both in Israel and the diaspora.

lewMt Mother in paperback available at the first class.
