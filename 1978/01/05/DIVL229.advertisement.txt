We program systems,
not systems programmers.
Mational CSS offers an environment geared to creativity
and career development. Here, you'll find the excitement and
vitality of a youthful, powerfully motivated company on the
way up.
We're an information services company, specializing in
translating data into useful business information through the
use of computer and communications technology. Technically.
we are offering the most comprehensive collection of
programs currently available in the industry.
We seek your help in continuing our aggressive pursuit of the
growth opportunities available in the information processing
marketplace.
At NCSS, systems programmers are afforded a chance to
assume a variety of responsibilities. You'll be called upon to
design, debug, code, test and document functions within the
operating system. Additionally, your know-how will be needed
to analyze existing systems and programming logic difficulties,
and recommend better methods.
In short, we're planning a future that will keep us among the
industry's leaders and provide our people with rewarding careers.
For further information and/or prompt consideration, see
our recruiter on campus Jan. 10th. Arrangements should
be made through the Placement office.
