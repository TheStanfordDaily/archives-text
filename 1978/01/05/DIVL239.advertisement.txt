more people had cancer
of the colon-rectum
than any other cancer.
And you
haven't had
aprocto
lately?
Procto: an
everyday way of
saying proctoscopic
examination.
It's a simple
diagnostic test for
cancer of the colon
and rectum.
And it helps
save more lives than
any other step in
the checkup.
So, if you're
over 40, you should
have a procto as
part of your health
examination.
Just think of it
as a regular part of
living.
