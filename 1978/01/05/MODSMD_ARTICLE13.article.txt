on television every week he can't possibly be any
good here, and that because I liked him I must be
some kind of groupie who probably got low SAT
scores anyway. You're thinking that disco music is
about as exciting as leprosy and that anyone who likes
it must have no moral vision whatsoever.
You've got a point, too, except that it's uncharita
ble to go around thinking about other people's lousy
SAT's. John Travolta can be a bit of a pain, as the
publicity for this movie is proving, and most of the
music involved in this picture is not worth too much
on its own, but that still doesn't matter once the film
begins. I really liked this movie, and it bothers me
that I feel vaguely guilty about it.
But let me put it differently.
"Saturday Night Fever" has a fixity about it which
prevents it from leaving the disco. Whenever it does
leave the disco it becomes inconsequential and you
fidget until it returns. But that never takes very long.
Everything in the picture revolves around that build
ing, and everything in the building revolves around
John Travolta. Travolta plays nothing less than the
best disco dancer in the entire one-mile radius of the
picture — when he opens the door everybody there
stands up. Disco music follows Travolta everywhere
he goes in the picture, including the hardware store
where he works and subway which he rides, and
when he enters the disco, he and the movie are trans
formed.
They are transformed because the dancing scenes
in "Saturday Night" are the best I've ever seen. Be
cause they stand dead center we have no "Turning
Point" problems ("The Turning Point" is a movie
about bitchy people who won't shut up, and it only
incidentally features the finest male dancer on the
planet). Because they overfill the screen, the end
effect is hypnotic. It is not so much that Travolta is a
terrific dancer (he's good, and energetic, looking
barely under control) as it is the atmosphere in these
scenes — they use every possible film effect to draw
the viewer in. Anywhere else the music would be
oppressive and the flashing dance floor bogus, but in
)ohn Travolta's disco they are all but overwhelming.
And Travolta is a legitimate star. When the action
moves to the periphery, he keeps it from falling to
pieces; if it wasn't for him they would undermine and
corrode the movement which dominates the center.
Travolta wasn't given much room with this character
— he plays a big dumb stud — but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost complex at others. For the
most part, though, he successfully gives the impres
sion that the characters and action in "Saturday Night
Fever" are supposed to be subordinate to the danc
ing. He stays right on the edge of parody, and thus
takes the pain out of a lot of otherwise awful script
ing. When he needs to do things for real, he performs
without losing the edge he needs. Towards the end of
this picture there are moments which not even
Travolta can save, but by that time it doesn't matter.

By that time he's been in the disco and cemented us
to our chairs.
Some people, I'm sure, will hate this film for its
unrepentant dumbness, and even a few who will ob
ject to the dancing as inherently unimportant. But
that's their fault, really — if they scoff at you you
should punch them in the nose.
—JOHN NIELSEN


It has a dopey plot and only one real actor and no
nutritional value and a lot of schlock, but "Saturday
Night Fever" is a damn good film and you should see
it.
It pretends to be about living on the wrong end of
New York and about getting pregnant and jumping
off bridges, and also about quitting the priesthood
and beating up your neighbors, but that doesn't mat
ter, and you should forget I mentioned it. This is John
Travolta's movie, the one with the disco dancing — as
long as either holds the camera the action is dow
nright riveting.
But I know what you're thinking now. You're think
ing that because )ohn Travolta makes a fool of himself

on television every week he can't possibly be any
good here, and that because I liked him I must be

scores anyway. You're thinking that disco music is

off bridges, and also about quitting the priesthood
and beating up your neighbors, but that doesn't mat
ter, and you should forget I mentioned it. This is John
Travolta's movie, the one with the disco dancing — as
long as either holds the camera the action is dow
nright riveting.
But I know what you're thinking now. You're think
ing that because )ohn Travolta makes a fool of himself

on television every week he can't possibly be any
good here, and that because I liked him I must be
some kind of groupie who probably got low SAT
scores anyway. You're thinking that disco music is
about as exciting as leprosy and that anyone who likes
it must have no moral vision whatsoever.
You've got a point, too, except that it's uncharita
ble to go around thinking about other people's lousy
SAT's. John Travolta can be a bit of a pain, as the
publicity for this movie is proving, and most of the
music involved in this picture is not worth too much
on its own, but that still doesn't matter once the film
begins. I really liked this movie, and it bothers me
that I feel vaguely guilty about it.
But let me put it differently.
"Saturday Night Fever" has a fixity about it which
prevents it from leaving the disco. Whenever it does
leave the disco it becomes inconsequential and you
fidget until it returns. But that never takes very long.
Everything in the picture revolves around that build
ing, and everything in the building revolves around
John Travolta. Travolta plays nothing less than the
best disco dancer in the entire one-mile radius of the
picture — when he opens the door everybody there
stands up. Disco music follows Travolta everywhere
he goes in the picture, including the hardware store
where he works and subway which he rides, and
when he enters the disco, he and the movie are trans
formed.
They are transformed because the dancing scenes
in "Saturday Night" are the best I've ever seen. Be
cause they stand dead center we have no "Turning
Point" problems ("The Turning Point" is a movie
about bitchy people who won't shut up, and it only
incidentally features the finest male dancer on the
planet). Because they overfill the screen, the end
effect is hypnotic. It is not so much that Travolta is a
terrific dancer (he's good, and energetic, looking
barely under control) as it is the atmosphere in these
scenes — they use every possible film effect to draw
the viewer in. Anywhere else the music would be
oppressive and the flashing dance floor bogus, but in
)ohn Travolta's disco they are all but overwhelming.
And Travolta is a legitimate star. When the action
moves to the periphery, he keeps it from falling to
pieces; if it wasn't for him they would undermine and
corrode the movement which dominates the center.
Travolta wasn't given much room with this character
— he plays a big dumb stud — but he manages to be
subtle at times and almost complex at others. For the
most part, though, he successfully gives the impres
sion that the characters and action in "Saturday Night
Fever" are supposed to be subordinate to the danc
ing. He stays right on the edge of parody, and thus
takes the pain out of a lot of otherwise awful script
ing. When he needs to do things for real, he performs
without losing the edge he needs. Towards the end of
this picture there are moments which not even
Travolta can save, but by that time it doesn't matter.

By that time he's been in the disco and cemented us
to our chairs.
Some people, I'm sure, will hate this film for its
unrepentant dumbness, and even a few who will ob
ject to the dancing as inherently unimportant. But
that's their fault, really — if they scoff at you you
should punch them in the nose.
—JOHN NIELSEN


It has a dopey plot and only one real actor and no
nutritional value and a lot of schlock, but "Saturday
Night Fever" is a damn good film and you should see
it.
It pretends to be about living on the wrong end of
New York and about getting pregnant and jumping
off bridges, and also about quitting the priesthood
and beating up your neighbors, but that doesn't mat
ter, and you should forget I mentioned it. This is John
Travolta's movie, the one with the disco dancing — as
