Carver's second book of
short fiction is a little like
having a moody friend walk
up and talk in a voice so low
you strain to hear, and when
you bend toward him, he
suddenly hauls off and
knocks you down. Eight
times. You come away sore
in spots.
For example, take the first
story, "Dummy." A name
less deaf man is talked into
stocking his farm pond with
black bass by a sawmill co
worker, but then refuses to
let anyone fish there. He is
adamant in his refusal even
when an enormous hooked
bass rests just a few feet
from shore, "on its side,
whipped, mouth open and
gills working slowly." Later,

rains come and the pond is
flooded. Then, on a Satur
day night, he pulls his un
faithful wife out of a bar and
beats her to death with a
hammer and drowns him
self in his stocked lake.
When police drag for him,
another body is discovered,
a man who had been in the
water for months.
And "Pastoral." With
plain reference to Heming
way's "Big Two-Hearted
River," Carver has a man
drive alone through snow to
a mountain cabin where he
had honeymooned with his
wife. He ties lures, he wraps
sandwiches in waxed paper,
he quietly fishes down river
and hears eight shots in the
distance. He casts a new fly
and a doe stumbles out of
the brush, dragging her
damaged hind leg. Soon
some boys appear and ask
where the deer went, but
the man will not tell them. A

boy threatens him with a
rifle while the others pelt
him with rocks. They leave
and he mislays his rod on his
slow walk back to the cabin.
He thinks, "Somehow he
had missed it and it was
gone. Something heroic
. . . He stared at the word
less, distorted things
around him."
"Mine" is a surreal piece,
almost a cheap gag, in
which a baby is torn apart
during a marital separation.
The mysterious title story is
about incest and a brother's
stabbing of his sister when
she becomes pregnant.
Maybe the best of the
stories about married life is
the metaphorical "So Much
Water, So Close to Home."
Four men go fishing on
opening day of the fishing
season and even before
they could set up camp, Mel
Dorn found the girl floating
face down in the river,

nude, lodged near the
shore against some
branches. He called the
other men and they came to
look at her.
They pleaded fatigue, the
late hour, the fact that the
girl "wasn't going any
where." In the end they all
decided to stay.
Taken singly these are
wonderful, resonant
stories, charged with the
kind of psychic energy
which flings tumblers off of
tables. But they lose much
of that when read in tan
dem. The sad music seems
of one note, each punch
seems telegraphed. The
sameness disappoints.
"Will You Please Be Quiet,
Please?" Carver's first col
lection, was nominated for
both the National Book
Award and the Ernest
Hemingway Foundation
Prize; it was a haunting
book, suffused with

menace and suppressed
violence. The hook to each
fiction was in its ominous
atmosphere of blur, of
something overheard, of
something terrible happen
ing in the next room. Carver
has traded that for raw sen
sation and shock; his phan
toms have turned into corp
ses, his fantasies seem
locked on threatened injury
and murder and a little too
much is too improbable.
None of this is accidental,
of course. Raymond Carver
wants all his chilling effects,
means to draw in one un
lighted book a map of emo
tional storms. If only in that
sense, "Furious Seasons" is
a real achievement, a mov
ing dream diary written in
spare, naive, evocative
prose by a true artist who
hurts but does not under
stand. When he whispers,
lean to hear him.
