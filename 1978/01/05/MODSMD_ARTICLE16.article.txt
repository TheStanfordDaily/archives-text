# Evans' latest only for those who are willing to listen

Bill Evans at his best is
perhaps the premier jazz
pianist of our time. His latest
album "Alone Again" is dis
tinct proof of this; Evan's play
ing is starkly beautiful and rich
in harmonic coloring and
melodic surprise.
Evans, like Art Tatum, Oscar
Peterson and a host of old
timers, is primarily a "tune"
player; he will take a popular
song and transform it into a
three minute masterpiece. In
this regard he disdains the ex
cesses of many avant-garde
musicians, yet ironically his
music sounds as modern as
anything being played today.
Part of the reason for this is his
command of chord structure
— forwhich is deeply indebted
to the impressionists and early
modernists of classical music.
His early recordings with
Miles Davis were far ahead of
anything else being done at the
time. His style has remained
essentially the same ever since.
On "Alone Again'' his interpre
tations of songs like "People"
or "On a Clear Day" are amaz
ing. Evans can take the tritest
material, pop tunes like "Alfie"
or "People" and transform
them from Musak into stun
ning music.
One of the main pleasures of
"Alone Again" is that it gives
the listener a rare opportunity
to hear Evans play solo piano.
His one previous solo album,

"Alone" on Verve, is quite
good though difficult to find.
In his solo playing Evans takes
more liberties with his mate
rial.
But make no mistake —
"Alone Again" is not a virtuoso
album. Evans' playing is clean
and sure, but never ornamen
tal. Unlike Oscar Peterson or
Phineas Newborn, Evans is al
ways intent on displaying the
music and not his playing of it.
The most important part of
Evans' technique at the piano is
