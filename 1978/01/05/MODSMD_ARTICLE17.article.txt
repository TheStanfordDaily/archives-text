his tone control. Much of the
attraction of his music is the
clear, singing yet subdued
tone he produces from the
piano. In that regard Evans is
one of the few jazz musicians
— one thinks immediately of
Miles Davis and Paul Desmond
— who can captivate an audi
ence with the tone of his play
ing alone. This for a pianist is
quite an accomplishment.
One drawback of "Alone
Again" and, I might add, of
Evans.' playing in general, is the
middle range tempo which all
his songs fall into. Evans rarely
takes his music at a fast pace,
instead it always remains at a
relaxed speed which often lulls
the listener rather than moves
him. At his concerts it is not
unusual for Evans to play a half

dozen slow numbers in a row.
Evans has often been
criticized for being too intros
pective; he often seems more
intent on communion with his
instrument than with his audi
ence. There is a degree of truth
to this observation — Evans'
music does demand attentive
listening — yet this is a quality
which I would argue is much a
part of all great music. Bill
Evans has objected in print that
jazz piano is too often consi
dered as background music.
Evans' music itself has often
been wrongly considered as
such, yet in contrast his music
can only be appreciated with
careful listening. His apparent
introspectiveness is a problem
only tothose who let it be one.
Thus the reviewer of an
album like "Alone Again" is
faced with an unusual prob
lem. I can say that "Alone
Again" is one of the best al
bums of the past year yet also
not one I would recommend to
everyone. Today's music
showcases tricky effects and
exterior qualities. The subtle
beauty of Bill Evans' music, like
the cigarette, is not for
everyone nor tries to be. Yet
for the listener who is willing to
approach his music with per
ceptivenessand sincerity — for
him "Alone Again" will be a
very important musical experi
ence.
