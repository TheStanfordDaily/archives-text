Leaders view Palestinian rights
Aswan, Egypt (AP) — President Jimmy Carter met
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in this Upper Nile city
yesterday and afterwards declared his support for the
"legitimate rights of Palestinians."
The statement was ridiculed by Palestinians while
Israelis expressed concern.
But a smiling Sadcft told reporters he and Carter
shared "identical views" and agreed at their hour
long meeting on tactics for advancing peace talks. He
and Carter were united on how to deal with the Pales
tinian problem, Sadat said and added: "We have
reached a solution."
In Beirut, Mahmoud Dabadi, spokesman for Pales
tinine Liberation Organization chief Vasir Arafat, said
of Carter's endorsement of Palestinian rights: "Let
Mr. Cartertell us where hewantsthese rights realized
— on the moon or on earth."
In Syria the government controlled newspapers
said: "Carter has failed to line up a single Arab part
ner to Sadat. Sadat remains alone in the journey of
treason that has already hit a dead end."
Hearst loses reconsideration bid
San Francisco (AP) — A federal appeals court yes
terday refused to reconsider its unanimous decision
to uphold Patricia Hearst's bank robbery conviction,
leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as her next legal
recourse.
Hearst's attorney, Al Johnson, said he was "disap
pointed" in the decision but that notice of appeal
would be filed with the nation's highest court within
30 days.
In its brief 1 '/2-page order, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals denied Hearst's motion to recon
sider its Nov. 2, 1977, ruling upholding the guilty
verdict.
It disputed her contention that her 1976 trial was
prejudiced against her by the admission of evidence
about criminal acts after the April 1974 bank robbery
for which she was on trial. She was convicted March
20, 1976.
Although she was sentenced to seven years in
prison for the bank holdup, she is free on $1 million
bail pending appeals.
Baker on canal treaty: no chance
Panama City (AP) —Gen. Omar Torrijos was told in
blunt terms yesterday by Sen. Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) that the proposed Panama Canal treaty stands
no chance of Senate passage in its present form.
The Panamanian leader said Baker's warning was
"so important" that he would call a special meeting of
his Cabinet and other top aides to try to come up with
some answers for Baker before he leaves the country
Saturday.

Torrijos' comments left open the possibility of the
Panamanians allowing changes in the treaty to make
the accord more palatable to Baker and others in the
Senate who now oppose it.
Baker, the Senate minority leader, told Torrijos that
he could not personally support the treaty unless it
undergoes significant revision. The senator told re
porters earlier that the pact could win bipartisan sup
port if "understandings" were made to clarify certain
provisions on the canal's future defenses.
The treaty needs a two-thirds majority to win ratifi
cation.
The treaty provides for the United States to gradu
ally turn the waterway over to Panama by the year
2000, after which the two countries would share re
sponsibility for its defense and neutrality. Many
senators contend this latter provision is not specific
enough.
Chileans given yes/no ballot
Santiago, Chile (AP) — Chileans voted yesterday in a
referendum, called a "national consultation," ex
pected to give resounding support to the military
regime of President Augusto Pinochet.
Pinochet sought the vote to strengthen his position
in confrontations with international critics and oppo
nents at home.
Pinochet hoped for a massive show of support in
the face of a recent United Nations resolution on
alleged continuing human rights abuses in Chile.
Voters responded "yes" or "no" to the following
statement:
"Before the international aggression unleashed
against the government of our country I back Presi
dent Pinochet in his defense of the dignity of Chile
and I reaffirm the legitimacy of the government of the
republic to sovereignly lead the process of in
stitutionalization of the country."
What the voter was expected to respond was made
quite clear. Above the "yes" line on the ballot is a
drawing of the national flag and above the "no" line a
small square filled in with gray.
Over six million citizens were expected to vote.
Dollar plunges on money markets
London (AP) — The dollar plunged sharply in trad
ing yesterday morning on Europe's money markets
and made a modest recovery in the afternoon, but
still finished lower than the previous day on most
markets.
The U.S. government said it was starting major
intervention in foreign exchange markets to maintain
the dollar's value. It was not immediately clear
whether the announcement had helped cause the
dollar's moderate recovery in Europe.
For the first time in nearly two years American

tourists in London had to pay more than $2 for a
British pound at currency exchanges.
Brown's health policies attacked
Sacramento (AP) — Legislators from both parties
attacked Gov. Jerry Brown's mental health policies
yesterday and refused for the second time to approve
an emergency $4 million grant to Metropolitan State
Hospital.
However, Brown administration officials said new
hiring could continue at Metropolitan, in the Los
Angeles County community of Norwalk, for another
six weeks under a $750,000 state loan authorized by
the Democratic governor.
Brown plans to make a third request to the Joint
Legislative Budget Committee in about a month for
approval to spend $4 million in federal funds for hir
ing of 234 persons at Metropolitan, officials said.
The committee's response Wednesday was gener
ally hostile. Members said Brown had let a crisis de
velop by blocking past legislative funding requests
for the 11 mental hospitals, which have been cited by
the state for about 3000 health and safety violations.
They also signaled clearly that Brown will have to
document his mental health plans in detail before the
Legislature approves his new $27.7 million proposal
for immediate funding of 3000 new jobs at the hospi
tals.
FDA plans hair dye warning
Washington (AP) —The Food and Drug Administra
tion yesterday announced plans to require warning
labels on many permanent hair dyes that contain coal
tar derivatives suspected of causing cancer.
The agency also proposed requiring all beauty sa
lons to display posters warning that some hair dyes
contain ingredients that may cause cancer and advis
ing consumers to check for warning labels on dyes to
be used on their hair.
The FDA proposal follows a finding by the National
Cancer Institute that a chemical used in many perma
nent hair dyes, 4-methoxy-m-phenylenediamine and
its sulphate, caused cancer when fed to laboratory
rats and mice.
The regulation would require dyes containing the
suspect chemical to carry this statement on their
labels: "Warning — Contains an ingredient that can
penetrate your skin and has been determined to
cause cancer in laboratory animals."
Today's weather
Showers likely through today, then chance of
showers tonight and tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s
to low 50s. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s. Chance of
rain 70 per cent today and 40 per cent tonight.

Dollar plunges on money markets
London (AP) — The dollar plunged sharply in trad
ing yesterday morning on Europe's money markets
and made a modest recovery in the afternoon, but
still finished lower than the previous day on most
markets.
The U.S. government said it was starting major
intervention in foreign exchange markets to maintain
the dollar's value. It was not immediately clear
whether the announcement had helped cause the
dollar's moderate recovery in Europe.
For the first time in nearly two years American

tourists in London had to pay more than $2 for a
British pound at currency exchanges.
Brown's health policies attacked
Sacramento (AP) — Legislators from both parties
attacked Gov. Jerry Brown's mental health policies
yesterday and refused for the second time to approve
an emergency $4 million grant to Metropolitan State
Hospital.
However, Brown administration officials said new
hiring could continue at Metropolitan, in the Los
Angeles County community of Norwalk, for another
six weeks under a $750,000 state loan authorized by
the Democratic governor.
Brown plans to make a third request to the Joint
Legislative Budget Committee in about a month for
approval to spend $4 million in federal funds for hir
ing of 234 persons at Metropolitan, officials said.
The committee's response Wednesday was gener
ally hostile. Members said Brown had let a crisis de
velop by blocking past legislative funding requests
for the 11 mental hospitals, which have been cited by
the state for about 3000 health and safety violations.
They also signaled clearly that Brown will have to
document his mental health plans in detail before the
Legislature approves his new $27.7 million proposal
for immediate funding of 3000 new jobs at the hospi
tals.
FDA plans hair dye warning
Washington (AP) —The Food and Drug Administra
tion yesterday announced plans to require warning
labels on many permanent hair dyes that contain coal
tar derivatives suspected of causing cancer.
The agency also proposed requiring all beauty sa
lons to display posters warning that some hair dyes
contain ingredients that may cause cancer and advis
ing consumers to check for warning labels on dyes to
be used on their hair.
The FDA proposal follows a finding by the National
Cancer Institute that a chemical used in many perma
nent hair dyes, 4-methoxy-m-phenylenediamine and
its sulphate, caused cancer when fed to laboratory
rats and mice.
The regulation would require dyes containing the
suspect chemical to carry this statement on their
labels: "Warning — Contains an ingredient that can
penetrate your skin and has been determined to
cause cancer in laboratory animals."
Today's weather
Showers likely through today, then chance of
showers tonight and tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s
to low 50s. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s. Chance of
rain 70 per cent today and 40 per cent tonight.
Leaders view Palestinian rights
Aswan, Egypt (AP) — President Jimmy Carter met
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in this Upper Nile city
yesterday and afterwards declared his support for the
"legitimate rights of Palestinians."
The statement was ridiculed by Palestinians while
Israelis expressed concern.
But a smiling Sadcft told reporters he and Carter
shared "identical views" and agreed at their hour
long meeting on tactics for advancing peace talks. He
and Carter were united on how to deal with the Pales
tinian problem, Sadat said and added: "We have
reached a solution."
In Beirut, Mahmoud Dabadi, spokesman for Pales
tinine Liberation Organization chief Vasir Arafat, said
of Carter's endorsement of Palestinian rights: "Let
Mr. Cartertell us where hewantsthese rights realized
— on the moon or on earth."
In Syria the government controlled newspapers
said: "Carter has failed to line up a single Arab part
ner to Sadat. Sadat remains alone in the journey of
treason that has already hit a dead end."
Hearst loses reconsideration bid
San Francisco (AP) — A federal appeals court yes
terday refused to reconsider its unanimous decision
to uphold Patricia Hearst's bank robbery conviction,
leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as her next legal
recourse.
Hearst's attorney, Al Johnson, said he was "disap
pointed" in the decision but that notice of appeal
would be filed with the nation's highest court within
30 days.
In its brief 1 '/2-page order, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals denied Hearst's motion to recon
sider its Nov. 2, 1977, ruling upholding the guilty
verdict.
It disputed her contention that her 1976 trial was
prejudiced against her by the admission of evidence
about criminal acts after the April 1974 bank robbery
for which she was on trial. She was convicted March
20, 1976.
Although she was sentenced to seven years in
prison for the bank holdup, she is free on $1 million
bail pending appeals.
Baker on canal treaty: no chance
Panama City (AP) —Gen. Omar Torrijos was told in
blunt terms yesterday by Sen. Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) that the proposed Panama Canal treaty stands
no chance of Senate passage in its present form.
The Panamanian leader said Baker's warning was
"so important" that he would call a special meeting of
his Cabinet and other top aides to try to come up with
some answers for Baker before he leaves the country
Saturday.

Torrijos' comments left open the possibility of the
Panamanians allowing changes in the treaty to make
the accord more palatable to Baker and others in the
Senate who now oppose it.
Baker, the Senate minority leader, told Torrijos that
he could not personally support the treaty unless it
undergoes significant revision. The senator told re
porters earlier that the pact could win bipartisan sup
port if "understandings" were made to clarify certain
provisions on the canal's future defenses.
The treaty needs a two-thirds majority to win ratifi
cation.
The treaty provides for the United States to gradu
ally turn the waterway over to Panama by the year
2000, after which the two countries would share re
sponsibility for its defense and neutrality. Many
senators contend this latter provision is not specific
enough.
Chileans given yes/no ballot
Santiago, Chile (AP) — Chileans voted yesterday in a
referendum, called a "national consultation," ex
pected to give resounding support to the military
regime of President Augusto Pinochet.
Pinochet sought the vote to strengthen his position
in confrontations with international critics and oppo
nents at home.
Pinochet hoped for a massive show of support in
the face of a recent United Nations resolution on
alleged continuing human rights abuses in Chile.
Voters responded "yes" or "no" to the following
statement:
"Before the international aggression unleashed

Hearst loses reconsideration bid
San Francisco (AP) — A federal appeals court yes
terday refused to reconsider its unanimous decision
to uphold Patricia Hearst's bank robbery conviction,
leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as her next legal
recourse.
Hearst's attorney, Al Johnson, said he was "disap
pointed" in the decision but that notice of appeal
would be filed with the nation's highest court within
30 days.
In its brief 1 '/2-page order, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals denied Hearst's motion to recon
sider its Nov. 2, 1977, ruling upholding the guilty
verdict.
It disputed her contention that her 1976 trial was
prejudiced against her by the admission of evidence
about criminal acts after the April 1974 bank robbery
for which she was on trial. She was convicted March
20, 1976.
Although she was sentenced to seven years in
prison for the bank holdup, she is free on $1 million
bail pending appeals.
Baker on canal treaty: no chance
Panama City (AP) —Gen. Omar Torrijos was told in
blunt terms yesterday by Sen. Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) that the proposed Panama Canal treaty stands
no chance of Senate passage in its present form.
The Panamanian leader said Baker's warning was
"so important" that he would call a special meeting of
his Cabinet and other top aides to try to come up with
some answers for Baker before he leaves the country
Saturday.

Torrijos' comments left open the possibility of the
Panamanians allowing changes in the treaty to make
the accord more palatable to Baker and others in the
Senate who now oppose it.
Baker, the Senate minority leader, told Torrijos that
he could not personally support the treaty unless it
undergoes significant revision. The senator told re
porters earlier that the pact could win bipartisan sup
port if "understandings" were made to clarify certain
provisions on the canal's future defenses.
The treaty needs a two-thirds majority to win ratifi
cation.
The treaty provides for the United States to gradu
ally turn the waterway over to Panama by the year
2000, after which the two countries would share re
sponsibility for its defense and neutrality. Many
senators contend this latter provision is not specific
enough.
Chileans given yes/no ballot
Santiago, Chile (AP) — Chileans voted yesterday in a
referendum, called a "national consultation," ex
pected to give resounding support to the military
regime of President Augusto Pinochet.
Pinochet sought the vote to strengthen his position
in confrontations with international critics and oppo
nents at home.
Pinochet hoped for a massive show of support in
the face of a recent United Nations resolution on
alleged continuing human rights abuses in Chile.
Voters responded "yes" or "no" to the following
statement:
"Before the international aggression unleashed
against the government of our country I back Presi
dent Pinochet in his defense of the dignity of Chile
and I reaffirm the legitimacy of the government of the
republic to sovereignly lead the process of in
stitutionalization of the country."
What the voter was expected to respond was made
quite clear. Above the "yes" line on the ballot is a
drawing of the national flag and above the "no" line a
small square filled in with gray.
Over six million citizens were expected to vote.
Dollar plunges on money markets
London (AP) — The dollar plunged sharply in trad
ing yesterday morning on Europe's money markets
and made a modest recovery in the afternoon, but
still finished lower than the previous day on most
markets.
The U.S. government said it was starting major
intervention in foreign exchange markets to maintain
the dollar's value. It was not immediately clear
whether the announcement had helped cause the
dollar's moderate recovery in Europe.
For the first time in nearly two years American

tourists in London had to pay more than $2 for a
British pound at currency exchanges.
Brown's health policies attacked
Sacramento (AP) — Legislators from both parties
attacked Gov. Jerry Brown's mental health policies
yesterday and refused for the second time to approve
an emergency $4 million grant to Metropolitan State
Hospital.
However, Brown administration officials said new
hiring could continue at Metropolitan, in the Los
Angeles County community of Norwalk, for another
six weeks under a $750,000 state loan authorized by
the Democratic governor.
Brown plans to make a third request to the Joint
Legislative Budget Committee in about a month for
approval to spend $4 million in federal funds for hir
ing of 234 persons at Metropolitan, officials said.
The committee's response Wednesday was gener
ally hostile. Members said Brown had let a crisis de
velop by blocking past legislative funding requests
for the 11 mental hospitals, which have been cited by
the state for about 3000 health and safety violations.
They also signaled clearly that Brown will have to
document his mental health plans in detail before the
Legislature approves his new $27.7 million proposal
for immediate funding of 3000 new jobs at the hospi
tals.
FDA plans hair dye warning
Washington (AP) —The Food and Drug Administra
tion yesterday announced plans to require warning
labels on many permanent hair dyes that contain coal
tar derivatives suspected of causing cancer.
The agency also proposed requiring all beauty sa
lons to display posters warning that some hair dyes
contain ingredients that may cause cancer and advis
ing consumers to check for warning labels on dyes to
be used on their hair.
The FDA proposal follows a finding by the National
Cancer Institute that a chemical used in many perma
nent hair dyes, 4-methoxy-m-phenylenediamine and
its sulphate, caused cancer when fed to laboratory
rats and mice.
The regulation would require dyes containing the
suspect chemical to carry this statement on their
labels: "Warning — Contains an ingredient that can
penetrate your skin and has been determined to
cause cancer in laboratory animals."
Today's weather
Showers likely through today, then chance of
showers tonight and tomorrow. Lows in the mid 40s
to low 50s. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s. Chance of
rain 70 per cent today and 40 per cent tonight.
Leaders view Palestinian rights
Aswan, Egypt (AP) — President Jimmy Carter met
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in this Upper Nile city
yesterday and afterwards declared his support for the
"legitimate rights of Palestinians."
The statement was ridiculed by Palestinians while
Israelis expressed concern.
But a smiling Sadcft told reporters he and Carter
shared "identical views" and agreed at their hour
long meeting on tactics for advancing peace talks. He
and Carter were united on how to deal with the Pales
