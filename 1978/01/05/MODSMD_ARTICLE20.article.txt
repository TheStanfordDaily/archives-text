"Mr. Ustinov lives in Paris in an
apartment filled with awards and good
conversation." The last trite sentence
on the jacket cover reveals more about
the nature of Ustinov's autobiography
than all the preceding verbiage tedi
ously describing its contents. For the
book is like good after-dinner conver
sation: not strictly vital to our lives, yet
so enormously enjoyable (and some
times thoughtful) as to enrich them
greatly.
Peter Ustinov is known principally for
his tragicomic plays "Romanoff and
Juliet" and "The Love of Four Col
onels," both international hits in the
early 1960s. In "Romanoff and Juliet,"
Ustinov invents a country in which his
nuclear-age version of the famed love
story takes place, and admits now in his
autobiography that this is the unique
land of which he is a citizen, or rather
President, making his own rules and
regulations. For Ustinov's own family
comes from an improbably varied in
ternational background — his mother
being mostly Russian and his father
morethan half German — and he hence
feels himself to be a foreigner
everywhere but in his own private
world. This is not surprising, when we
consider that he was conceived in Pet
rograd, born in London and christened
in a tiny village near Stuttgart, having
traveled to this unlikely spot in a laun
dry basket because an Ethiopian aunt
wished to attend the christening and
considered the village to be halfway be
tween London and Cairo.
"Once I had actually been cajoled to
enter this world, I apparently behaved

as though I had never hesitated and
held up my head to look around, even
when suspended by my feet like a bat,"
writes Ustinov of his birth. His interest
in the world, and more especially the
people around him, is evident in the
ensuing string of funny stories, anec
dotes and observations. Ustinov grew
up in London and avails himself liber
ally of the opportunity to ridicule some
of the more eccentric aspects of English
life from the standpoint of a foreigner
never forced to accept or expect them.
Having endured the vagaries of cricket
at prep school and rowing at Westmins
ter (a well-known private school for
boys), Ustinov transferred at the age of
15 to Michel Saint-Denis' Drama
Academy in Islington. The theatre be
came a profession, if not at first a voca
tion. But it was a profession Ustinov
was allowed to practice only for a brief
time, before being called into the army
during World War 11.
Ustinov's brushes with British milit
ary authority evidently gave him a pro
found sense of the absurd — both its
tragic and comic sense. The humor is
more to be expected than the serious
reflection. Film-making with Carol
Reed, Eric Ambler, David Niven and
others could hardly be less than amus
ing, and Ustinov recalls his army studio
experiences with wit and affection.
The serious reflections seem to
spring from Ustinov's overriding feel
ing of uselessness during his four
years in uniform, a sense of wasting
time and effort, despite ostensibly
doing his duty. His experiences lead
him to the following conclusion about
war: "Inefficiency on the scale of war
fare would be impermissible in any
field in which the prosperity of
shareholders was involved, while the
wastefulness of battle is comparable

only to the exchange of wealth in a
casino." It's a clever, and useful, com
parison, one of many such at this stage
of the book. We can be as thankful as
Ustinov himself that he went into the
army, for he shows us what he learned
there. In common with many who went
through the same experience, Ustinov
concludes: "I loathed every moment of
it, and I would not have missed it for the
world."
The budding playwright, actor and
director was more fortunate than most,
however, in being able to advance his
career while enlisted in the ranks. His
first four plays were premiered to grow
ing critical acclaim during the war, and
he worked with several current and fu
ture stars: John Gielgud, Ralph
Richardson, Edith Evans and Michael
Anderson. Ustinov has amusing
memories of all these people (did you
know Ralph Richardson had false
teeth?).
Despite his growing dramatic success
both during and after the war, Ustinov
was not personally happy. These
memories and insights lend his au
tobiography its character, not the often
predictable and sometimes apocryphal
tidbits about the stars he knows and has
worked with.
Shortly after the war, Ustinov's first
marriage broke up. He has only the fol
lowing wry comments to offer: "The
end of our marriage seemed curiously
tepid. It was all very English and very
reasonable, with the added spice of
that ludicrous charade of sending a de
tective to a prescribed room in a trans
ient hotel where Isolde (Ustinov's wife)
would be discovered playing cards with
a hired adulterer." Ustinov is either
unwilling or unable to offer any expla
nation of the reasons for the breakup.
The same holds true for his second

marriage, which broke up after 20
years, though Ustinov maintains that he
held it together only for the sake of his
three children, whom he quite plainly
adores. These are curious loopholes in
a character prone to analysis, though
perhaps the omissions stem more from
an unwillingness to launder dirty linen
in public than from inability to explain
relationships with the opposite sex. In
deed, at times Ustinov can be very
aware of the complications of male
female encounters: "I learned that
women seemed all the same when
things went wrong, all different when
things went well."
The neat phrasing of Ustinov's ob
servations sometimes lend his book a
facile quality which belies the amount
of thought which has evidently gone
into his words. The same holds true for
his humorous accounts of drinks with
Humphrey Bogart or the way in which
John Trevelyan, the British film censor,
helped secure good box-office returns
for Ustinov's film "Billy Budd."
The range of topics and emotions co
vered is, however, truly remarkable. I
suspect that this stems in part from Us
tinov's international background, and
his eye for the quirks of human nature.
His faith in human beings gives him the
optimism one would typically expect of
someone with his corpulent, beaming
looks: "I am an optimist, unrepentant
and militant. After all, in order not to be
a fool, an optimist must know how sad a
place the world can be. It is only the
pessimist who finds this out anew every
day."
In the company of Peter Ustinov, we
are privileged to discover the world's
joys and sadnesses today, tomorrow or
sometime soon — and all condensed
into 365 well-written pages.
