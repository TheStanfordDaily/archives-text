## Sororities may return to campus 
### Jill Liscom 
The 33-year-old ban on
sororities was modified at the
Dec. 13 Board of Trustees
meeting allowing women here
to subjectively select members
of an all-women's residential
or eating group.
According to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons, the
trustees were "trying to elimi
nate a situation in which men
students have a privilege which
women students do not have."
Lyons emphasized that mod
ifying the ban "does not mean
that we want sororities to re
turn, just that the padlock has
been lifted."
The proposal to lift the ban
was originally brought before
the trustees last )une, but vot
ing was postponed until the
November meeting.
In October the sorority issue
was discussed extensively in
preparation for a November
vote, but the trustees decided
to postpone the vote again,
until Dec. 13.
In their resolution, the trus
tees emphasized that any new
women's group must have
local control over membership
selection and meet University
criteria for student housing.
Lyons explained that requir
ing membership to be deter
mined locally is important be
cause "historically, one of the
ways sororities have been dis
criminatory is by requiring a
letter of reference to the na
tional sorority."
"It remains University policy
that there be no form of selec
tive housing for students that
results in the adverse effect
which led to the board's 1944
action," the trustees added.
He explained that if an all
women's group wants an on
campus residence, it must
compete with other student
groups who are also seeking
housing, such as theme
houses.
A more feasible alternative,
said Lyons, might be to have an
all-women's eating club.
