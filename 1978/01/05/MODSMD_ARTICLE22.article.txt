# U.S. power supply is grim

New York (AP) — Demand for electricity rose
in 1977 almost as fast as before the Arab oil
embargo, industry researchers said yesterday,
prompting analysts to warn that the outlook for
the nation's power supply may soon become
"quite threatening."
The Edison Electric Institute, a utility-industry
research group, said in its year-end report that
in 1977 electricity output for all of the United
States except the Northwest and Southwest
grew by 6 per cent, about the same as the rate of
growth before the embargo.
Northwest and Southwest states, largely de
pendent on hydroelectric power which was hurt
this year by droughts, had a rate of growth of
around 1 per cent.
The power situation in the Northwest was so
critical this past summer that voluntary rationing
was called for by local officials, and about 500
workers were laid off when several aluminum
factories shut down before rains relieved one of
the worst droughts in the area's history.
Peak power demand — the amount of electric

ity needed during tFie most extreme cir
cumstances — increased 6.5 per cent in 1977.
Utilities must plan on supplying the peak
amount, even though that means some of their
facilities will be unused for much of the rest of
the year.
Many industry experts already have warned
that rotating blackouts or government-imposed
restrictions on electricity use are possible by
next year in the Southeast and by 1986 in all
other areas.
Yesterday, analysts for Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co. of New York said that "unless correc
tive steps are taken soon, the outlook for the
nation's electric power supply is quite threaten
ing." It takes 12 years to build a nuclear power
plant and 5 years to 8 years to build a conven
tional one.
Because of uncertainty over how much power
would be needed and which fuel to use for
generating power, difficulties in raising money,
and environmental restrictions, many utilities
canceled or delayed plans to build power plants.
