# Ex-prof Franklin loses court cases
## 
### Craig Dennis 
Former Stanford Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin was properly
denied the protection of the
First Amendment's guarantee
of free speech and assembly
for his 1971 White Plaza speech
urging occupation of the
Computation Center, Santa
Clara County Superior Court
judge John Flaherty ruled yes
terday.
Franklin was contesting his
February, 1972, dismissal by
the Advisory Board, an elected
group of Stanford faculty. Its
conclusion was upheld by Pres
ident Richard Lyman and the
Board of Trustees by a 20-2
vote.
In an independent review of
the Advisory Board's record in
the case, Flaherty concluded
that the board had acted prop
erly when it determined
Franklin's First Amendment
rights were not protected.
In its opinion recommend
ing dismissal, the Advisory
Board cited Brandenberg v.
Ohio, a Supreme Court deci
sion that "held to be punisha
ble, advocacy must be directed
to inciting or producing immi

nent lawless action, and . . .
likely to produce such action."
With respect to Franklin's
White Plaza speech, Flaherty
said the Advisory Board
applied the Brandenberg stan
dard properly.
"Franklin's speech was a call
to action, framed at the end of
the speech specifically as a call
to shut down the Computation
Center," Flaherty said.
"At that point, Franklin was
urging the crowd in a manner
directed to inciting or produc
ing imminent lawless action
and likely to produce such ac
tion."
However, Flaherty denied
motions by both sides for a
summary judgment in the case.
Fie said another Franklin
speech in the Old Union cour
tyard on the night of Feb. 10,
1971 was "an entirely different
matter" when the board consi
dered it.
"Here the court believes the
Brandenberg test was not cor
rectly applied . . . Franklin ap
pears to be more concerned
with building the size of the
campus antiwar movement
rather than inciting lawless
ness or disruptive conduct."
Flaherty requested counsel
for both parties to submit
memoranda on whether the
case should be returned to the
Advisory Board for a redeter
mination of the penalty given
Franklin based upon the
court's rulings on their mo
tions.
"The evidence in the record
supports the finding of the
board," although "it is a close
question," Flaherty said.
The judge also denied
Franklin's contention that the
charges against him were
overbroad and so vague as to
be unconstitutional. But he ag
reed Franklin was entitled to an
independent review of the Ad
visory Board's record.
Franklin recently received
tenure as an English professor
at Rutgers University. His case
has been supported by the
American Civil Liberties Un
ion.

ing dismissal, the Advisory
Board cited Brandenberg v.
Ohio, a Supreme Court deci
sion that "held to be punisha
ble, advocacy must be directed
to inciting or producing immi

nent lawless action, and . . .
likely to produce such action."
With respect to Franklin's
White Plaza speech, Flaherty
said the Advisory Board
applied the Brandenberg stan
dard properly.
"Franklin's speech was a call
to action, framed at the end of
the speech specifically as a call
to shut down the Computation
Center," Flaherty said.
"At that point, Franklin was
urging the crowd in a manner
directed to inciting or produc
ing imminent lawless action
and likely to produce such ac
tion."
However, Flaherty denied
motions by both sides for a
summary judgment in the case.
Fie said another Franklin
speech in the Old Union cour
tyard on the night of Feb. 10,
1971 was "an entirely different
matter" when the board consi
dered it.
"Here the court believes the
Brandenberg test was not cor
rectly applied . . . Franklin ap
pears to be more concerned
with building the size of the
campus antiwar movement
rather than inciting lawless
ness or disruptive conduct."
Flaherty requested counsel
for both parties to submit
memoranda on whether the
case should be returned to the
Advisory Board for a redeter
mination of the penalty given
Franklin based upon the
court's rulings on their mo
tions.
"The evidence in the record
supports the finding of the
board," although "it is a close
question," Flaherty said.
The judge also denied
Franklin's contention that the
charges against him were
overbroad and so vague as to
be unconstitutional. But he ag
reed Franklin was entitled to an
independent review of the Ad
visory Board's record.
Franklin recently received
tenure as an English professor
at Rutgers University. His case
has been supported by the
American Civil Liberties Un
ion.
Former Stanford Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin was properly
denied the protection of the
First Amendment's guarantee
of free speech and assembly
for his 1971 White Plaza speech
urging occupation of the
Computation Center, Santa
Clara County Superior Court
judge John Flaherty ruled yes
terday.
Franklin was contesting his
February, 1972, dismissal by
the Advisory Board, an elected
group of Stanford faculty. Its
conclusion was upheld by Pres
ident Richard Lyman and the
Board of Trustees by a 20-2
vote.
In an independent review of
the Advisory Board's record in
the case, Flaherty concluded
that the board had acted prop
erly when it determined
Franklin's First Amendment
rights were not protected.
In its opinion recommend
ing dismissal, the Advisory
Board cited Brandenberg v.

sion that "held to be punisha
ble, advocacy must be directed

nent lawless action, and . . .
likely to produce such action."
