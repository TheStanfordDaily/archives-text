# Amicus briefs filed to support Daily case

### Kurt Cobb 
Ten groups are filing friend-of-the
court briefs on behalf of The Stanford
Daily, in the case where the U.S. Sup
reme Court will decide on the constitu
tionality of searches of news-gathering
organizations by police. Daily lawyers
have already submitted their brief.
Amicus briefs will be filed by the Na
tional Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers and several news organiza
tions which include the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press,
the National Association of Broadcas
ters, the American Society of News
paper Editors, the Radio-TV News Di
rectors Association, the Student Press
Law Center, the National Newspaper
Association, the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, and the Society
of Professional journalists (Sigma Delta
Chi).
In their brief, Daily lawyers say
searches, such as the one that Palo Alto
police conducted at the Daily offices in
April 1971, are "needlessly destructive"
of First Amendment interests.
The brief explains, "Even where the
police are entitled to demand produc
tion of particular evidence from a
newspaper's files, a subpoena permits
the newspaper to locate and transmit
that evidence to the police.
"In contrast, a search exposes to

police scrutiny unrelated materials
which may be highly confidential and
sensitive, retained in a newspaper's of
fices and files. Whenever a subpoena
would be effective . . . such a breach of
privacy is unnecessary."
In 1972, Federal District Judge Robert
Peckham ruled in the case that police
should use the "least drastic means"
available when seeking evidence from
newspapers. The Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld Peckham's ruling in its
entirety last February.
The Daily brief goes on to say, "There
is no basis for a generalized suspicion
that newspapers will not obey the law
and produce that which is demanded.
If, in the exceptional case, the police
have reason to believe otherwise, they
must make that showing to the magis
trate; if the magistrate finds . . .thatthe
subpoena would be impractical, a
search warrant may issue."
Seventeen states and the National
District Attorneys Association (NDAA)
also filed friend-of-the-court briefs.
They, however, are asking the high
court to overturn the lower court rul
ings. The NDAA said in its brief that
Peckham's ruling will mean "the de
mise of the search warrant as an effec
tive instrument in the enforcement of
criminal law."

The city of Palo Alto, a defendant in
the case along with Santa Clara County,
said in its brief asking the Supreme
Court to hear the case that the deci
sions "will cut back severely the in
stances in which a warrant may be
employed in 'non-suspect' situations"
and will result in an "unprecedented
extension of the Fourth Amendment's
probable cause language ... in all war
rant contexts."
Daily lawyers, however, argued in
their response opposing any review of
the case that the district court "ex
pressly refused in this very case to ex
tend its ruling beyond the immediate
context of a newspaper search."
The search of Daily offices was the
first time that police executed a search
warrant against a news organization.
Since then there have been several
searches at other newspapers and at
some radio and television stations.
Only last month the Marin County
district attorney obtained a search war
rant to be served on four area television
stations which had videotaped a Dec.
12 riot in Sausalito. The stations in
cluded KRON, KCO, KPIX and KTVU.
The Supreme Court will hear oral ar
guments on the Daily case lan. 17 and
render a decision sometime in the next
few months.
