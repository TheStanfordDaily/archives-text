# Brodie on football, sports-casting and life
## 
### 
For the last fifth of a century,
football fans have watched
John Brodie's remarkable
gridiron performances. A na
tive of Oakland, Brodie was an
Ail-American and the number
one National Football League
draft choice in 1957. His 17 sea
sons as an active player, the
fourth longest career in pro
football history, were all spent
as quarterback at the helm of
the San Francisco 49ers.
Brodie has left an impressive
mark on the football records
books. In 1970, for example, he
led the NFL in yards gained
passing with 2941; Roger
Staubach led next year having
gained about 1100 fewer yards.
Brodie ranks second only to
Johnny Unitas in most yards
gained in a lifetime; and
whereas Unitas' greatest sea
sons were hisfirst eight, during
which he had the legendary
Baltimore Colts supporting
him, Brodie's greatest seasons
were his last eight, and they
were achieved with teams
which, though good, could
never be ranked with the Colts.
Indeed, one sports expert has
remarked that the Brodie-led
49ers lacked only a man who
could kick the ball and a man
who could catch it. One year,
during a season John does not
regard as his best by any
means, Bruce Cossett kicked
the ball and Gene Washington
caught it and the 49ers won a
lot of games. Subsequently
voted the NFC Player of the
Year, Brodie characteristically
shrugged off the award as evi
dence of sportswriters' bias
towards winning teams.
Beyond his durability and
consistent excellence, how
ever, Brodie the player was
most memorable for the
charisma he displayed on the
field, and for the team person
ality he evoked from the 49ers,
regardless of the changing per
sonnel and coaches on their
roster. It is no secret that
Brodie was his own man on the
football field. He gave off an
aura of calculated recklessness
and enjoyment in the playing
of the game.
He was a daring quarterback
as well as a dangerous one. In
1971, for example, Brodie beat
the Detroit Lions with a quar
terback draw on the last play of
the season for a division title,
and then beat the Washington
Redskins in the playoff with a
third-and-one bomb to Gene
Washington for 77 yards and a
touchdown. And then there
was the notorious last game of
the 1972 regular season in
which Brodie, who had been
injured and out of action for
five weeks — "Is Brodie
Through for Good?" read the
uncharitable headlines —
came off the bench at the start
of the fourth quarter, with the
49ers trailing 17-6, and threw
on every play, 15 passes in 10
minutes, the first two for inter
ceptions, the last for a 20-17
victory and the division title.
Since his retirement from
football three years ago,
Brodie has, if anything, been
more active on both the na
tional and Peninsula scenes.
He sportscasted on a Bay Area
news program; he played pro
fessional golf for a year and
now plays in the U.S., British
and French Amateur tourneys
and the Crosby; his television
program "John Brodie's 49ers"
was aired during last year's
football season; this season he
was a color commentator cov
ering both football and golf for
NBC. In fact, with the retreat of
Don Meredith to ABC, Brodie
has ascended to the throne and
sits at the right hand of Curt
Gowdy, dean of American
sportscasters. In addition,
Brodie acts as president of
Narconon Palo Alto, a drug
abuse rehabilitation program.
Curiously, no one has asked
John Brodie about these di

verse activities in relation to
each other — in other words,
what the life of John Brodie,
ex-football star, is like as a
whole. At his home near Stan
ford recently, I had a chance to
discuss with Brodie his reasons
for retiring from football; his
thoughts about the game, its
rationale, and its detractors;
his ideas on sportscasting; and
his involvement with Narco
non. I found him uniquely
frank and outspoken, and in
possession of a quick sense of
humor.
When I arrived at Brodie's
house, a photographer
was taking Brodie's picture for
the cover of a local magazine —
or trying to take it, as it seemed
that a hundred previous shots
had gone awry. Desperate for a
prop, the photographer
reached into his equipment
bag and pulled out a cheap
football — not the sleek NFL
variety, but an off-color rubber
version with white plastic
laces.
"Could you hold this,"
asked the photographer, "just
for the picture?" "That's some
thing I used to do," Brodie re
plied in an even tone which
permitted no debate. "And
how would I hold it?" he con
tinued, still not touching the
football but making his hands
go ludicrously awkward and
feeble while lighting a
Marlboro.
Next the photographer pul
led a microphone from the
bag. Brodie seized it with a grin
and the photographer rushed
to his tripoded Rolleiflex and
focused. Suddenly Brodie
stuck the microphone in his
ear and grimaced. Click!
Brodie and the photographer
laughed. Brodie then stuck the
microphone in his mouth.
Click again! "There's our
cover!" cried Brodie and the
photographer together. Brodie
threw back his head and
laughed. At that, a third click
caught Brodie off guard. The
photographer looked happy.
He packed up and left.
I knew that on October 25,
1973 Brodie had announced
that he would retire from pro
fessional football at the sea
son's end.ln the three seasons
previous he had led the 49ers
to three successive NFL west
ern division titles. While an
nouncing his retirement, he
had noted that he felt his phys
ical skills remained undi
minished. With that in mind, I
asked him why he had decided
to retire.
"I had evolved into a posi
tion where I was ready toquit,"
he answered. "You know, it
was like the end of the cycle
and the things that made it so
exciting to me were gone. My
priorities had changed." Foot
ball is great. I love to play the
game itself, but the rest of it
was not that stimulating. And
in order to put all that effort
into the playing of one game,
you have to be excited about
what you're doing on the prac
tice field also. And I just didn't
have that much enthusiasm. As
a result I didn't play as well. It's
the many things that you do
from Monday to Saturday that
really get you to play on Sun
day. And there were a lot of
little things that weren't going
exactly how I wanted them to
g°-
"There was no one problem
or single turning point. It was
like I woke up for a month solid
not being very interested in
playing. The whole program —
the way we were going as a ball
club — the way it was being
handled — everything — dis
satisfied me
"In midseason I mentioned
these things to head coach
Dick Nolan, letting it be known
that in my opinion we weren't
playing the sort of offense that
we should be playing. My point
was we needed to adjust, we

weren't doing the things we
should be doing, and that
whether it was me or other fac
tors we ought to change. I
added that if they disagreed
with me on that point then
there was nowhere for me to
go: I'd be more effective not
playing."
I wondered if Brodie had had
an inkling that a broadcasting
career was in his immediate fu
ture.
"I wasn't sure," he replied.
"I hadn't been approached.
Then Curt Gowdy was out here
for the final game of the '73
season, and after an interview
he said, "Hey, did you ever
think of broadcasting?" I said
"No, but pursue it, if you like,
I'd be happy to give it a go." A
month or two later I was signed
with NBC. And I loved it. With
out realizing it, I did have an
edge because I had prepared
myself for my new job through
playing. It was a beautiful
evolvement because an analyst
has to know something about
what he's discussing. That's
why the guy is paid."
"What about Chris
Schenkle?" I asked, raising the
archetypal example of sports
announcer with a minimal
knowledge of sports.
"Well," said Brodie, "I give
everyone their own opinion.
He's not an analyst; he's a
broadcaster. There's a real dif
ference between play-by-play
callers and analysts. One is
very articulate and under
stands the game of broadcast
ing. The other knows the game
of football. We are trying to
close the gap, presenting what
we know so people under
stand more and get it straight."
I was curious about whether
Brodie ever felt that broadcas
ters, the public or the press
looked down on him as a
sportscaster or analyst because
he was a "jock."
"That's something I never
really cared about," he said. "I
would of course prefer they
like me. To the degree that
they look down upon me be
cause of an inability to articu
late what's going on on the
field, then I think they are very
justified in their viewpoint.
That can be a bit subjective,
you know. To the degree that
they think I got into sportscast
ing without paying my dues —
that's bullshit. That's generally
an expression of jealousy —
what is needed is somebody
who knows the game of foot
ball. Until you have played it,
you don't really know it. You
can know something about a
subject theoretically or
philosophically but if you ha
ven't done it, you don't know if
your theory or philosophy is
applicable. You don't know
what the hell is going on,
necessarily.
"In addition, before people
are ready to listen, they have to
be convinced that the speaker

can actually do what he is talk
ing about. That adds credibil
ity. Now if the man can also
articulate what he's looking at
and what he knows, he is easily
received and it's acceptable to
the people at home. Networks
overlooked this for a long time.
They were very slow coming to
it. But now they are all coming
to it because they are finding
out in order to be able to do it,
you have to know what it is
you're doing, and if you do
know what it is you're doing,
you can express it so the de
ntist at home understands it. I
think it's been a real upgrading
of professional broadcasting."
I agreed with Brodie and
wondered if his development
has changed the public's opin
ion of athletes' intelligence.
"I feel there are different
types of intelligence," he re
plied, "and they apply to diffe
rent subjects. But I think that
one does not know any subject
until he can go out and apply
his viewpoint and see it work.
Sport is a good example of that.
There are some guys who just
can't run fast, right? You'll find
a lot of times fellows with the
least physical attributes are
understading the game very
well and could probably catch
up to people who have the
physical advantage. So they
find every nook and cranny
they know and they often end
up knowing the game. Then
gain, there are running backs
with great speed who do a
superb job because of their
natural gifts, but that doesn't
mean they don't understand
the game itself. Now when you
talk about football, we quar
terbacks have been in the posi
tion to look at the overall pic
ture of a game, at all 22 players
on the field."
Did he feel he understood
defense as well as he did of
fense, I asked.
"I don't know if I can play it,"
he said, "but I can see some
one and tell you whether I can
beat their playing of defense.
As you play offense you have to
understand every offensive
and defensive player's respon
sibilities and whether they are
quick enough to carry out their
assignments. There are
numerous details: I see it as a
whole big picture. It's very im
portant, for example, that you
know on every specific de
fense what each individual is
assigned to do, because if you
don't, on a broadcast you're
going to blame the wrong guy.
Then you've done a discredit to
yourself, the guy you're calling
responsible, and the whole
telecast."
Remembering that for 10
months Brodie did the sports
news locally in addition to his
national commentaries for
NBC, I wondered how he
found that experience.
"That was a bummer," he re
called. "I did it for two
reasons; I wanted to learn the
inner workings of a television
station in a context I figured
couldn't hurt me. Secondly, I
had the time, enjoyed broad
casting, and felt intelligent
sports commentary could be
put into an entertainment spot.
The idea was fine with NBC.
They felt it would be a good
experience in front of the cam
era. Unfortunately I found out
my opinions were irrelevant
because you can't speak your
mind on the news. You know,
it made the five-thirty news a
little heavy.
"For the first month or so, I
was doing a commentary at
eleven o'clock, but that didn't
really work out because I was
looking for things to discuss
rather than having things to
say. If you're working to say
something all the time, it gets
kind of leaden. Sometimes
there's something to discuss
and sometimes there isn't.
"I also discovered that the
structure of newsbroadcasts —

their time restrictions and
methods of preparation — is
such that you really can't get
into anything. I didn't want to
use cue cards but without them
they couldn't segment what I
had to say into a certain time
frame to keep a clean con
tinuity in their show. So it af
fected the way they ran the
show. The whole thing was just
not something that I enjoyed
doing. I am not a reader. If I
know something about it, I'll
tell you. If I don't. .
Before leaving the subject of
sportscasting, I couldn't resist
asking Brodie's opinion of
Howard Cosell.
"Well," he answered, "I
think Howard knows more
about where games were
played, who won, and what the
numbers on the back of each
ballplayer were than anybody,
and he knows less about what's
actually going on during the
contest than any broadcaster
I've ever heard. His intention is
not to enhance sport, it's to
enhance Howard. I find some
of his qualities a bit repulsive,
and he knows that, and he
wants to be. He doesn't under
stand what athletes do to
achieve their level of perfor
mance. He doesn't understand
the doingness involved. You
always feel a condescension.
"He never makes an unli
mited statement, never a
"great" or a "beautiful," only
an explanation of the beauty or
an 'if he only would. . .' To me
that's not what the game is ab
out. Howard wants to limit
athletes. He wants to
categorize. Howard's intention
is to stick everyone in a card
catalogue, and if there is one
thing I can't stand it's being
catalogued.
"Now, any man with his wits
about him can defeat Howard,
if Howard would give you
ample time. But if he owns that
mike, he ends up losing but
nobody knows it. There is no
finality to Howard's defeat in
the conversation, since How
ard cannot acknowledge any
body. I don't have anything
personal against him, but I do
have a whole lot against what
he projects."
Mention of Cosell brought
to mind Don Meredith,
Cosell's announcing partner
on ABC, and a quarterback
who had frequently opposed
Brodie and who was his
longtime friend. Brodie recal
led that he and Meredith were
once in the office of Pete
Rozelle, Commissioner of the
National Football League,
when they noticed that over
Rozelle's desk was a huge
photograph, elaborately
framed, of the Commissioner
posing beside a large fish he
had caught. Seeing the two
quarterbacks looking at the
picture, Rozelle began boast
ing about the fish's weight.
"Tell me, Commissioner," in
terrupted Meredith, "when
you weighed the fish did you
weigh the frame too?"
I had seen Brodie quoted as
not subscribing to the usual
concept of "winners" and
"losers." I asked how this
philosophy jived with the raw
competitiveness of football.
"By the time someone gets
to the level of professional
football," Brodie said, "it is the
most highly competitive busi
ness in the world. Find me one
equally competitive, find me
one with more candidates for
one spot with competition
starting in the ninth grade and
in some states in the fifth and
sixth.
"I started when I was a
sophomore in high school, and
I really was never much of a
02football player. I played bas
ketball, baseball, tennis, golf
— everything except. I played
football because my junior
high coach said I could be a
first-stringer. So I watched the
team play once and said I think
I could do this OK. So I played
quarterback. I never really en
joyed it until I got to college
and I didn't get a scholarship
there.l was the sixth-string
quarterback at that time, in my
freshman year.
"And I watched those
players and thought I could
play better than they could, so I
continued. Stanford athletic
director Chuck Taylor was the
greatest thing that ever hap
pened to me. He gave me a
chance to start when I was a
sophomore and I went right on
through. But hell, I was
second-string in the middle of
my junior year.Then I started
playing good about the middle
of that, and then I was OK."
Knowing that Brodie had
gone through the competitive
gauntlet, playing professional
football for 17 years and play
ing football at various levels for
25 straight years, I was curious
what his notion of "winning"
and "losing" was.
"Vince Lombardi," he said,
"is credited with saying 'Win
ning isn't everything — it's the
only thing,' but he actually
said, 'Winning isn't everything
— but putting forth the effort
to win is.' And that's what I
consider 'winning.' It's not
even how you play the game,
it's that you play it. Anybody
that plays and has all of his at
tention composed toward
winning, to me is a winner, is
somebody playing the game.
And that's all that could be
asked, because there are so
few that do.
"I think most of the fellows
connected with football are
'winners' throughout life. I'm
not saying that they are all the
same but I do say that if each of
them took, would apply, the
same ability to whatever they
do outside football as they do
in it, they would continue
'winning.' But sometimes it
doesn't work that way, and the
effect of the game itself takes a
toll on several of them. In other
words, football is the greatest
game in the world to play when
you're on the field. All of your
attention is on one game, you
know the outcome in a short
period of time — it's not like
the business world, it's not like
marriage, it's not likeany other
dynamic in life. It's a game
whereby I said to an opponent,
'Good — there are two of us
playing and one of us will win.'
The affinity opposing players
have for each other is based on
their willingness to have a go at
it. Most of the players don't
feel that because one will win
the other is a loser. Rather they
think 'There is something here
for one to win, and I am willing
to have a go at that.' This is a
very healthy viewpoint to have
if you're in life.
"Most of the players share
that viewpoint, but when one
team wins, the press claims
there are 26 losing players.
That's the biggest objective
that the players have to the
press. The press labels all of
them 'losers.' And they don't
relate to themselves as losers,
since they had to beat 10 guys
out to get the position they
have on the 26th best team in
the league.
"And that's a winner, right?
In order to do any kind of job,
you have to put an awful lot of
work into what you do in order
to do it effectively. And I think
people should be given credit
for it, rather than invalidated
because of everything they do
that doesn't happen to mea
sure up to another participant
who may be three levels ahead
of them.
"Understand, I didn't like
losing. I got so mad I couldn't
see for about 20 minutes after
the game. But if Iplayed as hard
as I could that was it, the game
was over. So I gave credit to the
other club — for every good
player on my side, there was

another on the other side, try
ing to keep me from what I in
tended to do.
"Personally, and within my
own team, for 17 years there
was always an expectation that
some guy was going to beat me
out. I never got derailed by
that. I kept in mind that foot
ball was fun, I wanted to play,
and I was going to play as hard
as I could. I've always been
competitive; I am today. But
after 1970 I was better able to
state to others and myself how
I actually regarded competi
tion.
"Have you ever seen what a
football looks like? It's not
round, and it doesn't bounce
the same way all the time. You
go with the way it works. And if
you don't have the emotional
stability to do that, you can be
overcome by the way it
bounced. And you stand there
trying to figure it out all the
time. Then you go absolutely
nuts — and I can show you 50
coaches that all ought to be in
the rubber room. In contrast,
you'll always find the great
players get highly involved but
aren't totally intense.
"You play it as good as you
can play it, and if you don't
mind getting hit, when you do,
you can laugh. When you're in
j a football
J game playing,
iJSSv it's fun. But
> "itaf l j?- God, the
coaches, they
(fc « et all em °-
// , tionally upset
— THINK
THINK THINK
— that's not so
good."
Although he played his en
tire professional career with
one team, Brodie played under
many coaches. I wanted to
know how he interacted with
coaches, who of course have
differing personalities and
theories, during a fast-moving
contest.
"This is the game," he
answered. "If you understand
that knowing is far superior to
thinking, then you can take
whatever thought is given to
you and apply it if it is applica
ble. If it isn't you must be wil
ling to take the responsibility
to ignore it. There are very few
coaches who assume respon
sibility for a loss. If you tie or
lose, you didn't do what they
asked you to do. If you win,
that's great, you did just what
they said. Well pretty soon you
have to realize a quarterback
has the responsibility to win,
because if you don't win you're
not doing what the coach said.
"For all these reasons, emo
tional stability is the primary
quality for a quarterback. Fran
Tarkenton calls it arrogance.
Some guys call it bullheaded
ness. Whatever else it is, it's
knowing that you know what
you're doing, being able to
have people say what they like
and you knowing it mayor may
not be true, and being able to
handle all of that. My pleasure
was to maintain my composure
in the midst of violence to the
pointwhere I could actually get
something productive out of
what we were all doing. And I
like that. And it's fun.
"When you have to win, it
makes it very hard to get it.
When you can't lose, you're
going to lose. You have to go
play it. You have to be willing
to win or lose, then you can
play as good as you can play,
then you can get an accurate
indication of whether or not
you can play. The greatest qual
ity in life is being able to con
front. Athletics is a gem of pure
confrontation, and if people
couid apply the same quality to
other areas of their lives,
there'd be very few problems.
"I find that athletes' fun level
as people is pretty high: on a
scale of death to existence, you
find them around 'enthusiastic
antagonist.' That's a pretty high
level of being and that's fun.
Athletes call one another any
thing they want and then are
willing to laugh at it or protect
it. There's no covert nonsense.
That's the worst quality in man
— to hide; this covert action
against one another."
In this context, I reminded
Brodie of the criticism that
football is a warlike game
which excites the hostilities of
participant and spectatoralike.
"People who attack football
as a game of violence," he said,
"are typically those who at one
level of experience are totally
nonparticipators and on
another level a bit aesthetic.
They say, 'It's philosophically
wrong to hurt anybody.' What
they really object to is the overt
action which threatens their
covert defenses. It threatens
their beingness: 'You mean
someone is really going to
come out and call another per
son a no good SOB and do
something about it? Oh my
God, I'm being found out!'
"I believe you can be a very
sensitive man and be ex
tremely tough. You can have a
great affinity for people and yet
not let anybody run over the
top of you. It's being able to
differentiate where someone is
actually coming from. Ifthisisa
low level of living, it is living
and very few people are in a
living condition. Many are in a
dying condition. If you ever
see someone who doesn't do
anything — everything he does
is preparing for old age — pre
paringtodie — he's intodying.
This is into living. It is a rela
tively low level of living — but a
highly active level. Action is
very high on the living scale in
terms of productivity, experi
ence, ability, and openness."
Obviously as president of
Narconon Palo Alto
Brodie is interested in re
habilitating drug addicts. But I
wanted to know more pre
cisely what his relation to Nar
conon was.
"I got some money together,
found a program and brought
it to Palo Aito," he responded.
"We spent about $170,000
creating a product by which a
lot of people could get better.
About 300 people have been
through the program and of
that number roughly 200 defi
nitely gained, some of them
greatly. Then we went out and
got the city to fund it. I really
don't act as a fund-raiser now
because the program is work
ing just fine. I've been involved
with the program and I wanted
to make sure it got to where it
was working because I knew
the value of it."
Brodie is affiliated with the
Church of Scientology. Be
cause there is much confusion
as to the extent to which Scien
tology and Narconon are con
nected, I asked if he felt in
helping people, he was giving
them a religion as well.
"Oh no," he answered.
"Scientology and Narconon
are totally different. The pur
pose of Scientology is very
simply to allow a man to know
more about himself, to know
how to know more about his
fellow man and to be more
productive in life. It's that sim
ple.
"The funny thing is that the
purpose of Narconon is totally
different from that of Scientol
ogy. Narconon's purpose is to
get one into a productive state
so that one is no longer a para
site of society — productive for
oneself and others, not a bur
den on the police force and
medical profession, and actu
ally independent— a regaining
of self-respect. That's the only
purpose. We have borrowed
some of the very primitive first
steps in Scientology, simply a
little communication stuff.
After all, they damn well skip
ped those skills in education.
We're trying to pick the guy up.

We actually care about him.
"We don't stand up and say
'You should be responsible,'
treating drug abusers as
'wrong.' We show them how
important it is for man to take
responsibility for himself. All
Scientology does for Narconon
is allow them to use some of its
technology.
"I hope I've given you the
difference between Scientol
ogy and its purpose, which
deals with the whole spectrum
of life, and Narconon, which
offers a social service to take a
drug abuser out of the condi
tion he's in and get him back
into the game of life, at which
time he can go to Scientology
or any damn thing he wants.
Our purpose is to get him off
the anti-survival kick, trying to
do himself in.
"Many of our most vocal cri
tics, incidentally, were mem
bers of the local psychiatric
community. Some are very
able. I wish to hell they would
find a subject that could actu
ally do something for some
one. They like to assume that
nobody knows anything. This
is untrue. People know some
thing abbut how to handle
drug abuse problems and that
was my primary concern, hand
ling them, not spinning out
subjects for further research.
"We know how to detoxify
somebody in 72 hours, rela
tively without pain. Now that's
been the biggest hangup for
dope users in the history of
abuse. Coming off is such a
downer, because you are deal
ing with people who are into
making you pay for being a
drug user. It's like getting
even: 'That's the way it goes;
you got to pay your dues.'
Well, we know the poor guys
are about ready to die. So we
detoxify them properly: mix

"I also avoid legal and phar
macological hair-splitting as to
the definition of a drug.' I do
say that they all have qualities
that can affect the system. To
the degree that the being can
not handle them, and becomes
the effect of them — and that
will vary witheach individual —
then he is not in good shape.
You can compound that whole
game but it is a very simple
game; when the being be
comes the effect of the drug
the being needs rehabilita
tion.
"I myself took pain-killers,"
Brodie continued, "little green
beauties called dexamyls; and I
drank too much to come down
from the dexamyl. But there
was a basic distinction. I was
taking a drug so that I could go
out and perform at the level of
play I deemed important.
Pretty soon I became more de
pendent on that drug to handle
the mental aspect of my par
ticipation than the physical as
pect. And I started losing my
self confidence. I never got
hooked on anything. My pur
pose was to take enough so
that I could go play. Then I
found that I could get rid of
some of these pains and I could
play without the drugs. But in
the meantime I discovered that
I had lost a lot of my confi
dence, and that was the worst
part of all. I got into a bad cycle,
but the problem was never so
big that it was bigger than what
I was doing. I never took any
mind-expanding or illegal
drugs. I took drugs on pre
scription. But as I say this isn't a
problem of rules. Prescription
or not, they had an effect on
my life and livingness. Because
it's legal doesn't make it right. I
will respect the law, but I don't
have to agree with it, and I
know the effect of a drug has
nothing to do with a law. So at
Narconon we're not dealing
with the law when we're deal
ing with drugs — we're dealing
with people."
