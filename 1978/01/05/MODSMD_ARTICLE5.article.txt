# Brodie on football, sports-casting and life
## 
### 
For the last fifth of a century,
football fans have watched
John Brodie's remarkable
gridiron performances. A na
tive of Oakland, Brodie was an
Ail-American and the number
one National Football League
draft choice in 1957. His 17 sea
sons as an active player, the
fourth longest career in pro
football history, were all spent
as quarterback at the helm of
the San Francisco 49ers.
Brodie has left an impressive
mark on the football records
books. In 1970, for example, he
led the NFL in yards gained
passing with 2941; Roger
Staubach led next year having
gained about 1100 fewer yards.
Brodie ranks second only to
Johnny Unitas in most yards
gained in a lifetime; and
whereas Unitas' greatest sea
sons were hisfirst eight, during
which he had the legendary
Baltimore Colts supporting
him, Brodie's greatest seasons
were his last eight, and they
were achieved with teams
which, though good, could
never be ranked with the Colts.
Indeed, one sports expert has
remarked that the Brodie-led
49ers lacked only a man who
could kick the ball and a man
who could catch it. One year,
during a season John does not
regard as his best by any
means, Bruce Cossett kicked
the ball and Gene Washington
caught it and the 49ers won a
lot of games. Subsequently
voted the NFC Player of the
Year, Brodie characteristically
shrugged off the award as evi
dence of sportswriters' bias
towards winning teams.
Beyond his durability and
consistent excellence, how
ever, Brodie the player was
most memorable for the
charisma he displayed on the
field, and for the team person
ality he evoked from the 49ers,
regardless of the changing per
sonnel and coaches on their
roster. It is no secret that
Brodie was his own man on the
football field. He gave off an
aura of calculated recklessness
and enjoyment in the playing
of the game.
He was a daring quarterback
as well as a dangerous one. In
1971, for example, Brodie beat
the Detroit Lions with a quar
terback draw on the last play of
the season for a division title,
and then beat the Washington
Redskins in the playoff with a
third-and-one bomb to Gene
Washington for 77 yards and a
touchdown. And then there
was the notorious last game of
the 1972 regular season in
which Brodie, who had been
injured and out of action for
five weeks — "Is Brodie
Through for Good?" read the
uncharitable headlines —
came off the bench at the start
of the fourth quarter, with the
49ers trailing 17-6, and threw
on every play, 15 passes in 10
minutes, the first two for inter
ceptions, the last for a 20-17
victory and the division title.
Since his retirement from
football three years ago,
Brodie has, if anything, been
more active on both the na
tional and Peninsula scenes.
He sportscasted on a Bay Area
news program; he played pro
fessional golf for a year and
now plays in the U.S., British
and French Amateur tourneys
and the Crosby; his television
program "John Brodie's 49ers"
was aired during last year's
football season; this season he
was a color commentator cov
ering both football and golf for
NBC. In fact, with the retreat of
Don Meredith to ABC, Brodie
has ascended to the throne and
sits at the right hand of Curt
Gowdy, dean of American
sportscasters. In addition,
Brodie acts as president of
Narconon Palo Alto, a drug
abuse rehabilitation program.
Curiously, no one has asked
John Brodie about these di

verse activities in relation to
each other — in other words,
what the life of John Brodie,
ex-football star, is like as a
whole. At his home near Stan
ford recently, I had a chance to
discuss with Brodie his reasons
for retiring from football; his
thoughts about the game, its
rationale, and its detractors;
his ideas on sportscasting; and
his involvement with Narco
non. I found him uniquely
frank and outspoken, and in
possession of a quick sense of
humor.
When I arrived at Brodie's
house, a photographer
was taking Brodie's picture for
the cover of a local magazine —
or trying to take it, as it seemed
that a hundred previous shots
had gone awry. Desperate for a
prop, the photographer
reached into his equipment
bag and pulled out a cheap
football — not the sleek NFL
variety, but an off-color rubber
version with white plastic
laces.
"Could you hold this,"
asked the photographer, "just
for the picture?" "That's some
thing I used to do," Brodie re
plied in an even tone which
permitted no debate. "And
how would I hold it?" he con
tinued, still not touching the
football but making his hands
go ludicrously awkward and
feeble while lighting a
Marlboro.
Next the photographer pul
led a microphone from the
bag. Brodie seized it with a grin
and the photographer rushed
to his tripoded Rolleiflex and
focused. Suddenly Brodie
stuck the microphone in his
ear and grimaced. Click!
Brodie and the photographer
laughed. Brodie then stuck the
microphone in his mouth.
Click again! "There's our
cover!" cried Brodie and the
photographer together. Brodie
threw back his head and
laughed. At that, a third click
caught Brodie off guard. The
photographer looked happy.
He packed up and left.
I knew that on October 25,
1973 Brodie had announced
that he would retire from pro
fessional football at the sea
son's end.ln the three seasons
previous he had led the 49ers
to three successive NFL west
ern division titles. While an
nouncing his retirement, he
had noted that he felt his phys
ical skills remained undi
minished. With that in mind, I
asked him why he had decided
to retire.
"I had evolved into a posi
tion where I was ready toquit,"
he answered. "You know, it
was like the end of the cycle
and the things that made it so
exciting to me were gone. My
priorities had changed." Foot
ball is great. I love to play the
game itself, but the rest of it
was not that stimulating. And
in order to put all that effort
into the playing of one game,
you have to be excited about
what you're doing on the prac
tice field also. And I just didn't
have that much enthusiasm. As
a result I didn't play as well. It's
the many things that you do
from Monday to Saturday that
really get you to play on Sun
day. And there were a lot of
little things that weren't going
exactly how I wanted them to
g°-
"There was no one problem
or single turning point. It was
like I woke up for a month solid
not being very interested in
playing. The whole program —
the way we were going as a ball
club — the way it was being
handled — everything — dis
satisfied me
"In midseason I mentioned
these things to head coach
Dick Nolan, letting it be known
that in my opinion we weren't
playing the sort of offense that
we should be playing. My point
was we needed to adjust, we

weren't doing the things we
should be doing, and that
whether it was me or other fac
tors we ought to change. I
added that if they disagreed
with me on that point then
there was nowhere for me to
go: I'd be more effective not
playing."
I wondered if Brodie had had
an inkling that a broadcasting
career was in his immediate fu
ture.
"I wasn't sure," he replied.
"I hadn't been approached.
Then Curt Gowdy was out here
for the final game of the '73
season, and after an interview
he said, "Hey, did you ever
think of broadcasting?" I said
"No, but pursue it, if you like,
I'd be happy to give it a go." A
month or two later I was signed
with NBC. And I loved it. With
out realizing it, I did have an
edge because I had prepared
myself for my new job through
playing. It was a beautiful
evolvement because an analyst
has to know something about
what he's discussing. That's
why the guy is paid."
"What about Chris
Schenkle?" I asked, raising the
archetypal example of sports
announcer with a minimal
knowledge of sports.
"Well," said Brodie, "I give
everyone their own opinion.
He's not an analyst; he's a
broadcaster. There's a real dif
ference between play-by-play
callers and analysts. One is
very articulate and under
stands the game of broadcast
ing. The other knows the game
of football. We are trying to
close the gap, presenting what
we know so people under
stand more and get it straight."
I was curious about whether
Brodie ever felt that broadcas
ters, the public or the press
looked down on him as a
sportscaster or analyst because
he was a "jock."
"That's something I never
really cared about," he said. "I
would of course prefer they
like me. To the degree that
they look down upon me be
cause of an inability to articu
late what's going on on the
field, then I think they are very
justified in their viewpoint.
That can be a bit subjective,
you know. To the degree that
they think I got into sportscast
ing without paying my dues —
that's bullshit. That's generally
an expression of jealousy —
what is needed is somebody
who knows the game of foot
ball. Until you have played it,
you don't really know it. You
can know something about a
subject theoretically or
philosophically but if you ha
ven't done it, you don't know if
your theory or philosophy is
applicable. You don't know
what the hell is going on,
necessarily.
"In addition, before people
are ready to listen, they have to
be convinced that the speaker

can actually do what he is talk
ing about. That adds credibil
ity. Now if the man can also
articulate what he's looking at
and what he knows, he is easily
received and it's acceptable to
the people at home. Networks
overlooked this for a long time.
They were very slow coming to
it. But now they are all coming
to it because they are finding
out in order to be able to do it,
you have to know what it is
you're doing, and if you do
know what it is you're doing,
you can express it so the de
ntist at home understands it. I
think it's been a real upgrading
of professional broadcasting."
I agreed with Brodie and
wondered if his development
has changed the public's opin
ion of athletes' intelligence.
"I feel there are different
types of intelligence," he re
plied, "and they apply to diffe
rent subjects. But I think that
one does not know any subject
until he can go out and apply
his viewpoint and see it work.
Sport is a good example of that.
There are some guys who just
can't run fast, right? You'll find
a lot of times fellows with the
least physical attributes are
understading the game very
well and could probably catch
up to people who have the
physical advantage. So they
find every nook and cranny
they know and they often end
up knowing the game. Then
gain, there are running backs
with great speed who do a
superb job because of their
natural gifts, but that doesn't
mean they don't understand
the game itself. Now when you
talk about football, we quar
terbacks have been in the posi
tion to look at the overall pic
ture of a game, at all 22 players
on the field."
Did he feel he understood
defense as well as he did of
fense, I asked.
"I don't know if I can play it,"
he said, "but I can see some
one and tell you whether I can
beat their playing of defense.
As you play offense you have to
understand every offensive
and defensive player's respon
sibilities and whether they are
quick enough to carry out their
assignments. There are
numerous details: I see it as a
whole big picture. It's very im
portant, for example, that you
know on every specific de
fense what each individual is
assigned to do, because if you
don't, on a broadcast you're
going to blame the wrong guy.
Then you've done a discredit to
yourself, the guy you're calling
responsible, and the whole
telecast."
Remembering that for 10
months Brodie did the sports
news locally in addition to his
national commentaries for
NBC, I wondered how he
found that experience.
"That was a bummer," he re
called. "I did it for two
reasons; I wanted to learn the
inner workings of a television
station in a context I figured
couldn't hurt me. Secondly, I
had the time, enjoyed broad
casting, and felt intelligent
sports commentary could be
put into an entertainment spot.
The idea was fine with NBC.
They felt it would be a good
experience in front of the cam
era. Unfortunately I found out
my opinions were irrelevant
because you can't speak your
mind on the news. You know,
it made the five-thirty news a
little heavy.
"For the first month or so, I
was doing a commentary at
eleven o'clock, but that didn't
really work out because I was
looking for things to discuss
rather than having things to
say. If you're working to say
something all the time, it gets
kind of leaden. Sometimes
there's something to discuss
and sometimes there isn't.
"I also discovered that the
structure of newsbroadcasts —

their time restrictions and
methods of preparation — is
such that you really can't get
into anything. I didn't want to
use cue cards but without them
they couldn't segment what I
had to say into a certain time
frame to keep a clean con
tinuity in their show. So it af
fected the way they ran the
show. The whole thing was just
not something that I enjoyed
doing. I am not a reader. If I
know something about it, I'll
tell you. If I don't. .
Before leaving the subject of
sportscasting, I couldn't resist
asking Brodie's opinion of
Howard Cosell.
"Well," he answered, "I
think Howard knows more
about where games were
played, who won, and what the
numbers on the back of each
ballplayer were than anybody,
and he knows less about what's
actually going on during the
contest than any broadcaster
I've ever heard. His intention is
not to enhance sport, it's to
enhance Howard. I find some
of his qualities a bit repulsive,
and he knows that, and he
wants to be. He doesn't under
stand what athletes do to
achieve their level of perfor
mance. He doesn't understand
the doingness involved. You
always feel a condescension.
"He never makes an unli
mited statement, never a
"great" or a "beautiful," only
an explanation of the beauty or
an 'if he only would. . .' To me
that's not what the game is ab
out. Howard wants to limit
athletes. He wants to
categorize. Howard's intention
is to stick everyone in a card
catalogue, and if there is one
thing I can't stand it's being
catalogued.
"Now, any man with his wits
about him can defeat Howard,
if Howard would give you
ample time. But if he owns that
mike, he ends up losing but
nobody knows it. There is no
finality to Howard's defeat in
the conversation, since How
ard cannot acknowledge any
body. I don't have anything
personal against him, but I do
have a whole lot against what
he projects."
Mention of Cosell brought
to mind Don Meredith,
Cosell's announcing partner
on ABC, and a quarterback
who had frequently opposed
Brodie and who was his
longtime friend. Brodie recal
led that he and Meredith were
once in the office of Pete
Rozelle, Commissioner of the
National Football League,
when they noticed that over
Rozelle's desk was a huge
photograph, elaborately
framed, of the Commissioner
posing beside a large fish he
had caught. Seeing the two
quarterbacks looking at the
picture, Rozelle began boast
ing about the fish's weight.
"Tell me, Commissioner," in
terrupted Meredith, "when
you weighed the fish did you
weigh the frame too?"
I had seen Brodie quoted as
not subscribing to the usual
concept of "winners" and
"losers." I asked how this
philosophy jived with the raw
competitiveness of football.
"By the time someone gets
to the level of professional
football," Brodie said, "it is the
most highly competitive busi
ness in the world. Find me one
equally competitive, find me
one with more candidates for
one spot with competition
starting in the ninth grade and
in some states in the fifth and
sixth.
"I started when I was a
sophomore in high school, and
I really was never much of a
02football player. I played bas
ketball, baseball, tennis, golf
— everything except. I played
football because my junior
high coach said I could be a
first-stringer. So I watched the
