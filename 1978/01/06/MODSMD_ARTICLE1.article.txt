# H. Bruce Franklin seeks new hearing

Former Stanford Assoc. English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin said yester
day he felt under-oath testimony
concerning the events leading to his
dismissal from the University needs
to be heard.
Franklin made his comments in a
telephone interview after Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge john
Flaherty handed down a ruling yes
terday in his case protesting the Feb
ruary 1972 dismissal.
Franklin was dismissed by the Ad
visory Board, an elected group of
Stanford faculty, after the body de
termined comments made by
Franklin in speeches in White Plaza,
at the computation center and in the
Old Union courtyard in 1971 were
"inciting or producing imminent law
less action, and . . . likely to produce
such action."
A Supreme Court decision in
Brandenberg v. Ohio had held that
only when advocacy was directed to
such an end is it punishable.
The Flaherty opinion said the Ad
visory Board had correctly invoked
the Brandenberg ruling in the White
Plaza and computation center
speeches, but not in the Old Union
speech.
The judge also denied Franklin's
contention that the charges against
him were overbroad and so vague as
to be unconstitutional.
Franklin said yesterday that the
issue of his job had overshadowed
his main points in the case, namely to
insure the "civil liberty (which)
people allegedly have to make un
popular political utterances" and to
bring to light improper actions by
Stanford University.
"If the First Amendment doesn't
protect speech offensive to the pow
ers that be, then it means nothing,"
Franklin said. "Non-offensive
speech needs no protection.
"If the White Plaza speech isn't
protected under the First Amend
ment, then I don't know what is," he

said.
In his White Plaza speech, Franklin
urged occupation of the Computa
tion Center. Franklin said yesterday
that plans for the invasion of South
east Asia were being developed at
the center when he called for the oc
cupation.
Franklin also charged yesterday
that the administration had "made a
decision to fire me before any of
these events happened. They were
just looking for a pretext."
Franklin said administration offi
cials, whom he would not name, told
the Advisory Board then that
"Franklin must be fired before he
makes full professor." The board, he
said, told the officials that, because
Franklin was tenured, a reason for
dismissal was needed.
But Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig yesterday
labeled the Franklin charge "abso
lute nonsense," adding "It's just not
