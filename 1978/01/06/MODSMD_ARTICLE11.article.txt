# Food taken for granted
## 
### Americans 
David Sartoris

Any reasonably perceptive Ameri
can citizen who happened to read
the Dec. 11 issue of Newsweek
should have recognized a powerful
hidden holiday message within its
pages. One feature story dealt with
the national farmer strike, which was
not expected to succeed due to exist
ing massive surpluses of agricultural
products. Its supporters sought an
increase in government crop support
payments by threatening to not only
halt production of food but destroy
rather than market it as well.
Meanwhile, the cover story in
volved what might aptly be termed
middle-and-upper class America's
greatest obsession: the diet craze.
Our country presently boasts 70 mill
ion overweight individuals. Heart
and blood vessel diseases, which
numerous studies have linked to
poor eating habits, currently claim
one million lives per year. By sum
marizing the multitude of means by
which Americans try to lose weight,
the article demonstrates that much
of our population wages a constant
battle against overnutrition.
Together, these two stories indi
rectly reveal the shameful state of

nutritional abundance that presently
exists in the United States. To the
average American, Christmas means
overindulgence in holiday culinary
delights, to be followed by compen
satory dieting as a New Year's resolu
tion. On the other hand, to millions
of less-fortunate human beings ac
ross the globe, Christmas means one
more day of hunger pains and im
poverished existence.
Economists and agricultural ex
perts have pointed out that the world
famine problem is one of distribu
tion rather than inadequate produc
tion. The human race is presently
capable of raising enough food for all
of its members, yet starvation and
accompanying disease run rampant
because of man's failure to make it
universally available.
Until this dilemma is resolved, the
average American tends to
rationalize his/her personal wasteful
tendencies by blaming a limitation
inherent in the system as a whole.
However, there are several ways for
the individual to contribute signific
antly toward alleviation of the world
hunger problem.
One of the most common disgust-

ing sights in our nation today are
trash cans laden with unfinished
meals and wasted groceries. This
represents money spent unnecessar
ily at restaurants and supermarkets,
which might otherwise have been
donated to charitable organizations
such as Care or Save the Children.
More prudent shopping and eating
would also be economically benefi
cial by decreasing demand, increas
ing supply, and tending to lower
food prices as a result.
As a second measure, growing
American children should be ex
posed to proper nutritional educa
tion both in the home and at school.
Emphasis on sensible eating habits
and discouragement of wastefulness
at an early age will result in a greater
concern and respect for the world
food problem by these individuals as
adults. Responsibility for implemen
tation of this proposal obviously
rests heavily upon local school sys
tems and especially parents.
Finally, to increase individual
awareness, participation in both or
ganized and self-initiated fasts might
be encouraged. Most Americans
have never subjectively experienced
true hunger, a feeling familiar to our
biological predecessors as well as
impoverished millions today.
Our society has become like the
bears in Yellowstone Park, spoiled to
the point where survival might not be
possible without the easy accessabil
ity of tourist handouts and discards.
The preceding remarks are not in
tended to condemn the American
way of life as much as the attitude
that accompanies it. Our forefathers
and ourselves have worked hard Â»o
achieve and preserve the good life
that we presently enjoy. However, it
is imperative that we not become ob
livious to the fact that our level of
prosperity belongs to only a minority
of Homo sapiens.
Food is a commodity which we
take far too much for granted; thus,
the message here is to ponder more
seriously the painful expression and
distended abdomen of the starving
child when next tempted to overin
dulge in or discard it.
