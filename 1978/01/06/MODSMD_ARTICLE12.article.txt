Coach Walsh
I would like to comment on the
recent speculation as to whether Bill
Walsh will remain as Stanford's head
football coach or leave to take a head
coaching job in the NFL. These
rumors have become commonplace
in the daily papers as of late.
Coach Walsh has been silent ex
cept to remark to the effect that it
would be hard to turn down an offer
to make one wealthy. He has alluded
to, presumably with a smile, a "Cod
father" type situation, that is, an
offer that he couldn't refuse.
Coach Walsh's actions would be
entirely understandable in this situa
tion if he were on a one-year contract
terminating at the end of this season.
He is not. He in fact was given an
extension by Athletic Director )oe
Ruetz on his existing three-year con
tract.

By signing the original pact, Walsh
in essence was committing himself to
the Stanford program where his pre
sence was/is needed and ap
preciated. Stanford gave him the op
portunity that had evaded him up
until this year, to head coach. He did
a good job, but the job is not over.
Walsh has signed a contract, a un
ilateral one as any athletic director
will concede, and he should feel ob
ligated to honor it. Anything less

could of course be termed dishonor
able. If Coach Walsh is as capable
and talented as he has proven this
year, the professional big-money
jobs will always be there. Walsh's re
luctance to dispel the many rumors
I are causing Stanford followers to
wonder.
