## ASSU Council of Presidents comment on tuition, room and board increase to trustees 
### 
Following is a statement to the Board of Trustees on the
proposed tuition and room and board increases, presented bv
Greq Larson of the ASSU Council of Presidents on Dec. 13,
1977:
After our election to the Council of Presidents eight
months ago, we had separate meetings with Dr. Peter Bing
and Fred Glover, during which both stated that many had
been surprised that our predecessors had not taken a more
active interest in the substantive issues of the proposed tui
tion and room and board increases. What follows is a state
ment to the Board raising what we feel are important issues,
and demonstrating our interest in these issues.
At a time when students are clamoring for more and
more—such as universal course evaluations, divestment from
corporations in South Africa, and a Western Culture require
ment that is excellent—it is difficult to be in the position of
also asking for savings in regards to tuition and room and
board. Nevertheless, that is what we are here to do today.
The ASSU Council of Presidents has spent a good deal of
time during this finals and dead week period to become
familiar with the reasons for, and necessities of, the proposed
tuition and room and board increases. We have had several
meetings with various administrators and have tried to do as
much outside homework as possible. While we do not feel
that we have made any startling findings, we do have some
questions and conclusions which we'd like to bring, for the
record, to the attention of the Board.
First, it can be assumed that students, by virtue of their
enrollment, find Stanford worth the financial burden on
themselves and their families. Yet even so, it needs to be
reiterated again and again that such does not lessen the

weight of that burden or the hardship that it causes.
Second, we note that the cost of attending Stanford is
increasing dramatically at a time when the student's return
from investment in higher education, as cited by Herbert
Freeman in The Over-Educated American, is decreasing. To
aggravate the situation, we further call to your attention that
the proposed increase will occur at a time when the dollar
commitment to funded improvement and graduate T.A. sup
port is also decreasing, as presented by Provost Miller at our
last meeting.
Third, we are concerned about the effect of tuition hikes
on the composition and nature of the student body. While
there is evidence that cost is not the major factor for those
students who are admitted to Stanford, yet do not enroll, we
are convinced that the price-tag of a Stanford education does
affect the composition of the applicant pool, and conse
quently, the composition of the student body itself.
While Stanford's financial aid program is indeed quite
good, it is, to quote Ray Bacchetti, "counterintuitive" to
assume that one will not have to directly bear the cost of this
education. There are some questions as to whether informa
tion about the availability of financial aid is adequately
disseminated to, and recognized by, those students consider
ing college (especially for those in lower-income high schools
and/or receiving poor higher education counseling). Further,
is the financial aid given actually sufficient? As we will argue
shortly, it is not sufficient in terms of the self-help require
ment and personal expense allowance.
That these factors affect the composition of the applicant
pool seems obvious for the reasons cited above, and is indi
rectly evidenced by the statistics in the Board's November

Agenda, which show how the applicant pool differs from
society in general. For example, only 37% of the applicants
are women and 4.5% are black.
Our fourth concern is that the increases will result in an
increased burden on the student to provide for his/her own
education. Currently, self-help is to provide 25% of one's
need, with 10% from loans and 15% from term-time employ
ment. The problem is that tuition is going up over 9%, while
expected wages for student jobs are only increasing at 8%.
The difference will either be made up through additional
hours of employment during the academic year, or even
greater indebtedness at the end of one's education. It should
be pointed out that these problems are such that they will be
faced by students, and the University, year after year.
Fifth, we call to your attention that the Personal Expense
Allowance is anticipated to increase by only $I—from $700
this year to $701 next year-yet inflation is estimated at 6%.
Further, in the past decade, the Personal Expanse Allowance
(which provides for books and personal items) has only risen
an average of 4.1%, from $500 in 1969-70 to a current
projection of $701. Using »he 1969-70 figure of $500 as a
base, and assuming an average inflation rate of 6% over the
decade, the Personal Expense Allowance should be $845, a
difference of $144. It is fair to state that the costs of a
Stanford education are not adequately represented.
Sixth, and nearing the end of this presentation, we turn to
the room and board increases as proposed in the Agenda. It
seems inequitable for next year's budget to include both a
1.9% increase to make up for this year's operating deficit,
and a .6% increase to remove interest income on the opera
ting reserves as a revenue source for the operating budget.

While the construction of new housing should be a high
priority, and consequently, the need to build reserves is also
great, we question whether both of the above steps need to
be taken this year.
More important, however, is our concern for the future of
room and board increases. We were informed by Ed Scoles of
the Housing Management Office that future increases would
probably be between 9 and 10%. Yet we ask why such will be
necessary in the future if 1.9% of this year's proposed in
crease is attributable to this year's operating deficit, a situa
tion which should not recur.
Finally, we'd like to conclude by asking for your aware
ness of the points we've made in your deliberations this year,
and in future years. Preparing this statement has been a very
educational experience and beneficial, we feel, both to our
selves and to the student body in general.
We must point out, however, that this has been a difficult
task, given the rigors of Dead and Finals weeks. To solve this
problem, and to allow for more intelligent and considered
discussion of these weighty issues, we ask that student intern
ships be created in the two offices most directly responsible
for preparing the tuition and room and board rate proposals
(Further efforts to create internships in the Academic Plan
ning Office and the Housing Management Office will be
undertaken by the C O P and Pat Flinn, the originator of the
idea, next quarter.)
These issues are of concern to all students, and careful
attention to the reactions of an informed and knowledgeable
student body should be of great help in planning the future
of the University.
