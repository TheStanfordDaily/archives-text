# Ever consider owning a three-wheeled motor vehicle?

It looked like a hot rod built
by a mad soap box derby fan.
What looked like a motorcycle
cut in half and attached to the
front of a car was just that —
and builder David Willis was
more than happy to take curi
ous passers-by for a ride.
The "vehicle," as Willis calls
it, is part of his Mechanical En
gineering 211/ Art 360 graduate
program in product design.
The purpose of the year-long
course, according to Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. Robert
Leifer, an instructor, is to have
students show a need for a
product and attempt to satisfy
that need with an invention.

"/ essentially wanted to build a motorcy
cle that couldn't fall down/'

"I essentially wanted to build
a motorcycle that couldn't fall
down," said the bearded Wil
lis, who is now fulfilling his
Masters of Fine Arts degree. He
also works with conceptual
and industrial design at a com
pany which designs amuse
ment park equipment.
'Hedonistic'
"It's a hedonistic approach
to a car. It's fun. I wanted to
find out if you could take a
motorcycle, saw it in half and
attach it to a front of a car.
"I decided to throw the
academic need-search thing
out the window temporarily
and do a hands-on, hardware
intensive project. With a tangi

ble item in hand, I'm in a better
position to talk to people about
my idea," Willis said.
The Willis wheeler consists
of a 1970 Honda 450 motorcy
cle, minus its front wheel and
steering bars, brakes from a
1969 Fiat, the steering column
from an Opel, bucket seats
from a Porsche 914 and panel
instruments ripped-off from
various motorcycles
Under $1000
The vehicle weighs about 650
pounds, reaches speeds of 60
to 75 miles per hour and gets
about 65 to 70 miles per gallon
of fuel. The best part of it is the
wheeler was made for less than
$1000 including the motorcy

cle, Willis said.
The vehicle can quality as a
motorcycle because it has al
most everything a motorcycle
has to have to be street-worthy
in California, Willis said.
It has no more than three
wheels and weighs less than
1500 pounds. It also has a brako
on each wheel, a stop light and
horn. All it needs now is a
rear-view mirror and fenders,
Willis said.
Officer Rhett Brandeburg of
the California Highway Patrol
added that headlights are re
quired for night driving and
any vehicle must have more
than 15 1 /2 horsepower in order
to go on the freeway.

The windshieldless wheeler
rides low and draws amused
stares from pedestrians as it
zooms through campus. This
reporter was the fifth rider in
the world to test it out, Willis
said..
Willis said there could be a
need for a vehicle anyone
could build from commonly
available parts.
It can be related to a "Do it
yourself" ethic, Willis
suggested.
"If you do it yourself, you
understand the vehicle and
become an integrated part of
the system. If you make it your
self, you will inherently under
stand it," Willis said.
Industrial Engineering Prof,
jim Adams said being able to
understand technology ena
bles persons to get more emo
tionally out of technology.
Interaction
"People feel threatened by
technology if they do not have
the ability to deal with it. If you
can't understand technology,
you can't interact with it,"
Adams said.
Willis said he spent eight
weeks building the vehicle.
He used the engineering
machine shop as a work area.
Cars have been a hobby for the
30-year-old Willis since he was
a 13-year-old.
"I like motorcycles. They are
the minimum form of transpor
tation but have many inherent
problems," Willis said.
"First, you can fall off it. In
1963, of the total number of re
gistered motorcycles, 50 per
cent were involved in reported
accidents," he said.
Wife and kids
"Also, you can't carry your
groceries, kids or wife on it
very easily," he said.
"Cars on the other hand, are
big, expensive and insurance
on them is high. They also take
up a lot of space.
"I wanted to explore the area
in between and use a pragma
tic approach to create a vehi
cle," Willis explained.
Because of his art
background, Willis said he is
also looking into the "aesthetic
study of vehicle movements
and dynamics" which means to
make an object look like what it
does.
"That is, I had to make this
vehicle look fast and fun. I had
to integrate the aesthetics with
the functions," he said.
But the question comes back
to who needs a vehicle like
this?
"Dave's had some trouble
demonstrating the need for it,
but I think he thinks that to
solve the "need" problem, we

have to experience the vehicle
ourselves," Leifer said.
"We then might find it is a
real need. I've ridden it and I'm
much more inclined to feel a
need for it," Leifer said.
Other instructors for the
course are Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Robert McKim
and Art Prof. Matt Kahn and
Asst. Art Prof. Jan Mollenkamp.
Now that Willis has his vehi
cle in hand, he said he plans to
weigh, test and improve on it.
He said while he was build

ing the vehicle, students in his
class would come by and give
comments on the project.
"This vehicle creates interac
tion with fellow students. It's
easier to relate with something
being constructed than with
ideas floating around. I relied
heavily on fellow student
comments," Willis said.
Creative
All projects are openly dis
cussed in class. There are
weekly project reviews. There
is a certain openness in discus

sion not found in other
graduate programs, Willis said.
"The aspect that makes this
course so enjoyable is the
sense of being playful which is
essential to being creative,"
Leifer said. "You can't be too
intense or leave out the sense
of adventure in this class."
Willis has high hopes for his
vehicle. He said he believed
more and more motorcycle ac
cidents may prove the danger
of bi-wheeled vehicles to the
public.

"Also, we have a unique
situation of an energy crunch
combined with the motorcycle
as culturally acceptable," he
said.
"In the early '60s, our culture
was thinking that anything with
two or three wheels was bad —
you know, Marlon Brando and
motorcycle gangs and such.
"Now if you see a
businessman on a motorcycle,
our culture thinks of him as
being energy conservation
conscious."

on each wheel, a stop light and
horn. All it needs now is a
rear-view mirror and fenders,
Willis said.
Officer Rhett Brandeburg of
the California Highway Patrol
added that headlights are re
quired for night driving and
any vehicle must have more
than 15 1 /2 horsepower in order
to go on the freeway.

stares from pedestrians as it
zooms through campus. This
reporter was the fifth rider in
the world to test it out, Willis
said..
Willis said there could be a
need for a vehicle anyone
could build from commonly
available parts.
It can be related to a "Do it
yourself" ethic, Willis
suggested.
"If you do it yourself, you
understand the vehicle and
become an integrated part of
the system. If you make it your
self, you will inherently under
stand it," Willis said.
Industrial Engineering Prof,
jim Adams said being able to
understand technology ena
bles persons to get more emo
tionally out of technology.
Interaction
"People feel threatened by
technology if they do not have
the ability to deal with it. If you
can't understand technology,
you can't interact with it,"
Adams said.
Willis said he spent eight
weeks building the vehicle.
He used the engineering
machine shop as a work area.
Cars have been a hobby for the
30-year-old Willis since he was
a 13-year-old.
"I like motorcycles. They are
the minimum form of transpor
tation but have many inherent
problems," Willis said.
"First, you can fall off it. In
1963, of the total number of re
gistered motorcycles, 50 per
cent were involved in reported
accidents," he said.
Wife and kids
"Also, you can't carry your
groceries, kids or wife on it
very easily," he said.
"Cars on the other hand, are
big, expensive and insurance
on them is high. They also take
up a lot of space.
"I wanted to explore the area
in between and use a pragma
tic approach to create a vehi
cle," Willis explained.
Because of his art
background, Willis said he is
also looking into the "aesthetic
study of vehicle movements
and dynamics" which means to
make an object look like what it
does.
"That is, I had to make this
vehicle look fast and fun. I had
to integrate the aesthetics with
the functions," he said.
But the question comes back
to who needs a vehicle like
this?
"Dave's had some trouble
demonstrating the need for it,
but I think he thinks that to
solve the "need" problem, we

have to experience the vehicle
ourselves," Leifer said.
"We then might find it is a
real need. I've ridden it and I'm
much more inclined to feel a
need for it," Leifer said.
Other instructors for the
course are Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Robert McKim
and Art Prof. Matt Kahn and
Asst. Art Prof. Jan Mollenkamp.
Now that Willis has his vehi
cle in hand, he said he plans to
weigh, test and improve on it.
He said while he was build

ing the vehicle, students in his
class would come by and give
comments on the project.
"This vehicle creates interac
tion with fellow students. It's
easier to relate with something
being constructed than with
ideas floating around. I relied
heavily on fellow student
comments," Willis said.
Creative
All projects are openly dis
cussed in class. There are
weekly project reviews. There
is a certain openness in discus

sion not found in other
graduate programs, Willis said.
"The aspect that makes this
course so enjoyable is the
sense of being playful which is
essential to being creative,"
Leifer said. "You can't be too
intense or leave out the sense
of adventure in this class."
Willis has high hopes for his
vehicle. He said he believed
more and more motorcycle ac
cidents may prove the danger
of bi-wheeled vehicles to the
public.

"Also, we have a unique
situation of an energy crunch
combined with the motorcycle
as culturally acceptable," he
said.
"In the early '60s, our culture
was thinking that anything with
two or three wheels was bad —
you know, Marlon Brando and
motorcycle gangs and such.
"Now if you see a
businessman on a motorcycle,
our culture thinks of him as
being energy conservation
conscious."



Inventor David Willis exhibits his three-wheeled vehicle made of a
motorcycle and various car parts. If it seems that the motorcycle is

taped with silver electrical tape, you're right. "It's only temporary,"
Willis told those who stopped to admire the invention.
It looked like a hot rod built
by a mad soap box derby fan.
What looked like a motorcycle
cut in half and attached to the
front of a car was just that —
and builder David Willis was
more than happy to take curi
ous passers-by for a ride.
The "vehicle," as Willis calls
it, is part of his Mechanical En
gineering 211/ Art 360 graduate
program in product design.
The purpose of the year-long
course, according to Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. Robert
Leifer, an instructor, is to have
students show a need for a
product and attempt to satisfy
that need with an invention.

"I essentially wanted to build
a motorcycle that couldn't fall
down," said the bearded Wil

Masters of Fine Arts degree. He
also works with conceptual

'Hedonistic'
"It's a hedonistic approach
to a car. It's fun. I wanted to
find out if you could take a

academic need-search thing
out the window temporarily
and do a hands-on, hardware
intensive project. With a tangi

The vehicle weighs about 650

about 65 to 70 miles per gallon
of fuel. The best part of it is the

vehicle look fast and fun. I had
to integrate the aesthetics with
the functions," he said.
But the question comes back
to who needs a vehicle like
this?
"Dave's had some trouble
demonstrating the need for it,
but I think he thinks that to
solve the "need" problem, we

have to experience the vehicle
ourselves," Leifer said.
"We then might find it is a
real need. I've ridden it and I'm
much more inclined to feel a
need for it," Leifer said.
Other instructors for the
course are Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Robert McKim
and Art Prof. Matt Kahn and
Asst. Art Prof. Jan Mollenkamp.
Now that Willis has his vehi
cle in hand, he said he plans to
weigh, test and improve on it.
He said while he was build

ing the vehicle, students in his
class would come by and give
comments on the project.
"This vehicle creates interac
tion with fellow students. It's
easier to relate with something
being constructed than with
ideas floating around. I relied
heavily on fellow student
comments," Willis said.
Creative
All projects are openly dis
cussed in class. There are
weekly project reviews. There
is a certain openness in discus

sion not found in other
graduate programs, Willis said.
"The aspect that makes this
course so enjoyable is the
sense of being playful which is
essential to being creative,"
Leifer said. "You can't be too
intense or leave out the sense
of adventure in this class."
Willis has high hopes for his
vehicle. He said he believed
more and more motorcycle ac
cidents may prove the danger
of bi-wheeled vehicles to the
public.

"Also, we have a unique
situation of an energy crunch
combined with the motorcycle
as culturally acceptable," he
said.
"In the early '60s, our culture
was thinking that anything with
two or three wheels was bad —
you know, Marlon Brando and
motorcycle gangs and such.
"Now if you see a
businessman on a motorcycle,
our culture thinks of him as
being energy conservation
conscious."



Inventor David Willis exhibits his three-wheeled vehicle made of a
motorcycle and various car parts. If it seems that the motorcycle is

—Daily photo by Lex Passaris
taped with silver electrical tape, you're right. "It's only temporary,"
Willis told those who stopped to admire the invention.
It looked like a hot rod built
by a mad soap box derby fan.
What looked like a motorcycle
cut in half and attached to the
front of a car was just that —
and builder David Willis was
more than happy to take curi
ous passers-by for a ride.
The "vehicle," as Willis calls
it, is part of his Mechanical En
gineering 211/ Art 360 graduate
program in product design.
The purpose of the year-long
course, according to Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. Robert
Leifer, an instructor, is to have
students show a need for a
product and attempt to satisfy
that need with an invention.

"/ essentially wanted to build a motorcy
cle that couldn't fall down/'

"I essentially wanted to build
a motorcycle that couldn't fall
down," said the bearded Wil
lis, who is now fulfilling his
Masters of Fine Arts degree. He
also works with conceptual
and industrial design at a com
pany which designs amuse
ment park equipment.
'Hedonistic'
"It's a hedonistic approach
to a car. It's fun. I wanted to
find out if you could take a
motorcycle, saw it in half and
attach it to a front of a car.
"I decided to throw the
academic need-search thing
out the window temporarily
and do a hands-on, hardware
intensive project. With a tangi

ble item in hand, I'm in a better
position to talk to people about
my idea," Willis said.
The Willis wheeler consists
of a 1970 Honda 450 motorcy
cle, minus its front wheel and
steering bars, brakes from a
1969 Fiat, the steering column
from an Opel, bucket seats
from a Porsche 914 and panel
instruments ripped-off from
various motorcycles
Under $1000
The vehicle weighs about 650
pounds, reaches speeds of 60
to 75 miles per hour and gets
about 65 to 70 miles per gallon
of fuel. The best part of it is the
wheeler was made for less than
$1000 including the motorcy

cle, Willis said.
The vehicle can quality as a
motorcycle because it has al
most everything a motorcycle
has to have to be street-worthy
in California, Willis said.
It has no more than three
wheels and weighs less than
1500 pounds. It also has a brako
on each wheel, a stop light and
horn. All it needs now is a
rear-view mirror and fenders,
Willis said.
Officer Rhett Brandeburg of
the California Highway Patrol
added that headlights are re
quired for night driving and
any vehicle must have more
than 15 1 /2 horsepower in order
to go on the freeway.

The windshieldless wheeler
rides low and draws amused
stares from pedestrians as it
zooms through campus. This
reporter was the fifth rider in
the world to test it out, Willis
said..
Willis said there could be a
need for a vehicle anyone
could build from commonly
available parts.
It can be related to a "Do it
yourself" ethic, Willis
suggested.
"If you do it yourself, you
understand the vehicle and
become an integrated part of
the system. If you make it your
self, you will inherently under
stand it," Willis said.
Industrial Engineering Prof,
jim Adams said being able to
understand technology ena
bles persons to get more emo
tionally out of technology.
Interaction
"People feel threatened by
technology if they do not have
the ability to deal with it. If you
can't understand technology,
you can't interact with it,"
Adams said.
Willis said he spent eight
weeks building the vehicle.
He used the engineering
machine shop as a work area.
Cars have been a hobby for the
30-year-old Willis since he was
a 13-year-old.
"I like motorcycles. They are
the minimum form of transpor
tation but have many inherent
problems," Willis said.
"First, you can fall off it. In
1963, of the total number of re
gistered motorcycles, 50 per
cent were involved in reported
accidents," he said.
Wife and kids
"Also, you can't carry your
groceries, kids or wife on it
very easily," he said.
"Cars on the other hand, are
big, expensive and insurance
on them is high. They also take
up a lot of space.
"I wanted to explore the area
in between and use a pragma
tic approach to create a vehi
cle," Willis explained.
Because of his art
background, Willis said he is
also looking into the "aesthetic
study of vehicle movements
and dynamics" which means to
make an object look like what it
does.
"That is, I had to make this
vehicle look fast and fun. I had
to integrate the aesthetics with
the functions," he said.
