# Major corporations submit bids
## Hospital may get private help 
### Andrea James 
Four of the largest corporations in
the United States have submitted
bids to assist in management of
Stanford-affiliated Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center (VMC), a VMC
spokesman said yesterday.
Robert Jensen, budget director at
VMC, said eight corporations have
submitted "requests for proposal" to
survey the financially-troubled hos
pital. Of those eight corporations,
"four are among the largest corpora
tions in the United States," Jensen
said.
However, Jensen refused to re
lease names of the corporations until

]an. 31, the final date for submitting
requests.
Stanford Medical Center works
closely with VMC in educational and
clinical training programs.
VMC is currently operated by
Santa Clara County, but the hospital
has been experiencing financial dif
ficulties over the past several years,
and the County Board of Supervisors
voted last month to circulate bids for
management assistance to private
corporations.
"There are many advantages to
private management assistance,"
Jensen said. "Private corporations
have many specialists who can be cal

led in to do various tasks."
Besides adding expertise to man
agement, the corporation would use
its own personnel to create the posi
tion of director of finance and to fill
the currently vacant post of hospital
administrator, Jensen explained.
However, this plan, recently ap
proved by the board of supervisors,
insures that all decisions made by
private management be approved by
Dr. Yvonne Russell, current director
of medical institutions at VMC.
"Private management is certainly
not taking over VMC," Jensen said.
"The public doesn't seem to under
stand this. Minor policy decisions
must be approved by both Russell
and the management personnel, and
major policy decisions will require
the agreement of Russell, manage
ment, the city executive and the
board of supervisors.
"In the past, less affluent persons
have feared that the hospital will turn
away the poor to save money," Jen
sen said. "This is a major policy
change and will not be instituted un
less the board of supervisors agrees
to the decision."
Jensen added that several labor un
ions have also expressed concern
that many of their members will lose
jobs as a result of corporation inter
ference.
"This possibility does exist," Jen
sen said. "But again, this is a policy
decision and the management cor
poration must be in agreement with
Russell."
