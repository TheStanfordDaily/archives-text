Washington — Tattoos are in; embar
rassment about them is out.
A new wave of tattoo artists, who run
studios rather than parlors, say tattoos can
be worn proudly, as a form of expression.
Instead of hiding their tattoos under shirt
sleeves, a new breed of customers if
flaunting them, even going to the extreme
of covering themselves in virtual body
suits of color and pattern.
"Tattoos are about the last frontier of
individuality," said Dennis Watkins, one
of at least 1000 tattoo artists in the United
States. "Just about everything in this coun
try has already been explored, so people
are getting to know themselves."
Getting to know oneself has a price. A
single tattoo can cost $30 or $40. For those
who choose to make a broader visual
statement, such as a man who had his back

covered with a tattooed graveyard, the
cost can go as high as $5000.
Smokey Nightingale, a veteran
Washington, D.C., tattoo artist who
learned the trade from his mother, said: "I
charge a $40 minimum for body work —
that's anything between the shoulders and
the knees." In that region of the body, he
explained, the skin is looser, making for a
harder-to-manage canvas.
Women have helped dissolve the tattoo
taboo. After singers, such as Cher, Pearl
Bailey, and the late Janis Joplin appeared
with delicate tattoo designs, women
around the country sought adornment of
their own.
Now some tattoo artists say half of their
customers are women. But not all women
want hearts and flowers. A girl in Mil
waukee had the head of a panther etched

on the back of her shoulder. "I don't want
to be too feminine," she said. "I skate in
roller derbies, and I want to scare the girls
behind me."
A Long Beach housewife entered a tat
too studio and thrust a card into the tat
tooer's hand, instructing him to emblazon
the card's message on her arm. "Death
Before Dishwashing," it said.
Tattoos are made with indelible ink by
electromagnetically powered needles that
pierce the skin about one-hundredth of an
inch. Because of the risk of contracting
hepatitis from unsterilized needles, tatto
oing is illegal in some parts of the United
States.
Whatever the method, getting a tattoo is
usually simpler than getting rid of one.
Most methods are painful, costly, and
leave a scar.
