# Hostile environment awaiting Stanford
## DiBiaso's Cards open conference slate in Oregon 
### David Georgette 
Over 10,000 howling fans
pack both arenas from floor to
ceiling for nearly every game.
The fans scream for the home
team and try to intimidate the
opponent with a din that
makes conversation next to
impossible. Oregon State's Gill
Coliseum and Oregon's an
cient double-tiered McArthur
Court serve as a sixth man
when the Beavers and Ducks
are playing at home.
A two-game road trip to the
basketball-crazy state of Ore
gon is a rough way to open the
Pacific-8 basketball season, but
at least coach Dick Dißiaso's
Stanford cagers won't have to
play the Portland Trailblazers.
The Cards are 8-3 going into
tonight's game against OSU (8
p.m., KZSU FM 90.1, KSFO AM
560), including wins in five of
their last six games. That's the
best start a Stanford basketball
team has had since the 1963-64
squad jumped off to a 9-2 re
cord.
"We're playing with confi
dence now," said Dißiaso.
"We've beaten some good
teams. And we've won some
close games. These things
build confidence in a team."
Reserves important
Also contributing to the de
velopment of team confidence
has been Dißiaso's use of his
reserves. "We're able to rotate
nine guys until we find the
right combination for each
game," said Dißiaso. "A lot of
people have been contribut
ing, and we're getting ba
lanced scoring."
The Cards' top scorer and

rebounder is sophomore for
ward Kimberly Belton. Scoring
almost exclusively near the
basket, Belton is averaging 15.5
points a game and has a 8.7 re
bounding average. Three other
Cards — guard Mark Pitchford,
forward Jay Carter and center
Jeff McHugh — are also averag
ing over 11 points per
ballgame.
McHugh will do his scoring
off the bench, though, be
cause 6-foot-7 freshman Jeff
Ryan has moved into the start
ing slot at center. Wolfe Perry,
a starter last season who's been
relegated to a reserve role this
year, will start at guard in place
of Paul Giovacchini, who has a
pulled calf muscle.
New lineup
The Beaver starting lineup
will look different, too, at least
from that of last year. OSU has
only one starter back — senior
6-6 forward Rickey Lee, who
leads the team in scoring witha
13.2 average. Two freshmen
and two sophomores make up
the rest of coach Ralph Miller's
starting five. "They're an ex
tremely quick team," said Di-
Biaso, "and Rickey Lee is one
of the finest forwards around."
The Beavers' youth might
have accounted for their poor
start this season. They lost four
of their first six games, and
looked to be the weakest team
in the Pac-8. But the Beavers
have since turned it around,
and are now 6-6.
"Oregon State is playing well
as any team in the Pac-8 now,"
said Dißiaso. The Beavers
finished second in the Far West
Classic, losing 49-44 in over

time to Colorado St. in the fi
nals. Stanford defeated Col
orado St. earlier this season,
86-73.
Oregon State's co-host for
the Far West Classic, Oregon,
did not do as well as the Beav
ers in the tournament. The
Ducks lost 61-50 to Colorado
St. in their opening game, and
ended up finishing seventh.
The Ducks are on a two-game
winning streak, though, and
have a 9-3 record going into
conference play.
Drummond's back
The Ducks also have only
one senior in the starting
lineup. Guard Mike Drum
mond, playing his fourth sea
son for coach Dick Harter, rep

resents everything that is Duck
basketball. He's not flashy but
he's quick, hard-nosed and
ferocious. Drummond has two
returners from last year's Duck
team joining him in the starting
lineup — guard Rob Closs and
6-8 center Kelvin Small.
The two starting forwards are
freshmen — 6-8 Mike Clark,
who has a 9.2 scoring average,
highest among the starters,
and 6-4 Felton Sealey.
"We'll try to overcome the
disciplined offense and de
fense characteristic of all Ore
gon teams,"" said Dißiaso,
"plus playing in the Pit. McAr
thur Court is probably the
toughest place we'll have to
play in all year."

rebounding on the team. The Cards take an 8-3 season record into
this weekend's matchups against Oregon and Oregon State.

nals. Stanford defeated Col
orado St. earlier this season,
86-73.
Oregon State's co-host for
the Far West Classic, Oregon,
did not do as well as the Beav

Ducks lost 61-50 to Colorado
St. in their opening game, and
ended up finishing seventh.
The Ducks are on a two-game
winning streak, though, and
have a 9-3 record going into
conference play.
Drummond's back
The Ducks also have only
one senior in the starting
lineup. Guard Mike Drum
mond, playing his fourth sea
son for coach Dick Harter, rep

resents everything that is Duck
basketball. He's not flashy but
he's quick, hard-nosed and
ferocious. Drummond has two
returners from last year's Duck
team joining him in the starting
lineup — guard Rob Closs and
6-8 center Kelvin Small.
The two starting forwards are
freshmen — 6-8 Mike Clark,
who has a 9.2 scoring average,
highest among the starters,
and 6-4 Felton Sealey.
"We'll try to overcome the
disciplined offense and de
fense characteristic of all Ore

thur Court is probably the
toughest place we'll have to
play in all year."

Jeff McHugh shoots over several San Jose State players in Stanford's
81-80 overtime win over the Spartans on Nov. 26. McHugh is averag
ing 11 points per game for the Cards this season, the fourth highest
average on the squad. The 6-foot-9 center is also the third leading
rebounding on the team. The Cards take an 8-3 season record into
this weekend's matchups against Oregon and Oregon State.
Over 10,000 howling fans
pack both arenas from floor to
ceiling for nearly every game.
The fans scream for the home
team and try to intimidate the
opponent with a din that
makes conversation next to
impossible. Oregon State's Gill
Coliseum and Oregon's an
cient double-tiered McArthur
Court serve as a sixth man
when the Beavers and Ducks
are playing at home.
A two-game road trip to the
basketball-crazy state of Ore
gon is a rough way to open the
Pacific-8 basketball season, but
at least coach Dick Dißiaso's
Stanford cagers won't have to
play the Portland Trailblazers.
The Cards are 8-3 going into
tonight's game against OSU (8
p.m., KZSU FM 90.1, KSFO AM
560), including wins in five of
their last six games. That's the
best start a Stanford basketball
team has had since the 1963-64
squad jumped off to a 9-2 re
cord.
"We're playing with confi
dence now," said Dißiaso.
"We've beaten some good
teams. And we've won some
close games. These things
build confidence in a team."
Reserves important
Also contributing to the de
velopment of team confidence
has been Dißiaso's use of his
reserves. "We're able to rotate
nine guys until we find the
right combination for each
game," said Dißiaso. "A lot of
people have been contribut
ing, and we're getting ba
lanced scoring."
The Cards' top scorer and

rebounder is sophomore for
ward Kimberly Belton. Scoring
almost exclusively near the
basket, Belton is averaging 15.5
points a game and has a 8.7 re
bounding average. Three other
Cards — guard Mark Pitchford,
forward Jay Carter and center
Jeff McHugh — are also averag
ing over 11 points per
ballgame.
McHugh will do his scoring
off the bench, though, be
cause 6-foot-7 freshman Jeff
Ryan has moved into the start
ing slot at center. Wolfe Perry,
a starter last season who's been
relegated to a reserve role this
year, will start at guard in place
of Paul Giovacchini, who has a
pulled calf muscle.
New lineup
The Beaver starting lineup
will look different, too, at least
from that of last year. OSU has
only one starter back — senior
6-6 forward Rickey Lee, who
leads the team in scoring witha
13.2 average. Two freshmen
and two sophomores make up
the rest of coach Ralph Miller's
starting five. "They're an ex
tremely quick team," said Di-
Biaso, "and Rickey Lee is one
of the finest forwards around."
The Beavers' youth might
have accounted for their poor
start this season. They lost four
of their first six games, and
looked to be the weakest team
in the Pac-8. But the Beavers
have since turned it around,
and are now 6-6.
"Oregon State is playing well
as any team in the Pac-8 now,"
said Dißiaso. The Beavers
finished second in the Far West
Classic, losing 49-44 in over

time to Colorado St. in the fi
nals. Stanford defeated Col

teams. And we've won some
close games. These things
build confidence in a team."
Reserves important
Also contributing to the de
velopment of team confidence
has been Dißiaso's use of his
reserves. "We're able to rotate
nine guys until we find the
right combination for each
game," said Dißiaso. "A lot of
people have been contribut
ing, and we're getting ba
lanced scoring."
The Cards' top scorer and

rebounder is sophomore for
ward Kimberly Belton. Scoring
almost exclusively near the
basket, Belton is averaging 15.5
points a game and has a 8.7 re
bounding average. Three other
Cards — guard Mark Pitchford,
forward Jay Carter and center
Jeff McHugh — are also averag
ing over 11 points per
ballgame.
McHugh will do his scoring
off the bench, though, be
cause 6-foot-7 freshman Jeff
Ryan has moved into the start
ing slot at center. Wolfe Perry,
a starter last season who's been
relegated to a reserve role this
year, will start at guard in place
of Paul Giovacchini, who has a
pulled calf muscle.
New lineup
The Beaver starting lineup
will look different, too, at least
from that of last year. OSU has
only one starter back — senior
6-6 forward Rickey Lee, who
leads the team in scoring witha
13.2 average. Two freshmen
and two sophomores make up
the rest of coach Ralph Miller's
starting five. "They're an ex
tremely quick team," said Di-
Biaso, "and Rickey Lee is one
of the finest forwards around."
The Beavers' youth might
have accounted for their poor
start this season. They lost four
of their first six games, and
looked to be the weakest team
in the Pac-8. But the Beavers
have since turned it around,
and are now 6-6.
"Oregon State is playing well
as any team in the Pac-8 now,"
said Dißiaso. The Beavers
finished second in the Far West
Classic, losing 49-44 in over

time to Colorado St. in the fi
nals. Stanford defeated Col
orado St. earlier this season,
86-73.
Oregon State's co-host for
the Far West Classic, Oregon,
did not do as well as the Beav
ers in the tournament. The
Ducks lost 61-50 to Colorado
St. in their opening game, and
ended up finishing seventh.
The Ducks are on a two-game
winning streak, though, and
have a 9-3 record going into
conference play.
Drummond's back
The Ducks also have only
one senior in the starting
lineup. Guard Mike Drum
mond, playing his fourth sea
son for coach Dick Harter, rep

resents everything that is Duck
basketball. He's not flashy but
he's quick, hard-nosed and
ferocious. Drummond has two
returners from last year's Duck
team joining him in the starting
lineup — guard Rob Closs and
6-8 center Kelvin Small.
The two starting forwards are
freshmen — 6-8 Mike Clark,
who has a 9.2 scoring average,
highest among the starters,
and 6-4 Felton Sealey.
"We'll try to overcome the
disciplined offense and de
fense characteristic of all Ore
gon teams,"" said Dißiaso,
"plus playing in the Pit. McAr
thur Court is probably the
toughest place we'll have to
play in all year."

Freshman Jeff Ryan (52) muscles his way up for a short shot as forward George Schader (22) moves in for
the possible rebound in Stanford's 99-78 loss to USF on Dec. 8. The 6-foot-7 Ryan will be the Cards'
starting center when Stanford opens its Pac-8 conference schedule this weekend in Oregon.

Jeff McHugh shoots over several San Jose State players in Stanford's
81-80 overtime win over the Spartans on Nov. 26. McHugh is averag
ing 11 points per game for the Cards this season, the fourth highest
average on the squad. The 6-foot-9 center is also the third leading
rebounding on the team. The Cards take an 8-3 season record into
this weekend's matchups against Oregon and Oregon State.
Over 10,000 howling fans
pack both arenas from floor to
ceiling for nearly every game.
The fans scream for the home
team and try to intimidate the
opponent with a din that
makes conversation next to
impossible. Oregon State's Gill
Coliseum and Oregon's an
cient double-tiered McArthur
Court serve as a sixth man
when the Beavers and Ducks
are playing at home.
A two-game road trip to the
basketball-crazy state of Ore
gon is a rough way to open the
Pacific-8 basketball season, but
at least coach Dick Dißiaso's
Stanford cagers won't have to
play the Portland Trailblazers.
The Cards are 8-3 going into
tonight's game against OSU (8
p.m., KZSU FM 90.1, KSFO AM
560), including wins in five of
their last six games. That's the
best start a Stanford basketball
team has had since the 1963-64
squad jumped off to a 9-2 re
cord.
"We're playing with confi
dence now," said Dißiaso.
"We've beaten some good
teams. And we've won some
close games. These things
build confidence in a team."
