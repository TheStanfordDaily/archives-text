Statement on Investment Responsibility
Concerning Endowment Securities
December 13, 1977
1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment securities is to maximize the financial return on those
resources, taking into account the amount of risk appropriate
for University investment policy. However, when the trustees
adjudge that corporate policies or practices cause substantial
social injury, they, as responsible and ethical investors, shall
give independent weight to this factor in their investment
policies and in voting proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms: for purposes of
these Guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The authority to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on en
dowment securities derives primarily from the stewardship
responsibilities which attend the ownership of endowment
securities. The policies and procedures in this Statement
recognize that there is no practical way for the University to
avoid having an affect on the outcome of issues involving
corporations in which it has invested and that, consequently,
the effect should be as thoughtful and considered as possible.
1.3 However, decisions regarding investment responsi
bility frequently are controversial, and the trustees recognize
that they may not speak for the University on issues of
public policy, except those that directly impinge upon Stan
ford as an educational institution. Therefore, all actions tak
en pursuant to these policies and procedures should be under
stood as judgments by the trustees made in discharging their
duties as an investor in corporations, and such an action
should not be interpreted to represent the view of all mem
bers-or of any particular member of the University.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds] in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary cri
terion for the retention of the University's endowment secu
rities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3. In both
cases, when assessing the expected return on the securities of
a company, the investment manager or advisor shall take into
consideration any substantial social injury caused by com

pany activities which in his or her opinion is likely to have a
negative impact on the value of the investment.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees conclude that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which would eliminate
or materially reduce the substantial social injury, the trustees
will vote for the proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or materially retard such elimination or
reduction, provided such action is not inconsistent with the
trustees' fiduciary obligations. In cases where the proposed
remedy is deemed unreasonable, the trustees may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees conclude that the
company's activities cause social injury, they may make
formal or informal representations to corporate management
to explain or reinforce their position on proxy issues and on
issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees conclude that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees con
clude that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities would have
a direct and material effect in alleviating such injury,
ii) the trustees have exhausted their practicable share
holder rights in seeking to eliminate or reduce the substantial
social injury thereby caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the trustees will consider the alternative of not continuing to
exercise their shareholder rights under the foregoing para
graphs, and may, when such an action is consistent with their
fiduciary obligations, instead sell the securities in question
within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions «
2.4 Exceptions
If the trustees conclude that a specific trustee action
otherwise indicated under these Guidelines is likely to impair
the capacity of the University to carry out its educational
mission (for example, by causing significant adverse action on
the part of governmental or other external agencies or
groups, or by causing deep divisions within the University
community), then the trustees need not take such action.
3. THE COMMISSION ON INVESTMENT RESPONSI

The trustees shall receive recommendation* concerning
the implementation of the above Guidelines by a Commission
on Investment Responsibility (CIR).

3.1 CIR membership
a) There is hereby established a Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility to be composed of persons appointed by
the President of the University from each of the components
of the University community, in the following numbers:

disability, or resignation of a member, the President of the
University shall appoint a replacement, who shall serve until
the expiration of such member's term and until a successor
takes office.
c) The CIR Chair shall be appointed by the President of
the University
3.2 Organization
a) The CIR shall meet at least twice a quarter (during the
September-June academic year), but this schedule may be
changed by a majority vote of the Commission. Additional
meetings of the CIR may be called at any time by the Chair

matter pertaining to the University's endowment securities
which could be within the purview of the CIR.
c) The CIR may ask individuals, whether or not con
nected with the University, to attend its meetings as consul
tants or otherwise provide advice and information.
d) The University will pay reasonable expenses of the CIR
and make staff and research time available in amount and
form approved by the President on the basis of budget
requests submitted by the director of finance after consulta

may request additional staff and research time from the
University.
e) The CIR will have access to lists of the University's
current holdings of pooled endowment securities and to
reasonably available data compiled by, or on behalf of, the
University with respect to the social responsibility of com
panies in which an investment has been made and with

CIR shall examine issues of investment responsibility in
volving the University's endowment securities and make ap
propriate recommendations for action by the trustees. Such
recommendations shall take into consideration the following
factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has gathered in
its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed within the
Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3) the legal
and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) If the CIR determines that a substantial issue arises
within the Guidelines established under Section 2, the CIR
may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage the convening of
occasional local public meetings or forums to assess the views
of members of the Stanford community concerning such an
issue.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the Univer
sity community, including a member of the CIR, a written
request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall first
determine whether the request, on its face and assuming its
factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established by
Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.

dation. The recommendation, together with accompanying
materials, may, at the discretion of the CIR, be made avail
able for public distribution.
e) Where the CIR indicates a desire to deliberate on a
proxy or divestment issue, the trustees will, where practi
cable, await a timely recommendation from the CIR before

business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The authority to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on en
dowment securities derives primarily from the stewardship
responsibilities which attend the ownership of endowment
securities. The policies and procedures in this Statement
recognize that there is no practical way for the University to
avoid having an affect on the outcome of issues involving
corporations in which it has invested and that, consequently,
the effect should be as thoughtful and considered as possible.
1.3 However, decisions regarding investment responsi
bility frequently are controversial, and the trustees recognize
that they may not speak for the University on issues of
public policy, except those that directly impinge upon Stan
ford as an educational institution. Therefore, all actions tak
en pursuant to these policies and procedures should be under
stood as judgments by the trustees made in discharging their
duties as an investor in corporations, and such an action
should not be interpreted to represent the view of all mem
bers-or of any particular member of the University.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds] in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary cri
terion for the retention of the University's endowment secu
rities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3. In both
cases, when assessing the expected return on the securities of
a company, the investment manager or advisor shall take into
consideration any substantial social injury caused by com

pany activities which in his or her opinion is likely to have a
negative impact on the value of the investment.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees conclude that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which would eliminate
or materially reduce the substantial social injury, the trustees
will vote for the proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or materially retard such elimination or
reduction, provided such action is not inconsistent with the
trustees' fiduciary obligations. In cases where the proposed
remedy is deemed unreasonable, the trustees may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees conclude that the
company's activities cause social injury, they may make
formal or informal representations to corporate management
to explain or reinforce their position on proxy issues and on
issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees conclude that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees con
clude that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities would have
a direct and material effect in alleviating such injury,
ii) the trustees have exhausted their practicable share
holder rights in seeking to eliminate or reduce the substantial
social injury thereby caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the trustees will consider the alternative of not continuing to
exercise their shareholder rights under the foregoing para
graphs, and may, when such an action is consistent with their
fiduciary obligations, instead sell the securities in question
within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions «
2.4 Exceptions
If the trustees conclude that a specific trustee action
otherwise indicated under these Guidelines is likely to impair
the capacity of the University to carry out its educational
mission (for example, by causing significant adverse action on
the part of governmental or other external agencies or
groups, or by causing deep divisions within the University
community), then the trustees need not take such action.

recommendations shall take into consideration the following
factors: 1) the facts and information the CIR has gathered in
its study of the issue; 2) the opinions expressed within the
Stanford community regarding the issues; and 3) the legal
and financial impact of the recommended action.
b) If the CIR determines that a substantial issue arises
within the Guidelines established under Section 2, the CIR
may, at its discretion, sponsor or encourage the convening of
occasional local public meetings or forums to assess the views
of members of the Stanford community concerning such an
issue.
c) When the CIR receives from any member of the Univer
sity community, including a member of the CIR, a written
request for action under this Statement, the CIR shall first
determine whether the request, on its face and assuming its
factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established by
Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the

give independent weight to this factor in their investment
policies and in voting proxies on corporate securities.

a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva

should not be interpreted to represent the view of all mem
bers-or of any particular member of the University.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds] in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary cri
terion for the retention of the University's endowment secu
rities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3. In both
cases, when assessing the expected return on the securities of
a company, the investment manager or advisor shall take into
consideration any substantial social injury caused by com

pany activities which in his or her opinion is likely to have a
negative impact on the value of the investment.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights
a) Voting: Where the trustees conclude that a company's
activities cause substantial social injury and such activities are
the subject of a shareholder proposal which would eliminate
or materially reduce the substantial social injury, the trustees
will vote for the proposal and will vote against a proposal
that would prevent or materially retard such elimination or
reduction, provided such action is not inconsistent with the
trustees' fiduciary obligations. In cases where the proposed
remedy is deemed unreasonable, the trustees may abstain.
b) Representations: When the trustees conclude that the
company's activities cause social injury, they may make
formal or informal representations to corporate management
to explain or reinforce their position on proxy issues and on
issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees conclude that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees con
clude that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities would have
a direct and material effect in alleviating such injury,
ii) the trustees have exhausted their practicable share
holder rights in seeking to eliminate or reduce the substantial
social injury thereby caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the trustees will consider the alternative of not continuing to
exercise their shareholder rights under the foregoing para
graphs, and may, when such an action is consistent with their
fiduciary obligations, instead sell the securities in question
within a reasonable period of time.
2.4 Exceptions «
2.4 Exceptions
If the trustees conclude that a specific trustee action
otherwise indicated under these Guidelines is likely to impair
the capacity of the University to carry out its educational
mission (for example, by causing significant adverse action on

Statement on Investment Responsibility
Concerning Endowment Securities
December 13, 1977
1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment securities is to maximize the financial return on those
resources, taking into account the amount of risk appropriate
for University investment policy. However, when the trustees
adjudge that corporate policies or practices cause substantial
social injury, they, as responsible and ethical investors, shall
give independent weight to this factor in their investment
policies and in voting proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms: for purposes of
these Guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The authority to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on en
dowment securities derives primarily from the stewardship
responsibilities which attend the ownership of endowment
securities. The policies and procedures in this Statement
recognize that there is no practical way for the University to
avoid having an affect on the outcome of issues involving
corporations in which it has invested and that, consequently,
the effect should be as thoughtful and considered as possible.
1.3 However, decisions regarding investment responsi
bility frequently are controversial, and the trustees recognize
that they may not speak for the University on issues of
public policy, except those that directly impinge upon Stan
ford as an educational institution. Therefore, all actions tak
en pursuant to these policies and procedures should be under
stood as judgments by the trustees made in discharging their
duties as an investor in corporations, and such an action
should not be interpreted to represent the view of all mem
bers-or of any particular member of the University.

Statement on Investment Responsibility
Concerning Endowment Securities
December 13, 1977
1. PREAMBLE
1.1 The primary fiduciary responsibility of the University
trustees in investing and managing the University's endow
ment securities is to maximize the financial return on those
resources, taking into account the amount of risk appropriate
for University investment policy. However, when the trustees
adjudge that corporate policies or practices cause substantial
social injury, they, as responsible and ethical investors, shall
give independent weight to this factor in their investment
policies and in voting proxies on corporate securities.
(Social injury: the injurious impact which the activities of
a company are found to have on consumers, employees, or
other persons, particularly including activities which violate,
or frustrate the enforcement of, rules of domestic or inter
national law intended to protect individuals against depriva
tion of health, safety, or basic freedoms: for purposes of
these Guidelines, social injury shall not consist of doing
business with other companies which are themselves engaged
in socially injurious activities.)
1.2 The authority to take ethical factors into account
when setting investment policies and voting proxies on en
dowment securities derives primarily from the stewardship
responsibilities which attend the ownership of endowment
securities. The policies and procedures in this Statement
recognize that there is no practical way for the University to
avoid having an affect on the outcome of issues involving
corporations in which it has invested and that, consequently,
the effect should be as thoughtful and considered as possible.
1.3 However, decisions regarding investment responsi
bility frequently are controversial, and the trustees recognize
that they may not speak for the University on issues of
public policy, except those that directly impinge upon Stan
ford as an educational institution. Therefore, all actions tak
en pursuant to these policies and procedures should be under
stood as judgments by the trustees made in discharging their
duties as an investor in corporations, and such an action
should not be interpreted to represent the view of all mem
bers-or of any particular member of the University.
2. POLICY GUIDELINES
2.1 Selection and retention of endowment securities
a) Maximum economic return shall be the primary criteri
on for the selection of the University's endowment securities.
(Endowment security: an equity security held for investment
as part of the University's endowment funds or other funds
(such as loan funds, building and other temporary funds,
reserve funds, and current funds] in which securities are held
for investment.)
Maximum economic return shall also be the primary cri
terion for the retention of the University's endowment secu
rities except in the cases covered by paragraph 2.3. In both
cases, when assessing the expected return on the securities of
a company, the investment manager or advisor shall take into
consideration any substantial social injury caused by com

pany activities which in his or her opinion is likely to have a
negative impact on the value of the investment.
b) In no event will an endowment security be selected or
retained for the primary purpose of thereby encouraging or
expressing approval of a company's activities, or, alterna
tively, for the primary purpose of placing the University in a
position to contest a company's activities.
2.2 Exercise of shareholder rights

to explain or reinforce their position on proxy issues and on
issues where no proxy is presented.
2.3 Divestment
Where the trustees conclude that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social injury, and the trustees con
clude that:
i) a desired change in the company's activities would have
a direct and material effect in alleviating such injury,
ii) the trustees have exhausted their practicable share
holder rights in seeking to eliminate or reduce the substantial
social injury thereby caused,
iii) the company has been afforded the maximum reason
able opportunity to alter its activities,
iv) no alleviation of the substantial social injury by the
company is likely within a reasonable time;
the trustees will consider the alternative of not continuing to
exercise their shareholder rights under the foregoing para
graphs, and may, when such an action is consistent with their
fiduciary obligations, instead sell the securities in question
within a reasonable period of time.

otherwise indicated under these Guidelines is likely to impair
the capacity of the University to carry out its educational
mission (for example, by causing significant adverse action on
the part of governmental or other external agencies or
groups, or by causing deep divisions within the University
community), then the trustees need not take such action.

factual accuracy, appears to meet the criteria established by
Section 2. If the request does not so appear, the individual
making the request shall be advised that no further steps will
be taken unless persuasive additional evidence or arguments
are presented to the CIR. If the request appears to meet the
criteria, the CIR shall investigate and analyze the request in
light of the criteria established by Section 2.

the trustees, the President, and the vice-president for business
and finance. The recommendation shall be accompanied by
