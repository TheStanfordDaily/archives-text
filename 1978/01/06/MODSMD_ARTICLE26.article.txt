# Cardinal sins
## Fun in the Sun in El Paso 
### 
Bruce Anderson

A bowl game is more than a post-season
football game. It is an event.
And the Sun Bowl event went on three days
for the Stanford football team last week be
fore the Cardinals clashed with LSU in the
30,000-seat stadium called the Sun Bowl
(you're kidding) on the University of Texas-El
Paso campus.
It was an event which featured a sheriff's
posse breakfast, a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon, an awards banquet dinner and
plenty of El Paso and Juarez night life. And all
of it was served up with unceasing West
Texas hospitality.
El Paso folks take pride in this 43-year-old
event and pull out all stops to show their
guests a good time. Free booze flowed all
week for Athletic Department adminis
trators, Stanford alumni and the press.
Stanford players avoided the alcoholic ex
cesses in which others engaged, but
explored the West Texas night scene and
found an assortment of discotheques in El
Paso and more sleazy offerings in Juarez.
* * * *
Although the team practiced daily, game
preparation at times seemed incidental to
having a good time in El Paso.
And certainly the team deserved an oppor
tunity to enjoy itself. As soon as the rest of the
Stanford campus headed home after finals,
the Cardinals resumed practice.
Players had two or three days off for
Christmas, returned to the Farm Dec. 26 for
two days of practice, then flew to the Sun
Bowl. Most players saw very little of Mom and
Dad or their hometown flame.
But the Cards saw a return for their labor.
Stanford dumped the Bayou Bengals, 24-14,
and finished No. 15 in both post-season wire
service polls.
Stanford's 9-3 record and the nationally
televised bowl victory can do nothing but
enhance the Cardinal recruiting effort this

winter.
♦ * ♦ »
Stanford's football successes this season
also have stories flying that a number of pro
teams are seeking the services of first-year
Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"We expect to be at Stanford next year,"
Walsh said at a press conference after the
game, sipping a drink and wearing the cow
boy boots he picked up in El Paso.
"Absolutely?" Walsh was asked.
"Weil that's not a fair question. 'Abso
lutely' I don't think there's any way I could
say that. There's always a possibility of some
thing happening. But we don't expect to
leave, we don't want to leave, we're not look
ing to leave."
So while pro teams continue to dangle bait
in front of Walsh, Walsh and his staff con
tinue to work with recruits before the Feb. 14
signing date.
The coaching staff is looking to next year
already and yet some Stanford players have
not even finished the season.
Guy Benjamin, James Lofton and Cordy
King are all in Mobile, Ala., this week for
Saturday's Senior Bowl. Benjamin will split
time behind the center with Pitt's Matt
Cavanaugh, who was named the outstanding
player in the Cator Bowl after leading the
Panthers to a 34-3 romp over Clemson.
Mark Hill is in Honolulu this week for
Saturday's Hula Bowl. From Hawaii, Hill will
jet to Japan for the Japan Bowl Jan. 14.
Wide receiver Bill Kellar is in Tampa Bay,
Fla., preparing for the Canadian-American
Bowl which pits Canadian college all-stars
against American college standouts in a game
using Canadian football rules.
Benjamin, Lofton, King, Kellar and
linebacker Ray Cardinalli will join other
seniors from the Pacific-8 in a matchup
against Big 10 all-stars Jan. 14 in Challenge
Bowl I in Seattle's Kingdome.

leave, we don't want to leave, we're not look
ing to leave."
So while pro teams continue to dangle bait
in front of Walsh, Walsh and his staff con
tinue to work with recruits before the Feb. 14
signing date.
The coaching staff is looking to next year
already and yet some Stanford players have
not even finished the season.
Guy Benjamin, James Lofton and Cordy
King are all in Mobile, Ala., this week for
Saturday's Senior Bowl. Benjamin will split
time behind the center with Pitt's Matt
Cavanaugh, who was named the outstanding
player in the Cator Bowl after leading the
Panthers to a 34-3 romp over Clemson.
Mark Hill is in Honolulu this week for
Saturday's Hula Bowl. From Hawaii, Hill will
jet to Japan for the Japan Bowl Jan. 14.
Wide receiver Bill Kellar is in Tampa Bay,
Fla., preparing for the Canadian-American
Bowl which pits Canadian college all-stars
against American college standouts in a game
using Canadian football rules.
Benjamin, Lofton, King, Kellar and
linebacker Ray Cardinalli will join other
seniors from the Pacific-8 in a matchup
against Big 10 all-stars Jan. 14 in Challenge
Bowl I in Seattle's Kingdome.

A bowl game is more than a post-season
football game. It is an event.
And the Sun Bowl event went on three days
for the Stanford football team last week be
fore the Cardinals clashed with LSU in the
30,000-seat stadium called the Sun Bowl
(you're kidding) on the University of Texas-El
Paso campus.
It was an event which featured a sheriff's
posse breakfast, a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon, an awards banquet dinner and
plenty of El Paso and Juarez night life. And all
of it was served up with unceasing West
Texas hospitality.
El Paso folks take pride in this 43-year-old
event and pull out all stops to show their
guests a good time. Free booze flowed all
week for Athletic Department adminis
trators, Stanford alumni and the press.
Stanford players avoided the alcoholic ex
cesses in which others engaged, but
explored the West Texas night scene and
found an assortment of discotheques in El
Paso and more sleazy offerings in Juarez.
* * * *
Although the team practiced daily, game
preparation at times seemed incidental to
having a good time in El Paso.
And certainly the team deserved an oppor
tunity to enjoy itself. As soon as the rest of the
Stanford campus headed home after finals,
the Cardinals resumed practice.
Players had two or three days off for
Christmas, returned to the Farm Dec. 26 for
two days of practice, then flew to the Sun
Bowl. Most players saw very little of Mom and
Dad or their hometown flame.
But the Cards saw a return for their labor.
Stanford dumped the Bayou Bengals, 24-14,
and finished No. 15 in both post-season wire
service polls.
Stanford's 9-3 record and the nationally
televised bowl victory can do nothing but
enhance the Cardinal recruiting effort this

winter.

Stanford's football successes this season
also have stories flying that a number of pro
teams are seeking the services of first-year
Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"We expect to be at Stanford next year,"
Walsh said at a press conference after the
game, sipping a drink and wearing the cow
boy boots he picked up in El Paso.
"Absolutely?" Walsh was asked.
"Weil that's not a fair question. 'Abso
lutely' I don't think there's any way I could
say that. There's always a possibility of some
thing happening. But we don't expect to
leave, we don't want to leave, we're not look
