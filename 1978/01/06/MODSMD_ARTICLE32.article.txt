## 
### Sukie Jackson 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team, in its first game
of the new year yesterday eas
ily defeated the University of
Hawaii, 65-27, in Maples Pavil
ion. The Rainbows, currently
on a seven day tour of Califor
nia, haven't fared well on the
court against Northern
California teams.

Hawaii dropped decisions to
San Jose and Berkeley before
losing to the stronger, taller
Cardinals.
Throughout its earlier
games, Stanford has de
monstrated consistent
strength scoring under the
basket and rebounding; yes
terday's game was no excep
tion. Although Hawaii had a

definite height disadvantage
(their tallest player being
5-foot-8), Stanford's combina
tion of Maggie Nelson (6-1),
Kathy Murphy (5-11) and Ann
Cooper (5-10) proved to be
more than the Rainbows could
handle.
High scorers for Stanford
were Cooper with 14 points
and Nelson, Stephanie Calef
and Barb Boylan who contri
buted eight points each. High
scorer for Hawaii was Maia
Yoshida with nine points.
Cardinal coach Dottie
McCrea called the victory "a
good team effort."
This victory and the Cards'
65-41 win over Hayward State
on Dec. 22 raise the team's sea
son record to 5-2. McCrea was

especially pleased with the
team's victory over Hayward
which has been a tough com
petitor in past years. McCrea
said "the game showed how far
Stanford has come."
She attributed the improve
ment to the dedication and en
thusiasm of the players along
with scholarships which coach
McCrea has used to build the
basketball program.
The Cards haveachallenging
weekend ahead as they travel
to Southern California to face
Cal Poly-Pomona today at 8
p.m. and Fullerton State to
morrow at 6 p.m.
McCrea said this will be a
"very different weekend" for
the Cards. "It will really show
where we're at," McCrea said.
