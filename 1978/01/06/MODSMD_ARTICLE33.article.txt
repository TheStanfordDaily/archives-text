Carter views D-Day beach
Omaha Beach, France — In biting, damp cold
under lowering clouds, President Jimmy Carter
walked atop the cliffs of this windswept beach
yesterday and paid homage to the thousands of
Allied soldiers who died in the D-Day invasion of
Normandy.
"We are proud of what we have done together,"
he told French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and a gathering of French and Americans. "We are
sure our friendship shall be everlasting."
Carter, Giscard d'Estaing and their wives gazed
out over Omaha Beach, where 2000 Allied soldiers
were killed on )une 6, 1944, in the invasion that
freed France from the Nazi grip.
Saluting it as "a site of tragedy, of heroism,"
Carter declared in the brief ceremony, "We are
determined with our allies that Europe's freedom
will never again be in danger."
Giscard d'Estaing told the chilled crowd: "All
this France remembers. She expresses her
gratitude for all those who fell for her freedom, to
their families and to all their friends."
The two presidents walked along the grass
covered cliff as the steel-blue surf of the English
Channel rolled up the beach 130 feet below.
At the time of the invasion, Giscard d'Estaing
was a teenage member of the French resistance
and Carter was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
Legislators in special session
Sacramento — A handful of Senate Democrats
held the key votes yesterday as state legislators
began a special session on property taxes, with
instructions from Gov. Edmund Brown ]r. to pass a
$1 billion bill this month.
In calling the special session in his State-of-the-
State speech, Brown gave only vague outlines of a
tax package, leaving unanswered the problems of
detail that have confounded the lawmakers for the
last year.
The central question remained the same one
that has deadlocked every legislative proposal on
taxes: should tax relief be shared equally by all
property owners or be based on income?
That question is likely to be answered in the
Senate, which twice last year defeated Brown
backed bills that offered the most relief to low
to-middle-income homeowners. Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said yesterday his house
wouldn't insist on any provisions that weren't ac
ceptable to a majority of the Senate.
Most liberals still favor some formula weighted
toward low-income families, like the Brown
backed bill. Conservatives want across-the-board
relief that helps middle-to-upper-income families.
Anti-violence drive gets support
Washington — The federal government, search
ing for ways to improve education and diminish

school violence, is getting behind the Rev. Jesse
lackson's inspirational program that involves pa
rents and community leaders in helping to moti
vate students.
lackson's "Push for Excellence, Inc." received
two grants totaling $45,000 yesterday, and HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano Jr., said he expects
more federal support to follow.
At the same time, Califano sent Congress a re
port cataloguing the high level of crime in schools.
The three-year, $2.4 million study showed the rate
of violence is leveling off, but remains "extremely
serious," particularly in urban areas, he said.
The study found that 2.4 million, or 11 percent of
the nation's 21 million high school students have
something stolen from them in a month's time,
and 282,000, or 1.3 percent, report being attacked.
About 12 percent of their teachers, or 120,000 also
are victimized by theft and,5200 teachers are as
saulted each month.
Mondale seeks party unity
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale,
who is emerging as the administration's emissary
to Democrats, says the party needs to pull itself
together if it is going to help itself and its presi
dent.
"The presidency requires an effective political
party," Mondale said. "A president requires a
good party."
In an interview aboard Air Force Two returning
from a party-boosting trip, Mondale said the
Democratic Party should be more supportive of
the people it elects.
"I don't mean an obsequious party," he added.
"It should be a strong and independent party, but
one that can help the president and the Congress
get their jobs done."
"A president can't do it all alone," he had told a
group of Florida Democrats earlier. "The job
wasn't finished when you elected him. He still
needs your help."
Mondale's mission to the party regulars casts
him in a sensitive role as he tries to win support for
a Democratic president, who after a year in the
White House still claims less than wholehearted
support from the party establishment.
U.S. dollar stages comeback
London —The dollar made a dramatic comeback
in world money markets yesterday after the United
States government bought dollars on the open
market to snap the currency out of its year-long
decline.
But some foreign exchange dealers called the
dollar's revival a "knee-jerk" reaction to U.S. in
tervention in the markets and said it could be
short-lived.
They said the causes of the dollar's troubles,
such as a foreign trade deficit that could total $27
billion for 1977, still remain to be dealt with.
Trading was cautious as many big foreign ex
change operators waited to see whether the U.S.

Federal Reserve Board would continue the aggres
sive purchase of dollars it began on the New York
market Wednesday.
As the business day neared its close in Europe
and opened in the United States, New York deal
ers said the Federal Reserve Board was again ac
tively intervening on the foreign exchanges.
One of the more remarkable turnabouts for the
dollar rame in London where the British pound
shed more than 7Vi cents to reach $1.8825 late in
the day, compared to $1.9590 late Wednesday.
On Wednesday morning the pound, buoyed re
cently by the flow of North Sea oil, had nudged up
to $1.9960. It has been under $2 since March 5,
1976.
Hays may return to politics
St. Clairsville, Ohio — Former Rep. Wayne Flays
said yesterday he'll "run for something" in 1978,
two years after leaving his seat in Congress in the
midst of a sex scandal.
The 66-year-old politician, whose career in poli
tics began in 1939, said he will "make an an

"Some people want me to run for county au
ditor, but I'm pretty much disinclined to do that,"
he said.

Clairsville Citizens National Bank and lives with his
second wife, Pat, on a 200-acre horse and cattle
farm near Flushing, Ohio.
He resigned his congressional office after it was
reported that Elizabeth Ray, his mistress, was on
the public payroll as a House clerk. Hays acknow
ledged hisaffairwith Ray but denied any wrongdo
ing in use of public funds.
New York landmark to close
New York — Radio City Music Hall, that lavish
holdout from the vaudeville era that showcased
the high-kicking Rockettesand the family film, will
bow to changing times and tastes this spring and
shut its doors.
Alton Marshall, president of the parent Roc
kefeller Center Inc., said yesterday that the action
was forced by falling attendance and a projected
$3.5 million deficit in 1978.
Today's weather

Carter views D-Day beach
Omaha Beach, France — In biting, damp cold
under lowering clouds, President Jimmy Carter
walked atop the cliffs of this windswept beach
yesterday and paid homage to the thousands of
Allied soldiers who died in the D-Day invasion of
Normandy.
"We are proud of what we have done together,"
he told French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and a gathering of French and Americans. "We are
sure our friendship shall be everlasting."
Carter, Giscard d'Estaing and their wives gazed
out over Omaha Beach, where 2000 Allied soldiers
were killed on )une 6, 1944, in the invasion that
freed France from the Nazi grip.
Saluting it as "a site of tragedy, of heroism,"
Carter declared in the brief ceremony, "We are
determined with our allies that Europe's freedom
will never again be in danger."
Giscard d'Estaing told the chilled crowd: "All
this France remembers. She expresses her
gratitude for all those who fell for her freedom, to
their families and to all their friends."
The two presidents walked along the grass
covered cliff as the steel-blue surf of the English
Channel rolled up the beach 130 feet below.
At the time of the invasion, Giscard d'Estaing
was a teenage member of the French resistance
and Carter was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
Legislators in special session
Sacramento — A handful of Senate Democrats
held the key votes yesterday as state legislators
began a special session on property taxes, with
instructions from Gov. Edmund Brown ]r. to pass a
$1 billion bill this month.
In calling the special session in his State-of-the-
State speech, Brown gave only vague outlines of a
tax package, leaving unanswered the problems of
detail that have confounded the lawmakers for the
last year.
The central question remained the same one
that has deadlocked every legislative proposal on
taxes: should tax relief be shared equally by all
property owners or be based on income?
That question is likely to be answered in the
Senate, which twice last year defeated Brown
backed bills that offered the most relief to low
to-middle-income homeowners. Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said yesterday his house
wouldn't insist on any provisions that weren't ac
ceptable to a majority of the Senate.
Most liberals still favor some formula weighted
toward low-income families, like the Brown
backed bill. Conservatives want across-the-board
relief that helps middle-to-upper-income families.
Anti-violence drive gets support
Washington — The federal government, search
ing for ways to improve education and diminish

school violence, is getting behind the Rev. Jesse
lackson's inspirational program that involves pa
rents and community leaders in helping to moti
vate students.
lackson's "Push for Excellence, Inc." received
two grants totaling $45,000 yesterday, and HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano Jr., said he expects
more federal support to follow.
At the same time, Califano sent Congress a re
port cataloguing the high level of crime in schools.
The three-year, $2.4 million study showed the rate
of violence is leveling off, but remains "extremely
serious," particularly in urban areas, he said.
The study found that 2.4 million, or 11 percent of
the nation's 21 million high school students have
something stolen from them in a month's time,
and 282,000, or 1.3 percent, report being attacked.
About 12 percent of their teachers, or 120,000 also
are victimized by theft and,5200 teachers are as
saulted each month.
Mondale seeks party unity
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale,
who is emerging as the administration's emissary
to Democrats, says the party needs to pull itself
together if it is going to help itself and its presi
dent.
"The presidency requires an effective political
party," Mondale said. "A president requires a
good party."
In an interview aboard Air Force Two returning
from a party-boosting trip, Mondale said the
Democratic Party should be more supportive of
the people it elects.
"I don't mean an obsequious party," he added.
"It should be a strong and independent party, but
one that can help the president and the Congress
get their jobs done."
"A president can't do it all alone," he had told a
group of Florida Democrats earlier. "The job
wasn't finished when you elected him. He still
needs your help."
Mondale's mission to the party regulars casts
him in a sensitive role as he tries to win support for
a Democratic president, who after a year in the
White House still claims less than wholehearted
support from the party establishment.
U.S. dollar stages comeback
London —The dollar made a dramatic comeback
in world money markets yesterday after the United
States government bought dollars on the open
market to snap the currency out of its year-long
decline.
But some foreign exchange dealers called the
dollar's revival a "knee-jerk" reaction to U.S. in
tervention in the markets and said it could be
short-lived.
They said the causes of the dollar's troubles,
such as a foreign trade deficit that could total $27
billion for 1977, still remain to be dealt with.
Trading was cautious as many big foreign ex
change operators waited to see whether the U.S.

Federal Reserve Board would continue the aggres
sive purchase of dollars it began on the New York
market Wednesday.
As the business day neared its close in Europe
and opened in the United States, New York deal
ers said the Federal Reserve Board was again ac
tively intervening on the foreign exchanges.
One of the more remarkable turnabouts for the
dollar rame in London where the British pound
shed more than 7Vi cents to reach $1.8825 late in
the day, compared to $1.9590 late Wednesday.
On Wednesday morning the pound, buoyed re
cently by the flow of North Sea oil, had nudged up
to $1.9960. It has been under $2 since March 5,
1976.
Hays may return to politics
St. Clairsville, Ohio — Former Rep. Wayne Flays
said yesterday he'll "run for something" in 1978,
two years after leaving his seat in Congress in the
midst of a sex scandal.
The 66-year-old politician, whose career in poli

"Some people want me to run for county au

he said.
Hays is chairman of the board of the St.

He resigned his congressional office after it was

Carter views D-Day beach
Omaha Beach, France — In biting, damp cold
under lowering clouds, President Jimmy Carter
walked atop the cliffs of this windswept beach
yesterday and paid homage to the thousands of
Allied soldiers who died in the D-Day invasion of
Normandy.
"We are proud of what we have done together,"
he told French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and a gathering of French and Americans. "We are
sure our friendship shall be everlasting."
Carter, Giscard d'Estaing and their wives gazed
out over Omaha Beach, where 2000 Allied soldiers
were killed on )une 6, 1944, in the invasion that
freed France from the Nazi grip.
Saluting it as "a site of tragedy, of heroism,"
Carter declared in the brief ceremony, "We are
determined with our allies that Europe's freedom
will never again be in danger."
Giscard d'Estaing told the chilled crowd: "All
this France remembers. She expresses her
gratitude for all those who fell for her freedom, to
their families and to all their friends."
The two presidents walked along the grass
covered cliff as the steel-blue surf of the English
Channel rolled up the beach 130 feet below.
At the time of the invasion, Giscard d'Estaing
was a teenage member of the French resistance
and Carter was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
Legislators in special session
Sacramento — A handful of Senate Democrats
held the key votes yesterday as state legislators
began a special session on property taxes, with
instructions from Gov. Edmund Brown ]r. to pass a
$1 billion bill this month.
In calling the special session in his State-of-the-
State speech, Brown gave only vague outlines of a
tax package, leaving unanswered the problems of
detail that have confounded the lawmakers for the
last year.
The central question remained the same one
that has deadlocked every legislative proposal on
taxes: should tax relief be shared equally by all
property owners or be based on income?
That question is likely to be answered in the
Senate, which twice last year defeated Brown
backed bills that offered the most relief to low
to-middle-income homeowners. Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said yesterday his house
wouldn't insist on any provisions that weren't ac
ceptable to a majority of the Senate.
Most liberals still favor some formula weighted
toward low-income families, like the Brown
backed bill. Conservatives want across-the-board
relief that helps middle-to-upper-income families.
Anti-violence drive gets support
Washington — The federal government, search
ing for ways to improve education and diminish

school violence, is getting behind the Rev. Jesse
lackson's inspirational program that involves pa
rents and community leaders in helping to moti
vate students.
lackson's "Push for Excellence, Inc." received
two grants totaling $45,000 yesterday, and HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano Jr., said he expects
more federal support to follow.
At the same time, Califano sent Congress a re
port cataloguing the high level of crime in schools.
The three-year, $2.4 million study showed the rate
of violence is leveling off, but remains "extremely
serious," particularly in urban areas, he said.
The study found that 2.4 million, or 11 percent of
the nation's 21 million high school students have
something stolen from them in a month's time,
and 282,000, or 1.3 percent, report being attacked.
About 12 percent of their teachers, or 120,000 also
are victimized by theft and,5200 teachers are as
saulted each month.
Mondale seeks party unity
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale,
who is emerging as the administration's emissary
to Democrats, says the party needs to pull itself
together if it is going to help itself and its presi
dent.
"The presidency requires an effective political
party," Mondale said. "A president requires a
good party."
In an interview aboard Air Force Two returning
from a party-boosting trip, Mondale said the
Democratic Party should be more supportive of
the people it elects.
"I don't mean an obsequious party," he added.
"It should be a strong and independent party, but
one that can help the president and the Congress
get their jobs done."
"A president can't do it all alone," he had told a
group of Florida Democrats earlier. "The job
wasn't finished when you elected him. He still
needs your help."
Mondale's mission to the party regulars casts
him in a sensitive role as he tries to win support for
a Democratic president, who after a year in the
White House still claims less than wholehearted
support from the party establishment.
U.S. dollar stages comeback
London —The dollar made a dramatic comeback
in world money markets yesterday after the United
States government bought dollars on the open
market to snap the currency out of its year-long
decline.
But some foreign exchange dealers called the
dollar's revival a "knee-jerk" reaction to U.S. in
tervention in the markets and said it could be
short-lived.
They said the causes of the dollar's troubles,
such as a foreign trade deficit that could total $27
billion for 1977, still remain to be dealt with.
Trading was cautious as many big foreign ex
change operators waited to see whether the U.S.

Federal Reserve Board would continue the aggres
sive purchase of dollars it began on the New York
market Wednesday.
As the business day neared its close in Europe
and opened in the United States, New York deal
ers said the Federal Reserve Board was again ac
tively intervening on the foreign exchanges.
One of the more remarkable turnabouts for the
dollar rame in London where the British pound
shed more than 7Vi cents to reach $1.8825 late in
the day, compared to $1.9590 late Wednesday.
On Wednesday morning the pound, buoyed re
cently by the flow of North Sea oil, had nudged up
to $1.9960. It has been under $2 since March 5,
1976.
Hays may return to politics
St. Clairsville, Ohio — Former Rep. Wayne Flays
said yesterday he'll "run for something" in 1978,
two years after leaving his seat in Congress in the
midst of a sex scandal.
The 66-year-old politician, whose career in poli
tics began in 1939, said he will "make an an

Flays, who resigned from Congress on Sept. 1,
1976, said he may run for the Ohio Legislature, in
which he served as senator 1941-42. He said he also

commissioner's job in his native eastern Ohio.
"Some people want me to run for county au
ditor, but I'm pretty much disinclined to do that,"
he said.
Hays is chairman of the board of the St.

Carter views D-Day beach
Omaha Beach, France — In biting, damp cold
under lowering clouds, President Jimmy Carter
walked atop the cliffs of this windswept beach
yesterday and paid homage to the thousands of
Allied soldiers who died in the D-Day invasion of
Normandy.
"We are proud of what we have done together,"
he told French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and a gathering of French and Americans. "We are
sure our friendship shall be everlasting."
Carter, Giscard d'Estaing and their wives gazed
out over Omaha Beach, where 2000 Allied soldiers
were killed on )une 6, 1944, in the invasion that
freed France from the Nazi grip.
Saluting it as "a site of tragedy, of heroism,"
Carter declared in the brief ceremony, "We are
determined with our allies that Europe's freedom
will never again be in danger."
Giscard d'Estaing told the chilled crowd: "All
this France remembers. She expresses her
gratitude for all those who fell for her freedom, to
their families and to all their friends."
The two presidents walked along the grass
covered cliff as the steel-blue surf of the English
Channel rolled up the beach 130 feet below.
At the time of the invasion, Giscard d'Estaing
was a teenage member of the French resistance
and Carter was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval
Academy.
Legislators in special session
Sacramento — A handful of Senate Democrats
held the key votes yesterday as state legislators
began a special session on property taxes, with
instructions from Gov. Edmund Brown ]r. to pass a
$1 billion bill this month.
In calling the special session in his State-of-the-
State speech, Brown gave only vague outlines of a
tax package, leaving unanswered the problems of
detail that have confounded the lawmakers for the
last year.
The central question remained the same one
that has deadlocked every legislative proposal on
taxes: should tax relief be shared equally by all
property owners or be based on income?
That question is likely to be answered in the
Senate, which twice last year defeated Brown
backed bills that offered the most relief to low
to-middle-income homeowners. Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy said yesterday his house
wouldn't insist on any provisions that weren't ac
ceptable to a majority of the Senate.
Most liberals still favor some formula weighted
toward low-income families, like the Brown
backed bill. Conservatives want across-the-board
relief that helps middle-to-upper-income families.
Anti-violence drive gets support
Washington — The federal government, search
ing for ways to improve education and diminish

school violence, is getting behind the Rev. Jesse
lackson's inspirational program that involves pa
rents and community leaders in helping to moti
vate students.
lackson's "Push for Excellence, Inc." received
two grants totaling $45,000 yesterday, and HEW
Secretary Joseph Califano Jr., said he expects
more federal support to follow.
At the same time, Califano sent Congress a re
port cataloguing the high level of crime in schools.
The three-year, $2.4 million study showed the rate
of violence is leveling off, but remains "extremely
serious," particularly in urban areas, he said.
The study found that 2.4 million, or 11 percent of
the nation's 21 million high school students have
something stolen from them in a month's time,
and 282,000, or 1.3 percent, report being attacked.
About 12 percent of their teachers, or 120,000 also
are victimized by theft and,5200 teachers are as
saulted each month.
Mondale seeks party unity
Washington — Vice President Walter Mondale,
who is emerging as the administration's emissary
to Democrats, says the party needs to pull itself
together if it is going to help itself and its presi
dent.
"The presidency requires an effective political
party," Mondale said. "A president requires a
good party."
In an interview aboard Air Force Two returning
from a party-boosting trip, Mondale said the
Democratic Party should be more supportive of
the people it elects.
"I don't mean an obsequious party," he added.
"It should be a strong and independent party, but
one that can help the president and the Congress
get their jobs done."
"A president can't do it all alone," he had told a
group of Florida Democrats earlier. "The job
wasn't finished when you elected him. He still
needs your help."
Mondale's mission to the party regulars casts
him in a sensitive role as he tries to win support for
a Democratic president, who after a year in the
White House still claims less than wholehearted
support from the party establishment.
U.S. dollar stages comeback
London —The dollar made a dramatic comeback
in world money markets yesterday after the United
States government bought dollars on the open
market to snap the currency out of its year-long
decline.
But some foreign exchange dealers called the
dollar's revival a "knee-jerk" reaction to U.S. in
tervention in the markets and said it could be
short-lived.
They said the causes of the dollar's troubles,
such as a foreign trade deficit that could total $27
billion for 1977, still remain to be dealt with.
Trading was cautious as many big foreign ex
change operators waited to see whether the U.S.

Federal Reserve Board would continue the aggres
sive purchase of dollars it began on the New York
market Wednesday.
As the business day neared its close in Europe
and opened in the United States, New York deal
ers said the Federal Reserve Board was again ac
tively intervening on the foreign exchanges.
One of the more remarkable turnabouts for the
dollar rame in London where the British pound
shed more than 7Vi cents to reach $1.8825 late in
the day, compared to $1.9590 late Wednesday.
On Wednesday morning the pound, buoyed re
cently by the flow of North Sea oil, had nudged up
to $1.9960. It has been under $2 since March 5,
1976.
