The University has been served
with a subpoena on behalf of the
State Board of Medical Quality As
surance (BMQA) for information de
aling with the University's medical
services plan, the Daily has learned.
University administrators and a
BMQA official confirmed yesterday
that a subpoena was served on the
University Wednesday for a "very ex
tensive set of records" dealing with
the University's distribution of
physicians' professional fees.
The physicians involved are faculty
and clinical faculty of the Medical
School, according to John Schwartz,
University counsel.
The subpoena came as part of an
investigation into allegations re
ceived by the BMQA last October,
Robert Rowland, executive director
of BMQA, said.
The claims stated that the Medical
Center billing policy is in violation of
section 2008 of the California Busi
ness Code. The code states, in part,
that medical schools and institutions
may make "no charge for profes
sional services rendered patients."
Such complaints were filed with
the BMQA by Assoc. Cardiovascular
Surgery Prof. Eugene Dong and Dr.
Robert Weinmann, president of the
Union of American Physicians.
Weinmann is a clinical instructor of
surgery at the medical school.
University legal counsel has con
sistently expressed confidence in the
legality of the University billing pro
cedure.
But administrators expressed sur
prise over the subpoena yesterday,
saying the action was the first contact
the University has had with the
BMQA.
Schwartz said he assumes the sub
poena is in connection with a specific
complaint, but said the University
has been neither officially notified of
any complaint nor previously re
quested to make a formal or informal
statement on the billing matter.
"I was quite surprised that we
would be served with a subpoena on
the basis of an apparent complaint
without being contacted first by the
state agency," Schwartz said.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said he felt the
University would be willing to turn
over most material requested with
out a subpoena if the administration
were only notified of why the records
were needed.
Rosenzweig said the subpoena re
quested a long list of documents
which would be "very burdensome
and quite expensive" to collect for
the board.
He called the board subpoena "a

strange way to operate" since the
University had not been previously
asked for information.
But Rowland said the BMQA is just
trying to gather enough evidence to
decide if the charges have merit.
"When we conduct an investiga
tion, we choose what we think is the
best way to explore a certain prob
lem," Rowland said.
"We have some evidence and we
are just trying to get all the facts.
"There is no implication of guilt at
this time," Rowland said.
He said copies of complaints are
not routinely sent to the institution
being investigated. He added that in
vestigations are generally kept sec
ret, saying "it is not the public's bus
