# Rain, snow storms bring hopes that drought is easing
## Pressure patterns return to normal, but reservoirs are still low 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Gale-driven rain and snow
showers pounded California again yesterday to
further swell hopes that the two-year drought has lost
its clutch on the state.
"We are looking good," said Alex Cunningham,
deputy director of the Governor's Drought
Emergency Task Force. "This storm has dropped sig
nificant amounts of rain in northern California and
snow in the Sierra. But we are not out of the woods
yet."
He said reservoirs remain drier than last year de
spite the parade of Pacific storms which have
marched through California this winter.
"The crisis is not over," Cunningham said. "If for
some reason high pressure would establish itself
again and keep storms from coming in, we'd be in
worse shape than last year."
Still, the weather experts happily said the latest
furious storm was another solid piece of evidence
that pressure patterns — which control weather ac
tion — have returned to normal after a two-year
lapse.
"The high pressure finally is sitting south of San
Diego off Baja where it belongs," said Bill Exley of the
National Weather Service. "In the past two years, it
stayed just off the coast here and pushed most of the
storms to the north."
Season rainfall totals for several points eclipsed
normal amounts yesterday as showers slanted down
on most of California. More were expected through
out the night.
In San Francisco, a half-inch fell during the 24-hour
period, bringing the season total to 7.2 inches, just
under the normal for the date.
The storm saved its heaviest punch for the Sierra,
where it powdered the mountains with more than an
inch of snow each hour. Seventeen inches fell on
Donner Summit, boosting the season pack to 59 in
ches. Normal for the date is 44 inches.
Motorists were warned by the California Highway
Patrol to carry snow chains when driving on most

rrtountain roads. Drivers were advised to beware of
dangerous gusts on a windy stretch of Interstate 5
between Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
Traffic backed up for miles on Interstate 80 through
Donner Pass after heavy snows and zero visibility
forced the Highway Patrol to close a 65-mile stretch of
the major roadway yesterday.
Patrolmen said the road would remain closed "in
definitely."
The U.S. Forest Service issued avalanche warnings
for the Sierra's eastern slopes. An avalanche overran
a ski lift at Ski Shasta early yesterday morning, a resort
official said. No one was hurt in the 2 a.m. slide.
Gale warnings were posted up and down the coast,
but the Coast Guard said the 40-knot winds had not
caused any sea accidents.
Cunningham said there were 6.2 million acre feet
of water in the state's 30 major reservoirs yesterday.
Last year there were 8.1 million, compared to a 10-
year average of 13.3 million acre-feet.
Cunningham said underground water tables also
were seriously tapped during the past two record dry
years when users turned to wells for water.
"We are cautiously optimistic," he said. "If we
keep getting rains like we've had lately we could get
the reservoirs back to where they should be in one to
a few years.
"But right now we still have less water in the state
than we did a year ago, which was a record dry year."
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, 50 percent chance of
rain was predicted through today. The persistent
storm system off the coast that brought torrential
rains and gale-force winds earlier in the week
threatened to add even more inches to an already
above-average year. But the new rains were expected
to be lighter than the squall that knocked down
power lines and caused a fatal plane crash.
DePauw said showers may linger on in the area
until late afternoon today. But the clearing that fol
lows may be shortlived, with showers again a possibil
ity for Sunday.

further swell hopes that the two-year drought has lost
its clutch on the state.
"We are looking good," said Alex Cunningham,
deputy director of the Governor's Drought
Emergency Task Force. "This storm has dropped sig
nificant amounts of rain in northern California and
snow in the Sierra. But we are not out of the woods
yet."
He said reservoirs remain drier than last year de
spite the parade of Pacific storms which have
marched through California this winter.
"The crisis is not over," Cunningham said. "If for
some reason high pressure would establish itself
again and keep storms from coming in, we'd be in
worse shape than last year."
Still, the weather experts happily said the latest
furious storm was another solid piece of evidence
that pressure patterns — which control weather ac
tion — have returned to normal after a two-year
lapse.
"The high pressure finally is sitting south of San
Diego off Baja where it belongs," said Bill Exley of the
National Weather Service. "In the past two years, it
stayed just off the coast here and pushed most of the
storms to the north."
Season rainfall totals for several points eclipsed
normal amounts yesterday as showers slanted down
on most of California. More were expected through
out the night.
In San Francisco, a half-inch fell during the 24-hour
period, bringing the season total to 7.2 inches, just
under the normal for the date.
The storm saved its heaviest punch for the Sierra,
where it powdered the mountains with more than an
inch of snow each hour. Seventeen inches fell on
Donner Summit, boosting the season pack to 59 in
ches. Normal for the date is 44 inches.
Motorists were warned by the California Highway
Patrol to carry snow chains when driving on most

rrtountain roads. Drivers were advised to beware of
dangerous gusts on a windy stretch of Interstate 5
between Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
Traffic backed up for miles on Interstate 80 through
Donner Pass after heavy snows and zero visibility
forced the Highway Patrol to close a 65-mile stretch of
the major roadway yesterday.
Patrolmen said the road would remain closed "in
definitely."
The U.S. Forest Service issued avalanche warnings
for the Sierra's eastern slopes. An avalanche overran
a ski lift at Ski Shasta early yesterday morning, a resort
official said. No one was hurt in the 2 a.m. slide.
Gale warnings were posted up and down the coast,
but the Coast Guard said the 40-knot winds had not
caused any sea accidents.
Cunningham said there were 6.2 million acre feet
of water in the state's 30 major reservoirs yesterday.
Last year there were 8.1 million, compared to a 10-
year average of 13.3 million acre-feet.
Cunningham said underground water tables also
were seriously tapped during the past two record dry
years when users turned to wells for water.
"We are cautiously optimistic," he said. "If we
keep getting rains like we've had lately we could get
the reservoirs back to where they should be in one to
a few years.
"But right now we still have less water in the state
than we did a year ago, which was a record dry year."
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, 50 percent chance of
rain was predicted through today. The persistent
storm system off the coast that brought torrential
rains and gale-force winds earlier in the week
threatened to add even more inches to an already
above-average year. But the new rains were expected
to be lighter than the squall that knocked down
power lines and caused a fatal plane crash.
DePauw said showers may linger on in the area
until late afternoon today. But the clearing that fol
lows may be shortlived, with showers again a possibil
ity for Sunday.
