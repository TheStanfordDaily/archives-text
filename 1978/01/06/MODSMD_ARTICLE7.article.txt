# No human rights in Iran
## 
### 
Parviz Mobarez

Over the past two months we have
seen another example of the Carter
Administration "human rights" pol
icy. On Nov. 15, the Shah of Iran
came to the U.S. to visit jimmy Car
ter and, according to the western
media, "to discuss the issues of arms
deals, oil prices, and human rights."
I see the Shah's visit as a part of the
development of U.S. plans to further
suppress the Iranian people's strug
gle and to exploit the Iranian natural
resources.
There were widespread demonst
rations by Iranian students in the
U.S., exposing the Shah's visit. What
the news media failed to report
properly is what has happened in
Iran since Nov. 15.
On Nov. 15, thousands of Iranian
students and intellectuals gathered
in a sports arena in Arya Mehr Uni
versity to hear S. Soltanpour (an
anti-regime poet). The police at
tacked 2000 of them outside the
arena and arrested many of them. To
protest this police attack, people in
side staged a sit-in for hours.
On the next day of the protest,
hundreds of students marched from
Arya Mehr University toward Tehran
University. Many people joined the
demonstration. At one time near
Tehran University, there were more
than 10,000 demonstrators shouting
anti-dictorial, anti-IJ.S. slogans. On
their way, they broke out tne win
dows of banks and western com
panies.
Savak agents and police brutally at
tacked the demonstrators. Hundreds
of people were injured and arrested,
andatleastl6peoplewere killed. On
Nov. 17, two writers, Nemat Mir
zadeh and Homa Nategh, were pro
testing the police's brutal attack.
They were severely beaten up and
are now both in the hospital.
The writers and individuals who
oppose the regime are now under
constant attack at their homes. Their
only crime is that they publicly
criticize the conditions in Iran. On
Nov. 20, thousands gathered in
Tehran condemning and opposing
the fascist regime of the Shah. They
were attacked by Savak agents. Dur
ing this demonstration, many people
were murdered and hundreds
wounded and arrested.
On Nov. 22, 1500 gathered in a re
ligious anti-regime meeting outside
Tehran. They were brutally attacked
by hundreds of plain clothes police
men. Many people were injured, in
cluding Daryush Forouhar, and
Kazem Hasibi.
The regime has not been able to
crush this wide opposition. Univer
sities are closed, semi-official milit

ary curfew has been declared in many
cities, police and army troups are
present at every corner of the city
blocks.
This is not the first time that the
Iranian people have been massacred
by the Shah's police. Since the 1953
CIA engineered coup, the Iranian re
gime, the Shah's regime, has com
mitted numerous murders, the most
hideous example being the massacre
of over 5000 unarmed people cn June
5, 1963.
The most conscious elements of
the movement summed up the past
experience in that the only path to
freedom and independence is the

overthrow of the Shah's regime and
an end to foreign domination.
Since 1971 various revolutionary
organizations, i.e., Organization of
Iranian People Fedaii Guerrillas and
Organization of Mojahedeen of
People of Iran, have created a new
atmosphere of resistance and strug
gle in Iran. This new wave of mass
uprising in Iran has once again un
masked the fascist nature of the
U.S.-backed Shah's regime and
further exposed the phony "human
rights" campaign of the Carter Ad
ministration.

protest this police attack, people in
side staged a sit-in for hours.
On the next day of the protest,
hundreds of students marched from
Arya Mehr University toward Tehran
University. Many people joined the
demonstration. At one time near
Tehran University, there were more
than 10,000 demonstrators shouting
anti-dictorial, anti-IJ.S. slogans. On
their way, they broke out tne win
dows of banks and western com
panies.
Savak agents and police brutally at
tacked the demonstrators. Hundreds
of people were injured and arrested,
andatleastl6peoplewere killed. On
Nov. 17, two writers, Nemat Mir
zadeh and Homa Nategh, were pro
testing the police's brutal attack.
They were severely beaten up and
are now both in the hospital.
The writers and individuals who
oppose the regime are now under
constant attack at their homes. Their
only crime is that they publicly
criticize the conditions in Iran. On
Nov. 20, thousands gathered in
Tehran condemning and opposing
the fascist regime of the Shah. They
were attacked by Savak agents. Dur
ing this demonstration, many people
were murdered and hundreds
wounded and arrested.
On Nov. 22, 1500 gathered in a re
ligious anti-regime meeting outside
Tehran. They were brutally attacked
by hundreds of plain clothes police
men. Many people were injured, in
cluding Daryush Forouhar, and
Kazem Hasibi.
The regime has not been able to
crush this wide opposition. Univer
sities are closed, semi-official milit

ary curfew has been declared in many
cities, police and army troups are
present at every corner of the city
blocks.
This is not the first time that the
Iranian people have been massacred
by the Shah's police. Since the 1953
CIA engineered coup, the Iranian re
gime, the Shah's regime, has com
mitted numerous murders, the most
hideous example being the massacre
of over 5000 unarmed people cn June
5, 1963.
The most conscious elements of
the movement summed up the past
experience in that the only path to
freedom and independence is the

overthrow of the Shah's regime and
an end to foreign domination.
Since 1971 various revolutionary
organizations, i.e., Organization of
Iranian People Fedaii Guerrillas and
Organization of Mojahedeen of
People of Iran, have created a new
atmosphere of resistance and strug
gle in Iran. This new wave of mass
uprising in Iran has once again un
masked the fascist nature of the
U.S.-backed Shah's regime and
further exposed the phony "human
rights" campaign of the Carter Ad
ministration.

Over the past two months we have
seen another example of the Carter
Administration "human rights" pol
icy. On Nov. 15, the Shah of Iran
came to the U.S. to visit jimmy Car
ter and, according to the western
media, "to discuss the issues of arms
deals, oil prices, and human rights."
I see the Shah's visit as a part of the
development of U.S. plans to further
suppress the Iranian people's strug
gle and to exploit the Iranian natural
resources.
There were widespread demonst
rations by Iranian students in the
U.S., exposing the Shah's visit. What
the news media failed to report
properly is what has happened in
Iran since Nov. 15.
On Nov. 15, thousands of Iranian
students and intellectuals gathered
in a sports arena in Arya Mehr Uni
versity to hear S. Soltanpour (an
anti-regime poet). The police at
tacked 2000 of them outside the
arena and arrested many of them. To
protest this police attack, people in
