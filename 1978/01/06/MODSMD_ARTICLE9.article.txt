# Progress needed?

I was rather disturbed by Moshe
Aelion's column in the Daily (Friday,
Dec. 2), in which he outlines a very
dismal picture of the future of hu
manity and the universe in general.
Aelion rejects the ideal of conserva
tion, except in periods of shortage.
He instead urges that society em
brace the goal of constant progress:
this is to be achieved through an
ever-expanding technology, funded
by a redirection of society's re
sources, and making use of limitless
supplies of energy, which he thinks
can be found.
I will not argue with Aelion over
whether his program is actually feas
ible. (I am not as confident as he that
all the problems created by technol
ogy can be solved.) I question,
rather, whether his aims are in fact as
"noble" as he claims. In effect, he
has reduced humanity to a race of
cosmic vermin, preying on the uni
verse in their quest for higher and
higher standards of living, rather
than seeking to achieve a balance be
tween their needs and those of their
surroundings.
Of course hunger and illiteracy
must be eradicated, but we have al
ready the technological capability of
doing so, if only we choose to use it.
Should we reach the point where
these no longer pose an immediate
threat to anyone, however, a con
tinually rising standard of living will
no longer be desirable in itself.
"Constant progress in science and
technology is healthy for soci
ety. . according to Aelion; . .it
is essential that humanity shall keep
moving forward; that there will be no
decay. Otherwise, the middle ages

may return."
It is, in the first place, highly de
batable whether a society needs to
keep moving forward at all. Despite
the common use of biological
metaphors to describe them,
societies are not organisms. They do
not "blossom," neither do they "de
cay" or "die," though they may
change beyond recognition.
Consequently, constant develop
ment need be a goal only if the mem
bers of a society impose it upon
themselves. Personally, I doubt
whether it is in fact necessary to
"move forward," once everyone is
free of the fear of hunger and cold.
Even if we choose, in the belief that
stagnation is an evil, to seek prog
ress, however, technological ad
vance is not the only possibility. In
our effort to stave off the "middle
ages" (a highly misunderstood
period, by the way) we might instead
turn our attention to developing our
intellectual and artistic abilities, and
advancing pure science, since these
give more promise of general happi
ness than does mere technological
progress.
In essence, then, I refuse to accept
Aelion's assumption that our salva
tion lies only in technology. He sets
up as barriers to a more rational re
ordering of society using our present
technology to end hunger and illiter
acy, the twin monsters of bureauc
racy and big government, which, ac
cording to "uncontestable rules of
sociology and economics," can
never stop growing.
I can only reply that there are no
"uncontestable rules" in dealing
with human societies; bureaucracies
and governments have fallen before,
albeit with cataclysmic social up
heaval. Aelion's solution is only one
of many, and not, I think, the best or
"noblest."
The decision as to which road to
follow lies, as always, with us, if only
we can recognize the fact.

dismal picture of the future of hu
manity and the universe in general.
Aelion rejects the ideal of conserva
tion, except in periods of shortage.
He instead urges that society em
brace the goal of constant progress:
this is to be achieved through an
ever-expanding technology, funded
by a redirection of society's re
sources, and making use of limitless
supplies of energy, which he thinks
can be found.
I will not argue with Aelion over
whether his program is actually feas
ible. (I am not as confident as he that
all the problems created by technol
ogy can be solved.) I question,
rather, whether his aims are in fact as
"noble" as he claims. In effect, he
has reduced humanity to a race of
cosmic vermin, preying on the uni
verse in their quest for higher and
higher standards of living, rather
than seeking to achieve a balance be
tween their needs and those of their
surroundings.
Of course hunger and illiteracy
must be eradicated, but we have al
ready the technological capability of
doing so, if only we choose to use it.
Should we reach the point where
these no longer pose an immediate
threat to anyone, however, a con
tinually rising standard of living will
no longer be desirable in itself.
"Constant progress in science and
technology is healthy for soci
ety. . according to Aelion; . .it
is essential that humanity shall keep
moving forward; that there will be no
decay. Otherwise, the middle ages

may return."
It is, in the first place, highly de
batable whether a society needs to
keep moving forward at all. Despite
the common use of biological
metaphors to describe them,
societies are not organisms. They do
not "blossom," neither do they "de
cay" or "die," though they may
change beyond recognition.
Consequently, constant develop
ment need be a goal only if the mem
bers of a society impose it upon
themselves. Personally, I doubt
whether it is in fact necessary to
"move forward," once everyone is
free of the fear of hunger and cold.
Even if we choose, in the belief that
stagnation is an evil, to seek prog
ress, however, technological ad
vance is not the only possibility. In
our effort to stave off the "middle
ages" (a highly misunderstood
period, by the way) we might instead
turn our attention to developing our
intellectual and artistic abilities, and
advancing pure science, since these
give more promise of general happi
ness than does mere technological
progress.
In essence, then, I refuse to accept
Aelion's assumption that our salva
tion lies only in technology. He sets
up as barriers to a more rational re
ordering of society using our present
technology to end hunger and illiter
acy, the twin monsters of bureauc
racy and big government, which, ac
cording to "uncontestable rules of
sociology and economics," can
never stop growing.
I can only reply that there are no
"uncontestable rules" in dealing
with human societies; bureaucracies
and governments have fallen before,
albeit with cataclysmic social up
heaval. Aelion's solution is only one
of many, and not, I think, the best or
"noblest."
The decision as to which road to
follow lies, as always, with us, if only
we can recognize the fact.
