ATTENTION
SENIORS
Please check at the Academic Information Center immediately
regarding completion of your writing and distribution require
ments.
Last June, 15 seniors did not graduate because they had not com
pleted Writing and Distribution Requirements. They thought they had.
Please don't make the same mistake.
You are ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of these require
ments. We will be able to inform you of your status if you simply stop in
to check.
