# Trustees' statement assailed by Henkels
## 
### Kurt Cobb 
When the ASSU Senate meets to
morrow evening, it may hear a re
commendation that it refuse to
nominate any students to serve on a
new University Commission of In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
The CIR will be "most definitely a
method for pigeon-holing criticism"
on University investment policy,
charged Anne Henkels, ASSU cop
resident.
Henkels is one of the three stu
dents on the ad hoc Committee for
Investment Responsibility. That
committee proposed guidelines to
the Board of Trustees for the new
CIR.
At their meeting last month the
Trustees adopted modified
guidelines for the creation and oper
ation of a permanent CIR. The Trus
tees' guidelines, Henkels asserted,
"totally subordinate social responsi
bility to the maximization of profit."
The permanent CIR is slated to
have three student members, to be
nominated by the senate, and ap
proved by President Richard Lyman.
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, said the trus
tees do wish to vote on proxy issues
in a way that will maximize profits.
On divestment, Massy said, "The re
port speaks for itself."
Concerning divestment, the re
port says, "Where the trustees con
clude that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social in
jury, and the trustees conclude that:
— a desired change in the company's
activities would have a direct and
material effect in alleviating such in
jury.
— the trustees have exhausted their
practicable shareholder rights in
seeking to eliminate or reduce the
substantial social injury thereby
caused,
— the company has been afforded
the maximum reasonable opportun
ity to alter its activities,
— no alleviation of the substantial
social injury by the company is likely

within a reasonable time,
— the trustees will consider (divest
ment) . . . when such action is con
sistent with their fiduciary obliga
tions. . .
"The primary fiduciary responsibil
ity of the University trustees in in
vesting and managing the Universi
ty's endowment securities is to
maximize the financial return on
those resources . . the report
says.
Henkels said that a bigger em
phasis on social responsibility was
"something we (the three students
on the committee) had been fighting
for." She said that while the trustees
accepted the "bulk of the wording"
of the recommendation of the Ad
Hoc CIR, they were "very politically
clever" in altering only a few phrases
which entirely changed the spirit of
the recommendations and have
made the permanent committee a
"pointless" one.
Massy said, "I emphatically do not
agree it is a pointless (committee) or
that the spirit of the recommenda
tions have been violated."
"The commission is a positive
step," he said. "I call on the mem
bers of the community to make it
work."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said, "There isn't
any way to guard against a CIR that
doesn't-do its job." He added, how
ever, that if there is "sustained com
munity interest" in the subject of in
vestment responsibility the CIR will
not be able to act as a dustbin for

criticism.
The permanent CIK provides for a
hearing of grievances concerning
university investment policy from
any member of the University com
munity. Rosenzweig said that some
groups may take the first rejection of
any of their grievances as proof of the
committee's "invalidity, and thus
seek other means" for promoting
their stances.

guidelines for the creation and oper
ation of a permanent CIR. The Trus
tees' guidelines, Henkels asserted,
"totally subordinate social responsi
bility to the maximization of profit."
The permanent CIR is slated to
have three student members, to be
nominated by the senate, and ap
proved by President Richard Lyman.
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, said the trus
tees do wish to vote on proxy issues
in a way that will maximize profits.
On divestment, Massy said, "The re
port speaks for itself."
Concerning divestment, the re
port says, "Where the trustees con
clude that a company's activities or
policies cause substantial social in
jury, and the trustees conclude that:
— a desired change in the company's
activities would have a direct and
material effect in alleviating such in
jury.
— the trustees have exhausted their
practicable shareholder rights in
seeking to eliminate or reduce the
substantial social injury thereby
caused,
— the company has been afforded
the maximum reasonable opportun
ity to alter its activities,
— no alleviation of the substantial
social injury by the company is likely

within a reasonable time,
— the trustees will consider (divest
ment) . . . when such action is con
sistent with their fiduciary obliga
tions. . .
"The primary fiduciary responsibil
ity of the University trustees in in
vesting and managing the Universi
ty's endowment securities is to
maximize the financial return on
those resources . . the report
says.
Henkels said that a bigger em
phasis on social responsibility was
"something we (the three students
on the committee) had been fighting
for." She said that while the trustees
accepted the "bulk of the wording"
of the recommendation of the Ad
Hoc CIR, they were "very politically
clever" in altering only a few phrases
which entirely changed the spirit of
the recommendations and have
made the permanent committee a
"pointless" one.
Massy said, "I emphatically do not
agree it is a pointless (committee) or
that the spirit of the recommenda
tions have been violated."
"The commission is a positive
step," he said. "I call on the mem
bers of the community to make it
work."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said, "There isn't
any way to guard against a CIR that
doesn't-do its job." He added, how
ever, that if there is "sustained com
munity interest" in the subject of in
vestment responsibility the CIR will
not be able to act as a dustbin for

criticism.
The permanent CIK provides for a
hearing of grievances concerning
university investment policy from
any member of the University com
munity. Rosenzweig said that some
groups may take the first rejection of
any of their grievances as proof of the
committee's "invalidity, and thus
seek other means" for promoting
their stances.
When the ASSU Senate meets to
morrow evening, it may hear a re
commendation that it refuse to
nominate any students to serve on a
new University Commission of In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
The CIR will be "most definitely a
method for pigeon-holing criticism"
on University investment policy,
charged Anne Henkels, ASSU cop
resident.
Henkels is one of the three stu
dents on the ad hoc Committee for
Investment Responsibility. That
committee proposed guidelines to
the Board of Trustees for the new
CIR.
At their meeting last month the
Trustees adopted modified
guidelines for the creation and oper
ation of a permanent CIR. The Trus
tees' guidelines, Henkels asserted,
"totally subordinate social responsi
bility to the maximization of profit."
