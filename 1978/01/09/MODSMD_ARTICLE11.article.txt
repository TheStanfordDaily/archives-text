# Chilean support of military meaningless

The official, final results of the
plebiscite that took place in Chile on
Jan. 4 are in. According to the gov
ernment, 75 per cent of the ballots
were marked "yes," under the Chi
lean flag and the question that asked
the people to reject the "campaign of
international aggression against
Chile," as well as to back the military
regime in "its efforts to in
stitutionalize the country," while
only 20 per cent chose the "no" ans
wer under the black flag of anarch
ism.
What is the story behind this first
"election" in 52 months of military
rule in Chile?
On Dec. 22, General Pinochet an
nounced that a plebiscite would be
held within two weeks. A few days *

earlier, the U.N. General Assembly
had approved by a wide margin a re
solution (sponsored, among other
countries, by the United States) that
strongly condemned the Chilean
government's constant violations of
human rights. The Chilean people,
Pinochet said, would not have an
opportunity to show whether it
backed his government or "interna
tional aggression."
A decree, specifying the manner in
which the plebiscite would be im
plemented, was immediately sent to
the Comptroller, who has to approve
all legislation before it becomes ef
fective. To everybody's surprise, the
Comptroller refused to sign it, argu
ing that it was unconstitutional.
• Under the military's peculiar "sep

aration of power," executive power
is embodied in Pinochet, but the
legislative function is exercised by
the four-man junta. The decree had
only been signed by Pinochet and his
Minister of the Interior. Comptroller
Humeres, an elderly career civil ser
vant who had until now eagerly ap
proved every single law submitted to
him by the generals, merely asked
for the signatures of the three other
junta members.
Pinochet's reaction was swift; he
replaced Humeres with one of his
cabinet members. Sergio Fernandez,
the new comptroller, immediately
proceeded to approve the plebiscite.
By now, not only the opposition
and the Catholic Church had come
out strongly against the plebiscite,
but also within the junta, General
Leigh, of the Air Force, and Admiral
Merino, of the Navy, voiced serious
objections.
Pinochet, undisturbed, started a
nation-wide campaign for the "yes"
vote. The essence of his strategy was
to combine an appeal to the patriotic
feelings of the people ("si a Chile,"
"no a la agresion internacional")
with a personal endorsement that
would both legitimize four years of
military rule and give him (not the
junta) a blank check for the future.
To get an idea of the conditions
under which the campaign took
place, we have to keep in mind:
a) In Chile today, all political par
ties are banned, and their leaders, as
well as many members, have been
either killed, imprisoned or exiled.
b) The country is under state of
siege, and a curfew is effective. Any
political activity by opponents of the
regime is considered "treason" and
"subversion," and comes under the
jurisdiction of military tribunals.
c) There is strict press censorship.
Of the 11 dailies that were published

in Santiago five years ago, only five
remain, all subserviently pro
regime; of those, three belong to "El
Mercurio" and one to the govern
ment.
Although the press was flooded
with ads for the "yes" vote, people
that distributed pamphlets for a "no"
vote were immediately arrested.
Nonetheless, both the Left and the
Christian Democrats took part in var
ious public demonstrations against
the plebiscite.
The situation threatened to get out
of hand for the government, and "El
Mercurio" urged that the heated
political debate that had emerged be
shut off immediately after Jan. 4, as
the country was "not yet ready" for
open political discussion.
As far as the electoral procedures
themselves are concerned, there is
no way of knowing whether the offi
cial results are an accurate reflection
of the true vote. For one thing, there
are no voter registration lists; the
generals had them all destroyed two
years ago; for another, the votes
were counted only by government
officials, with no access whatsoever
to independent observers or opposi
tion representatives.
Anybody familiar with elections
will realize the tremendous pos
sibilities forfraud thecombination of
these two factors opens up. For all
we know, a huge majority may have
voted "no."
If the plebiscite is unconstitutional
even according to the junta's own
rules, the conditions under which
the campaign took place as well as
the impossibility of verifying the ac
curacy of the official results deprive
the announced outcome of any seri
ous meaning.

were counted only by government
officials, with no access whatsoever

The official, final results of the
plebiscite that took place in Chile on
Jan. 4 are in. According to the gov
ernment, 75 per cent of the ballots
were marked "yes," under the Chi
lean flag and the question that asked
the people to reject the "campaign of
international aggression against
Chile," as well as to back the military
regime in "its efforts to in
stitutionalize the country," while
only 20 per cent chose the "no" ans
wer under the black flag of anarch
ism.
What is the story behind this first
"election" in 52 months of military
rule in Chile?
On Dec. 22, General Pinochet an
nounced that a plebiscite would be
held within two weeks. A few days *

earlier, the U.N. General Assembly
had approved by a wide margin a re
solution (sponsored, among other
countries, by the United States) that
strongly condemned the Chilean
government's constant violations of
human rights. The Chilean people,
Pinochet said, would not have an
opportunity to show whether it
backed his government or "interna
tional aggression."
A decree, specifying the manner in
which the plebiscite would be im
plemented, was immediately sent to
the Comptroller, who has to approve
all legislation before it becomes ef
fective. To everybody's surprise, the
Comptroller refused to sign it, argu
ing that it was unconstitutional.
• Under the military's peculiar "sep

aration of power," executive power
is embodied in Pinochet, but the
legislative function is exercised by
the four-man junta. The decree had
only been signed by Pinochet and his
Minister of the Interior. Comptroller
Humeres, an elderly career civil ser
vant who had until now eagerly ap
proved every single law submitted to
him by the generals, merely asked
for the signatures of the three other
junta members.
Pinochet's reaction was swift; he
replaced Humeres with one of his
cabinet members. Sergio Fernandez,
the new comptroller, immediately
proceeded to approve the plebiscite.
By now, not only the opposition
and the Catholic Church had come
out strongly against the plebiscite,
but also within the junta, General
Leigh, of the Air Force, and Admiral
Merino, of the Navy, voiced serious
objections.
Pinochet, undisturbed, started a
nation-wide campaign for the "yes"
vote. The essence of his strategy was
to combine an appeal to the patriotic
feelings of the people ("si a Chile,"
"no a la agresion internacional")
with a personal endorsement that
would both legitimize four years of
military rule and give him (not the
junta) a blank check for the future.
To get an idea of the conditions
under which the campaign took
place, we have to keep in mind:
a) In Chile today, all political par
ties are banned, and their leaders, as
well as many members, have been
either killed, imprisoned or exiled.
b) The country is under state of
siege, and a curfew is effective. Any
political activity by opponents of the
regime is considered "treason" and
"subversion," and comes under the
