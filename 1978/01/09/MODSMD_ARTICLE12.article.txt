## Heart of the matter 
### 
Los Angeles Times

News organizations are currently
confronted with an issue that goes to
the integrity of the newsgathering
process. It is the attempt by police
and prosecutors, often joined by de
fense attorneys, to seek access to
their news files.
Much of this material is innocu
ous. But some of it is confidential,
gathered from sources promised the
protection of anonymity. Compelled
disclosure would undermine the
function of news organizations to
gather and disseminate information
to the public.
This is the principle at stake in a
case that now, after six long years,
will be argued in the U.S. Supreme
Court on Jan. 17.
It arose when Palo Alto police,
armed with a search warrant, ran
sacked the files of the Stanford Uni
versity newspaper, the Stanford
Daily. The police sought but did not
find photographs of a battle between
demonstrators and the police three
days earlier at the Stanford Univer
sity Hospital.
The newspaper sued on the
grounds that use of a search warrant
to invade its offices was improper
and was "needlessly destructive" of
First Amendment freedoms.
This position was upheld by a fed
eral district court and the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Dist.
Judge Robert Peckham decided that
the search was illegal because third
parties not suspected of crime are

entitled to stronger protection than
suspects against search and seizure.
This rule, he said, applies with par
ticular emphasis when First Amend
ment freedoms are involved. Pec
kham noted that a subpoena would
serve to obtain the same informa
tion.
In briefs filed with the Supreme
Court, attorneys for the university
newspaper presented a similar ar
gument. They contended that an in
discriminate search of files by police
permits them access to confidential
information on unrelated subjects.
For that reason, they argued, a sub
poena is preferred.
That argument no doubt has been
carefully calculated to persuade the
Supreme Court to adopt the district
court's view of the case. But it is a
fatally defective position. Judge Pec
kham's ruling was a welcome deci
sion, but it stopped short of reaching
the heart of the matter. Either action
— an indiscriminate hunt through
files under a search warrant or an
attempt by subpoena to obtain
selected material — would cripple
the gathering of news that depends
on confidential sources.
If news organizations bow either
to a search warrant or to a subpoena,
the message will be unmistakably
clear. It will tell confidential sources
that in talking to a news reporter,
they may be talking to the police.

will be argued in the U.S. Supreme
Court on Jan. 17.
It arose when Palo Alto police,
armed with a search warrant, ran
sacked the files of the Stanford Uni
versity newspaper, the Stanford
Daily. The police sought but did not
find photographs of a battle between
demonstrators and the police three
days earlier at the Stanford Univer
sity Hospital.
The newspaper sued on the
grounds that use of a search warrant
to invade its offices was improper
and was "needlessly destructive" of
First Amendment freedoms.
This position was upheld by a fed
eral district court and the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Dist.
Judge Robert Peckham decided that
the search was illegal because third
parties not suspected of crime are

entitled to stronger protection than
suspects against search and seizure.
This rule, he said, applies with par
ticular emphasis when First Amend
ment freedoms are involved. Pec
kham noted that a subpoena would
serve to obtain the same informa
tion.
In briefs filed with the Supreme
Court, attorneys for the university
newspaper presented a similar ar
gument. They contended that an in
discriminate search of files by police
permits them access to confidential
information on unrelated subjects.
For that reason, they argued, a sub
poena is preferred.
That argument no doubt has been
carefully calculated to persuade the
Supreme Court to adopt the district
court's view of the case. But it is a
fatally defective position. Judge Pec
kham's ruling was a welcome deci
sion, but it stopped short of reaching
the heart of the matter. Either action
— an indiscriminate hunt through
files under a search warrant or an
attempt by subpoena to obtain
selected material — would cripple
the gathering of news that depends
on confidential sources.
If news organizations bow either
to a search warrant or to a subpoena,
the message will be unmistakably
clear. It will tell confidential sources
that in talking to a news reporter,
they may be talking to the police.
