# Open Pac-8 season on dismal note
## Card cagers fall to Oregon, OSU 
### David Georgette 
Eugene, Ore. — "I don't un
derstand how the game got
away from us," said Stanford
forward Kimberly Belton. "We
were playing in the game. They
just took it away from us."
Never trailing by more than
eight points at any time, and
down by two with two minutes
left, the Cardinals had their bid
for victory in roaring McAr
thur Court ended by a seven
to-one Oregon scoring run.
The Ducks finished on top
74-64, and combined with Stan
ford's possessive 48-47 loss to
Oregon State Friday night, the
Cards are now 0-2 in the
Pacific-8.
Despite the larger margin of
defeat Saturday, the Cards' ef
fort against the Ducks was far
better than- their performance
against OSU.
"I thought our team played
exceptionally well except for
one stretch," said coach Dick
Dißiaso after the Oregon
game. "It was a much better
effort than last night."
Offensive execution
Most responsible for the dif
ference in Stanford's showing
was the offensive execution
Saturday night. Against the
Beavers, the Cardinals sud
denly found offense. Intensity
can take a team a long way, but
with the execution lacking, de
termination won't always put
the ball through the hoop.
Stanford managed only 18
field goals in 40 minutes
against the Beavers. "The of
fensive performance of Stan
ford was without question the
worst of the year," said Di-
Biaso. "I don't think we ever
got into our offensive syn
chronization."
Dißiaso said the poor of
fense resulted from good
Beaver defense and a lack of
patience and a lack of compo
sure by the Cards.
Against the Ducks though,
the Cards were able to run
their offense. "Oregon wasn't
nearly as quick as Oregon
State," said Card guard Daryle
Morgan, who started his first
game Saturday. "Oregon State
full-court- or three-quarter
court-pressed us the whole
game."
Stanford was more discip

lined against Oregon, and was
able to work the ball inside,
particularly to Belton who
finished as the game's top
scorer with 18 points, 11 of
them in the first half.
The Cards took a 38-35 lead
into the locker room as Paul
Ciovacchini canned a jumper
from the top of the circle at the
buzzer.
In the second half, Oregon
guards applied more pressure
on Stanford's guards. "The
story of the game was that our
guys played harder in the sec
ond half," said Oregon coach
Dick Harter.
"It was two different games.
We took bad shots and didn't
play with force in the first half.
There was no question in the
second half we competed."
'Emotionally drained'
"I think I was emotionally
drained from last night from
chasing (Cal's Gene) Ransom,"
said Oregon's Mike Drum
mond. "In the second half, we
put on better ball pressure."
Oregon held Stanford to 10
points in the first 13 minutes of
the second half in running up a
56-48 lead. Most of the Ducks'
points during thatstretch came
from freshman forward Phil
Barner, who had three inside
baskets and guard John Murray
who popped three 20-footers.
Stanford rallied to pull
within 62-60 with 1:54 remain
ing when Oregon guard Rob
Closs hit two free throws and
followed up with a breakaway
lay-in to send Oregon on the
way to an eight point lead with
22 seconds left.
A late second half comeback
by the Cards Friday had almost
pulled out the Oregon State
game. Trailing 42-33 with eight
minutes remaining and with
out a point for over six mi
nutes, the Cards ran off eight
straight points to close within
one.
Dißiaso's views
"The reason we made a run
at them was because Jeff Ryan
made some jumpshots, and
then Jeff McHugh snuck in
there for a few," said Dißiaso.
Beaver coach Ralph Miller
ordered a passing stall by OSU
after Stanford's scoring run.
Eschewing the ire of the nor
mally boisterous Beaver

crowd, OSU ran the clock
down for a few minutes before
losing the ball but the Cardi
nals couldn't score.
Then freshman Mark Rad
ford, who finished with a
game-high 16 points, got a
lay-in with under two minutes
to go, for a three point lead.
Stanford came back three
times to close within a single
point and once had the ball
with the chance to take the
lead before losing it to the
Beavers. A four-for-four per
formance from the free throw
line kept the Beavers in front in
the last minute.
The Cards problems on of
fense were evident from the
outset of the game when they
turned the ball over a half
dozen times in the opening
seven minutes to the Beaver
pressure defense.
"I think it (the Beaver's pos

sessive press) definitely did
bother Stanford. There was no
question about it," said Miller.
"We were hoping it would."
"If one guy misses an as
signment on breaking a press,"
said Morgan, "that can blow
the whole thing."
Stanford ended up with 22
turnovers against the Beavers
but Dißiaso said "It's not the
number of turnovers you have,
it's the type of turnovers. We
were not where we were sup
posed to be."
Miller said he felt the mis
takes by his team kept the
game close. "We ran a com
pletely new offense. They gave
us easy shots. We just threw
the ball away. We ran well in
the first half, but we missed
four layups."

During the first half, which
ended in a 22-22 tie, the Beav
ers' rebounding did not please
Miller either. "We kept them
off the boards the whole sec
ond half. If we had done that
the first half we wouldn't have
had to sweat this one out."
Beside the two losses, Stan
ford was dealt a setback when
forward Jay Carter reinjured a
thumb which had been hurt
during last month's Rainbow
Classic.
"Offensively, he's just not
there," said Dißiaso. "The
thumb hurts. He's not ready to
handle the ball well."
"In Carter's absence, Belton
and George Schader, who had
12 points against Oregon,
played together for the first
time in quite a while," said Di-
Biaso. Having regained his
confidence, Schader said, "I
was looking a little bit more to
contributing offensively."
The showing against the
Ducks left Dißiaso less disap
pointed than he had been on
Friday, but opening the season
with two losses on the road did
not do much for helping Cards'
hopes for a successful season.
"I think the home court is
very important," said Dißiaso.
"The team that wins away is the
team with the best chance to
win the league."
