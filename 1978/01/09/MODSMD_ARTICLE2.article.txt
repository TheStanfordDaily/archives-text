# Laundry service faces shortage problem

Inventory shortages have caused
the ASSU-run laundry service to run
out of linens several times this year.
But Bill Lape, coordinator of the ser
vice, denies that short-sheeting has
been a big problem.
Difficulty in meeting the ASSU's
contract obligations with Exchange
Linen Service of San Jose, which ac
tually launders the sheets and pil
lowcases, led to the reduced stock.
Some 750 students pay $15 per
quarter or $40 per year to use the
service.
One subscriber complained, "I

signed up for linen service for con
venience. Well, it's not as conve
nient as I had expected; not by a long
shot."
The ASSU took over laundry ser
vice this year at the University's re
quest, after problems were experi
enced with National Linen Service,
which had formerly held the conces
sion.
Lape gave several reasons for the
change. National Linen Service
would have charged each subscriber
more than $50 per year, and would
not have offered quarterly contracts.
In addition, the old service suffered

from "inefficiency," he said.
"National had to charge more, be
cause they suffered from rip-offs.
They had students running the ser
vice, and had no one from National
on campus, so the controls were
pretty loose. Since ASSU has
budgeted less than a 5 percent loss
and we run the service, we are con
cerned with tighter controls," Lape
said.
When the ASSU began its middle
man role with Exchange Linen Ser
vice, the company required that at
least 30 percent of the ASSU inven
• tory be laundered each week.
So the laundry service decided to
use three sets of linen: one on stu
dent beds, one on the shelves and
one being laundered at any given
time. The idea was that when the
students returned their third of the
linen each week, the ASSU would be
able to meet the 30 percent require
ment.
But only 70 to 75 percent of the
subscribers turn in their linen each
week for laundering, Lape said. The
ASSU was thus only sendingabout2s
percent of its total stock to Exchange,
but paying for 30 percent. That
hadn't been expected.
"Exchange was reaMy nice about
helping us out with this misun
derstanding," Lape remarked. "Ac
tually, all that requirement means is
that we have to keep our inventory
low."
The number of sheets on the shelf
was cut back so the number laun
dered would become 30 percent of
the total. Lape said the smaller inven
tory has helped th® linen program to
break even.
The cost of each student's weekly
service is $1.15, with 97 cents being
spent on laundering and the remain
der on business expenses.
Several students requested re
funds after their parents arranged for

the linen service and the students
then found they didn't need it.
However, refunds will not be gi
ven, because of the ASSU's budget
ing and the 30 percent requirement
by Exchange, Lape said.
Another problem is that most beds
in Stanford dorms are extra long, but
the sheets aren't.
"Exchange would have ordered us
extra long sheets, but we contracted
on such short notice, there was not
time. I hope we will have longer
sheets next year," Lape said.

Some students here have been dissatisfied with the ASSU linen service. Bill Lape,
linen service director, says he hopes the bugs will be out of the system soon.
