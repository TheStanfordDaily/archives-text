small Stanford men's and wo
men's contingent to Berkeley
Saturday for the second day of
competition at the California
Invitational. No team scoring
was maintained, and the meet,

Gaughran, "was low pres
sure."
Nevertheless, many fine ef
forts were turned in by Cardi
nal swimmers. In the women's
competition, Olympic gold
medalist Kim Peyton and
freshman Zena Herrmann each
captured two events. Peyton
won the 50 yd. free (25.4) and
the 200 yd. free (1:55.0) while
Herrmann edged Margot
Hagstette in the 100 yd. fly
(1:00) and touched out another

teammate, Laura Raymond, in
the 50 yd. backstroke (30.6).
In the men's competition,
Bruner cruised under national
qualifying standards in the 200
yd. fly (1:50.2) and in the 1650
yd. freestyle (15:48.4). He was
pushed by teammates Paul
Hartloff and fast improving
Monte Brown (16:01.5) in the
1650 and by Cal's Olympic
finalist, Par Arvidsson, in the
200 fly (1:52.3).
)on Powell, Stanford's
6-foot-4 sprinter, touched out
Cal's Paul Sims to cop the 100
yd. freestyle, pasting a fast 46.3
