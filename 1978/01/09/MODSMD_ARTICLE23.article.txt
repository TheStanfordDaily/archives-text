# Bay Area arts & entertainment ACT goes 'Home' with Agee
## 
### 
"All the Way Home," the Pulitzer Prize
winning play by Tad Mosel based on James
Agee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "A Death in
the Family, joins the American Conservatory
Theater repertory Jan. 17. Four reduced-rate
public preview performances beginning Jan. 11
precede the official opening at the Geary.
Acclaimed in its initial Broadway run as "the
miracle on 44th Street" because of the public's
phenomenal enthusiasm for a play which origi
nally seemed to have little appeal, "All the Way
Home found its audience and became a popu
lar hit of the time. Receipt of the Pulitzer for the
play in 1961, following earlier presentation of
the coveted award (posthumously) to Agee for
the novel, certainly added to its success.
"All the Way Home" is the tenth play so hon-

ored that A.C.T. has presented in San Francisco,
with Edward Hastings directing half of them,
including this most recent addition to the reper
tory.
Narrowing its focus to the events of four days
in the life of a rural southern family, the decep
tively simple drama capsulizes on the one hand
and universalizes on the other the implications
of mortality and procreation inherent in such a
unit.
A sudden and unexpected death in the Follet
family circa 1915 provides the dramatic impetus
for deep realizations of the love and values they
shared, which also bind together most families.
Jay O. Sanders, Barbara Dirickson and David
Bransten as their son comprise the immediate
family.
