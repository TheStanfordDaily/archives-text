# Records: the year's best
## 
### 
Another year has passed, during
which time a deluge of new albums
were issued. Here's a list of this
year's most noteworthy albums and
reasons why they deserve this dis
tinction.
The Alan Parsons Project — I
Robot, Arista
Alan Parsons, who previously en
gineered such notable albums as
The Beatles' "Abbey Road" and Pink
Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon,"
achieves personal success, both
musically and commercially, with
this, the second concept work which
he has conceived, produced, en
gineered and co-written. The music
ranges from mediocre to excellent
and is, as could be expected, spot
lessly produced. Perhaps we are
witnessing the start of a new move
ment in music to let the people who
actually produce what we hear get
more credit for their work.
Lol Creme/Kevin Godley — Con
sequences, Mercury
An ambitious three-record set by
two former members of 10cc. Origi
nally written to demonstrate the
capabilities of the gizmo, an instru
ment developed by Godley and
Creme to accurately synthesize
orchestral sounds from a guitar, this
set is a concept work, describing the
effects of a storm. Along with the
musical passages, some of which are
quite good, the records are filled
with narration by Peter Cook. Espe
cially interesting is the vocal work by
guest singer Sarah Vaughan.
Bread — Lost Without Your Love,
Elektra
This album marks the return to the
music scene of a group who, before
breaking up in 1973, produced one
of the longest and highest quality
strings of hits in the early 19705. Con
trary to what one might infer from
the album's somewhat sluggish

sales, the music is, overall, on a par
with the immensely successful pre
breakup Bread albums.
Cat Stevens — Izitso, A&M
After two disastrous albums,
"Foreigner" and "Numbers," which
were separated by one fair album,
"Buddha and the Chocolate Box," Cat
Stevens has produced an album of
less philosophical and less muddled
songs, and the results are predicta
bly good. A large number of the
songs are reminiscent, to the extent
that "I Never Wanted to be a Star"
cleverly incorporates parts of Ste
vens' early works, a definite
reemergence of the style which
brought Cat Stevens deserved fame
in the first place.
James Taylor — J.T., Columbia
Perhaps Taylor's biggest album
ever, and an abrupt end to the lull in
his career which started after his last
peak album, in 1970, "Sweet Baby
James." While most of the songs are
simply typical, pleasant Taylor fare,
it's nice to see Taylor enjoying a bit
of earned success.
Paul Simon — Greatest Hits, Etc.,
Columbia
An album noteworthy in that it
marks a period of well over two years
since one of pop music's more
talented writers has come out with
anything new, with the exception of
two minor songs. A well-balanced
collection, this album still does little
to quell claims that Simon's best
work, with few exceptions, was
done while with Art Garfunkel. Inci
dentally, rumor has it that a Simon
and Garfunkel and James Taylor
single is in the making.
Peter Gabriel — Peter Gabriel, At
lantic
A masterful first album by the

former vocalist and keystone
member of Genesis. Gabriel's wares
are musically enticing, as are
Genesis', but Gabriel's are much
more accessible. Where we formerly
only had Genesis, we now have
Genesis (still a viable force with its
post-Gabriel "Wind and Wuther
ing") and Gabriel. Who says the sum
of the parts is never greater than the
whole?
The Carpenters — Passage, A&M
No longer simply the sugar-coated
love song singing duet, the Carpen
ters have, with this album, diver
sified into a variety of types of music,
including, of all things, opera and
the "spacey" "Calling Occupants of
Interplanetary Craft." Richard Car
penter retains his knack for produc
ing a quality product and Karen Car
penter's voice remains appealing,
but the music produced deviates
from the conservatism of earlier
Carpenters albums. An album which
should win the Carpenters a larger
following.
Fleetwood Mac — Rumours,
Warner Brothers
They say that the big worry at
Warner Brothers nowadays is if
there is anyone left who doesn't al
ready own a copy of "Rumours."
Any album that remains number one
for as many weeks as this one, and
sells as many copies as this one,
must have something going for it.
And it does: catchy tunes and ex
traordinary accessibility.
The Sex Pistols — Never Mind The
Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols,
Warner Brothers
The first non-import album by the
most commented upon members of
the new wave "punk" rock. The
music is loud, raw, energetic, and —

with few exceptions, mostly lyrical
— without a great deal of musical
merit. Important as a milestone
album in this new direction in rock
music.
Emerson, Lake & Palmer — Works
(Vols. I and II), Atlantic
After a three-year hiatus, one of
rock's most talented groups returns
in triumphant, style. The complete
spectrum of musical tastes is rep
resented on these albums, from
classical (Emerson's piano concerto
with the London Philharmonic) to
ballads to jazz to hard rock. Two al
bums which would contribute toany
record collection.
Crosby, Stills & Nash — CSN, At
lantic
This year's biggest reunion pro
duced an album which, contrary to
what many people forcasted, is
comparable in quality to Crosby,
Stills and Nash's previous albums.
Quite palatable, though sometimes
mundane, in musical content, this
album is a wish fulfilled for Crosby,
Stills and Nash fans.
Yes — Going For The One, Atlantic
Keyboardist Rick Wakeman is
back with Yes, resulting in the best,
most satisfying Yes album to date.
With the exception of the overtly
commercial title track, each tune
demonstrates Yes' ability to produce
richly textured, sophisticated rock.
Lynyrd Skynyrd — Street Sur
vivors, MCA
The first, and best album by a
country rock group which following
was continuing to grow. MCA origi
nally released this album with a
cover depicting the group engulfed
in flames, but after the tragic acci
dent reissued the album with a pic
ture of the group minus flames.
