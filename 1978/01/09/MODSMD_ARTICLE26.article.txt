# An 'Oliver' which tries too hard
## 
### 
The single major flaw which can be laid at the doorstep of the
production behind the latest dramatic effort of Theatreworks at
the Palo Alto Community Theatre is that everyone is trying too
hard. The musical "Oliver," which has been playing to sizable
audiences since Christmas and will continue until )an. 14, has
been so elaborated upon, that each audience sits numbed from
the splendid impact of the first part and hence misses most of the
even better second act. As they stumble outside at the end, the
bewitched people knowat gut le 'el that they've really seen some
thing, although they're not certai i what it is.
Both the director (Robert Kelley) and light designer (Clay Wil
liams) frequently use techniques which hit the audience like a
shotgun blast, rather than those of a subtler nature. On the other
hand, accolades are merited by th«> ingenious constructivistic
set (its harsh skeletal nature revealing the characteristics of
lower-class London in 1830) of Bruce McLeod, the professional
movements of the entire cast (even to the carefully prepared
chase scenes) supplied by choreographer Linda Webster, and the
excellence of the hidden orchestra being conducted by Joseph
Haletky.
The acting is generally fine with several examples of such com
plete characterization in some of the smaller (notably that of Mrs.
Sowerberry, Noah Claypole, Mrs. Bedwin, and the Old Woman)
roles. Peter Brandt (Oliver Twist) dances and performs well, but
in fact sings his way into one's heart with his rendition of "Where
is Love?". The Arful Dodger (Bradford Minkoff) is consistently
excellent in every aspect of his part, except for hisforgetfulnessat
singing (when he doesn't remember to inhale a full breath and so
loses 75 percent of his volume). The love team of Bill (Kurt Oliver)
and Nancy (Terri Berringer) work so well together that one is
tempted to call this production a tragedy in the Romantic style,
versus a musical comedy-drama.
The fine support of the townspeople is matched by the en
thusiasm of younger members of the cast in this story about a
boy's attempts to conform with his world and seek out his rightful
place in it. This musical adaption of Dickens' novel with its lively
lyrics, funny dialogue and sad viewpoint of the lower half of
civilization has been placed into a production vehicle adequate in
every aspect and superb in many and is well worth its viewing.
