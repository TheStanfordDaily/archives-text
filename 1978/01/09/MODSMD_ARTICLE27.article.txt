# Consumers pessimistic on business conditions

Ann Arbor, Mich. (AP) â€”
Consumers were more pes
simisticabout general business
conditions at the end of 1977
than they were last summer or
a year ago, according to the
University of Michigan's quar
terly Survey of Consumer At
titudes.
Restoring public confidence
in government economic
policies is essential to reverse
the trend, researchers said yes
terday.
The survey, based on inter
views with 1280 Americans ac
ross the country last fall,
showed a decline in confi
dence in the government's
policies to curb inflation and to
boost employment.
"The increased confidence
in government economic pol
icy which was evident in early
1977 as President Jimmy Carter
entered office has now been
entirely reversed," a report on
the survey said.
It noted that the biggest drop
in consumer attitudes was
among families with annual in
come of less than $15,000.

Richard Curtin and George
Katona of the Survey Research
Center said consumers mod
erated their spending in the
last three months of 1977 but
remained generally optimistic
about their personal finances,
with attitudes in that area bet
ter than they were a year ago.
But about half of the people
most recently surveyed said
they had heard of unfavorable
business developments in De
cember 1977, compared with
about one third of the people
queried three months earlier
who said they had heard of
general economic troubles.
Eleven percent of respon
dents said they believed the
government was doing a
"good job" in dealing with
economic problems, down
from 19 percent who felt that
way in the previous survey.
About 24 percent in the re
cent survey said they felt the
government was doing a "poor
job" in the economic area,
compared with 15 percent who
expressed that opinion in the
earlier survey.
