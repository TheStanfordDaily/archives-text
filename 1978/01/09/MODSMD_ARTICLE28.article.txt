Israeli withdrawal in question
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Menahem Begin said
yesterday Israel may withdraw its offer to return all
of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt if Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat refuses to allow existing
lewish settlements to remain there.
Begin spoke to a gathering of right-wing suppor
ters in Tel Aviv two hours after the Israeli cabinet
voted in Jerusalem to "strengthen" existing set
tlements in the Sinai but decided not to build new
ones.
It Sadat continues to demand a total civilian
pullout under a peace agreement, Begin said, Is
rael may demand a change in its borders on the
Sinai, which it captured from Egypt in the 1967
Mideast War. He did not elaborate but clearly
meant Israel would try to make the settlements
part of its own territory.
Referring to Sadat's demand, reported last
week, that Israel abandon its Sinai outposts, Begin
said: "The Israelis do not burn settlements. They
build settlements and keep them."
In other developments yesterday:
— A hand grenade exploded in a crowded bus
station in Arab East Jerusalem, slightly injuring
three persons, Israeli police said.
— Sadat, returning to Egypt from talks with
Sudanese President Jaafar el-Numairi, told repor
ters he is undecided and "must see details" of an
Israeli plan for an Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian
committee to administer the occupied West Bank
of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip until resi
dents decide their own status in a referendum.
Argentine-Chilean conflict looms
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentine warships
sailed south yesterday toward the tip of South
America where a dispute with Chile over three tiny
islands threatens to expand into a conflict over
Chilean rights in the Atlantic Ocean.
Both Argentina and Chile are ruled by right-wing
military governments.
The Argentine navy said it had deployed the
aircraft c arrier 25 de Mayo, two submarines, troop
ships and escort and auxiliary vessels. Spokesmen
refused to pinpoint the vessels' positions.
A Buenos Aires newspaper columnist with close
government contacts said the navy was preparing
to make "ac ts of possession" in the area. How
ever, other observers do not believe Argentina
intends to occupy the islands.
In Santiago, the Chilean government news
paper Fl Cronista said a Foreign Ministry spokes
man refused to comment on the Argentine naval
ac tion, but added, "Chile will not accept provoca

tions."
Both Chile and Argentina requested British ar
bitration in 1973, and early in 1977 Britain ruled that
the islands belong to Chile. Argentine officials said
privately that Chile could have the windblown
flyspecks, inhabited by a few Chilean sheepher
ders.
But soon after the ruling, the Chilean junta is
sued new maps of the region. It used the islands as
a baseline to extend Chile's 200-mile economic
zone into the Atlantic.
African arms spending soars
Johannesburg, South Africa — Studies show that
military spending is soaring in black Africa, a part
of the world plagued by civil conflicts, territorial
disputes and wars of liberation.
Armies are being enlarged and new weapons
acquired by nations in an area stretching from
Mauritania in West Africa across to the strategic
Horn of East Africa and south to the borders of
white-governed southern Africa, according to the
studies, both official and unofficial.
Total military spending in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding white-ruled South Africa and Rhodesia,
is now estimated at about $3.7 billion a year, al
most four times the outlay three years ago. This
estimate is based on figures published by the In
ternational Institute for Strategic Studies in Lon
don and on reports from various reliable but unof
ficial sources.
By comparison, defense spending in South Af
rica now stands at $1.9 billion, and in Rhodesia the
defense budget totals $159 million.
According to the London institute and the other
sources, the number of black Africans under arms
has risen from an estimated 475,000 three years
ago to some 600,000 now.
The rising military outlays are not only a sign of
increasingly serious conflicts across this vast con
tinent. They also reflect the large number of milit
ary governments in black Africa and the need to
keep their armed forces content.
Higher aircraft sales predicted
Washington — The aircraft industry will have a
strong year as the economy continues to grow, but
output should drop off in the auto industry, the
Commerce Department said yesterday in its an
nual industrial outlook report.
"Of the 10 largest manufacturing industries in
terms of shipments, aircraft are expected to show
the biggest gain — up 30 percent over 1977 — in
value of shipments," the report said.

"Others in the top 10 show expected gains of 12
percent except in automobiles, which are ex
pected to drop 1 percent and truck and chassis,
which are expected to dip 4 percent," it said.
Retail sales in 1978 are expected to be $785 bill
ion,almost 10 percent above 1977, thedepartment
said.
The increases do not account for inflation,
which is forecast to be about (> percent again this
year.
Commenting on the overall economy, a Com
merce Department economist said it should con
tinue growing at a rate of about 4 to 5 percent this
year. But she said it could begin tapering off at the
end of the year without further government ac
tion.
Courtenay Slater, chief department economist,
said the growth rate should be strong enough to
reduce unemployment from about 7 percent cur
rently to a 6!/j-percent average for the year.
'Record' ski season in sight
What a difference a year makes. Some western
ski resort operators are already saying that this will
be a record season. Last year most of them cried
disaster as winter snows leapfrogged trie West and
smothered the nation's Midwest and East.
The weather last year kept both snow and skiers
off the slopes and cash registers were as dry as the
mountainsides.
This year, glowing reports of deep snow bases,
full reservations and record expectations come
from the luxury ski spas from Big Mountain in
Montana to Squaw Valley in California, from
Snoqualmie Summit in Washington to Taos Ski
Valley in New Mexico.
But there are still a few grim spots.
Holiday Hill in the San Gabriel Mountains east of
Los Angeles has had rain, but little snow. Saturday
was the area's first fully operational day of the
season.
The rest of the California ski situation is rated
excellent with the best Sierra Nevada snowpack in
four seasons after two years of severe drought.
Today's weather
Rain continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Rain locally heavy at times through this morning.
Little temperature change. Lows mid-40s to low
50s. Highs mid-50s to low 60s. Gale warning for
south winds increasing to 20 to 40 mph through
today. Chance of rain 80 percent today, 80 percent
tonight.

'Record' ski season in sight
What a difference a year makes. Some western
ski resort operators are already saying that this will
be a record season. Last year most of them cried
disaster as winter snows leapfrogged trie West and
smothered the nation's Midwest and East.
The weather last year kept both snow and skiers
off the slopes and cash registers were as dry as the
mountainsides.
This year, glowing reports of deep snow bases,
full reservations and record expectations come
from the luxury ski spas from Big Mountain in
Montana to Squaw Valley in California, from
Snoqualmie Summit in Washington to Taos Ski
Valley in New Mexico.
But there are still a few grim spots.
Holiday Hill in the San Gabriel Mountains east of
Los Angeles has had rain, but little snow. Saturday
was the area's first fully operational day of the
season.
The rest of the California ski situation is rated
excellent with the best Sierra Nevada snowpack in
four seasons after two years of severe drought.
Today's weather
Rain continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Rain locally heavy at times through this morning.
Little temperature change. Lows mid-40s to low
50s. Highs mid-50s to low 60s. Gale warning for
south winds increasing to 20 to 40 mph through
today. Chance of rain 80 percent today, 80 percent
tonight.
Israeli withdrawal in question
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Menahem Begin said
yesterday Israel may withdraw its offer to return all
of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt if Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat refuses to allow existing
lewish settlements to remain there.
Begin spoke to a gathering of right-wing suppor
ters in Tel Aviv two hours after the Israeli cabinet
voted in Jerusalem to "strengthen" existing set
tlements in the Sinai but decided not to build new
ones.
It Sadat continues to demand a total civilian
pullout under a peace agreement, Begin said, Is
rael may demand a change in its borders on the
Sinai, which it captured from Egypt in the 1967
Mideast War. He did not elaborate but clearly
meant Israel would try to make the settlements
part of its own territory.
Referring to Sadat's demand, reported last
week, that Israel abandon its Sinai outposts, Begin
said: "The Israelis do not burn settlements. They
build settlements and keep them."
In other developments yesterday:
— A hand grenade exploded in a crowded bus
station in Arab East Jerusalem, slightly injuring
three persons, Israeli police said.
— Sadat, returning to Egypt from talks with
Sudanese President Jaafar el-Numairi, told repor
ters he is undecided and "must see details" of an
Israeli plan for an Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian
committee to administer the occupied West Bank
of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip until resi
dents decide their own status in a referendum.
Argentine-Chilean conflict looms
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentine warships
sailed south yesterday toward the tip of South
America where a dispute with Chile over three tiny
islands threatens to expand into a conflict over
Chilean rights in the Atlantic Ocean.
Both Argentina and Chile are ruled by right-wing
military governments.
The Argentine navy said it had deployed the
aircraft c arrier 25 de Mayo, two submarines, troop
ships and escort and auxiliary vessels. Spokesmen
refused to pinpoint the vessels' positions.
A Buenos Aires newspaper columnist with close
government contacts said the navy was preparing
to make "ac ts of possession" in the area. How
ever, other observers do not believe Argentina
intends to occupy the islands.
In Santiago, the Chilean government news
paper Fl Cronista said a Foreign Ministry spokes
man refused to comment on the Argentine naval
ac tion, but added, "Chile will not accept provoca

tions."
Both Chile and Argentina requested British ar
bitration in 1973, and early in 1977 Britain ruled that
the islands belong to Chile. Argentine officials said
privately that Chile could have the windblown
flyspecks, inhabited by a few Chilean sheepher
ders.
But soon after the ruling, the Chilean junta is
sued new maps of the region. It used the islands as
a baseline to extend Chile's 200-mile economic
zone into the Atlantic.
African arms spending soars
Johannesburg, South Africa — Studies show that
military spending is soaring in black Africa, a part
of the world plagued by civil conflicts, territorial
disputes and wars of liberation.
Armies are being enlarged and new weapons
acquired by nations in an area stretching from
Mauritania in West Africa across to the strategic
Horn of East Africa and south to the borders of
white-governed southern Africa, according to the
studies, both official and unofficial.
Total military spending in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding white-ruled South Africa and Rhodesia,
is now estimated at about $3.7 billion a year, al
most four times the outlay three years ago. This
estimate is based on figures published by the In
ternational Institute for Strategic Studies in Lon
don and on reports from various reliable but unof
ficial sources.
By comparison, defense spending in South Af
rica now stands at $1.9 billion, and in Rhodesia the
defense budget totals $159 million.
According to the London institute and the other
sources, the number of black Africans under arms
has risen from an estimated 475,000 three years
ago to some 600,000 now.
The rising military outlays are not only a sign of
increasingly serious conflicts across this vast con
tinent. They also reflect the large number of milit
ary governments in black Africa and the need to
keep their armed forces content.
Higher aircraft sales predicted
Washington — The aircraft industry will have a
strong year as the economy continues to grow, but
output should drop off in the auto industry, the
Commerce Department said yesterday in its an
nual industrial outlook report.
"Of the 10 largest manufacturing industries in
terms of shipments, aircraft are expected to show
the biggest gain — up 30 percent over 1977 — in
value of shipments," the report said.

"Others in the top 10 show expected gains of 12
percent except in automobiles, which are ex
pected to drop 1 percent and truck and chassis,
which are expected to dip 4 percent," it said.
Retail sales in 1978 are expected to be $785 bill
ion,almost 10 percent above 1977, thedepartment
said.
The increases do not account for inflation,
which is forecast to be about (> percent again this
year.

acquired by nations in an area stretching from
Mauritania in West Africa across to the strategic
Horn of East Africa and south to the borders of
white-governed southern Africa, according to the
studies, both official and unofficial.
Total military spending in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding white-ruled South Africa and Rhodesia,
is now estimated at about $3.7 billion a year, al
most four times the outlay three years ago. This
estimate is based on figures published by the In
ternational Institute for Strategic Studies in Lon
don and on reports from various reliable but unof
ficial sources.
By comparison, defense spending in South Af
rica now stands at $1.9 billion, and in Rhodesia the
defense budget totals $159 million.
According to the London institute and the other
sources, the number of black Africans under arms
has risen from an estimated 475,000 three years
ago to some 600,000 now.
The rising military outlays are not only a sign of
increasingly serious conflicts across this vast con
tinent. They also reflect the large number of milit
ary governments in black Africa and the need to
keep their armed forces content.
Higher aircraft sales predicted
Washington — The aircraft industry will have a
strong year as the economy continues to grow, but
output should drop off in the auto industry, the
Commerce Department said yesterday in its an
nual industrial outlook report.
"Of the 10 largest manufacturing industries in
terms of shipments, aircraft are expected to show
the biggest gain — up 30 percent over 1977 — in
value of shipments," the report said.

"Others in the top 10 show expected gains of 12
percent except in automobiles, which are ex
pected to drop 1 percent and truck and chassis,
which are expected to dip 4 percent," it said.
Retail sales in 1978 are expected to be $785 bill
ion,almost 10 percent above 1977, thedepartment
said.
The increases do not account for inflation,
which is forecast to be about (> percent again this
year.
Commenting on the overall economy, a Com
merce Department economist said it should con
tinue growing at a rate of about 4 to 5 percent this
year. But she said it could begin tapering off at the
end of the year without further government ac
tion.
Courtenay Slater, chief department economist,
said the growth rate should be strong enough to
reduce unemployment from about 7 percent cur
rently to a 6!/j-percent average for the year.
'Record' ski season in sight
What a difference a year makes. Some western
ski resort operators are already saying that this will
be a record season. Last year most of them cried
disaster as winter snows leapfrogged trie West and
smothered the nation's Midwest and East.
The weather last year kept both snow and skiers
off the slopes and cash registers were as dry as the
mountainsides.
This year, glowing reports of deep snow bases,
full reservations and record expectations come
from the luxury ski spas from Big Mountain in
Montana to Squaw Valley in California, from
Snoqualmie Summit in Washington to Taos Ski
Valley in New Mexico.
But there are still a few grim spots.
Holiday Hill in the San Gabriel Mountains east of
Los Angeles has had rain, but little snow. Saturday
was the area's first fully operational day of the
season.
The rest of the California ski situation is rated
excellent with the best Sierra Nevada snowpack in
four seasons after two years of severe drought.
Today's weather
Rain continuing on and off through tomorrow.
Rain locally heavy at times through this morning.
Little temperature change. Lows mid-40s to low
50s. Highs mid-50s to low 60s. Gale warning for
south winds increasing to 20 to 40 mph through
today. Chance of rain 80 percent today, 80 percent
tonight.
Israeli withdrawal in question
Tel Aviv — Prime Minister Menahem Begin said
yesterday Israel may withdraw its offer to return all
of the occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt if Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat refuses to allow existing
lewish settlements to remain there.
Begin spoke to a gathering of right-wing suppor
ters in Tel Aviv two hours after the Israeli cabinet
voted in Jerusalem to "strengthen" existing set
tlements in the Sinai but decided not to build new
ones.
It Sadat continues to demand a total civilian
pullout under a peace agreement, Begin said, Is
rael may demand a change in its borders on the
Sinai, which it captured from Egypt in the 1967
Mideast War. He did not elaborate but clearly
meant Israel would try to make the settlements
part of its own territory.
Referring to Sadat's demand, reported last
week, that Israel abandon its Sinai outposts, Begin
said: "The Israelis do not burn settlements. They
build settlements and keep them."
In other developments yesterday:
— A hand grenade exploded in a crowded bus
station in Arab East Jerusalem, slightly injuring
three persons, Israeli police said.
— Sadat, returning to Egypt from talks with
Sudanese President Jaafar el-Numairi, told repor
ters he is undecided and "must see details" of an
Israeli plan for an Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian
committee to administer the occupied West Bank
of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip until resi
dents decide their own status in a referendum.
Argentine-Chilean conflict looms
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentine warships
sailed south yesterday toward the tip of South
America where a dispute with Chile over three tiny
islands threatens to expand into a conflict over
Chilean rights in the Atlantic Ocean.
Both Argentina and Chile are ruled by right-wing
military governments.
The Argentine navy said it had deployed the
aircraft c arrier 25 de Mayo, two submarines, troop
ships and escort and auxiliary vessels. Spokesmen
refused to pinpoint the vessels' positions.
A Buenos Aires newspaper columnist with close
government contacts said the navy was preparing
to make "ac ts of possession" in the area. How
ever, other observers do not believe Argentina
intends to occupy the islands.
In Santiago, the Chilean government news
paper Fl Cronista said a Foreign Ministry spokes
man refused to comment on the Argentine naval
ac tion, but added, "Chile will not accept provoca

tions."
Both Chile and Argentina requested British ar
bitration in 1973, and early in 1977 Britain ruled that
the islands belong to Chile. Argentine officials said
privately that Chile could have the windblown
flyspecks, inhabited by a few Chilean sheepher
ders.
But soon after the ruling, the Chilean junta is
sued new maps of the region. It used the islands as
a baseline to extend Chile's 200-mile economic
zone into the Atlantic.
African arms spending soars
Johannesburg, South Africa — Studies show that
military spending is soaring in black Africa, a part
of the world plagued by civil conflicts, territorial
disputes and wars of liberation.
