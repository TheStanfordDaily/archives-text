# Minority hiring plan held up

Indirect obstacles have hindered
the progress of affirmative action
programs here, President Richard
Lyman told the Academic Council
Friday.
University difficulties in imple
menting such plans have "arisen
more from indirect, oblique or unin
tentional obstacles to black and
other minority progress than from
open opposition to the policy objec
tives of affirmative action," Lyman
said.
Major failures in this country, such
as 40 percent teen-age black un
employment and continuing decay
in the inner cities, are not so much
due to attacks against affirmative ac
tion as they are to the "inability of
affirmative action ... to reach those
who have been left stranded while
other, luckier members of the group
advanced brilliantly."
Some blacks are enjoying oppor
tunities for advancement and status
hardly to be imagined 10 to 15 years
ago; others have no prospects for
any kind of life other than one of

crime, welfare and demeaning ex
periences, according to Lyman.
More experience
"At Stanford, we have more ex
perience with the upwardly mobile
than with those left stranded," said
Lyman. "We have had more oppor
tunity to see how much has changed
for the better since the mid-1960s
than to see the continuing frustration
and decay in those parts of the nation
and its population not touched by
those favorable changes."
He said that progress here has
been quite notable looking back a
decade; it has been far less dramatic
over the last five years.
Twenty-one blacks, 12 Chicanos
and one native American are faculty
members; in 1968 there were only
one or two blacks or Chicanos. Al
though the number of minority fa
culty members is small in a total of
nearly 1100, they are nevertheless
"strong contributors to many parts of
the institution; they are not by any
stretch of the imagination a token
ghetto," said Lyman.
In addition, he said, the total

number of minority students enrol
led at Stanford has increased each
year since 1967. But the increase be
tween 1974 and 1977 was fewer than
50 students.
"Still," Lyman pointed out, "the
presence of over 1200 black, Chicano
and American Indian students in a
student body of 11,500 is no incon
siderable fact, especially when com
pared with the nearly total absence
of such students hardly more than 10
years ago.''
Lyman also said the tone and na
ture of affirmative action has
changed over the last 10 years.
In the past few years the University
has concentrated on more focused
concerns. For example, W. Bliss Car
nochan, dean of the graduate divi
sion, and Arthur Walker, associate
dean of the graduate division, have
turned to departments and schools
to take responsibility for more
targeted recruitment of minorities
for graduate programs.
Stanford has also joined with 20
universities to pool information and
