Ten female students here officially
pledged Alpha Phi sorority yester
day, making it the first sorority to be
reinstated since the Board of Trus
tees voted to lift a 33-year ban Dec.
13.
Alpha Phi is one of nine national
sororities which had chapters at
Stanford when the ti ustees outlawed
sororities in 1944.
Eight of the 10 women became rib
bon pledges last quarter, meaning
that they "were promising to work
for this sorority" and "planning to
pledge the sorority when possible."
According to Janice Kimball, the
first to become a ribbon pledge,
those asked to pledge were
women here "who had initially ex
pressed interest to me or to alum
nae" and "who kept coming back to
ask questions and showed interest."
In November, the ribbon pledges
turned in a proposal to adminis
trators asking that Alpha Phi be rec
ognized, said Kimball, "but they
didn't do anything about it."
After the ban was lifted, Alpha Phi
representatives met with Residential
Education Director Norm Robinson
again to ask for recognition.

"The University is not going to deal
with us or recognize us until we want
a hoyse," said Kimball, because "we
are a selective member organiza
tion."
Kimball said that one short-term
goal is to increase the size of the
group.
"We will be having rush in the
middle of this quarter for sopho
mores, juniors and seniors. In spring
we'll have rush again, but freshmen
will be included also," Kimball
explained.
Other plans for the new sorority
include service projects, fundraising
and social functions.
"Our long-term goal is to have a
house," Kimball said, "but that's still
pretty far down the road."
The new Alpha Phi members have
five alumnae advisers, who attended
other colleges and most of whom live
in the area.
"The thing the alumnae did the
most was be there when we were
discouraged," said Kimball. "So
many people were negative and it
was so hard to get past what people's
preconceived ideas of what a sorority
is."
According to Special Adviser Joni
Hansen, the alumnae do not antici
pate any conflicts with University
regulations and "right now none
exists.
"University policy always does
take precedence at all of our chap
ters," said Hansen.
In addition, Hansen said that -
"maintaining local control isfirstand
foremost."
"We think it's sort of exciting to be
the first ones back," commented
Kimball, "but probably what's going
to happen within the next year is that
several other groups will start up."
Kimball said that she is hoping
more sororities will be reinstated,
adding that the Alpha Phis here
"would be willing to help anyone
who wants to get started."
