# Guest prof to lecture about Chilean politics
## 
### 
Fernando Flores, a former Chilean
cabinet member and now a released
political prisoner from Chile, will be
the ASSU guest professor for Winter
and Spring quarters.
His course, entitled Political In
terpretations of Chile, will present an
interpretation of Chile before Al
lendeand will point up "the question
of political blindness."
Flores admits that after spending
three years in jail "there is no possi
bility of objective interpretation,"
but it is possible to "point to the
truth."
He emphasized the fact that the
course will not be competitive with
history. He will not give extensive
background or historical review. For
this reason the first two lectures of
each quarter will be delivered by
guest speakers serving as primer lec
turers. The class, sponsored by the
ASSU, is open to all students. No
background in Chilean history or
politics is required.
Sophomore Kaki Bertelsen, a
member of the ASSU guest profes

sorship board, described the
course's appeal to all students. "This
is a unique course," she said. "We
hope that a lot of people take the
course because it would be of be
nefit to everyone. Since the guest
professors are paid for by the stu
dents we think they should be of in
terest to a great number of students.
We don't hire microbiologists."
The course is a "chance of a
lifetime" according to Steve Westly
of the Council of Presidents and
head of the guest professor nomina
tions committee. Westly lauded
Flores as "one of the most incredibly
brilliant people in the world, a tre
mendous intellectual resource."
Westly noted Flores' expertise in
the field of computer science and
remarked that the course would not
only be an interpretation, but a sci
entific analysis of political events in
Chile.
The three-unit course is scheduled
for Tuesdays from 3:15 to 5:05 p.m.
in room 61G.
