# Council considers road widening project
## 
### Erik Cleage 
Final approval is expected to
night on the $6.6 million Sand Hill
Road Improvement project when
the Palo Alto City Council consid
ers the issue of land acquisition at
its regular Monday meeting.
The project (formerly known as
the Willow Road Improvement
Project) involves widening the
present Willow Road from its in
tersection with Santa Cruz Av
enue in Menlo Park to El Camino
Real along the western edge of the
Stanford Shopping Center park
ing lot.
When completed, the road will
be a four-lane divided boulevard
with nine sets of traffic lights.
The council has previously ap
proved all aspects of the project
with the exception of land acquisi
tion, according to University Di
rector of Community Relations
Andrew Doty.
Doty said tonight's vote will
providefor acquiring needed land
from the University.
Palo Alto will either condemn
and purchase the land, or approve
an easement of the land giving use
of the land for an extended period
of time.

Doty said that, if approved,
construction would probably start
sometime in March. Completion
will take six to seven months, ac
cording to Palo Alto engineers on
the project.
At this point, design is com
plete. A detailed environmental
impact report has been reviewed
and determined adequate by the
Palo Alto City Council. Negotia
tions between Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Stanford have been
completed and a detailed en
gineer's report has been pre
sented to the Palo Alto City Coun
cil.
Other changes, ranging from
extension to the construction of
major expressways and freeways
have been proposed for Willow
Road for several decades but no
agreement has ever been
reached.
When the Stanford Shopping
Center was built in the 19505, pro
vision was made to leave suffi
cient land on the western side of
the shopping center to accom
modate a major roadway.
The most recent discussions
leading to the current project
began in 1973.

"It's certainly in Stanford's best
interest" to complete this project,
otherwise "we wouldn't be sup
porting it," said vice president for
Business and Finance William
Massy.
Heavy traffic often congests the
shopping center and campus
thoroughfares and adversely af
fects other campus operations
such as the Medical School,
Massy said.
Palo Alto also has a vested in
terest in the traffic problem. "We
were, over the years, getting loud
screams from people driving Wil
low Road about the horrendous
congestion," Palo Alto Head Traf
fic Engineer Ted Noguchi said.
The congestion concern started
the effort to alleviate the problem,
Noguchi said.
He said many things occur on
campus which affect the road sys
tem around the campus and "to
some degree the University has
some responsibility for trying to
resolve the problems of public
streets."
As part of that responsibility,
the University was urged by Palo
Alto and Menlo Park to extend
Campus Drive from its present

terminus at Panama Street near
the Medical Center to Junipero
Serra Boulevard.
The agreement made provided
for initiation of the extension
within two years, but Massy re
cently announced that if neces
sary governmental approvals are
received and if bids for the work
do not substantially exceed the
funds available, construction will
begin as soon as work is started on
Sand Hill Road.
The municipalities are also
seeking to bar the University from
permanently closing the section
of Arboretum Road from the
shopping center to Palm Drive.
However, a trustee report on
the project has said that since the
artery provides access to the
shopping center and the Medical
Center, it is unlikely the Univer
sity would ever have any interest
in closing it.
An assessment district made up
of the University and its tenants
will pay $4.9 million, or 75 percent
of the project costs. Palo Alto's
net cost will be $667,000, while
San Mateo County will pay
$651,000.
