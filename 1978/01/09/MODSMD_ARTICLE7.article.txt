# Energy program
## Deregulation is necessary 
### 
Doug Bandow

Jimmy Carter's recent petty
temper tantrums against the oil
companies illustrates the intellectual
bankruptcy of his energy program.
Carter, who is unable to support his
program on the grounds of logic or
economics, had to resort to the worst
sort of demagoguery with inflam
matory accusations and gross distor
tions of statistics.
Carter has been reduced to such a
reprehensible state because of the
inadequacy of his program, which
merely exacerbates the rampant
governmental interference that is the
basis of our present energy prob
lems. All of his proposals implicitly
recognize the bankruptcy of this past
federal regulation.
For example, his proposed tax on
oil is reasonable only because the
lower regulated prices have over
stimulated demand (a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology study esti
mates that we are paying 36 per cent
less than the true market price for
energy, which is causing demand to
beB percent higher, and supply6per
cent lower, than they would naturally
be). The equalizing tax means con
sumers will value what they use at the
world market replacement cost.
The tax on "gas guzzlers" (which is
a nonsensical term; large cars per
form the socially useful function of
transporting more people and more
goods in greater luxury — that is,
they are more efficient in other re
spects) has only one claim to rational
thinking — that oil and gas prices are
now below the market cost, so
people undervalue the gas they use
and therefore aren't as worried
about gas efficiency as they would be
without regulation.
Similarly, forcing industries to use
coal instead of gas or oil is marginally
sane only because oil and gas prices
are currently held artificially low by
regulation; thus, industries are using
socially more expensive fuels be
cause they seem cheaper because of
price regulation.
However, these arbitrary policies
will force some people to make less
efficient substitutions, since such
blanket government mandates can
not take individual factors into ac
count, as can the free market.
For example, the free market,
through higher natural gas prices,
will force over 80 per cent of the
utilities in Texas, currently using
natural gas to switch to other fuels by
1985. 'The most efficient way of
promoting conservation is to make

waste more expensive; decontrol
will do this.
Thus, the starting point for any
"energy program" should be the de
regulation of natural gas. Such dere
gulation needn't be immediate; ex
pectations have been formal and in
vestment has been made in reliance
thereon. Prices could be allowed to
rise 10 per cent above the inflation
rate per year until the controls were
meaningless; then they could be
permanently removed.
The opponents of deregulation
seem to have forgotten that the
amount of recoverable resources
expands as prices rise. Because of
price controls, total natural gas re
serves have dropped by one-third
since 1967, and natural gas produc
tion has fallen in absolute terms
since 1972; only states like Texas,
whose intra-state market is not fed
erally regulated, have enough gas.
It is estimated that decontrol
would bring the 1985 production
close to the peak produced in 1970-
73, which is 20-25 per cent above the
level that would occur under regula
tion. A study by the General Account
ing Office demonstrated that dere
gulation is the only way to meet cur
rent demand, and would result in an
estimated addition to the supply of
natural gas of as much as 12 trillion
cubic feet (tcf) per year.
A study by the Energy Research
and Development Administration
(ERDA) showed that potential re
serves would be twice as large at a
price of $3.25 per million cubic feet
(mcf) as opposed to the current regu
lated price of $1.75 per mcf.
In addition, other forms of produc
tion would be encouraged. Large
quantities of natural gas might be
feasibly gotten from geopressurized
brine — estimates range from 500
trillion to 100 quadrillion cubic feet
(25 to 1000 times our annual con
sumption); however, higher prices
are necessary.
But, you say, what about the $78
billion rip-off that Carter speaks of?
The demagoguery is reprehensible;
our dear leader studiously ignores
the costs of not deregulating. Even
Congressional Budget Analysts
admit that decontrol will yield lower
prices (2.80) as opposed to $3.30 per
mcf than regulation by 1985.
Without natural gas available, con
sumers must pay higher prices for
expensive substitutes such as synth
etic and liquified natural gas (the
former cost $4.14 per mcf last winter

— while intrastate, and unregulated,
natural gas sold at lower prices).
In fact, a very careful, and fair,
study by Reps. Dave Stockman (R-
Mich.) and Clarence Brown (R-Ohio)
found that continued regulation
would cost $48 billion more than de
regulation between 1977 and 1990.
Deregulation would result in the
production of at least 25 tcf more
natural gas over the 13-year period
(which is a very conservative esti
mate).
The shortage under continued
regulation would have to be made up
from other, more expensive, fuels,
which would add $168 billion to the
energy bill. Lost efficiencies from
distribution charges from less gas
going through the pipelines would
waste $44 billion more. Thus, the 13-
year cost of energy was estimated to
be $461.8 billion with regulation, and
only $414.2 billion with deregulation
— and the gap widens every year
thereafter.
Thus, we are unfortunately asking
the wrong question. We shouldn't
ask "why deregulate?"; rather, we
should ask "why regulate?" We
should have learned by now that the
quickest way to create a shortage is
to keep prices inefficiently low. This
is one campaign promise that )immy
Carter should not break.

The tax on "gas guzzlers" (which is
a nonsensical term; large cars per
form the socially useful function of
transporting more people and more
goods in greater luxury — that is,
they are more efficient in other re
spects) has only one claim to rational
thinking — that oil and gas prices are
now below the market cost, so
people undervalue the gas they use
and therefore aren't as worried
about gas efficiency as they would be
without regulation.
Similarly, forcing industries to use
coal instead of gas or oil is marginally
sane only because oil and gas prices
are currently held artificially low by
regulation; thus, industries are using
socially more expensive fuels be
cause they seem cheaper because of
price regulation.
However, these arbitrary policies
will force some people to make less
efficient substitutions, since such
blanket government mandates can
not take individual factors into ac
count, as can the free market.
For example, the free market,
through higher natural gas prices,
will force over 80 per cent of the
utilities in Texas, currently using
natural gas to switch to other fuels by
1985. 'The most efficient way of
promoting conservation is to make

waste more expensive; decontrol
will do this.
Thus, the starting point for any
"energy program" should be the de
regulation of natural gas. Such dere
gulation needn't be immediate; ex
pectations have been formal and in
vestment has been made in reliance
thereon. Prices could be allowed to
rise 10 per cent above the inflation
rate per year until the controls were
meaningless; then they could be
permanently removed.
The opponents of deregulation
seem to have forgotten that the
amount of recoverable resources
expands as prices rise. Because of
price controls, total natural gas re
serves have dropped by one-third
since 1967, and natural gas produc
tion has fallen in absolute terms
since 1972; only states like Texas,
whose intra-state market is not fed
erally regulated, have enough gas.
It is estimated that decontrol
would bring the 1985 production
close to the peak produced in 1970-
73, which is 20-25 per cent above the
level that would occur under regula
tion. A study by the General Account
ing Office demonstrated that dere
gulation is the only way to meet cur
rent demand, and would result in an
estimated addition to the supply of
natural gas of as much as 12 trillion
cubic feet (tcf) per year.
A study by the Energy Research
and Development Administration
(ERDA) showed that potential re
serves would be twice as large at a
price of $3.25 per million cubic feet
(mcf) as opposed to the current regu
lated price of $1.75 per mcf.
In addition, other forms of produc
tion would be encouraged. Large
quantities of natural gas might be
feasibly gotten from geopressurized
brine — estimates range from 500
trillion to 100 quadrillion cubic feet
(25 to 1000 times our annual con
sumption); however, higher prices
are necessary.
But, you say, what about the $78
billion rip-off that Carter speaks of?
The demagoguery is reprehensible;
our dear leader studiously ignores
the costs of not deregulating. Even
Congressional Budget Analysts
admit that decontrol will yield lower
prices (2.80) as opposed to $3.30 per
mcf than regulation by 1985.
Without natural gas available, con
sumers must pay higher prices for
expensive substitutes such as synth
etic and liquified natural gas (the
former cost $4.14 per mcf last winter

— while intrastate, and unregulated,
natural gas sold at lower prices).
In fact, a very careful, and fair,
study by Reps. Dave Stockman (R-
Mich.) and Clarence Brown (R-Ohio)
found that continued regulation
would cost $48 billion more than de
regulation between 1977 and 1990.
Deregulation would result in the
production of at least 25 tcf more
natural gas over the 13-year period
(which is a very conservative esti
mate).
The shortage under continued
regulation would have to be made up
from other, more expensive, fuels,
which would add $168 billion to the
energy bill. Lost efficiencies from
distribution charges from less gas
going through the pipelines would
waste $44 billion more. Thus, the 13-
year cost of energy was estimated to
be $461.8 billion with regulation, and
only $414.2 billion with deregulation
— and the gap widens every year
thereafter.
Thus, we are unfortunately asking
the wrong question. We shouldn't
ask "why deregulate?"; rather, we
should ask "why regulate?" We
should have learned by now that the
quickest way to create a shortage is
to keep prices inefficiently low. This

natural gas to switch to other fuels by
1985. 'The most efficient way of
promoting conservation is to make

waste more expensive; decontrol
will do this.
Thus, the starting point for any
"energy program" should be the de
regulation of natural gas. Such dere
gulation needn't be immediate; ex
pectations have been formal and in
vestment has been made in reliance
thereon. Prices could be allowed to
rise 10 per cent above the inflation
rate per year until the controls were
meaningless; then they could be
permanently removed.
The opponents of deregulation
seem to have forgotten that the
amount of recoverable resources
expands as prices rise. Because of
price controls, total natural gas re
serves have dropped by one-third
since 1967, and natural gas produc
tion has fallen in absolute terms
since 1972; only states like Texas,
whose intra-state market is not fed
erally regulated, have enough gas.
It is estimated that decontrol
would bring the 1985 production
close to the peak produced in 1970-
73, which is 20-25 per cent above the
level that would occur under regula
tion. A study by the General Account
ing Office demonstrated that dere
gulation is the only way to meet cur
rent demand, and would result in an
estimated addition to the supply of
natural gas of as much as 12 trillion
cubic feet (tcf) per year.
A study by the Energy Research
and Development Administration
(ERDA) showed that potential re
serves would be twice as large at a
price of $3.25 per million cubic feet
(mcf) as opposed to the current regu
lated price of $1.75 per mcf.
In addition, other forms of produc
tion would be encouraged. Large
quantities of natural gas might be
feasibly gotten from geopressurized
brine — estimates range from 500
trillion to 100 quadrillion cubic feet
(25 to 1000 times our annual con
sumption); however, higher prices
are necessary.
But, you say, what about the $78
billion rip-off that Carter speaks of?
The demagoguery is reprehensible;
our dear leader studiously ignores
the costs of not deregulating. Even
Congressional Budget Analysts
admit that decontrol will yield lower
prices (2.80) as opposed to $3.30 per
mcf than regulation by 1985.
Without natural gas available, con
sumers must pay higher prices for
expensive substitutes such as synth
etic and liquified natural gas (the
former cost $4.14 per mcf last winter

— while intrastate, and unregulated,
natural gas sold at lower prices).
In fact, a very careful, and fair,
study by Reps. Dave Stockman (R-
Mich.) and Clarence Brown (R-Ohio)
found that continued regulation
would cost $48 billion more than de
regulation between 1977 and 1990.
Deregulation would result in the
production of at least 25 tcf more
natural gas over the 13-year period
(which is a very conservative esti
mate).
The shortage under continued
regulation would have to be made up
from other, more expensive, fuels,
which would add $168 billion to the
energy bill. Lost efficiencies from
distribution charges from less gas
going through the pipelines would
waste $44 billion more. Thus, the 13-
year cost of energy was estimated to
be $461.8 billion with regulation, and
only $414.2 billion with deregulation
— and the gap widens every year
thereafter.
Thus, we are unfortunately asking
the wrong question. We shouldn't
ask "why deregulate?"; rather, we
should ask "why regulate?" We
should have learned by now that the
quickest way to create a shortage is
to keep prices inefficiently low. This
is one campaign promise that )immy
Carter should not break.

Jimmy Carter's recent petty
temper tantrums against the oil
companies illustrates the intellectual
bankruptcy of his energy program.
Carter, who is unable to support his
program on the grounds of logic or
economics, had to resort to the worst
sort of demagoguery with inflam
matory accusations and gross distor
tions of statistics.
Carter has been reduced to such a
reprehensible state because of the
inadequacy of his program, which
merely exacerbates the rampant
governmental interference that is the
basis of our present energy prob
lems. All of his proposals implicitly
recognize the bankruptcy of this past
federal regulation.
For example, his proposed tax on
oil is reasonable only because the
lower regulated prices have over
stimulated demand (a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology study esti
mates that we are paying 36 per cent
less than the true market price for
energy, which is causing demand to
beB percent higher, and supply6per
cent lower, than they would naturally
be). The equalizing tax means con
sumers will value what they use at the
world market replacement cost.
The tax on "gas guzzlers" (which is
a nonsensical term; large cars per
form the socially useful function of
transporting more people and more
goods in greater luxury — that is,
they are more efficient in other re
spects) has only one claim to rational
thinking — that oil and gas prices are
now below the market cost, so
people undervalue the gas they use
and therefore aren't as worried
about gas efficiency as they would be
without regulation.
Similarly, forcing industries to use
coal instead of gas or oil is marginally
sane only because oil and gas prices
are currently held artificially low by
regulation; thus, industries are using
socially more expensive fuels be
cause they seem cheaper because of
price regulation.
However, these arbitrary policies
will force some people to make less
efficient substitutions, since such
blanket government mandates can
not take individual factors into ac
count, as can the free market.
For example, the free market,
through higher natural gas prices,
will force over 80 per cent of the
utilities in Texas, currently using
natural gas to switch to other fuels by
1985. 'The most efficient way of
