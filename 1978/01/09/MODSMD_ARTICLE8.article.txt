Logic of imperialism
The main thrust of L.H. Gann's re
sponse (Daily, |an. 4) to Glenn Jor
dan's column (Daily, Dec. 3) on the
South African Krugerrand was that
there is a migration of black Africans
into South Africa for jobs in the
mines, rather than a migration of
black Africans out of apartheid. He
characterized this as "voting with
their feet" (neglecting to mention
that this is the only way black Afri
cans can vote under apartheid).
Let's leave aside any question of
the facts because, even if the facts
are right, his logic is all wrong. It is
the logic of imperialism. For cen
turies the economies of African and
other third world countries have
been ravaged by the imperialists;
then, when the people of these
countries are forced to go to more
industrialized outposts of im
perialism for jobs, it's claimed these
migrant laborers dig apartheid.
We can see the same logic applied
to a case much closer to home: the
so-called "illegal aliens." Mexican
peasants are driven off their own
land by U.S. agribusiness; they are
forced to become migrant laborers,
then these same U.S. corporations

make extra bucks off these Mexican
workers here in the U.S. by paying
them below minimum wage (and
driving them out of the country if
they start to organize or if un
employment gets too high).
Gann's logic would characterize
these migrant laborers as "voting
with their feet" for the good ole
U.S.A. just as he would have us be
lieve that black Africans go to South
Africa because they think apartheid's
not so bad. He then labels the con
demnation of the white minority re
gimes as the lies of the "left liberal
American campus community"
whom Gann likens to Nazis.
Perhaps Gann belongs at Hoover,
but the day is coming when his im
perialist logic, along with the logic of
apartheid and the Krugerrand coin,
will be filed where they belong â€”
"Ancient History."

It is to be hoped that the good
news of Stanford's receiving a new
stadium track is a harbinger of im
proved conditions generally for the
running community here. The rec

ognition that has come to running
nationally and worldwide for car
diovascular health as well as spirited
enjoyment is reflected in the number
and quality of participants on cam
pus. Their activities range from mild
jogging to intense competition.
Collectively, Stanford's faculty and
staff have twice won a national
championship organized by the Uni
versity of Nebraska "clearing house"
and a state championship for univer
sities and colleges in California; in
dividually, many are prominent in
local races and others hold age
group records.
Despite this intensity of interest,
level of achievement and upgrading
of health, running facilities provided
and maintained by the Athletic De
partment are truly minimal. They
barely cover varsity needs; recrea
tion is pretty much left to fend for
itself (though the full name of the
department is athletics, physical
education and recreation).
It is a bit incongruous that the de
partment should list its cross-country
facilities and its track facilities as "ex
cellent." Even varsity cross country
has no true home of its own, being
permitted use of the golf course area
only under limited and restrictive
conditions. Recreational runners are
officially barred. The intramural
"cross-country" race is held on flat
terrain, partly on pavement and
partly adjacent to El Camino where
panting runners may enjoy a fresh
breath of carbon monoxide.
Alternative routes to which run
ners must resort tend to utilize roads
and paved pathways, with con
sequent knee and ankle injuries re
sulting from incessant pounding on
hard surfaces. Cooperative attempts
initiated by golfing and running
groups to agree on a suitable running
route in the golf course area, which
would not interfere with golfers,
have been rebuffed by higher ad
ministrators.
While the varsity track will soon
have an excellent new surface,
Angell Field, the only running facility
made available generally by the ath
letic department for recreational
purposes, has been seriously de
teriorating to the point where run
ners have a better rapport with the
exploding gopher population than
with the department. Let us hope
that the new stadium track will be
available for some recreational use,
while Angell Field is repaired suffi
ciently to catch the spill-over.
It would be a pity if Angell Field
were given token attention as an ex
cuse to keep runners off the new
track. I would prefer to think this
new addition is the start of a more

cooperative attitude. There are many
recreational runners who have given
serious thought to the problems in
volved and whose ideas and energies
could be tapped in a constructive
way.

Litter
Universities around the world,
once revered, are becoming objects
of public scorn because of the slum
ming of the campuses, often by small
groups. At universities such as Nan
terre and the Free University of Ber
lin, not to mention some American
campuses, the plastering of walls and
buildings with posters has become
such a hopeless problem that any at
tempt to clean up the place has been
given up, and the environment has
suffered irreparable damage.
At Stanford, Public Events is en
trusted with responsibility for this
problem. It has issued clear regula
tions which should be widely distri
buted and obeyed.
But who is responsible for litter?
Quite apart from the aesthetic as
pect, there have been nasty acci
dents because of the litter accumu
lated in certain places, notably out
side of the Post Office. All self
respecting communities have anti
litter laws, with stiff fines for offen
ders. Yet on the first day of the quar
ter the area outside the Post Office
was littered with a variety of things,
including the Daily, the Campus Re
port, commercial advertisements
and the debris from packages.
The University and the organiza
tions or individuals responsible
could be sued for heavy damages if
an accident resulted. The safety and
health department has issued warn
ings about this, but the Stanford
community has lost the art of read
ing. Perhaps this is the reason some
groups find it necessary to plaster the
campus walls with posters in large
letters which even a moron can read.

Transfer Orientation
This letter is to thank the many
administration representatives, ad
visors, and assorted others for the
Winter Quarter Transfer Orientation
Program. Although the campus has
been my home for several years, it
was exhilarating to be welcome as a
student, and the obvious caring that
these people exhibited is what made
it so special.
