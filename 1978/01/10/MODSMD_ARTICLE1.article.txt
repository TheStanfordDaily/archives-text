# ASSU refuses to nominate students for CIR
## 
### Sara Lessley 
The ASSU Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom) announced last night
it is refusing to nominate any stu
dents for positions on the new
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (OR)
A Nom Com statement declared
that it would be "counterproduc
tive' to place anv students on the
CIR.
Co-president Steve Westly said re
fusal of the Nom Com to nominate
students for the CIR is, if not unpre
cedented, at least an unusual and
drastic action.
Guidelines for creation of the new
CIR were adopted by the Board of
Trustees at its December meeting.
The trustees' guidelines were
modifications of those prepared by
the Ad Hoc Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility.
Nom Com member Pier La Place

said the changes made by the trus
tees in the Ad Hoc Committee's re
port have made "maximizing profit a
more important consideration than
social responsibility."
These changes, according to Ad
Hoc Committee member Anne Hen
kels, "totally negate the sense of the
(original) version."
She added that the new CIR will
have to work under the revised
guidelines which "subordinate so
cial responsibility to maximizing pro
fits." In this case, she added, the
committee is useless, confining the
CIR to worrying about maximization
of profit.
The Nom Com statement referred
to the trustees' guidelines as "a
document which dismisses student
input as well as University social re
sponsibility.' Members said they did
not wish to legitimize such a docu
ment.

The Nom Com considered several
alternatives, said member Bill Oftutt,
before examining the "go/no go" op
tion of refusing to nominate students
for the committee.
Oftutt added that this option was
chosen to emphasize why this
document in particular is so abhor
rent. The trustees made small
( hanges thai subverted the mean
ing."
Henkels cited several changes
which she says subvert the meaning
of the ad hoc committee report.
Where the committee wrote that
trustees shall vote for proxy resolu
tions whit h seek to eliminate or re
duce substantial social injury, the
trustees have added the clause
"providing such action is not incon
sistent with the trustees' fiduciary
obligations."
In the report, the primary fiduciary
obligation is to maximize financial re-

turn on the University's endowment
securities.
Director of Finance Rodney Adams
said, on the basis of several laws and
statutes, the "trustees are held to a
standard of seeking to obtain a
maximum financial return commen
surate with prudence and other fac
tors."
He added that the law does not talk
about the social responsibility side of
the question. The law "doesn't pro
vide any mechanisms by which the
social aspects can be factored and to
that extent, they cannot override or
be paramount to seeking maximum
financial returns."
He added that the trustees will give
individual weight to questions of so
cial responsibility. Vice President
William Massy said the trustees' revi
sion was not a "substantial change,
but simply a clarification.
"The changes make clear that

whatever the trustees do has to be
consistent with their fiduciary re
sponsibilities," he added.
Westly said the Nom Com is, "a
ware of the administration argu
ments about managing trusts, but
since it is obvious that it is impossible
to maximize all returns in a trust, we
do not tind this a compelling or clear
argument."
La Place added that "within the
boundaries of the present
guidelines, student input has lost ef
fectiveness." The nomination of stu
dents would not make any difference
to University opinion, given the pre
sent guidelines, she added.
Before the Nom Com announce
ment, Assistant to the President Ci.
Robert Hamrdla said "the trustees
are really interested in a body (com
mission) with lots of discussion and
recommendations. There is certainly
the feeling that the trustees would

have to be very concerned about
going against commission recom
mendation, they would take any re
commendation seriously." But, he
added, they are recommendations,
because the trustees are finally re
sponsible for any decision made
about investment.
Offutt said he thought the CIR
would serve as a rubber stamp for
decisions already made.
"The trustees' change in wording
make commission results, whenever
questioned on social responsibility
questions, foreordained.''
Massy disagreed, saying the
guidelines and the CIR are "very
workable. It (CIR) deserves a good
faith effort to make it work."
I he Nom Com will present a resol
ution to the senate tonight, asking
tor senate support in the Nom Com
refusal to nominate students to the
new CIR.
