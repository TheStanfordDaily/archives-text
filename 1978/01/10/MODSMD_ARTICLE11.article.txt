# An important task
## Science, the public: bridging the gap 
### 
Thorn, et al.

The tremendous importance of
science in all aspects of our society is
a recent historical development with
which our society is still searching for
ways to cope. What are the relation
ships between science, industry,
government and the university?
What are the forces currently direct
ing science and technology and how
should science and technology be
directed to best serve our society?
What are the roles played by scien
tists and the public? These are the
basic questions being grappled with
in issues ranging from nuclear power
to recombinant DNA. The answers
we give will reach far beyond any
single issue.
A brief historical overview might
provide help in approaching these
questions. The development of sci
ence is generally identified with the
renaissance period in western his
tory. Certainly technological de
velopments from the steam engine
to the cotton gin had important im
pacts in the 1700's and 1800's, but it
wasn't until near the turn of this cen
tury that scientific research and in
dustrial development became firmly
linked.
Cooperation
Initially, industry relied on inde
pendent research contractors, but by
1920 cooperation between industry
and major universities was shifting
scientific training and research re
sponsibilities to universities like the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and Stanford. This development
was facilitated by the establishment
of the National Research Council by
the federal government to coordi
nate, promote and sponsor the in
tegration of the universities and in
dustry. These changes were also ac
companied by a shift in the orienta
tion of science itself, away from an
idealized search for truth and to
wards an emphasis on utility.
Since World War 11, government
ties with both science and industry
have blos'somed, with a myriad of
agencies, departments and prog
rams being established to allocate
funds, regulate research, police for
safety and formulate policies and
give advise on legislation.
The impact on our society has
been immense. Business, the milit
ary, medicine and the growth of our
society in general all depend on both
basic and applied research. An ex
panding portion of our society's re
sources are used to fund research,
either directly through grants, or in
directly through the tax-exempt
status and special privileges of uni

versities. In turn, scientific research
is having an increasing effect on our
society, not only by promoting the
particular values and assumptions
which underlie science, but more di
rectly by developing technologies —
from television and plastics to com
puters and nuclear power — which
shape our society's basic values and
styles of living.
How do the links between scien
tific research, the university, gov
ernment and industry work? These
social institutions and the scientists
who work within them play different
parts in a variety of issues — from
DES to the SST. Recombinant DNA
research, while only one particular
issue, illustrates some of the ways in
which the links between these in
stitutions operate.'
Basic techniques
The basic techniques of recombin
ant DNA were developed within the
universities — by a team of scientists
headed by Herb Boyer of the Univer
sity of California at San Francisco and
Stanley Cohen of Stanford several
years ago. Funding for this and simi
lar research was allocated by scien
tists within the National Institues of
Health (NIH), an agency of Health,
Education and Welfare. Scientists
also drew up the research guidelines
in this area, which were later
adopted by Donald Fredrickson, Di
rector of the NIH, and which have
since formed the basis for state and
federal legislative action.
Finally, industry has quickly rec
ognized the commercial potential of
this research, and several corpora
tions, including Cetus Corporation
of Berkeley, have been established
to exploit this area. Here again, sci
entists played important roles
beyond their laboratories, with Stan
ford's Stanley Cohen and Joshua
Lederberg appearing on the Cetus
Board of Scientific Advisors and Carl
Djerassi on the Cetus Board of Direc
tors.
How can the public participate in
this network of institutions and ex
perts? Currently there are several
vehicles for public involvement in
the decision making. Open federal
and state hearings on scientific is
sues offer a means of involvement
for a select segment of the public.
Public interest groups lobbying on a
particular science policy issue pro
vide another type of involvement.
Citizens can also lobby through their
representatives in Congress, or may
even participate in protest actions.
These, and perhaps more direct
mechanisms of public participation

could be effective means of public
involvement. The missing factor is
education. Science has remained iso
lated from the society it supposedly
serves. Accordingly, it has been both
ignored and made into something
mysterious by the rest of society.
This isolation and ignorance have
also made it difficult for scientists to
communicate with legislators and
members of the lay public.
Issues such as recombinant DNA
and nuclear power have shown how
this gap between science and the
public can create unfortunate and
potentially disastrous situations by
encouraging a mutual distrust bet-

ween scientists and the public, by
promoting emotional rather than ra
tional methods of argument and de
cision making, and by overly polariz
ing the issues involved.
The bridging of this gap — the in
volvement of the public in public pol
icy aspects of science — will be one
of the most important tasks for the
future, a task which will have impor
tant effects for both our science and
our society.

this network of institutions and ex
perts? Currently there are several
vehicles for public involvement in
the decision making. Open federal
and state hearings on scientific is
sues offer a means of involvement
for a select segment of the public.
Public interest groups lobbying on a
particular science policy issue pro
vide another type of involvement.
Citizens can also lobby through their
representatives in Congress, or may
even participate in protest actions.
These, and perhaps more direct
mechanisms of public participation

could be effective means of public
involvement. The missing factor is
education. Science has remained iso
lated from the society it supposedly
serves. Accordingly, it has been both
ignored and made into something
mysterious by the rest of society.
This isolation and ignorance have
also made it difficult for scientists to
communicate with legislators and
members of the lay public.
Issues such as recombinant DNA
and nuclear power have shown how
this gap between science and the
public can create unfortunate and
potentially disastrous situations by
encouraging a mutual distrust bet-

ween scientists and the public, by
promoting emotional rather than ra
tional methods of argument and de
cision making, and by overly polariz
ing the issues involved.
The bridging of this gap — the in
volvement of the public in public pol
icy aspects of science — will be one
of the most important tasks for the
future, a task which will have impor
tant effects for both our science and
our society.

The tremendous importance of
science in all aspects of our society is
a recent historical development with
which our society is still searching for
ways to cope. What are the relation
ships between science, industry,
government and the university?
What are the forces currently direct
ing science and technology and how
should science and technology be
directed to best serve our society?
What are the roles played by scien
tists and the public? These are the
basic questions being grappled with
in issues ranging from nuclear power
to recombinant DNA. The answers
we give will reach far beyond any
single issue.
A brief historical overview might
provide help in approaching these
questions. The development of sci
ence is generally identified with the
renaissance period in western his
tory. Certainly technological de
velopments from the steam engine
to the cotton gin had important im
pacts in the 1700's and 1800's, but it
wasn't until near the turn of this cen
tury that scientific research and in
dustrial development became firmly
linked.
Cooperation
Initially, industry relied on inde
pendent research contractors, but by
1920 cooperation between industry
and major universities was shifting
scientific training and research re
sponsibilities to universities like the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and Stanford. This development
was facilitated by the establishment
of the National Research Council by
the federal government to coordi
nate, promote and sponsor the in
tegration of the universities and in
dustry. These changes were also ac
companied by a shift in the orienta
tion of science itself, away from an
idealized search for truth and to
wards an emphasis on utility.
Since World War 11, government
ties with both science and industry
have blos'somed, with a myriad of
agencies, departments and prog
rams being established to allocate
funds, regulate research, police for
safety and formulate policies and
give advise on legislation.
The impact on our society has
been immense. Business, the milit
ary, medicine and the growth of our
society in general all depend on both
basic and applied research. An ex
panding portion of our society's re
sources are used to fund research,
either directly through grants, or in
directly through the tax-exempt
status and special privileges of uni

versities. In turn, scientific research
is having an increasing effect on our
society, not only by promoting the
particular values and assumptions
which underlie science, but more di
rectly by developing technologies —
from television and plastics to com
puters and nuclear power — which
shape our society's basic values and
styles of living.
How do the links between scien
tific research, the university, gov
ernment and industry work? These
social institutions and the scientists
who work within them play different
parts in a variety of issues — from
DES to the SST. Recombinant DNA
research, while only one particular
issue, illustrates some of the ways in
which the links between these in
stitutions operate.'
Basic techniques
The basic techniques of recombin
ant DNA were developed within the
universities — by a team of scientists
headed by Herb Boyer of the Univer
sity of California at San Francisco and
Stanley Cohen of Stanford several
years ago. Funding for this and simi
lar research was allocated by scien
tists within the National Institues of
Health (NIH), an agency of Health,
Education and Welfare. Scientists
also drew up the research guidelines
in this area, which were later
adopted by Donald Fredrickson, Di
rector of the NIH, and which have
since formed the basis for state and
federal legislative action.
Finally, industry has quickly rec
ognized the commercial potential of
this research, and several corpora
tions, including Cetus Corporation
of Berkeley, have been established
to exploit this area. Here again, sci
entists played important roles
beyond their laboratories, with Stan
ford's Stanley Cohen and Joshua
Lederberg appearing on the Cetus
Board of Scientific Advisors and Carl
Djerassi on the Cetus Board of Direc
tors.

Basic techniques
The basic techniques of recombin
ant DNA were developed within the
universities — by a team of scientists
headed by Herb Boyer of the Univer
sity of California at San Francisco and
Stanley Cohen of Stanford several
years ago. Funding for this and simi
lar research was allocated by scien
tists within the National Institues of
Health (NIH), an agency of Health,
Education and Welfare. Scientists
also drew up the research guidelines
in this area, which were later
adopted by Donald Fredrickson, Di
rector of the NIH, and which have
since formed the basis for state and
federal legislative action.
Finally, industry has quickly rec
ognized the commercial potential of
this research, and several corpora
tions, including Cetus Corporation
of Berkeley, have been established
to exploit this area. Here again, sci

beyond their laboratories, with Stan
ford's Stanley Cohen and Joshua
Lederberg appearing on the Cetus
Board of Scientific Advisors and Carl
Djerassi on the Cetus Board of Direc

How can the public participate in
this network of institutions and ex

vehicles for public involvement in
the decision making. Open federal
and state hearings on scientific is
sues offer a means of involvement
for a select segment of the public.
Public interest groups lobbying on a
particular science policy issue pro
vide another type of involvement.
Citizens can also lobby through their
representatives in Congress, or may
even participate in protest actions.
These, and perhaps more direct
mechanisms of public participation

could be effective means of public
involvement. The missing factor is
education. Science has remained iso
lated from the society it supposedly
serves. Accordingly, it has been both
ignored and made into something
mysterious by the rest of society.
This isolation and ignorance have
also made it difficult for scientists to
communicate with legislators and
members of the lay public.
Issues such as recombinant DNA
and nuclear power have shown how
this gap between science and the
public can create unfortunate and
potentially disastrous situations by
encouraging a mutual distrust bet-

ween scientists and the public, by
promoting emotional rather than ra
tional methods of argument and de
cision making, and by overly polariz
ing the issues involved.
The bridging of this gap — the in
volvement of the public in public pol
icy aspects of science — will be one
of the most important tasks for the
future, a task which will have impor
tant effects for both our science and
our society.

Thorn, et al.

The tremendous importance of
science in all aspects of our society is
a recent historical development with
which our society is still searching for
ways to cope. What are the relation
ships between science, industry,
government and the university?
What are the forces currently direct
ing science and technology and how
should science and technology be
directed to best serve our society?
What are the roles played by scien
tists and the public? These are the
basic questions being grappled with
in issues ranging from nuclear power
to recombinant DNA. The answers
we give will reach far beyond any
single issue.
A brief historical overview might
provide help in approaching these
questions. The development of sci
ence is generally identified with the
renaissance period in western his
tory. Certainly technological de
velopments from the steam engine
to the cotton gin had important im
pacts in the 1700's and 1800's, but it
wasn't until near the turn of this cen
tury that scientific research and in
dustrial development became firmly
linked.
Cooperation
Initially, industry relied on inde
pendent research contractors, but by
1920 cooperation between industry
and major universities was shifting
scientific training and research re
sponsibilities to universities like the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and Stanford. This development
was facilitated by the establishment
of the National Research Council by
the federal government to coordi
nate, promote and sponsor the in
tegration of the universities and in
dustry. These changes were also ac
companied by a shift in the orienta
tion of science itself, away from an
idealized search for truth and to
wards an emphasis on utility.
Since World War 11, government
ties with both science and industry
have blos'somed, with a myriad of
agencies, departments and prog
rams being established to allocate
funds, regulate research, police for
safety and formulate policies and
give advise on legislation.
The impact on our society has
been immense. Business, the milit
ary, medicine and the growth of our
society in general all depend on both
basic and applied research. An ex
panding portion of our society's re
sources are used to fund research,
either directly through grants, or in
directly through the tax-exempt
status and special privileges of uni

versities. In turn, scientific research
is having an increasing effect on our
society, not only by promoting the
particular values and assumptions
which underlie science, but more di
rectly by developing technologies —
from television and plastics to com
puters and nuclear power — which
shape our society's basic values and
styles of living.
