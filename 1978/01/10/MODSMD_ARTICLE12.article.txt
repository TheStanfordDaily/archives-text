# Grievance proposal borders on tyranny
## 
### 
Henry Organ

I recently (Daily, Nov. 28) offered
my opinions about the lack of fair
ness of the University's grievance
procedures and in some of the prac
tices of the Employee Relations sec
tion of the Personnel Office. I also
stated that I had filed a grievance,
which is still in process.
I am convinced that my opinions
are closer to being fact. I have now
learned that because of my grievance
the Personnel Office has drafted a
revision to the grievance procedures
that will severely limit staff
employees' rights to grieve and to
appeal to an outside hearing officer.
If the first draft I have seen is
adopted, it will be particularly
damaging to all employees, irrespec
tive of race or sex.
Staff will not be able to file a grie
vance if they believe their job clas
sification or a lateral reassignment is
in violation of a University policy or
procedure, be it fairness, equity or
otherwise. For example, if a super
visor or manager were to publicly
state that "no minority or woman will
ever be a C-9 in my organization,"
persons in those classes could not
file a grievance. And, employees will
not be able to appeal to an outside
hearing officer if they believe they
have not been fairly and equitably
promoted.
Consider some of the other
changes proposed in the first draft:
—the current procedures state!

that "no University employee shall
be discouraged from using this grie
vance procedure." This important
right is not included in the proposed
revision.
—the proposed revision does not
describe how outside hearing offic
ers are chosen, or state the period of
time (now two weeks) within which
hearing officers must be available to
hear the grievance.
—the proposed revision states that
the University's liability shall not be
in excess of 120 days prior to the date
the written grievance was filed, even
though the wrongdoing might ex
tend beyond those 120 days.
—the proposed revision further
discourages employees from serving
as a representative for other
employees in a grievance.
If these revisions to the grievance
procedures are adopted, one can
conclude that the Personnel Office's
actions, and the University's, are
repressive, and border on tyranny. I
believe the recommendation that the
Ombudsman's Office direct an in
vestigation of the grievance proce
dures and the role of the Employee
Relations section, as well as a review
of grievances filed over the last two
or three years, to be more approp
riate than ever.

vance if they believe their job clas
sification or a lateral reassignment is
in violation of a University policy or
procedure, be it fairness, equity or
otherwise. For example, if a super
visor or manager were to publicly
state that "no minority or woman will
ever be a C-9 in my organization,"
persons in those classes could not
file a grievance. And, employees will
not be able to appeal to an outside
hearing officer if they believe they
have not been fairly and equitably
promoted.
Consider some of the other
changes proposed in the first draft:
—the current procedures state!

that "no University employee shall
be discouraged from using this grie
vance procedure." This important
right is not included in the proposed
revision.
—the proposed revision does not
describe how outside hearing offic
ers are chosen, or state the period of
time (now two weeks) within which
hearing officers must be available to
hear the grievance.
—the proposed revision states that
the University's liability shall not be
in excess of 120 days prior to the date
the written grievance was filed, even
though the wrongdoing might ex
tend beyond those 120 days.
—the proposed revision further
discourages employees from serving
as a representative for other
employees in a grievance.
If these revisions to the grievance
procedures are adopted, one can
conclude that the Personnel Office's
actions, and the University's, are
repressive, and border on tyranny. I
believe the recommendation that the
Ombudsman's Office direct an in
vestigation of the grievance proce
dures and the role of the Employee
Relations section, as well as a review
of grievances filed over the last two
or three years, to be more approp
riate than ever.
