# Mark Haddad: the unassuming Rhodes scholar
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Mark Haddad was "wildly
ecstatic" the last Friday of finals
week. He found out he was
one of two students from
California selected for the final
round of interviews for the
prestigious Rhodes Scholar
ship.
When he called his family in
Studio City to tell them the
news, his dad simply said, "I'll
reserve judgment until tomor
row" — the deciding round of
interviews.
Haddad went on to become
the 44th Rhodes scholar from
Stanford and one of 32 stu
dents who will leave by boat
from New York this fall for
studies in England.
"Dad was very pleased and
terribly proud," Haddad said

"The Rhodes committee tries to select
persons on leadership ability, but that
doesn't mean you have to be a leader all
the time/'

with a modest smile.
"Dad's the type of person
who'd point facetiously at an A
and say, "Son, fix this up.' "
Haddad, a senior history
major, plans to study
phil osophy, politics and
economics during his two-year
stay at Oxford where he will
earn the equivalent of a
bachelor's degree.
Challenge
The scholarship, established
by the English administrator to
South Africa Cecil Rhodes in
1906, will pay about 3700 British
pounds a year or about $7067 of
which $4011 will be used for
tuition, Haddad said.
In early October, Haddad
began the grueling rigors of
applying for the Rhodes Scho
larship.
Thi four-page personal
statement required by the

scholarship committee was
"definitely the hardest four
pages I've ever written," Had
dad said, his tall, slim body
eased comfortably onto a
chair.
"I had a great weekend. I had
to complete some research,
write a paper on that research,
take the LSAT (Law School Ad
missions Test) and write the in
itial copy of the Rhodes essay.
"Of all things, the essay
seemed to be the least produc
tive item. But I guess that's the
way the Rhodes committee
weeds out candidates. It's easy
to not complete everything,"
Haddad said.
Nevertheless, Haddad —
with his housemates as editing
advisers and moral supporters
— completed the essay.

"You don't want to boast by
saying "I, I, I' But you have to
show your qualities somehow.
"In my essay, I tried to give a
rationale for my academic re
cord in modern European his
tory, philosophy and environ
mental studies."
He also had to collect six or
seven recommendations and
be interviewed by a Stanford
Rhodes committee. He was
then one of 24 students inter
viewed by the State Rhodes
committee.
"California is the toughest
state to compete in," accord
ing to Jeanette Phillips, who
handles Rhodes and Marshall
scholarship applications here.
"There are just so many qual
ified applicants that many are
not even interviewed."
There were 14 students in the
final regional selection round

round and Haddad was one of
the four selected.
"Everytime I'd go to the in
terviews, I'd tell myself 'What
am I doing here?' It's awe
some, there are some great
people there," said Haddad,
who studied at the Stanford
in-Paris program last fall and
winter quarters, scored a 761
on his LSAT and is now writing
his history honors thesis on the
ecology movement in France.
Interviews
Haddad said going through
interviews was like what he
supposed going through a
Miss America contest would
be.
"Candidates would all go in
and be interviewed one by

one. The good thing is, once a
choice is made, it's made — in
one day.
"I wanted to give as honest
and genuine an interview as I
could. I went in with a lack of
presumption and I really re
spected the others who were
being interviewed.
"I was told the Rhodes
committee uses the interviews
todistinguish thosewhoarear
ticulate from those who are
glib. I tried to be honest and
thoughtful in my responses,"
Haddad said.
"I had a lot of respect for the
committee. They made a sig
nificant effort and I felt, com
ing out of the interview, that if

they didn't choose me it wasn't
because I blew it."
Leader
Mark is the type of person
one is likely to get to know be
cause he exhibits such leader
ship. We spoke on a number of
occasions about philosophy
and politics and our minds
met," Assoc. History Prof.
Lyman Van Slyke said.
"I was extraordinarily
pleased but not surprised
when he won," History Prof.
Gordon Wright said. "He's in
telligent and very well ba
lanced. What strikes me is that
he's not pretentious in any
way. He's very genuine. He's
going to be an excellent rep
resentative of America at Ox

ford."
One factor Haddad said
might have attracted the in
terest of the Rhodes commit
tee was his research of the
ecology movement in France
this summer while on a grant
from the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
"The Center for Research in
International Studies here had
this money for undergradutae
overseas research," Haddad
explained.
"When I went to France, I
knew one contact person. I
spent five or six weeks in Paris
interviewing members of Les
Amis de la Terre. Ecologists are
the warmest and nicest of
French people.
Demonstration
"An incredible experience
for me was being at the de
monstration at Malville in July.
"Malville is near Grenoble.
There were about 50,000 per
sons there, it rained for three
days. There were helicoptors
flying around spraying tear gas
to subdue the crowd.
"Maybe about 2000 persons
were violent. They were the
young Trotskyists, Leninists,
Maoists who are pretty
obscure now. They were just
latching on to the ecologists'
movement," Haddad said.
Haddad hitch-hiked from
town to town and was wel
comed by ecologists along the
way. He was even hosted in a
Grenoble chateau overlooking
the city.
His research on the history
of the French ecology move
ment will comprise the bulk of
his honors essay. He is not tak
ing classes this quarter so he
can finish the essay. He is also

completing research he did last
quarter on an Arizona water
project debacle for an en
vironmental policy class to be
offered next quarter. He may
be a teaching assistant for the
course.
Sports
Haddad is a member of the
History Undergraduate Stu
dents Association (HUGSA),
plays intra-mural football, bas
ketball and soccer as well as
A-league Softball for the Space
Cowboys or the Aberrations.
He is "sort of" an organizer for
the MFers (a team of persons
living on Middlefield Road).
"The Rhodes committee
tries to select persons on lead
ership ability, but that doesn't
mean you have to be a leader
all the time," said Haddad,
who was often a ieam player
rather than organiztr.
"Another thing people fear
is the athletic qualification in
the Rhodes Scholarship. All
you have to be is interested in a
sport and be able to play some
sports. You don't have to
throw touchdown passes for
the LA Rams."
The time to start applying for
Rhodes scholarships is at the
end of one's junior year, ac
cording to Phillips. This year is
the second year women have
been allowed to apply for the
scholarship. Twelve of the 32
students selected this year are
women, Haddad said.
And after the two years in
England?
Haddad smiles shyly. "I
hope to go to law school like
every good, red-blooded his
tory major and major in en
vironmental law."

Mark Haddad was "wildly
ecstatic" the last Friday of finals
week. He found out he was
one of two students from
California selected for the final
round of interviews for the
prestigious Rhodes Scholar
ship.
When he called his family in
Studio City to tell them the
news, his dad simply said, "I'll
reserve judgment until tomor
row" — the deciding round of
interviews.
Haddad went on to become
the 44th Rhodes scholar from
Stanford and one of 32 stu
dents who will leave by boat
from New York this fall for
studies in England.
"Dad was very pleased and
terribly proud," Haddad said

"The Rhodes committee tries to select
persons on leadership ability, but that
doesn't mean you have to be a leader all
the time/'

with a modest smile.
"Dad's the type of person
who'd point facetiously at an A
and say, "Son, fix this up.' "
Haddad, a senior history
major, plans to study
phil osophy, politics and
economics during his two-year
stay at Oxford where he will
earn the equivalent of a
bachelor's degree.
Challenge
The scholarship, established
by the English administrator to
South Africa Cecil Rhodes in
1906, will pay about 3700 British
pounds a year or about $7067 of
which $4011 will be used for
tuition, Haddad said.
In early October, Haddad
began the grueling rigors of
applying for the Rhodes Scho
larship.
Thi four-page personal
statement required by the

scholarship committee was
"definitely the hardest four
pages I've ever written," Had
dad said, his tall, slim body
eased comfortably onto a
chair.
"I had a great weekend. I had
to complete some research,
write a paper on that research,
take the LSAT (Law School Ad
missions Test) and write the in
itial copy of the Rhodes essay.
"Of all things, the essay
seemed to be the least produc
tive item. But I guess that's the
way the Rhodes committee
weeds out candidates. It's easy
to not complete everything,"
Haddad said.
Nevertheless, Haddad —
with his housemates as editing
advisers and moral supporters
— completed the essay.

"You don't want to boast by
saying "I, I, I' But you have to
show your qualities somehow.
"In my essay, I tried to give a
rationale for my academic re
cord in modern European his
tory, philosophy and environ
mental studies."
He also had to collect six or
seven recommendations and
be interviewed by a Stanford
Rhodes committee. He was
then one of 24 students inter
viewed by the State Rhodes
committee.
"California is the toughest
state to compete in," accord
ing to Jeanette Phillips, who
handles Rhodes and Marshall
scholarship applications here.
"There are just so many qual
ified applicants that many are
not even interviewed."
There were 14 students in the
final regional selection round

round and Haddad was one of
the four selected.
"Everytime I'd go to the in
terviews, I'd tell myself 'What
am I doing here?' It's awe
some, there are some great
people there," said Haddad,
who studied at the Stanford
in-Paris program last fall and
winter quarters, scored a 761
on his LSAT and is now writing
his history honors thesis on the
ecology movement in France.
Interviews
Haddad said going through
interviews was like what he
supposed going through a
Miss America contest would
be.
"Candidates would all go in
and be interviewed one by

one. The good thing is, once a
choice is made, it's made — in
one day.
"I wanted to give as honest
and genuine an interview as I
could. I went in with a lack of
presumption and I really re
spected the others who were
being interviewed.
"I was told the Rhodes
committee uses the interviews
todistinguish thosewhoarear
ticulate from those who are
glib. I tried to be honest and
thoughtful in my responses,"
Haddad said.
"I had a lot of respect for the
committee. They made a sig
nificant effort and I felt, com
ing out of the interview, that if

they didn't choose me it wasn't
because I blew it."
Leader
Mark is the type of person
one is likely to get to know be
cause he exhibits such leader
ship. We spoke on a number of
occasions about philosophy
and politics and our minds
met," Assoc. History Prof.
Lyman Van Slyke said.
"I was extraordinarily
pleased but not surprised
when he won," History Prof.
Gordon Wright said. "He's in
telligent and very well ba
lanced. What strikes me is that
he's not pretentious in any
way. He's very genuine. He's
going to be an excellent rep
resentative of America at Ox

ford."
One factor Haddad said
might have attracted the in
terest of the Rhodes commit
tee was his research of the
ecology movement in France
this summer while on a grant
from the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
"The Center for Research in
International Studies here had
this money for undergradutae
overseas research," Haddad
explained.
"When I went to France, I
knew one contact person. I
spent five or six weeks in Paris
interviewing members of Les
Amis de la Terre. Ecologists are
the warmest and nicest of
French people.
Demonstration
"An incredible experience
for me was being at the de
monstration at Malville in July.
"Malville is near Grenoble.
There were about 50,000 per
sons there, it rained for three
days. There were helicoptors
flying around spraying tear gas
to subdue the crowd.
"Maybe about 2000 persons
were violent. They were the
young Trotskyists, Leninists,
Maoists who are pretty
obscure now. They were just
latching on to the ecologists'
movement," Haddad said.
Haddad hitch-hiked from
town to town and was wel
comed by ecologists along the
way. He was even hosted in a
Grenoble chateau overlooking
the city.
His research on the history
of the French ecology move
ment will comprise the bulk of
his honors essay. He is not tak
ing classes this quarter so he
can finish the essay. He is also

completing research he did last
quarter on an Arizona water
project debacle for an en
vironmental policy class to be
offered next quarter. He may
be a teaching assistant for the
course.
Sports
Haddad is a member of the
History Undergraduate Stu
dents Association (HUGSA),
plays intra-mural football, bas
ketball and soccer as well as
A-league Softball for the Space
Cowboys or the Aberrations.
He is "sort of" an organizer for
the MFers (a team of persons
living on Middlefield Road).
"The Rhodes committee
tries to select persons on lead
ership ability, but that doesn't
mean you have to be a leader
all the time," said Haddad,
who was often a ieam player
rather than organiztr.
"Another thing people fear
is the athletic qualification in
the Rhodes Scholarship. All
you have to be is interested in a
sport and be able to play some
sports. You don't have to
throw touchdown passes for
the LA Rams."

Mark Haddad was "wildly
ecstatic" the last Friday of finals
week. He found out he was
one of two students from
California selected for the final
round of interviews for the
prestigious Rhodes Scholar
ship.
When he called his family in
Studio City to tell them the
news, his dad simply said, "I'll
reserve judgment until tomor
row" — the deciding round of
interviews.
Haddad went on to become
the 44th Rhodes scholar from
Stanford and one of 32 stu
dents who will leave by boat
from New York this fall for
studies in England.
"Dad was very pleased and
terribly proud," Haddad said

"The Rhodes committee tries to select
persons on leadership ability, but that
doesn't mean you have to be a leader all
the time/'

with a modest smile.
"Dad's the type of person
who'd point facetiously at an A
and say, "Son, fix this up.' "
Haddad, a senior history
major, plans to study
phil osophy, politics and
economics during his two-year
stay at Oxford where he will
earn the equivalent of a
bachelor's degree.
Challenge
The scholarship, established
by the English administrator to
South Africa Cecil Rhodes in
1906, will pay about 3700 British
pounds a year or about $7067 of
which $4011 will be used for
tuition, Haddad said.
In early October, Haddad
began the grueling rigors of
applying for the Rhodes Scho
larship.
Thi four-page personal
statement required by the

scholarship committee was
"definitely the hardest four
pages I've ever written," Had
dad said, his tall, slim body
eased comfortably onto a
chair.
"I had a great weekend. I had
to complete some research,
write a paper on that research,
take the LSAT (Law School Ad
missions Test) and write the in
itial copy of the Rhodes essay.
"Of all things, the essay
seemed to be the least produc
tive item. But I guess that's the
way the Rhodes committee
weeds out candidates. It's easy
to not complete everything,"
Haddad said.
Nevertheless, Haddad —
with his housemates as editing
advisers and moral supporters
— completed the essay.

"You don't want to boast by
saying "I, I, I' But you have to
show your qualities somehow.
"In my essay, I tried to give a
rationale for my academic re
cord in modern European his
tory, philosophy and environ
mental studies."
He also had to collect six or
seven recommendations and
be interviewed by a Stanford
Rhodes committee. He was
then one of 24 students inter
viewed by the State Rhodes
committee.
"California is the toughest
state to compete in," accord
ing to Jeanette Phillips, who
handles Rhodes and Marshall
scholarship applications here.
"There are just so many qual
ified applicants that many are
not even interviewed."
There were 14 students in the
final regional selection round

round and Haddad was one of
the four selected.
"Everytime I'd go to the in
terviews, I'd tell myself 'What
am I doing here?' It's awe
some, there are some great
people there," said Haddad,
who studied at the Stanford
in-Paris program last fall and
winter quarters, scored a 761
on his LSAT and is now writing
his history honors thesis on the
ecology movement in France.
Interviews
Haddad said going through
interviews was like what he
supposed going through a
Miss America contest would
be.
"Candidates would all go in
and be interviewed one by

one. The good thing is, once a
choice is made, it's made — in
one day.
"I wanted to give as honest
and genuine an interview as I
could. I went in with a lack of
presumption and I really re
spected the others who were
being interviewed.
"I was told the Rhodes
committee uses the interviews
todistinguish thosewhoarear
ticulate from those who are
glib. I tried to be honest and
thoughtful in my responses,"
Haddad said.
"I had a lot of respect for the
committee. They made a sig
nificant effort and I felt, com
ing out of the interview, that if

they didn't choose me it wasn't
because I blew it."
Leader
Mark is the type of person
one is likely to get to know be
cause he exhibits such leader
ship. We spoke on a number of
occasions about philosophy
and politics and our minds
met," Assoc. History Prof.
Lyman Van Slyke said.
"I was extraordinarily
pleased but not surprised
when he won," History Prof.
Gordon Wright said. "He's in
telligent and very well ba
lanced. What strikes me is that
he's not pretentious in any
way. He's very genuine. He's
going to be an excellent rep
resentative of America at Ox

ford."
One factor Haddad said
might have attracted the in
terest of the Rhodes commit
tee was his research of the
ecology movement in France
this summer while on a grant
from the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
"The Center for Research in
International Studies here had
this money for undergradutae
overseas research," Haddad
explained.
"When I went to France, I
knew one contact person. I
spent five or six weeks in Paris
interviewing members of Les
Amis de la Terre. Ecologists are
the warmest and nicest of
French people.
Demonstration
"An incredible experience
for me was being at the de
monstration at Malville in July.
"Malville is near Grenoble.
There were about 50,000 per
sons there, it rained for three
days. There were helicoptors
flying around spraying tear gas
to subdue the crowd.
"Maybe about 2000 persons
were violent. They were the
young Trotskyists, Leninists,
Maoists who are pretty
obscure now. They were just
latching on to the ecologists'
movement," Haddad said.
Haddad hitch-hiked from
town to town and was wel
comed by ecologists along the
way. He was even hosted in a
Grenoble chateau overlooking
the city.
His research on the history
of the French ecology move
ment will comprise the bulk of
his honors essay. He is not tak
ing classes this quarter so he
can finish the essay. He is also

completing research he did last
quarter on an Arizona water
project debacle for an en
vironmental policy class to be
offered next quarter. He may
be a teaching assistant for the
course.
Sports
Haddad is a member of the
History Undergraduate Stu
dents Association (HUGSA),
plays intra-mural football, bas
ketball and soccer as well as
A-league Softball for the Space
Cowboys or the Aberrations.
He is "sort of" an organizer for

Mark Haddad was "wildly
ecstatic" the last Friday of finals
week. He found out he was
one of two students from
California selected for the final
round of interviews for the
prestigious Rhodes Scholar
ship.
When he called his family in
Studio City to tell them the
news, his dad simply said, "I'll
reserve judgment until tomor
row" — the deciding round of
interviews.
Haddad went on to become
the 44th Rhodes scholar from
Stanford and one of 32 stu
dents who will leave by boat
from New York this fall for
studies in England.
"Dad was very pleased and
terribly proud," Haddad said

"The Rhodes committee tries to select
persons on leadership ability, but that
doesn't mean you have to be a leader all
the time/'

with a modest smile.
"Dad's the type of person
who'd point facetiously at an A
and say, "Son, fix this up.' "
Haddad, a senior history
major, plans to study
phil osophy, politics and
economics during his two-year
stay at Oxford where he will
earn the equivalent of a
bachelor's degree.
Challenge
The scholarship, established
by the English administrator to
South Africa Cecil Rhodes in
1906, will pay about 3700 British
pounds a year or about $7067 of
which $4011 will be used for
tuition, Haddad said.
In early October, Haddad
began the grueling rigors of
applying for the Rhodes Scho
larship.
Thi four-page personal
statement required by the

scholarship committee was
"definitely the hardest four
pages I've ever written," Had
dad said, his tall, slim body
eased comfortably onto a
chair.
"I had a great weekend. I had
to complete some research,
write a paper on that research,
take the LSAT (Law School Ad
missions Test) and write the in
itial copy of the Rhodes essay.
"Of all things, the essay
seemed to be the least produc
tive item. But I guess that's the
way the Rhodes committee
weeds out candidates. It's easy
to not complete everything,"
Haddad said.
Nevertheless, Haddad —
with his housemates as editing
advisers and moral supporters
— completed the essay.

"You don't want to boast by
saying "I, I, I' But you have to
show your qualities somehow.
"In my essay, I tried to give a
rationale for my academic re
cord in modern European his
tory, philosophy and environ
mental studies."
He also had to collect six or
seven recommendations and
be interviewed by a Stanford
Rhodes committee. He was
then one of 24 students inter
viewed by the State Rhodes
committee.
"California is the toughest
state to compete in," accord
ing to Jeanette Phillips, who
handles Rhodes and Marshall
scholarship applications here.
"There are just so many qual
ified applicants that many are
not even interviewed."
There were 14 students in the
final regional selection round

round and Haddad was one of
the four selected.
"Everytime I'd go to the in
terviews, I'd tell myself 'What
am I doing here?' It's awe
some, there are some great
people there," said Haddad,
who studied at the Stanford
in-Paris program last fall and
winter quarters, scored a 761
on his LSAT and is now writing
his history honors thesis on the
ecology movement in France.
Interviews
Haddad said going through
interviews was like what he
supposed going through a
Miss America contest would
be.
"Candidates would all go in
and be interviewed one by

one. The good thing is, once a
choice is made, it's made — in
one day.
"I wanted to give as honest
and genuine an interview as I
could. I went in with a lack of
presumption and I really re
spected the others who were
being interviewed.
"I was told the Rhodes
committee uses the interviews
todistinguish thosewhoarear
ticulate from those who are
glib. I tried to be honest and
thoughtful in my responses,"
Haddad said.
"I had a lot of respect for the
committee. They made a sig
nificant effort and I felt, com
ing out of the interview, that if

they didn't choose me it wasn't
because I blew it."
Leader
Mark is the type of person
one is likely to get to know be
cause he exhibits such leader
ship. We spoke on a number of
occasions about philosophy
and politics and our minds
met," Assoc. History Prof.
Lyman Van Slyke said.
"I was extraordinarily
pleased but not surprised
when he won," History Prof.
Gordon Wright said. "He's in
telligent and very well ba
lanced. What strikes me is that
he's not pretentious in any
way. He's very genuine. He's
going to be an excellent rep
resentative of America at Ox

ford."
One factor Haddad said
might have attracted the in
terest of the Rhodes commit
tee was his research of the
ecology movement in France
this summer while on a grant
from the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
"The Center for Research in
International Studies here had
this money for undergradutae
overseas research," Haddad
explained.
"When I went to France, I
knew one contact person. I
spent five or six weeks in Paris
interviewing members of Les
Amis de la Terre. Ecologists are
the warmest and nicest of
French people.
Demonstration
"An incredible experience
for me was being at the de
monstration at Malville in July.
"Malville is near Grenoble.
There were about 50,000 per
sons there, it rained for three
days. There were helicoptors
flying around spraying tear gas
to subdue the crowd.
"Maybe about 2000 persons
were violent. They were the
young Trotskyists, Leninists,
Maoists who are pretty
obscure now. They were just
latching on to the ecologists'
movement," Haddad said.
Haddad hitch-hiked from
town to town and was wel
comed by ecologists along the
way. He was even hosted in a
Grenoble chateau overlooking
the city.
His research on the history
of the French ecology move
ment will comprise the bulk of
his honors essay. He is not tak
ing classes this quarter so he
can finish the essay. He is also

completing research he did last
quarter on an Arizona water
project debacle for an en
vironmental policy class to be
offered next quarter. He may
be a teaching assistant for the
course.
Sports
Haddad is a member of the
History Undergraduate Stu
dents Association (HUGSA),
plays intra-mural football, bas
ketball and soccer as well as
A-league Softball for the Space
Cowboys or the Aberrations.
He is "sort of" an organizer for
the MFers (a team of persons
living on Middlefield Road).
"The Rhodes committee
tries to select persons on lead
ership ability, but that doesn't
mean you have to be a leader
all the time," said Haddad,
who was often a ieam player
rather than organiztr.
"Another thing people fear
is the athletic qualification in
the Rhodes Scholarship. All

throw touchdown passes for
the LA Rams."
