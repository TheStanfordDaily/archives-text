# Adolescence talks begin tomorrow
## 
### 
Some researchers say adolescence — that period between
puberty and adulthood — can now be defined as falling between
the ages of nine and 30.
If such is the case, a slate of weekly discussions on various
aspects of adolescence may interest students here, according to
]an Van Houten, a second-year education graduate student.
"The reason why the range is so large is that kids stay in college
longer and are dependent on their parents longer. That's why the
issue of adolescence looms so large," said Van Houten, who
along with education graduate student Cheryl Perry, organized
this second annual series.
Tomorrow's discussion guest will be Dr. Helen Kraemer, who is
doing statistical research on adolescence in chimpanzees and will
explain how this can apply to humans.
"The whole idea behind this was the need to have a forum for
people at Stanford with expertise in the area to speak here.
"They speak in Washington and New York, but students here at
Stanford don't hear them. Response last spring quarter was great.
The speakers jumped at the chance to speak to students," Van
Houten said.
The program was organized .on a non-existent budget by Van
Houten and Perry last year. This year, the School of Education will
provide the refreshments for the series.
Other speakers scheduled for the series this quarter include
Dr. Thomas F. Anders, director of child psychiatry at Stanford
Medical School, who has done studies on school absenteeism
and Marcia Linn, acting associate professor of education, who
has studied thinking processes.
The discussions will be held each Wednesday at noon starting
tomorrow in Cubberley E-35. Public welcome.
