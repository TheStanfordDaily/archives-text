# What are they looking at?

### 
Half crazed, ecstatic or
merely puzzled gutless,
these actors from stage and
screen are staring at some
thing with more than usual
indifference. For Melinda
Dillon and Cary Cuffey (bot
tom right) it's the alien force
in "Close Encounters of the
Third Kind." For Barbara Di
rickson and company
(right), it's the tower
hopping architect of Ibsen's
"The Master Builder," run
ning in repertory with "The
Circle" and the soon-to
open "All the Way Flome"at
the American Conservatory
Theatre. For "Soap" 's Billy
Crystal (left), it's that hang
ing stomach which the doc
tors' of "Rabbit Test" have
diagnosed as a sure sign of
pregnancy.
