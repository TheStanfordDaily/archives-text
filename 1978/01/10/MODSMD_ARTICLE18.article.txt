# Charlie Haden's history of jazz
## 
### 
The history of Charlie Ha
den's career is almost a history
of modern jazz. Haden first
came to prominence playing
bass with Ornette Coleman
and Don Cherry in the late 50s
and early W)s. Since then he has
played with the fine Bay Area
musician Denny Zeitlin, and
worked with several major
avant-garde groups. Most re
cently, Haden played an im
portant role in the Keith Jarrett
quartet.
Charlie Haden's latest al
bum, "The Golden Number''
on Horizon, consists of four
duets played with several of
the most important figures in
jazz. Haden creates music of a
very intense nature with Don
Cherry, Archie Shepp, Ornette
Coleman and the late Hampton
Hawes. The four selections are
uniformly excellent and serve
as a fine companion piece to
Haden's previous album of
duets, entitled "Closeness."
As with Haden's previous
album these numbers are
duets in the true sense of the
word — the bass is not used as
simply a supporting instru

ment, but as a solo voice in its
own right. More than perhaps
any other instrument, the bass
has been granted much free
dom in the avant-garde move
ment; Charlie Haden is a chief
figure in this so-called "libera
tion" of the bass.
Part of the reason for Ha
den's success as a soloist is the
authority and feeling his play
ing presents. He has a way of
phrasing a note so that it stands
out among more vociferous in
struments. This remarkable
quality of Haden's playing is
apparent throughout "The
Golden Number."
The title track is a fantastic
duet with Coleman. Here, Or
nette plays beautifully de
veloped lines on his trumpet
(interestingly Coleman re
volutionized jazz as a
saxophonist — only in recent
years has he added the trumpet
and violin to his repetoire).
The Haden-Coleman duet is
probably the best cut on the
album, but the piece with
Hampton Hawes is undoub
tedly the most interesting.
Hawes is a traditional pianist

along the lines of Bud Powell,
and as such he is the only
musician on the album not af
filiated with the experimental
movement in jazz.
In his number, Hawes de
monstrates an ability to play
avant-garde piano yet retain
strong blues and gospel feel
ing. This combination of seem
ingly disparate opposites is,
surprisingly, successful.
Like Coleman, Don Cherry
playsaninstrumentwhich heis
not noted for — the flute.
Cherry has mellowed out con
siderably in the past few years
and, I think, to good purpose.
A final word of praise should
go to the label, Horizon Re
cords, which has produced an
unbelievably excellent line of
jazz recordings. The albums
are well packaged with very
good liner notes and each
album contains, as well, trans
cription of a solo on the album.
As such, they are the best pac
kaged albums that jazz has ever
seen.
