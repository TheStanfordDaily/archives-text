Cambodians claim victory
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodia claimed yes
terday to have dealt Vietnam a defeat in the
border war between the two Communist
neighbors, but Thai intelligence sources said
Vietnamese troops were entrenched well in
side Cambodia.
But much of the new fighting in the conflict
appeared to consist of propaganda barrages
via state radio.
President Jimmy Carter's security adviser,
/bigniew Brzezinski, meanwhile, described
the conflict as a "proxy war" between the
Soviet Union and China with the Soviets back
ing Vietnam and China backing Cambodia.
The official Soviet news agency Tass brushed
off the suggestion yesterday and said the
statement demonstrates a Western desire
. . to see that Soviet-Chinese relations re
main spoiled. . .
In the propaganda warfare, Cambodian
radio accused Vietnam of waging an invasion
aimed at overthrowing the Cambodian leader
ship.
Hanoi's official Voice of Vietnam attacked
the charge as "brazen slanderous allegations"
and said the fighting was over Cambodian in
cursions into Vietnamese territory.
The Vietnamese rejected as "fabricated"
Cambodian claims to have retaken the Parrot's
Beak area of Cambodia, which juts into south
ern Vietnam.
The Thai sources said Vietnam may have had
minor losses in the Ha Tien area, at the south
ern tip of the border, and around the Cambo
dian town of Snoul about 13 miles from the
frontier. They regard Cambodian claims of
"great historic victories" as grossly exagger
ated.
lhe Thai sources say the militarily superior
Vietnamese probably have gone as far into
Cambodia as they intend to and now are con
solidating their gains. Cambodia has acknow
ledged setbacks but claims they are tempor
ary.
Court to decide on dirty words
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide if seven words the federal
government considers indecent may be aired
on radio or television.
At the same time, the justices turned down
an attempt by I TO federal judges to insulate
their salaries from inflation and sidestepped
what may become an important test case on

the rights of reporters to cover trials.
Only eight justices returned to the bench
following a four-week recess. Justice William
Brennan jr., the court's senior member, was
reportedly undergoing treatment for a cancer
ous tumor in his throat.
In the "dirty words" case, the court said it
will hear an appeal by the Federal Communica
tions Commission seeking to have reinstated
its 1975 absolute ban on the seven words.
The words depict sexual or excretory organs
and activities.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington struck down the ban, ruling that it
was overbroad and vague.
The legal dispute began four years ago when
a New York City FM radio station, WBAI,
played a segment from the record album,
George Carlin, Occupation: Foole.
The appeals court agreed with the station's
owner, the Pacifica Foundation, that the Carlin
monologue was not obscene and therefore
deserved to be protected by the Constitution's
free-speech guarantees.
Some of the words can be found in great
literary pieces and even the Bible, the appeals
court noted.
In another case the justices refused to hear
an appeal by federal judges who contend the
Constitution guarantees them inflation-proof
salaries. The judges had lost their case previ
ously before the U.S. Court of Claims.
Bad weather grips nation
New York — Snow squalls in the Great Lakes,
sub-freezing weather in the South and coastal
floods with plummeting temperatures and
hurricane-force winds in the Northeast — nota
nice day in the nation's eastern half yesterday.
In the West, Californians dealt with rising
tides that caused some damage before reced
ing, and snow and freezing rain fell in Mon
tana.
Hurricane-force winds swept across Cape
Cod at Chatham, hurricane tide gates were
closed across harbor channels to shut out the
battering surf at New Bedford, Mass., Provi
dence, R. 1., and Stamford, Conn.
The Great Lakes east to New York State area
bore the brunt of the snow — seven inches fell
in parts of Ohio — and the National Weather
Service said snow squalls that reduced visibil
ity to zero at some lakeshore points would
continue through the night.
In Minnesota the wind-chill factor drove
temperatures to M below at Rochester.

Temperatures in Georgia fell from the 60s to
the teens during the night, icing roads and
causing numerous power outages.
Atlanta had a low of 12 yesterday morning,
and thousands of power customers were with
out electricity for varying periods during the
night,
Florida citrus farmers were warned to pre
pare for the coldest night so far this winter as
temperatures were expected to drop into the
teens today.
Shah views Mideast
Aswan, Egypt — The Shah of Iran plunged
into a more active role in Middle East diplo
macy yesterday, giving unqualified support
to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's peace of
fensive.
"I have come to express my feelings of admi
ration and friendship to President Sadat. . . .
We hope what your president is doing will
bring peace," Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
said on his arrival in this palm-lined Nile resort
city for talks with Sadat. "I think Egypt is doing
precisely what we believe is right."
Aswan has become a center for meetings
between Sadat and other world leaders, in
cluding President Jimmy Carter, who stopped
here last Wednesday during his seven-nation
foreign tour, which also included a visit to Iran
for talks with the shah.
The Iranian leader's forthright support came
as a critical boost for Sadat at a time when the
Egyptian-Israeli peace dialogue, already dead
locked over the issue of a Palestinian state,
appeared to have run into new snags on the
question of Israel settlements in the Sinai
Peninsula.
The Shah said he will fly from Aswan to
Riyadh later this week for talks on the Mideast
with King Khaled of Saudi Arabia.
Carter has said the Saudis also support
Sadat, but they have remained publicly neutral
in a dispute that has drawn angry criticism from
some parts of the Arab world.
The shah, a heavy contributor to Egypt's im
poverished economy, also is in touch with Is
rael, where he has leverage as the chief
supplier of oil to the lewish state. Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan reportedly flew
to Tehran recently to brief the shah on Israel's
bargaining position.
Women keep edge in 2000
Sacramento — California still will have

slightly more women than men in the year
2000. And the 29 million people will be nearly
seven years older on the average, in large part
because there will be fewer children.
Walter Hollmann, director of the depart
ment's population research unit, said that
more males than females make long-distance
moves, and that "California is a long distance
away from a lot of places. That gives it a slight
male bias in population."
He added the statistics did not indicate,
however, that California "was loaded with
senior citi/ens." Instead, projections called
for the biggest growth in the group from 45 to
— af>9.s percent increase from 1975 to 2000.
The department also said birth rates dipped
in recent years below "a lifetime replacement
level" but added that might be a temporary dip
reflecting a different phasing of births.
California's population was 21,198,114 in
1975 and will grow .18.2 percent to 29,287,021 in
2000, the report estimated.
Israelis convict American
Tel Aviv, Israel — Terry Fleener, a 23-year-old
American woman convicted of supplying in
formation about the Jewish state to Arab guer
rillas, began a five-year prison term yesterday.
Fleener, of San Antonio, Texas, confessed
during a one-day trial last Tuesday to charges
of conveying information to the enemy, con
spiring to convey information to the enemy
and rendering service to unlawful groups, her
attorney reported. Other c harges were drop
ped after she entered the guilty plea.
She said she will appeal.
The indictment alleged she was to gather
information in Israel and pass it to a member of
an Arab guerrilla organization in Lebanon.
"She confessed in court . . . but the sen
tence does not reflect what she actually did.
She didn't hurt anyone," a doctor told The
Associated Press.
Fleener visited Israel once before, in 1976. It
was not clear if the charges against her resulted
from activities during that visit or from her
actions outside Israel. Under Israeli security
laws, persons can be tried for offense commit
ted against Israel in other countries.

Court to decide on dirty words
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide if seven words the federal
government considers indecent may be aired
on radio or television.
At the same time, the justices turned down
an attempt by I TO federal judges to insulate
their salaries from inflation and sidestepped
what may become an important test case on

the rights of reporters to cover trials.
Only eight justices returned to the bench
following a four-week recess. Justice William
Brennan jr., the court's senior member, was
reportedly undergoing treatment for a cancer
ous tumor in his throat.
In the "dirty words" case, the court said it
will hear an appeal by the Federal Communica
tions Commission seeking to have reinstated
its 1975 absolute ban on the seven words.
The words depict sexual or excretory organs
and activities.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington struck down the ban, ruling that it
was overbroad and vague.
The legal dispute began four years ago when
a New York City FM radio station, WBAI,

George Carlin, Occupation: Foole.
The appeals court agreed with the station's
owner, the Pacifica Foundation, that the Carlin
monologue was not obscene and therefore
deserved to be protected by the Constitution's

Some of the words can be found in great

In another case the justices refused to hear
an appeal by federal judges who contend the
Constitution guarantees them inflation-proof
salaries. The judges had lost their case previ

Bad weather grips nation
New York — Snow squalls in the Great Lakes,
sub-freezing weather in the South and coastal
floods with plummeting temperatures and
hurricane-force winds in the Northeast — nota
nice day in the nation's eastern half yesterday.
In the West, Californians dealt with rising
tides that caused some damage before reced

tana.
Hurricane-force winds swept across Cape
Cod at Chatham, hurricane tide gates were
closed across harbor channels to shut out the
battering surf at New Bedford, Mass., Provi
dence, R. 1., and Stamford, Conn.
The Great Lakes east to New York State area
bore the brunt of the snow — seven inches fell
in parts of Ohio — and the National Weather
Service said snow squalls that reduced visibil

continue through the night.
In Minnesota the wind-chill factor drove
temperatures to M below at Rochester.

Temperatures in Georgia fell from the 60s to
the teens during the night, icing roads and
causing numerous power outages.
Atlanta had a low of 12 yesterday morning,

Shah views Mideast

into a more active role in Middle East diplo

"I have come to express my feelings of admi

We hope what your president is doing will
bring peace," Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
said on his arrival in this palm-lined Nile resort
city for talks with Sadat. "I think Egypt is doing

Aswan has become a center for meetings
between Sadat and other world leaders, in
cluding President Jimmy Carter, who stopped
here last Wednesday during his seven-nation
foreign tour, which also included a visit to Iran
for talks with the shah.
The Iranian leader's forthright support came
as a critical boost for Sadat at a time when the
Egyptian-Israeli peace dialogue, already dead
locked over the issue of a Palestinian state,
appeared to have run into new snags on the
question of Israel settlements in the Sinai
Peninsula.
The Shah said he will fly from Aswan to
Riyadh later this week for talks on the Mideast
with King Khaled of Saudi Arabia.

Bad weather grips nation
New York — Snow squalls in the Great Lakes,
sub-freezing weather in the South and coastal
floods with plummeting temperatures and
hurricane-force winds in the Northeast — nota
nice day in the nation's eastern half yesterday.
In the West, Californians dealt with rising
tides that caused some damage before reced

Hurricane-force winds swept across Cape

closed across harbor channels to shut out the
battering surf at New Bedford, Mass., Provi

The Great Lakes east to New York State area
bore the brunt of the snow — seven inches fell

continue through the night.
In Minnesota the wind-chill factor drove

Shah views Mideast
Aswan, Egypt — The Shah of Iran plunged
into a more active role in Middle East diplo

to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's peace of
fensive.
"I have come to express my feelings of admi

We hope what your president is doing will
bring peace," Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
said on his arrival in this palm-lined Nile resort
city for talks with Sadat. "I think Egypt is doing
precisely what we believe is right."
Aswan has become a center for meetings
between Sadat and other world leaders, in
cluding President Jimmy Carter, who stopped
here last Wednesday during his seven-nation
foreign tour, which also included a visit to Iran
for talks with the shah.
The Iranian leader's forthright support came
as a critical boost for Sadat at a time when the
Egyptian-Israeli peace dialogue, already dead
locked over the issue of a Palestinian state,
appeared to have run into new snags on the
question of Israel settlements in the Sinai
Peninsula.
The Shah said he will fly from Aswan to
Riyadh later this week for talks on the Mideast
with King Khaled of Saudi Arabia.
Carter has said the Saudis also support
Sadat, but they have remained publicly neutral
in a dispute that has drawn angry criticism from
some parts of the Arab world.
The shah, a heavy contributor to Egypt's im
poverished economy, also is in touch with Is

Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan reportedly flew
to Tehran recently to brief the shah on Israel's

Women keep edge in 2000
Sacramento — California still will have

slightly more women than men in the year
2000. And the 29 million people will be nearly
seven years older on the average, in large part
because there will be fewer children.
Walter Hollmann, director of the depart
ment's population research unit, said that
more males than females make long-distance
moves, and that "California is a long distance
away from a lot of places. That gives it a slight
male bias in population."
He added the statistics did not indicate,
however, that California "was loaded with
senior citi/ens." Instead, projections called
for the biggest growth in the group from 45 to
— af>9.s percent increase from 1975 to 2000.
The department also said birth rates dipped
in recent years below "a lifetime replacement
level" but added that might be a temporary dip
reflecting a different phasing of births.
California's population was 21,198,114 in
1975 and will grow .18.2 percent to 29,287,021 in
2000, the report estimated.
Israelis convict American
Tel Aviv, Israel — Terry Fleener, a 23-year-old
American woman convicted of supplying in
formation about the Jewish state to Arab guer
rillas, began a five-year prison term yesterday.
Fleener, of San Antonio, Texas, confessed
during a one-day trial last Tuesday to charges
of conveying information to the enemy, con
spiring to convey information to the enemy
and rendering service to unlawful groups, her
attorney reported. Other c harges were drop
ped after she entered the guilty plea.
She said she will appeal.
The indictment alleged she was to gather
information in Israel and pass it to a member of
an Arab guerrilla organization in Lebanon.
"She confessed in court . . . but the sen

She didn't hurt anyone," a doctor told The
Associated Press.
Fleener visited Israel once before, in 1976. It
was not clear if the charges against her resulted

Cambodians claim victory
Bangkok, Thailand — Cambodia claimed yes
terday to have dealt Vietnam a defeat in the
border war between the two Communist
neighbors, but Thai intelligence sources said
Vietnamese troops were entrenched well in
side Cambodia.
But much of the new fighting in the conflict
appeared to consist of propaganda barrages
via state radio.
President Jimmy Carter's security adviser,
/bigniew Brzezinski, meanwhile, described
the conflict as a "proxy war" between the
Soviet Union and China with the Soviets back
ing Vietnam and China backing Cambodia.
The official Soviet news agency Tass brushed
off the suggestion yesterday and said the
statement demonstrates a Western desire
. . to see that Soviet-Chinese relations re
main spoiled. . .
In the propaganda warfare, Cambodian
radio accused Vietnam of waging an invasion
aimed at overthrowing the Cambodian leader
ship.
Hanoi's official Voice of Vietnam attacked
the charge as "brazen slanderous allegations"
and said the fighting was over Cambodian in
cursions into Vietnamese territory.
The Vietnamese rejected as "fabricated"
Cambodian claims to have retaken the Parrot's
Beak area of Cambodia, which juts into south
ern Vietnam.
The Thai sources said Vietnam may have had
minor losses in the Ha Tien area, at the south
ern tip of the border, and around the Cambo
dian town of Snoul about 13 miles from the
frontier. They regard Cambodian claims of
"great historic victories" as grossly exagger
ated.
lhe Thai sources say the militarily superior
Vietnamese probably have gone as far into
Cambodia as they intend to and now are con

Court to decide on dirty words
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide if seven words the federal
government considers indecent may be aired
on radio or television.
At the same time, the justices turned down
an attempt by I TO federal judges to insulate
their salaries from inflation and sidestepped
what may become an important test case on

the rights of reporters to cover trials.
Only eight justices returned to the bench
following a four-week recess. Justice William
Brennan jr., the court's senior member, was
reportedly undergoing treatment for a cancer
ous tumor in his throat.
In the "dirty words" case, the court said it
will hear an appeal by the Federal Communica
tions Commission seeking to have reinstated
its 1975 absolute ban on the seven words.
The words depict sexual or excretory organs
and activities.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington struck down the ban, ruling that it
was overbroad and vague.
The legal dispute began four years ago when
a New York City FM radio station, WBAI,
played a segment from the record album,
George Carlin, Occupation: Foole.
The appeals court agreed with the station's
owner, the Pacifica Foundation, that the Carlin
monologue was not obscene and therefore
deserved to be protected by the Constitution's
free-speech guarantees.
Some of the words can be found in great
literary pieces and even the Bible, the appeals

border war between the two Communist
neighbors, but Thai intelligence sources said
Vietnamese troops were entrenched well in
side Cambodia.
But much of the new fighting in the conflict
appeared to consist of propaganda barrages
via state radio.
President Jimmy Carter's security adviser,
/bigniew Brzezinski, meanwhile, described
the conflict as a "proxy war" between the
Soviet Union and China with the Soviets back
ing Vietnam and China backing Cambodia.
The official Soviet news agency Tass brushed
off the suggestion yesterday and said the
statement demonstrates a Western desire
. . to see that Soviet-Chinese relations re
main spoiled. . .
In the propaganda warfare, Cambodian
radio accused Vietnam of waging an invasion
aimed at overthrowing the Cambodian leader
ship.
Hanoi's official Voice of Vietnam attacked
the charge as "brazen slanderous allegations"
and said the fighting was over Cambodian in
cursions into Vietnamese territory.
The Vietnamese rejected as "fabricated"
Cambodian claims to have retaken the Parrot's
Beak area of Cambodia, which juts into south
ern Vietnam.
The Thai sources said Vietnam may have had
minor losses in the Ha Tien area, at the south
ern tip of the border, and around the Cambo
dian town of Snoul about 13 miles from the
frontier. They regard Cambodian claims of
"great historic victories" as grossly exagger
ated.
lhe Thai sources say the militarily superior
Vietnamese probably have gone as far into
Cambodia as they intend to and now are con
solidating their gains. Cambodia has acknow
ledged setbacks but claims they are tempor
ary.
Court to decide on dirty words
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide if seven words the federal
government considers indecent may be aired
on radio or television.
At the same time, the justices turned down
an attempt by I TO federal judges to insulate
their salaries from inflation and sidestepped
what may become an important test case on

the rights of reporters to cover trials.
Only eight justices returned to the bench
following a four-week recess. Justice William
Brennan jr., the court's senior member, was
reportedly undergoing treatment for a cancer
ous tumor in his throat.
In the "dirty words" case, the court said it
will hear an appeal by the Federal Communica
tions Commission seeking to have reinstated
its 1975 absolute ban on the seven words.
The words depict sexual or excretory organs
and activities.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington struck down the ban, ruling that it
was overbroad and vague.
The legal dispute began four years ago when
a New York City FM radio station, WBAI,
played a segment from the record album,
George Carlin, Occupation: Foole.
The appeals court agreed with the station's
owner, the Pacifica Foundation, that the Carlin
monologue was not obscene and therefore
deserved to be protected by the Constitution's
free-speech guarantees.
Some of the words can be found in great
literary pieces and even the Bible, the appeals
court noted.
In another case the justices refused to hear
an appeal by federal judges who contend the
Constitution guarantees them inflation-proof
salaries. The judges had lost their case previ
ously before the U.S. Court of Claims.
Bad weather grips nation
New York — Snow squalls in the Great Lakes,
sub-freezing weather in the South and coastal
floods with plummeting temperatures and
hurricane-force winds in the Northeast — nota
nice day in the nation's eastern half yesterday.
In the West, Californians dealt with rising
tides that caused some damage before reced
ing, and snow and freezing rain fell in Mon
tana.
Hurricane-force winds swept across Cape
Cod at Chatham, hurricane tide gates were
closed across harbor channels to shut out the
battering surf at New Bedford, Mass., Provi
dence, R. 1., and Stamford, Conn.
The Great Lakes east to New York State area
bore the brunt of the snow — seven inches fell
in parts of Ohio — and the National Weather
Service said snow squalls that reduced visibil
ity to zero at some lakeshore points would
continue through the night.
In Minnesota the wind-chill factor drove
temperatures to M below at Rochester.

Temperatures in Georgia fell from the 60s to
the teens during the night, icing roads and
causing numerous power outages.
Atlanta had a low of 12 yesterday morning,
and thousands of power customers were with
out electricity for varying periods during the
night,
Florida citrus farmers were warned to pre
pare for the coldest night so far this winter as
temperatures were expected to drop into the
teens today.
Shah views Mideast
Aswan, Egypt — The Shah of Iran plunged
into a more active role in Middle East diplo
macy yesterday, giving unqualified support
to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's peace of
fensive.
"I have come to express my feelings of admi
ration and friendship to President Sadat. . . .
We hope what your president is doing will
bring peace," Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
said on his arrival in this palm-lined Nile resort
city for talks with Sadat. "I think Egypt is doing
precisely what we believe is right."
Aswan has become a center for meetings
between Sadat and other world leaders, in
cluding President Jimmy Carter, who stopped
here last Wednesday during his seven-nation
foreign tour, which also included a visit to Iran
for talks with the shah.
The Iranian leader's forthright support came
as a critical boost for Sadat at a time when the
Egyptian-Israeli peace dialogue, already dead
locked over the issue of a Palestinian state,
appeared to have run into new snags on the
question of Israel settlements in the Sinai
Peninsula.
The Shah said he will fly from Aswan to
Riyadh later this week for talks on the Mideast
with King Khaled of Saudi Arabia.
Carter has said the Saudis also support
Sadat, but they have remained publicly neutral
in a dispute that has drawn angry criticism from
some parts of the Arab world.
The shah, a heavy contributor to Egypt's im
poverished economy, also is in touch with Is
rael, where he has leverage as the chief
supplier of oil to the lewish state. Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan reportedly flew
to Tehran recently to brief the shah on Israel's
bargaining position.
Women keep edge in 2000
Sacramento — California still will have

slightly more women than men in the year
2000. And the 29 million people will be nearly
seven years older on the average, in large part
because there will be fewer children.
Walter Hollmann, director of the depart
ment's population research unit, said that
more males than females make long-distance
moves, and that "California is a long distance
away from a lot of places. That gives it a slight
male bias in population."
He added the statistics did not indicate,
however, that California "was loaded with
senior citi/ens." Instead, projections called
for the biggest growth in the group from 45 to
— af>9.s percent increase from 1975 to 2000.
The department also said birth rates dipped
in recent years below "a lifetime replacement
level" but added that might be a temporary dip
reflecting a different phasing of births.
California's population was 21,198,114 in
1975 and will grow .18.2 percent to 29,287,021 in
2000, the report estimated.
Israelis convict American
Tel Aviv, Israel — Terry Fleener, a 23-year-old
American woman convicted of supplying in
formation about the Jewish state to Arab guer
rillas, began a five-year prison term yesterday.
Fleener, of San Antonio, Texas, confessed
during a one-day trial last Tuesday to charges
of conveying information to the enemy, con
spiring to convey information to the enemy
and rendering service to unlawful groups, her
attorney reported. Other c harges were drop
ped after she entered the guilty plea.
She said she will appeal.
The indictment alleged she was to gather
information in Israel and pass it to a member of
an Arab guerrilla organization in Lebanon.
"She confessed in court . . . but the sen
tence does not reflect what she actually did.
She didn't hurt anyone," a doctor told The
Associated Press.
Fleener visited Israel once before, in 1976. It
was not clear if the charges against her resulted
from activities during that visit or from her
actions outside Israel. Under Israeli security
laws, persons can be tried for offense commit
ted against Israel in other countries.
Today's weather
Chance of showers this morning. Mostly fair
this afternoon and night. Increasing cloudi
ness tomorrow. Lows 40s. Highs 50s. Chance
