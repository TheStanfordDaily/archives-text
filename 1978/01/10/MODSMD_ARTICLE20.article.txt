A rare loss of book orders by the
Interdepartmental Mail service has
kept textbooks for Econ 266 and 117
from arriving, according to Sandy
Hoyt of the Bookstore textbook de
partment.
Normally, department secretaries
fill out book orders, send them
through ID mail to the Bookstore,
which then sends the orders on to
publishers.
But when the Economics Depart
ment complained late last quarter
that the books weren't here, the
Bookstore did some detective work
to trace the slip-up, she said.
Over the break, they tried to con
tact one of the teachers, Ron Mckin
non; but he had taken a loyal jaunt to
the Sun Bowl, Hoyt said.
"We couldn't find the orders any
where. We looked high and low,"
she said. "We were upset" and,
when they returned, "both instruc
tors were upset,'' she said.
Sometimes, Hoyt said, teachers
expect books to come in that they
neglected to order. But in this case,
the Economics Department had a re
cord of the order.
"I have no idea what happened,"
said department secretary Audrey
Foley. "All I have is two requisitions.
I ordered the books."
"We assume responsibility," said
Hoyt. Though the orders must have
been lost in I.D. mail, no one's to
blame, she said.
Luckily, the tense episode is wind
ing down. "We called McGraw-Hill
and any other connections we have.
All the stuff is coming air mail," Hoyt
said. The books should be in some
time this week, she added.
Forany students worried about the
Bookstore's reliability in quarters to
come, "It doesn't happen very of
ten, " she commented. "Seldom do
we lose anything."
