# New computer center awaits approval
## 
### Richard Bowditch 
The University Planning Board is
reviewing the design of a proposed
$3.6 million computer center before
submitting the plan to the Board of
Trustees next month for final ap
proval, according to planner Robert
Esparza.
Early in November the trustees'
Academic Affairs Committee ap
proved the need for the new build
ing, sited for the Jordan Quad area.
Next month, after the Committee
on Land and Building Development,

an advisory body composed of stu
dents, faculty and staff, and the Uni
versity's vice presidents have re
viewed it, the plan will be presented
to the trustees' Committees on Land
and Buildings and Finance and De
velopment, according to Esparza.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president tor trustee affairs, said "no
significant opposition, if any, has
been voiced." He said he did not
know, however, whether trustee ap
proval is probable.
Esparza said the project is "on

schedule," and if approval is granted
bids will be solicited in May and (on
struction should begin in |une. But
he cautioned, "That's right now a lit
tle optimistic."
The construction of the new facil
ity, just south of Polya Hall, is part of
a larger plan to consolidate Stanford
Center for Information Processing
(SCIP) campus-based activities
within the Jordan Quad area.
A trustee background report said
the benefits of consolidation will in
clude "substantial operational sav
ings," allocatiqn of enough space for
computers, staff and users, and re
moval of five temporary buildings
from behind the Old Pavilion.
Currently SCIP's activities are
spread across campus, located in the
basement of Encina Hall, the tncina
Commons behind the Old Pavilion
and in Pine Hall.
The new facility will house user

facilities, the machine room and the
SCIP administration. SCIP will retain
Pine Hall, and Polya Hall will house
programming functions.
The rest of )ordan Quad, soon to
be vacated, will be available for
SCIP's expansion, according to Phil
Williams, director of planning.
The scheduled relocation of the
Computer Science and Communica
tion Departments make possible the
concentration of SCIP in Jordan
Quad.
Computer Science will move to
Margaret lacks Hall, currently under
reconstruction, and Communication
will move to Building 120, scheduled
for renovation.
The trustee report predicts occu
pancy of the new facility in 1979.
Planner Esparza said, "When we be
gan, we expected a lot of delays but it
seems like everyone is committed to
the project."

bids will be solicited in May and (on
struction should begin in |une. But
he cautioned, "That's right now a lit
tle optimistic."
The construction of the new facil
ity, just south of Polya Hall, is part of
a larger plan to consolidate Stanford
Center for Information Processing
(SCIP) campus-based activities
within the Jordan Quad area.
A trustee background report said
the benefits of consolidation will in
clude "substantial operational sav
ings," allocatiqn of enough space for
computers, staff and users, and re
moval of five temporary buildings
from behind the Old Pavilion.
Currently SCIP's activities are
spread across campus, located in the
basement of Encina Hall, the tncina
Commons behind the Old Pavilion
and in Pine Hall.
The new facility will house user

facilities, the machine room and the
SCIP administration. SCIP will retain
Pine Hall, and Polya Hall will house
programming functions.
The rest of )ordan Quad, soon to
be vacated, will be available for
SCIP's expansion, according to Phil
Williams, director of planning.
The scheduled relocation of the
Computer Science and Communica
tion Departments make possible the
concentration of SCIP in Jordan
Quad.
Computer Science will move to
Margaret lacks Hall, currently under
reconstruction, and Communication
will move to Building 120, scheduled
for renovation.
The trustee report predicts occu
pancy of the new facility in 1979.
Planner Esparza said, "When we be
gan, we expected a lot of delays but it
seems like everyone is committed to
the project."
