# Med center billing practice challenged
## 
### Andrea James 
In at least two instances, the Medi
cal Center has billed Medicare twice
tor services rendered, a labor union
leader declared yesterday.
Dr. Robert Weinmann, president
of the Union of American Physicians
Local 7402, claimed at a San lose
press conference yesterday he can
provide documentation proving the
University double-billed Medicare
for two visits in July.
He also said the University is not
alone in this double-billing practice,
which he described as apparently
legal, but "clearly unfair and im
moral.
Weinmann claims the University
bills Medicare's carrier, Blue Shield,
for the doctor's fees and then bills
Blue Cross, another carrier, for hos
pital expenses.
He added that because physician's
services are included in the bill for
hospital expenses, the University
bills Medicare twice for the same
services.
The University takes the position
that Blue Cross billing covers institu
tional costs for patient care and ad
ministrative costs not included in the
professional fee, while Blue Shield
billing pays for services rendered by
the physician.

"The physician's fee does not
cover all the costs of the patient's
visit," a University spokesman said.
The spokesman also said this pro
cedure is the way we are instructed
by the Medicare program to bill for
services rendered on an out-patient
basis and does not represent double
billing."
Weinmann commented at the
press conference that the "slam bang
billing procedures by medical
schools are a major factor in the ris
ing costs of medical care in our na
tion."
Dr. Sanford Marcus, national pres
ident of the K),00()-member doctor's
union, described the double billing
as a "monumental rip-off of the pub
lic treasury" because all Medicare
payments ultimately are a public ex
pense.
The union, the Bureau of Medical
Quality Assurance and the California
Senate Business and Professions
Committee are currently conducting
investigations into Stanford's billing
procedures.
Last week, the University was
served a subpoena by the bureau to
turn overall information dealing with
the University's medical services
plan.
