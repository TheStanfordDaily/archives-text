# Disturbances may bring power to Italian Communist Party
## 
### 
Rome (AP) — After a weekend of
political violence, Italy's premier
faced mounting pressure yesterday
to agree to an emergency govern
ment that would include Com
munists. The U.S. ambassador pre
pared to head home for consulta
tions on the uncertain political situa
tion here.
Beefed-up police forces ringed
Rome with roadblocks in an effort to
head off further disturbances.
Christian Democrat Premier Ciulio
Andreotti conferred with leaders of
his own party for two hours to dis
cuss demands by the Communists
and other parties that the Com
munists be given a share of power to
strengthen the government and re
store stability.
Andreotti's minority government
has ruled with tacit Communist sup

port since 1976, but Communists
have not been put on the cabinet.
Enrico Berlinguer's Italian Com
munist Party maintains it is a
"Eurocommunist" group free of
Soviet control and dedicated to par
liamentary democracy.
U.S. Ambassador Richard Gardner
is to leave for Washington today to
discuss the developments with Car
ter administration officials.
The Ford administration two years
ago raised the possibility of cutting
ott aid to Italy, a U.S. ally in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, if
Communists were brought into the
government. President |immy Carter
has taken a softer stance, but calling
Gardner home is in itself a sign of
official concern.
The weekend violence in Rome
was Italy's worst in almost 10 years.

Two young right-wingers were
shot dead on a street Saturday, and
the killings touched off a rampage by
rightist youths that night and Sunday
in which another young right-winger
was shot and c ritically wounded. He
died yesterday.
Much of the violence is bred in
high schools and universities where
Marxist splinter groups have battled
followers of the Italian Social Move
ment, a right-wing party led by
former collaborators of the late Fas
cist dictator Benito Mussolini.
Since the Communists won 37 per
cent of the vote in 1976 national elec
tions, second only to the Christian
Democrats, no individual party has
been strong enough to rule alone,
and Andreotti has depended on indi
rect Communist backing.
