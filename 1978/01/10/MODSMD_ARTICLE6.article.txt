# Financial aid abuse increasing in U.S.
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Abuse and fraud in federally
funded student financial aid prog
rams have become an increasing
problem for the U.S. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Last year Congress established the
Inspector General's Office as an
agency to combat the problems in all
HEW programs, and the agency now
devotes over one-fourth of its audit
ing time to examining student aid
programs.
According to Warren Spruill, the
University's internal auditor, Stan
ford was last audited three years ago
by the Department of Defense on
behalf of HEW
"The audit was done bee ause HEW
disc overed some problem at another
college and decided to audit all of
their student aid programs," Spruill
explained.
"Stanford did not have any disal
lowances; they did not find any fi
nancial irregularities," said Spruill.
There will be an HEW audit here
again this year, Spruill said, with
most of the work scheduled between
|une and October.
In addition, the University con
ducts its own audits every year
through an outside agency, said
Spruill.
"We have never found any in
stances of fraud here," commented
Spruill, adding that no fraud orabuse
of the programs exist "that I'm aware
of."
Spruill explained that "we review
the applications very carefully" and
"if we have any doubt that the person
is telling the truth, we ask for tax re
turns.
"Our experience is that students
and their parents are honest in pro
viding us with information," Spruill
continued.
'No fraud or abuse'
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff
also said that "There is no fraud or
abuse as far as we know."
However, some students have
found ways to get around the finan
cial aid system. For example, some
students will keep personal savings
in the account of a friend or relative
in order to receive more financial
aid.
As one student explained, "The
University makes you contribute a
certain percentage of your personal
savings, so if you have less savings,
you get more financial aid."
However, the student said he did
not regard this as fraud because "if

you give the money to somebody
else to put in their account, it's not
really yours any more. They don't
have to give it back."
According to Spruill, the types of
fraud and abuse the HEW audits are
looking for primarily concern prop
rietary or profit-making schools.
'Fictitious' filers
These schools have been known to
"file fictitious reports for financial
aid" and conduct a type of consumer
traud in which the schools "entice
people to apply, and, after students
become disenchanted and drop out,
still collect money from the govern
ment," Spruill said.
Charles Banks, a public affairs of
ficer for HCW in San Francisco, said
the federal government has also
"started to move aggressively to col
lect loans trom students after they
have left school" and is also en
couraging schools to be more ag
gressive in collecting their loans.
Banks said that 590,000 students in
the nation had delinquent loans last
year, which was a default rate of lf>
percent. The average student loan
default was $950, Banks added.
According to Joseph Jedd, man
ager of student accounting here, the
overall default rate here was b per
cent last year.
Jedd also pointed out that the Uni
versity has lost a total of $71,J41 from
students declaring bankruptcy after
graduation.
'Obvious' abuse
Jedd said this practice is "obvi
ously an abuse of the law" but could
not be called fraud because "the law,
at its present condition, allows any
person to declare bankruptcy for a
relatively small fee."
For example, "one student de
clared bankruptcy and after he w..s
discharged, he 1 obtained a very
well-paying position with one of the
top accounting firms."
Jedd added that these students are
"taking advantage of a law which was
never meant to discharge this kind of
responsibility."
