# What you don't read
## Repression unreported 
### 
Moshe Aelion

We hear lots of talk about human
rights these days. The talk comes out
of two principal sources; one of
them is the Carter administration.
The other one is less well defined. It
consists of journalists, commen
tators and an array of public figures
and intellectuals.
The countries on which the media
and the administration focus their at
tention are usually the same and not
many in number: The Soviet Union
and its treatment of dissidents, apar
theid in South Africa, political pris
oners in Chile and maybe in Argen
tina. You do not read or hear too
much about repression in other
countries.
The point I would like to make in
this article is that, in the first place,
severe repressio 'oes on in several
other (mostly leftist) countries, and
second, that there is something mor
ally wrong in shutting off one's atten
tion to oppression in certain parts of
the world, and complaining about it
selectively.
Obvious place
The obvious place to start is Tibet.
The People's Republic of China illeg
ally annexed Tibet in 1949, crushed
all forms of public expression and
prohibited the practicing of the na
tional religion. National rights for the
Tibetans are nonexistent. The na
tional and spiritual leaders, the Dalay
Lamas, are exiled. They primarily live
in India at present. In 1959, a rebell
ion whose aim was to achieve free
dom from the Chinese rule was
crushed
We can move on to Vietnam and
Cambodia, countries which were
freed in recent years from "im
perialist colonialist rule." Shouldn't
we hope to find in these countries,
following the "victory of the peoples'
progressive revolution," a happy,
classless society where "everybody
gives according to his ability and re
ceives according to his needs?" As
usual, the truth seems to bea little bit
different.
South Vietnam was not liberated
by General Giap's troops, it was con
quered. Most of the administrative
positions in the south are held by
North Vietnamese; anyone exhibit
ing the slightest opposition to the re
gime is immediately sent to a reedu
cation camp for an indefinite period
of time. Intellectuals are the first to
go since, as it is a rule in any dictato
rial regime, they tend to be indepen
dent in thinking and thus the least
trustworthy for the rulers.
Hundreds of thousands of South
Vietnamese fled their country and
are now refugees in many parts of the
world.
Worse in Cambodia
It is hard to believe that a situation
can be worse, but it is much worse in

Cambodia. Between 70 and 90 per
cent of the people who held any pos
ition of importance before the
Khmer Rouge regime came into
power were summarily executed, if
they were not lucky enough to flee
the country. This includes petty of
ficers, government officials, civil ser
vants, teachers, clerks, merchants
and soon. Hundreds of thousands of
city dwellers were forced out of their
homes, into aimless marches in the
jungles. Most of them died. Accord
ing to some estimates, about two
million people were massacred in
Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge re
gime.
Let us now turn to Syria. The ruler
of this country, President Hafez As
sad, was once described by the State
Department as a "moderate." lews in
Syria carry an identification card in
which the word "Jewish" is splashed
across in red letters. This is for ease
of identification, so that they could
be easily discriminated against, lews
are confined to the ghettos; iney are
not allowed to live outside them.
They are denied permission to leave
the country or emigrate (neither to
Israel nor to any other country). They
are allowed to engage only in a small
subset of occupations.
From time to time, mock, orches
trated trials are held, as a result of
which )ews are finally executed. The
situation there is reminiscent of the
darker periods of the middle ages. In
the face of all this, a renowned
American journalist, Mike Wallace of
CBS, went to Syria, talked with the
chief rabbi and a few government of
ficials and came back reporting that
Jews lead a happy life in Syria.
Kurdish rebellion
Let us consider Iraq now. During
the early 19705, the Kurdish rebell
ion was crushed in the mountainous
part of the country. The Kurds are a
minority in Iraq. They possess their
own language, culture, and national
heritage and aspirations. The Kurds
were armed with light weaponry
only; still, a Kurdish resistance
movement fought the Iraqi regime
successfully for years.
Eventually, in 1974, the Soviet —
supplied MIG jets and T-14 and T-55
tanks overcame the Kurdish freedom
fighters. Tens of thousands of Kurds
were massacred. Time and News
week ran small articles in their inter
national sections under the headline
"Genocide in Iraq." And that was all.
Who cares, anyway? Iraq is an oil
producing country, mind you.
The United Nations is the last body
in the world to turn to in the search
for redress. Three official members
of the U.N., Lithuania, Latvia and Es
tonia, are actually "captive nations."
(It is not proper for a progressive in
tellectual to use this phrase these

days, since it was coined during the
Eisenhower administration and is not
considered in fashion with detente.)
All of the government officials and,
of course, the U.N. representatives
of these nations are Soviet ap
paratchiks. National, religious or cul
tural public expressions in these
countries are nonexistent.
Another case of a nation without
sovereignty is Armenia. Armenia is
divided up between four countries:
Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Al
though the Armenians have their own
distinct culture, language and na
tional heritage, they have no hope of
attaining national self-expression.
What can you and I, the individu
als, do about all this? Not much, if
anything at all. But the first thing is to
care; to be alert. Also, you should be
suspicious of official communiques
and propaganda, whether it comes
from the Soviet Union, the United
Nations or the State Department.
The best sources of information
are internationally known periodi
cals like the New York Times, the L.A.
Times, and independent pro
freedom agencies like Amnesty In
ternational and Freedom House.

We hear lots of talk about human
rights these days. The talk comes out
of two principal sources; one of
them is the Carter administration.
The other one is less well defined. It
consists of journalists, commen
tators and an array of public figures
and intellectuals.
The countries on which the media
and the administration focus their at
tention are usually the same and not
many in number: The Soviet Union
and its treatment of dissidents, apar
theid in South Africa, political pris
oners in Chile and maybe in Argen
tina. You do not read or hear too
much about repression in other
countries.
The point I would like to make in
this article is that, in the first place,
severe repressio 'oes on in several
other (mostly leftist) countries, and
second, that there is something mor
ally wrong in shutting off one's atten
tion to oppression in certain parts of
the world, and complaining about it
selectively.
Obvious place
The obvious place to start is Tibet.
The People's Republic of China illeg
ally annexed Tibet in 1949, crushed
all forms of public expression and
prohibited the practicing of the na
tional religion. National rights for the
Tibetans are nonexistent. The na
tional and spiritual leaders, the Dalay
Lamas, are exiled. They primarily live
in India at present. In 1959, a rebell
ion whose aim was to achieve free
dom from the Chinese rule was
crushed
We can move on to Vietnam and
Cambodia, countries which were
freed in recent years from "im
perialist colonialist rule." Shouldn't
we hope to find in these countries,
following the "victory of the peoples'
progressive revolution," a happy,
classless society where "everybody
gives according to his ability and re
ceives according to his needs?" As
usual, the truth seems to bea little bit
different.
South Vietnam was not liberated
by General Giap's troops, it was con
quered. Most of the administrative
positions in the south are held by
North Vietnamese; anyone exhibit
ing the slightest opposition to the re
gime is immediately sent to a reedu
cation camp for an indefinite period
of time. Intellectuals are the first to
go since, as it is a rule in any dictato
rial regime, they tend to be indepen
dent in thinking and thus the least
trustworthy for the rulers.
Hundreds of thousands of South
Vietnamese fled their country and
are now refugees in many parts of the
world.
Worse in Cambodia
It is hard to believe that a situation
can be worse, but it is much worse in

Cambodia. Between 70 and 90 per
cent of the people who held any pos
ition of importance before the
Khmer Rouge regime came into
power were summarily executed, if
they were not lucky enough to flee
the country. This includes petty of
ficers, government officials, civil ser
vants, teachers, clerks, merchants
and soon. Hundreds of thousands of
city dwellers were forced out of their
homes, into aimless marches in the
jungles. Most of them died. Accord
ing to some estimates, about two
million people were massacred in
Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge re
gime.
Let us now turn to Syria. The ruler
of this country, President Hafez As
sad, was once described by the State
Department as a "moderate." lews in
Syria carry an identification card in
which the word "Jewish" is splashed
across in red letters. This is for ease
of identification, so that they could
be easily discriminated against, lews
are confined to the ghettos; iney are
not allowed to live outside them.
They are denied permission to leave
the country or emigrate (neither to
Israel nor to any other country). They
are allowed to engage only in a small
subset of occupations.
From time to time, mock, orches
trated trials are held, as a result of
which )ews are finally executed. The
situation there is reminiscent of the
darker periods of the middle ages. In
the face of all this, a renowned
American journalist, Mike Wallace of
CBS, went to Syria, talked with the
chief rabbi and a few government of
ficials and came back reporting that
Jews lead a happy life in Syria.
Kurdish rebellion
Let us consider Iraq now. During
the early 19705, the Kurdish rebell
ion was crushed in the mountainous
part of the country. The Kurds are a
minority in Iraq. They possess their
own language, culture, and national
heritage and aspirations. The Kurds
were armed with light weaponry
only; still, a Kurdish resistance
movement fought the Iraqi regime
successfully for years.
Eventually, in 1974, the Soviet —
supplied MIG jets and T-14 and T-55
tanks overcame the Kurdish freedom
fighters. Tens of thousands of Kurds
were massacred. Time and News
week ran small articles in their inter
national sections under the headline
"Genocide in Iraq." And that was all.
Who cares, anyway? Iraq is an oil
producing country, mind you.
The United Nations is the last body
in the world to turn to in the search
for redress. Three official members
of the U.N., Lithuania, Latvia and Es
tonia, are actually "captive nations."
(It is not proper for a progressive in
tellectual to use this phrase these

days, since it was coined during the
Eisenhower administration and is not
considered in fashion with detente.)
All of the government officials and,
of course, the U.N. representatives
of these nations are Soviet ap
paratchiks. National, religious or cul
tural public expressions in these
countries are nonexistent.
Another case of a nation without
sovereignty is Armenia. Armenia is
divided up between four countries:
Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Al
though the Armenians have their own
distinct culture, language and na
tional heritage, they have no hope of
attaining national self-expression.
What can you and I, the individu
als, do about all this? Not much, if
anything at all. But the first thing is to
care; to be alert. Also, you should be
suspicious of official communiques
and propaganda, whether it comes
from the Soviet Union, the United
Nations or the State Department.

countries are nonexistent.
Another case of a nation without
sovereignty is Armenia. Armenia is
divided up between four countries:
Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Al
though the Armenians have their own
distinct culture, language and na
tional heritage, they have no hope of
attaining national self-expression.
What can you and I, the individu
als, do about all this? Not much, if
anything at all. But the first thing is to
care; to be alert. Also, you should be
suspicious of official communiques
and propaganda, whether it comes
from the Soviet Union, the United
Nations or the State Department.
The best sources of information
are internationally known periodi
cals like the New York Times, the L.A.
Times, and independent pro
freedom agencies like Amnesty In

We hear lots of talk about human
rights these days. The talk comes out
of two principal sources; one of
them is the Carter administration.
The other one is less well defined. It
consists of journalists, commen
tators and an array of public figures
and intellectuals.
The countries on which the media
and the administration focus their at
tention are usually the same and not
many in number: The Soviet Union
and its treatment of dissidents, apar
theid in South Africa, political pris
oners in Chile and maybe in Argen
tina. You do not read or hear too
much about repression in other
countries.
The point I would like to make in
this article is that, in the first place,
severe repressio 'oes on in several
other (mostly leftist) countries, and
second, that there is something mor
ally wrong in shutting off one's atten
tion to oppression in certain parts of
the world, and complaining about it
selectively.
Obvious place
The obvious place to start is Tibet.
The People's Republic of China illeg
ally annexed Tibet in 1949, crushed
all forms of public expression and
prohibited the practicing of the na
tional religion. National rights for the
Tibetans are nonexistent. The na
tional and spiritual leaders, the Dalay
Lamas, are exiled. They primarily live
in India at present. In 1959, a rebell
ion whose aim was to achieve free
dom from the Chinese rule was
crushed
We can move on to Vietnam and
Cambodia, countries which were
freed in recent years from "im
perialist colonialist rule." Shouldn't
we hope to find in these countries,
following the "victory of the peoples'
progressive revolution," a happy,
classless society where "everybody
gives according to his ability and re
ceives according to his needs?" As
usual, the truth seems to bea little bit
different.
South Vietnam was not liberated
by General Giap's troops, it was con
quered. Most of the administrative
positions in the south are held by
North Vietnamese; anyone exhibit
ing the slightest opposition to the re
gime is immediately sent to a reedu
cation camp for an indefinite period
of time. Intellectuals are the first to
go since, as it is a rule in any dictato
rial regime, they tend to be indepen
dent in thinking and thus the least
trustworthy for the rulers.
Hundreds of thousands of South
Vietnamese fled their country and
are now refugees in many parts of the
world.
Worse in Cambodia
It is hard to believe that a situation
can be worse, but it is much worse in

Cambodia. Between 70 and 90 per
cent of the people who held any pos
ition of importance before the
Khmer Rouge regime came into
power were summarily executed, if
they were not lucky enough to flee
the country. This includes petty of
ficers, government officials, civil ser
vants, teachers, clerks, merchants
and soon. Hundreds of thousands of
city dwellers were forced out of their
homes, into aimless marches in the
jungles. Most of them died. Accord
ing to some estimates, about two
million people were massacred in
Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge re
gime.
Let us now turn to Syria. The ruler
of this country, President Hafez As
sad, was once described by the State
Department as a "moderate." lews in
Syria carry an identification card in
which the word "Jewish" is splashed
across in red letters. This is for ease
of identification, so that they could
be easily discriminated against, lews
are confined to the ghettos; iney are
not allowed to live outside them.
They are denied permission to leave
the country or emigrate (neither to
Israel nor to any other country). They
are allowed to engage only in a small
subset of occupations.
From time to time, mock, orches
trated trials are held, as a result of
which )ews are finally executed. The
situation there is reminiscent of the
darker periods of the middle ages. In
the face of all this, a renowned
American journalist, Mike Wallace of
CBS, went to Syria, talked with the
chief rabbi and a few government of
ficials and came back reporting that
Jews lead a happy life in Syria.
Kurdish rebellion
Let us consider Iraq now. During
the early 19705, the Kurdish rebell
ion was crushed in the mountainous
part of the country. The Kurds are a
minority in Iraq. They possess their
own language, culture, and national
heritage and aspirations. The Kurds
were armed with light weaponry
only; still, a Kurdish resistance
movement fought the Iraqi regime
successfully for years.
Eventually, in 1974, the Soviet —
supplied MIG jets and T-14 and T-55
tanks overcame the Kurdish freedom
fighters. Tens of thousands of Kurds
were massacred. Time and News
week ran small articles in their inter
national sections under the headline
"Genocide in Iraq." And that was all.
Who cares, anyway? Iraq is an oil
producing country, mind you.
The United Nations is the last body
in the world to turn to in the search
for redress. Three official members
of the U.N., Lithuania, Latvia and Es
tonia, are actually "captive nations."
(It is not proper for a progressive in
tellectual to use this phrase these

days, since it was coined during the
Eisenhower administration and is not
considered in fashion with detente.)
All of the government officials and,
of course, the U.N. representatives
of these nations are Soviet ap
paratchiks. National, religious or cul
tural public expressions in these
countries are nonexistent.
Another case of a nation without
sovereignty is Armenia. Armenia is
divided up between four countries:
Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Al
though the Armenians have their own
distinct culture, language and na
tional heritage, they have no hope of
attaining national self-expression.

als, do about all this? Not much, if
