For the first time in three years, it was possible to float a
canoe on Lake Lagunita yesterday. Weekend rainfall has
been filling the lower areas of the lake the past two days
and provided a rare opportunely for |im Hine, Jeff Merrill
and Dave Dick, members of the Kappa Alpha fraternity.

They were the first and possibly the only ones on the lake
this year as University officials stated last fall that even
with a normal rainfall this winter, the lake would not be
filled for two more years.
