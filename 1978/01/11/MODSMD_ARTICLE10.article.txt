# As approach to solar energy
## SolarCal comprehensive and practical

Solar energy is an idea whose time
has come. It can be the first step in
liberating America from the dangerous
energy and economic future toward
which we are heading.
The SolarCal proposal is the most
comprehensive and practical approach
for the implementation of solar energy
in California. It is being sponsored by
the Campaign for Economic Dem6c
racy. The proposal will be introduced
as a bill in the state legislatureearly this
year.
SolarCal's goals are (1) to transform
California's space and water heating
needs from dependence on fossil fuels
to solar and other conservation options

by 1990, and (2) to accelerate the
commercialization of solar-generated
electricity in California.
In November the Assembly Commit
tee on Resources, Land Use and Energy
held public hearings in Palo Alto and
Oakland on "The Future of Solar
Energy in California." During the Palo
Alto hearings the committee heard
from many local individuals and groups
who have endorsed SolarCal, includ
ing:
—the chairman of the Santa Clara
County chapter of the Sierra Club;
—the executive board of the Santa
Clara County Central Labor Council;
—the Palo Alto Area Democratic As-

sociation; and
—Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) Locals 715 and 535
(Santa Clara County chapte'r).
SolarCal has also been endorsed by
Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally, Con
gressman Ron Dellums, and San Fran
cisco Mayor George Moscone.
The SolarCal proposal
The potential market for solar energy
for space and water heating would in
clude the twomillion housingunits that
will be built in California over the next
decade, plus many of the existing seven
million housing units.
A crash program to install solar
energy equipment on every feasible

roof in California by 1990 would mean
installing equipment on hundreds of
thousands of housing units per year
over the next decade.
The public needs to be involved in
the solar sector, both to accelerate the
development of solar energy, and to
keep as much of the industry under
democratic, decentralized control as
possible.
If passed by the state legislature, the
SolarCal proposal would establish a
public solar energy agency that will
survey all buildings in the state to pro
vide a year-by-year breakdown of ob
jectives that will result in all Califor
nia's feasible space and water heating
needs being met by solar energy and
other conservation options over the
next decade.
After completing its survey, the solar
energy agency would submit to the
legislature a solar conservation prog
ram designed to implement the year
by-year objectives of its survey.
Once the legislature enacts the
agency's solar energy program, the
agency would have the further respon
sibility of monitoring the year-by-year
achievement of its objectives and pre
senting the legislature with an annual
update and recommendations for
change.
Incentives
The SolarCal proposal includes pro
visions for making the solar energy
agency the lender of last resort for con
sumers who want to install solar energy
equipment, small businesses that want
to expand their operations, and cities
that want to purchase solar energy sys
tems from manufacturers and install
them for those customers wishing to
purchase them.
In the event that the state's solar
energy objectives cannot be met by the
existing private sector, the SolarCal
proposal empowers the agency to enter
the solar energy industry as a manufac
turer, distributer, and/or installer of
solar energy systems.
Much work remains to be done be
fore SolarCal can become a reality. We
need to design and implement a
strategy for lobbying the state legisla
ture to pass the SolarCal proposal and
for getting Gov. Brown to sign the bill
passed by the Legislature.
